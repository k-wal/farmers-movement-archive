---||Meerut||A week after farmers’ deaths, Union minister’s son arrested||LAKHIMPUR KHERI: After nearly 12 hours of intense interrogation by the special investigation team (SIT) on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which he has been accused of killing four farmers, Union junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish was arrested late on Saturday night. Ashish had skipped summons by the SIT on Friday, after which a second notice had been issued asking him to appear. "He has been arrested for not cooperating with the investigation and giving evasive answers," DIG Upendra Agarwal, who is heading the SIT, said on Saturday night. Around 10.30am, Ashish entered the Lakhimpur Kheri crime branch office by the backdoor, escorted by over 10 cops. He was accompanied by two lawyers, Avdhesh Kumar Singh and Jitendra Singh. Ashish had been asked to appear at 11am in the second notice put up outside his house on Friday. "My client has come with video evidence to show he wasn’t there (the site of the killings) that day," his counsel Singh said in the morning. They also reportedly presented 12 affidavits of people saying Ashish was not at the Banbirpur violence site that day. As internet services were suspended again, police from neighbouring districts had been called to Lakhimpur Kheri and SSB jawans were deployed. BJP workers from across the district converged at the party office in Lakhimpur city. Security around the district jail and the collectorate was suddenly stepped up in the evening. When asked if it was preparation for arrest, ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar had earlier in the evening told TOI that he "didn’t know". He added, "Local police have taken their own decision to maintain law and order." A senior official from the administration, however, said the security was in place to prepare for both scenarios. "Whether he is arrested or not, we are ready for both. We have ensured required security to maintain law and order. The decision on his arrest rests with the SIT," the official told TOI. Around 11pm, Ashish was finally arrested. Police were preparing to take him before a remand magistrate at the time of filing the report.

Somanna also accused Ashoka of behaving like an “autocrat”. “I have been in politics for over four decades. I have also efficiently served as Bengaluru incharge minister in the past. So, I'm also a strong contender for the portfolio. I have no objection if the chief minister continues to keep the portfolio with him. But if he wants to give it to others, I have requested him to consider my name,” Somanna said. Somanna also took a dig at Ashoka for not attending a meeting he had convened last week to discuss implementation of housing schemes in the city. “He is literally behaving as Samrat Ashoka (king Ashoka). I go to meetings convened by him. But he thinks attending meetings convened by me is below his stature,” he alleged. Hitting back at Somanna, Ashoka said he was not particular about becoming the Bengaluru in-charge minister or getting the portfolio and he would be happy if someone else is given the responsibility.  “Whatever the CM has asked to do, I have done. That's all,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/somanna-and-ashoka-lock-horns-over-bluru-portfolio/articleshow/86899842.cms||---

City legislators cutting across party lines expressed confidence that Palike elections are likely to be announced in four months.According to sources, Shivakumar and Reddy have held at least three to four rounds of late-night meetings at the latter’s home to discuss bringing the party to power.At the other end, the ruling BJP is under pressure to come to power under a new leadership amid the tussle for Bengaluru supremacy between senior sitting legislators. With all BJP legislators, barring Chikpet MLA Uday Garudachar, being in power for a minimum of two terms, there is a huge expectation riding on the saffron party to come to power.Since 2019, of the 28 assembly segments, BJP controls 16 constituencies (including the three MLAs who moved from Congress and JD(S) to the saffron party).Last month, during the weekly meeting with CM Bommai, BJP legislators urged him to undertake a city tour. “We have also requested him to release funds towards pending projects and clear them ahead of the BBMP elections. The CM’s tour and releasing of funds will boost the morale of Bengaluru party cadre and also send out a clear message that the new leadership is in favour of city development despite the CM hailing from Haveri,” said Satish Reddy.BJP MLA from CV Raman Nagar, S Raghu said under Bommai’s leadership, they will have quite a strong footing before elections are announced. “We are expecting the CM to call for a zone-wise meeting of BBMP and meet legislators to take stock of the progress in the city in the next couple of weeks,” said Raghu.However, BJP’s own former corporators are quite sceptical over the Palike elections being announced as it will depend on the bypoll and ZP/TP election results.“Depending on the bypoll results and performance of the party in zilla and taluk panchayat elections, we may be able to gauge whether the Palike elections will be announced or not. There is no guarantee as of now as the new CM and the sitting ministers from Bengaluru are quite happy with the status quo of controlling the works directly ahead of the 2023 assembly polls,” said a BJP ex-corporator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-polls-cong-bjp-start-groundwork/articleshow/86899848.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The injured officers, identified as Zahoor Ahmad and Imran Ahmad, were rushed to the sub-district hospital in Damhal Hanjipora. “Their condition is stated to be out of danger,” DH Pora block medical officer Gulzar Ahmad Dar confirmed. Soon after the attack, the area was cordoned off and a search operation launched to trace the perpetrators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-cops-injured-in-kulgam-terror-attack/articleshow/86899907.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Drive to help Pandits reclaim lost assets triggered killings: Agencies||SRINAGAR: The J&K administration's drive to help Kashmiri Pandits reclaim properties that fell into the hands of "land sharks" and "interlopers" in the wake of their 90s exodus could have been a trigger for the renewed terror attacks on minority communities in the erstwhile state, say intelligence agencies. Deputy commissioners of various districts had received 5,600-odd complaints of landgrab and encroachment through the designated web portal within three weeks of its launch by lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on September 7. Around 2,200 such complaints ostensibly filed by Kashmiri Pandits and others have already been processed, according to official data. Most of these complaints are about land and houses belonging to Kashmiri Pandits being either wrested or sold off at throwaway prices three decades ago. Sinha has directed the Union Territory administration to ensure "time-bound redress" of landgrab and other property-related grievances of around 44,000 "migrant families". Of these, 40,142 families are Hindus, 2,684 Muslims and 1,730 Sikhs, officials said. "The administration has freed 41 ‘kanals’ (20 ‘kanals’ make a hectare) in just three weeks in Anantnag district alone. We have also processed nearly 400 of the 1,000 complaints filed in the south Kashmir district in less than a month. Around 95% of the complaints were found to be fake," a top official said. In 1997, the then Farooq Abdullah-led National Conference government had passed a legislation titled Migrant Immovable Property (Preservation, Protection and Restraint on Distress Sales) Act. The law banned the distress sale of properties owned by those forced to flee J&K in the face of selective killings by terror outfits in the early 90s, but was never enforced in spirit, an official said. Intelligence agencies claim the recent attacks on Kashmiri Pandits and Sikhs by Pakistan-backed Lashkar-e-Taiba affiliate TRF are in retaliation to the administration's campaign to "right a wrong". The terror outfit, which had announced its arrival last year by targeting applicants for domicile certificates, has shot dead a prominent Kashmiri Pandit businessman, a Kashmiri Sikh school principal, her Pandit colleague and a migrant food vendor in Srinagar within a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drive-to-help-pandits-reclaim-lost-assets-triggered-killings-agencies/articleshow/86900006.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||JP Nadda kickstarts BJP's campaigning in Manipur||BISHNUPUR: Sounding the poll bugle in Manipur, BJP president JP Nadda on Saturday said the party will return to power in the state on grounds of the development work done since 2017. Addressing a public rally at Sai Ground, Bishnupur in Manipur, Nadda called the state the "gateway for Atmanirbhar Bharat". Attacking the previous Congress government in the state, the BJP leader said, "Corruption, commission, and criminalisation were the order of the day in Manipur before we formed the government. Abduction cases were solved outside police stations. There was no development." He further praised the current BJP-led government in the state and said that chief minister N Biren Singh brought "only development" during the last four years. "Manipur is now on the mainstream of development because people elected BJP-led government at the right time in 2017. Among the northeastern states, Manipur is taking the lead in the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign," said Nadda. "Now it is the time of innovation, expansion of infrastructure, connectivity, and integration under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi," he added. Nadda further said that peace is the byproduct of the right kind of government that is elected. "Efforts have been made by the Prime Minister and the chief minister to take everyone together, be it through accords or agreements. A proactive role has been played by these leaders including home minister Amit Shah to bring together everyone in the society which has brought stability in the state," said the BJP leader. He further enumerated various schemes of the central government and said they empowered the common man of the state. Nadda reached Manipur on Saturday on a two-day visit. Assembly polls in Manipur are due early next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jp-nadda-kickstarts-bjps-campaigning-in-manipur/articleshow/86900068.cms||---

In the raids which concluded on Saturday, Rs 63 lakh in cash and foreign currency worth Rs 16 lakh was foundfrom the home and office of a money exchanger. The money has been seized. The latest raids were conducted in connection with the seizure of 188kg heroin by special task force (STF) of Punjab Police from Masih’s house on Sultanwind Road, Amritsar, in 2020. A source privy to the ED action spoke to TOI on condition of anonymity. The source said: "Based on FIR number 20/2020, dated January 29, 2020, and FIR number 23/ 2020, dated January 31, 2020, registered by the STF, a search under Prevention of Money Laundering (PMLA) Act was conducted by ED at nine locations in and around Amritsar on October 8. It is learnt that one Ankush Kapoor along with companions, namely Sukhwinder Singh, Major Singh, Tamanna Gupta, Arman Bashar Mall (Afghan national) in connivance with each other had established a secret place Kothi No 127-130, Akash Vihar, Sultanwind, Amritsar (whose original owner was Anwar Masih)." Source added the accused had stored huge quantity of heroin when the house was raided in 2020. “The main persons behind this operation were Ankush Kapoor, Tanvir Bedi and Simranjit Singh Sandhu. They had also established connections with smugglers in Dubai, Pakistan, Afghanistan etc. Ankush Kapoor, Tanvir Bedi and Simranjit Singh Sandhu were making and receiving payments through hawala also. They used to smuggle the heroin and other intoxicant substances internationally." Source revealed that several accused in this case were already in jail, so to find the money-laundering trail, efforts were being made by the ED to find out as much detail as possible against the accused. Besides, several mobile phones and other digital devices have also been seized by the agency. The investigation body is expected to check the data of these devices for clues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/heroin-bust-ed-raids-at-9-places-unearth-rs-63l-in-cash-rs-16l-in-foreign-currency/articleshow/86900138.cms||Mohit Behl

While Bhaskar, playing some of his best snooker in recent times, outplayed KS Naveen Kumar 6-2, Vidya had to dig deep into her reserves to edge out Chitra Magimairaj 4-3.Bhaskar, who missed out on the 15-red snooker title last month, looked a cut above the rest, making the 30s and 40s breaks consistently. After the early skirmish, he was in a different zone. Naveen, who was in the contest in the first four frames of the best-of-11-frame final, just wilted under Bhaskar’s charge.After a 42 break in the third frame, Bhaskar, who turned 50 last month, shifted gears to leave Naveen gasping in the wake. He had a fluent 61 in the sixth frame and followed that up with a gritty 52 in the next frame and wrapped up the final in the next for his second state ranking title.Defending champion Vidya it appeared would close out the women’s final in double quick time as she took a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven-frame. But veteran cueist Chitra rallied in splendid fashion, taking the next three frames to push the issue to the decider.Unfortunately, she couldn’t maintain the same form in the seventh frame. Former national champion Vidya recovered in time and played the crucial points well to dash Chitra’s hopes. She took the crucial brown, blue and pink to retain her title.Results: Men: Final: B Bhaskar bt KS Naveen Kumar 6-2 (42-12, 22-36, 42-17, 13-40, 32-21, 61 (61) -8, 57-0, 39-28).Third place playoff: Sean Davis bt Francis Joe 4-0 (75-30, 58-16, 48-0, 45-14).Semis: Naveen bt Sean Davis 5-3 (25-17, 48-4, 46-16, 18-37, 4-50, 32-40, 46-18, 37-24); Bhaskar bt Francis Joe 5-0 (45-16, 32-23, 54-0, 49-0, 48-18).5-8 place playoffs: R Santosh bt BVS Murthy 3-0 (53-8, 25-22, 44-5); MS Arun bt Rohit Ravindran 3-2 (56-12, 40-18, 10-35, 23-39, 36-29); bt Santosh 3-2 (52-0, 22-32, 49-17, 28-32, 63-1); Ravindran bt Murthy 3-0 (49-35, 45-41, 54-0).Final standings: 1.

The 12-member council includes CXOs, academicians, tech veterans and other thought leaders from the state and beyond, including TCS COO N G Subramaniam, director of IIT Madras Bhaskar Ramamurthy, Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan, and CEO of SaaS firm Kissflow Suresh Sambandam. The council is devised as a think-tank to support the state’s IT department and will help promote emerging tech that can be beneficial to the state and suggest policy changes that would enable the state to benefit from innovation and technology of the future. Among its other objectives, the council aims to support the state machinery to develop an IT/Emerging Technologies road map for long-term economic development of the state. Suresh Sambandam told TOI that the role of the thinktank is to help the IT ministry prioritise its time towards the larger vision of growing the state’s IT industry and not just on individual e-governance projects. “The end game here is to more than double the state’s IT exports and see how the technology sector can help in GDP growth and largescale job creation,” he said. While the IT exports of Tamil Nadu are currently around ₹50,000 crore, neighbouring Karnataka is almost at 4x this number with Bengaluru alone contributing over 38% of India’s total IT exports. The group has a term of one year, and will meet once in a quarter and exchange ideas on some of the pressing problem areas for the state where emerging technologies may be able to provide sustainable solutions. “The advisory council will lay out strategies for making Tamil Nadu ready for widespread adoption of emerging technologies providing a head-start in maximising the opportunities it has to offer,” the govt order (GO) announcing the formation of the council said. The GO adds that the council is a result of a proposal mooted by the Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu Limited (ELCOT) and accepted by the state government with a view that the service sector’s contribution to the state’s economic growth is likely to be higher in the next 10 years. “Day by day, the economic landscape turns to be more competitive and cutthroat. It is essential for businesses across geographies and industries to embrace emerging technologies to sustain growth, overcome external shocks and prosper,” it read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-forms-advisory-council-to-tap-emerging-tech-for-development/articleshow/86905669.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: 87% of Covid-19 deaths in August, September were of the unvaccinated||CHENNAI: Two doses of Covid-19 vaccines have offered “impressive” results in Tamil Nadu with reduced risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission and deaths despite fears of waning immunity and break through infections, an analysis by the directorate of public health has shown. Several international studies have shown that the fully vaccinated are better protected against Sars-Cov2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Now, the state health department says its own statistics have reiterated these findings. In August and September, of the 88,719 people tested positive in Tamil Nadu, at least 63% of them did not take any vaccine, 24% of them were partially vaccinated and 13% of them were fully vaccinated. The difference was stark in ICU admissions and deaths. Nearly 87% of deaths and 76% of ICU admissions were of those who did not get vaccinated. “Breakthrough infection exists. We do see fully vaccinated adults testing positive for the viral infection. A reason why we still ask them to wear masks, maintain social distance and follow Covid-19 protocols, but the risk of infection is lower. On the other hand, ICU admissions and deaths are significantly higher among those unvaccinated. We saw fewer fully vaccinated people in the ICU,” said director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam. State Covid-19 registry shows four percent of those fully vaccinated and 9% of those partially vaccinated died. ICU admissions had 16% of those partially vaccinated and 9% of those fully vaccinated. “The protection increased with the vaccinations. With increase in daily vaccinations, we are also seeing a dip in infections,” he said. Data also showed that nearly 73% of Covid-19 patients in the hospitals were unvaccinated, more than 45% of people in home quarantine had taken two doses of the vaccine. The state says it aims to push for at least 70% complete vaccination in all districts to prevent deaths, although no district have achieved more than half of the target. Tamil Nadu has more than 5.7 crore adults, who will need two doses of the vaccine. Until Friday, 3.7 crore (65%) of people have received one dose of the vaccine and 1.2 crore (22%) of adults have received two doses of the vaccine. While the coverage for first dose in some health units such as Coimbatore, Chennai, Tiruppur and Kancheepuram are above 75%, the coverage in districts such as Vellore and Thoothukudi are below 55%. In addition, many districts still have many people who haven’t taken their second dose on time. “Most people who want the vaccine have got them. To push coverage further, we must now fight harder against vaccine hesitancy,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “We are hoping mega camps organised across the state on Sunday will encourage more people,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tamil-nadu-87-of-covid-19-deaths-in-august-september-were-of-the-unvaccinated/articleshow/86905865.cms||Pushpa Narayan

State Covid-19 registry shows four percent of those fully vaccinated and 9% of those partially vaccinated died. ICU admissions had 16% of those partially vaccinated and 9% of those fully vaccinated. “The protection increased with the vaccinations. With increase in daily vaccinations, we are also seeing a dip in infections,” he said. Data also showed that nearly 73% of Covid-19 patients in the hospitals were unvaccinated, more than 45% of people in home quarantine had taken two doses of the vaccine. The state says it aims to push for at least 70% complete vaccination in all districts to prevent deaths, although no district have achieved more than half of the target. Tamil Nadu has more than 5.7 crore adults, who will need two doses of the vaccine. Until Friday, 3.7 crore (65%) of people have received one dose of the vaccine and 1.2 crore (22%) of adults have received two doses of the vaccine. While the coverage for first dose in some health units such as Coimbatore, Chennai, Tiruppur and Kancheepuram are above 75%, the coverage in districts such as Vellore and Thoothukudi are below 55%. In addition, many districts still have many people who haven’t taken their second dose on time. “Most people who want the vaccine have got them. To push coverage further, we must now fight harder against vaccine hesitancy,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “We are hoping mega camps organised across the state on Sunday will encourage more people,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tamil-nadu-87-of-covid-19-deaths-in-august-september-were-of-the-unvaccinated/articleshow/86905870.cms||Pushpa Narayan

This is the second time that the Delhi Police has taken action against Lav Kush Ramlila in the last two days after it started on October 7 at the Red Fort ground. Sagar Singh Kalsi, DCP North, Delhi Police, tells us, “When they took permission to organise Ramlila, they signed an agreement that they will ensure COVID appropriate behaviour at the ground. But we found that people in the audience were not wearing masks and were not maintaining social distancing. We’ve registered a case under Section 188 against the organisers. If there are any more violations, we will have to take strict action. We will ensure that they don’t violate DDMA guidelines.” Ashok Agarwal, president of the committee, says, “We have not been allowing audience at the venue and are asking people to watch Ramlila on YouTube. At the venue, entry is open for only the media. It is possible that a few people from the neighbourhood might have joined. We have appointed volunteers to check masks, and seats are being kept vacant. We will ensure that no visitors violate any COVID protocols at the venue.” Ankush Agarwal, chief coordinator of the event, adds, “In pre-COVID times, we used to keep 15,000 chairs at the ground for the audience. This year, we have only 500 chairs. There is no F&B arrangement at the ground to discourage visitors. We are not allowing unvaccinated people at the venue, and most of the people involved in arrangements are fully vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/will-ensure-all-covid-19-protocols-are-followed-say-delhi-ramlila-organisers-after-being-booked-for-flouting-norms/articleshow/86896802.cms||Niharika Lal
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Hike in LPG price burns through home budgets||BENGALURU: The price of LPG in the city has gone up from Rs 585 for a 14.2kg cylinder in May 2020 to a record Rs 902.50 now, up Rs 317.50 in just 17 months. On Wednesday, the price was increased by Rs 15. Oil industry sources said the price could touch Rs 1,000 in a few months. Delivery personnel collect an extra Rs 20-Rs 50 for delivering the cylinder home. As per government policy, 12 cylinders of 14.2kg each are provided to every eligible household at subsidised rate in a year.  The subsidy is supposed to be provided through direct benefit transfer to bank accounts of customers. However, many consumers are complaining they’ve not been getting the subsidy since May 2020. Many homemakers are now contemplating switching to electric stoves. “It’s unfair to hike the price of LPG cylinders, especially during pandemic and festive season. Many people have had pay cuts or lost jobs during Covid. Consumption of LPG has increased due to work from home, online classes and festive season. I plan to switch to an induction stove but electricity is not cheap either,” said Ashwini K, a homemaker in Koramangala. Urban poor are the worst affected. While many people in rural areas have shifted to firewood and kerosene from LPG, there are few alternatives for the poor and middle class in urban areas. Several people who received free LPG connections under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana are finding it difficult to purchase refills. Rupali, a domestic help from West Bengal who works in Indiranagar, said: “In rural areas, we could use firewood but here we don’t have an alternative. I stay in a rented place and the house owner doesn’t allow me to use firewood. My earnings have reduced after Covid. I don’t know how I’ll manage in the coming months. I’m not receiving any subsidy either.” The price of commercial cylinders of 19kg has also increased to Rs 1794.50 which has affected small businesses and roadside eateries. However, many are illegally using domestic cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hike-in-lpg-price-burnsthrough-home-budgets/articleshow/86902095.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The staff filed the complaint with RMC Yard police on Friday, saying the cheating took place on September 26 when they received an order for cooking oil, rice bags and other materials from a retail shop on Nelagedaranahalli Main Road. Complainant Patil VS, executive of the firm which has its office at SRS Junction, Peenya, said they received the order around 3.20pm.“A person claiming to be the owner of shop named Varalakshmi Stores on Nelagedaranahalli Main Road, Doddabidarakallu, placed the order for around 50 tins of cooking oil, around 50 rice bags and other materials. The bill came up to Rs 4.6 lakh. We called the person who had placed the order on his mobile saying the items were ready and will be dispatched once he makes the payment. He said he would make a spot payment. Our company executive Sridhar and assistant Darshan reached the place in a mini goods truck. But they did not find Varalakshmi Stores. Instead, they found an old building with locked shops. When we contacted the person, he asked us to dump the materials in the building and said he would pay online. He sent a screenshot that looked like the payment was done. Our men left the items there,” Patil’s complaint copy read.The cheating came to light when the staff crosschecked the online payment history. When they called the person, his mobile was switched off. Investigators said the miscreants took away the items in another vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/app-based-retail-firm-duped-of-grocery-other-items-worth-4-6l/articleshow/86902096.cms||---

The woman holding an infant in her hand had fallen on the road and a man was running away. Realising she had been robbed of her gold chain, the 24-year-old driver followed the thief. The fleeing suspect scaled the compound wall of a godown and vanished inside a small coconut plantation. Rudresh too entered the plantation and found the man hiding behind a coconut tree. When Rudresh approached him, he brandished a knife and threatened to stab him. Rudresh, however, rushed towards the man, who took advantage of the rain and took to his heels. “I returned to the same spot. By then, two police officials from Soladevanahalli had come. Sub-inspector Arun Kumar asked me to join him for another search. But we returned empty handed,” Rudresh told STOI. Sub-inspector Arun Kumar and Rudresh exchanged mobile phone numbers. The SI told him to call immediately if he happens to see the chain-snatcher. Rudresh continued his journey towards Peenya. After finishing his work, Rudresh, with his friend Kiran Kumar, an AC technician, was driving his autorickshaw when he spotted the man near Shettihalli railway gate at 7.45pm. “The man was walking in Abbigere direction. Slowing down my vehicle, I explained everything to Kiran and we decided to catch hold of him. I parked the vehicle and went close to him. He suddenly turned back, recognised me and started running. We chased him. I also called the SI and informed him of the location. When I grabbed him by his shoulder, he attacked me with a wooden log. By then, Kiran too reached the spot,” Rudresh said. Seeing the commotion, the public caught hold of Rudresh and the thief. “He lied to the public that I was a thief and was trying to snatch his mobile. I immediately called the SI, who was on his way. I put him on loudspeaker and told the public to help me,” Rudresh said. He had thrown chainSoon, Arun Kumar reached the spot and detained the suspect, Keshav, a resident of Chikkabanavara. But there was no gold chain on him. That's when one person in the crowd recalled what he saw — the suspect, while running, had thrown something below a parked vehicle.  "We went to the place and found the chain,” Rudresh from Peenya I Stage, a bachelor, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/auto-driver-catches-armed-thief-after-2-rounds-of-chase/articleshow/86902107.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Jamshedpur||Jamshedpur: Newly constructed modular ICU at MGM caves in, probe ordered||JAMSHEDPUR: State health minister Banna Gupta on Saturday ordered a probe headed by East Singhbhum DC Suraj Kumar in connection with the collapse of a newly constructed modular intensive care unit (ICU) at the Covid-19 ward of MGM hospital here. The probe team will also have the hospital superintendent on board. The minister visited the hospital in the morning following the collapse of the ICU on Friday night. Gupta said prima facie it seems to be a case of the technical failure and use of substandard materials in the construction. He said, “Action would be taken against the culprits after the inquiry report arrives. Let the DC (Suraj Kumar) and hospital superintendent Arun Kumar probe the matter in detail.” The modular OT is located on the fourth floor of the hospital. It caved in abruptly after a blast. The ceiling of the ICU fell and several medical equipment that were stored inside the ICU were damaged. Luckily, no one was inside the ICU when the incident occurred. The hospital superintendent said, “The modular ICU has not been handed over to the hospital management so far. An investigation will unearth the reasons for the collapse of the structure.” The expandable structure is produced by an NGO, the Indo American Foundation (IAF), and is erected by Delhi-based firm, PT Medical Solutions. Built at Rs 3.5 crore, the ICU project involved the construction of four makeshift Covid wards having 16 ICU beds, 30 oxygen-equipped beds and 54 general ward beds. The PVC tarpaulin structure is ready for use but the hospital management has not taken over the control of the structure. “The modular ICU structure has no facility to control fire. Hence, we advised the agency to equip it with fire-fighting devices before handing it over to us,” a senior doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/newly-constructed-modular-icu-at-mgm-caves-in-probe-ordered/articleshow/86902263.cms||---

Rates of clothes in different segments have increased by about 5-10 per cent due to rising yarn prices and increased logistic cost, claimed manufacturers, traders and retailers. Maharaja Tukojirao Cloth Market Merchants Association president Hansraj Jain said, “There has been a jump of around 10 per cent in rates of clothes. Apart from raw material prices, skyrocketing fuel prices has made logistics expensive and still there is no certainty on market rates because of the volatile nature of raw materials and fuel prices.” Indore is a major trading centre for clothes and a manufacturing hub for readymade garments. Cloth traders said, high cost of fuel has made transportation of goods expensive, squeezing margins and making end products costlier. Indore Retail Garments Association president Akshay Jain said, “Rates of readymade garments have jumped but looking at the market sentiment, it is unlikely to have any impact on festive business. Everything - Dying, colouring, transportation — has become costlier.” Fabrics and clothes called from outstation markets have seen a sharp increase due to high cost and transportation charges. Market is expected to see a rebound this festive season but high costs may keep a lid on purchases.The main markets for Indore made garments are southern India, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Material for shirting and suiting come from markets of Mumbai and Bhilwara, while sarees and dress material are mostly from Gujarat, said traders. There are around 1200 readymade garment manufacturers in Indore and the Readymade Complex in Pardeshipura, is a hub for garment manufacturers housing around 125 units. Despite a jump in prices, manufacturers and traders anticipate a better season this year due to ease in pandemic induced restrictions and pace of vaccination in urban and rural belts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/readymade-garments-will-cost-10-more-this-festive-season/articleshow/86902285.cms||---

Now, Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has decide to restore the Mandir, believed to have been constructed during Holkar era. IMC commissioner Pratibha Pal on Saturday visited the temple situated near Kadav Ghat and Gangaur Ghat where locals informed her about Ganesh Mandir’s history and also that it has a stepwell in its compound. The locals said that years ago, they offered prayers there but the Saraswati river used to surge during rainy seasons in the last few years, submerging the temple on many occasions. Due to lack of maintenance, people also allegedly dumped debris there deteriorating its condition further. “The temple is very old and if we carry out digging around it with heavy machinery, it might damage this historic structure,” the commissioner said. “Officials concerned have been instructed to carry out manual digging to avert any damage to the temple,” she said. IMC superintendent engineer in-charge DR Lodhi said that restoration of Ganesh Mandir would be part of IMC’s riverfront work, under which the civic body would remove slums and temporary shops erected alongside Saraswati River in Kadav Ghat and Machhi Bazaar area. “We have identified around 128 huts in Machhi Bazar slum. They all have been allotted flats in Bada Bangada area. We will shift them after October 20 and also remove encroachments as part of developing the riverfront,” he said. Lodhi said that a retaining wall would also be constructed next to the Saraswati river along with restoration of Ganesh Mandir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/buried-under-mud-ancient-temple-to-get-a-facelift/articleshow/86902287.cms||---

The insurer had turned down her claim, saying the vehicle’s insurance policy was still in the name of the first owner and hadn’t been transferred to her. Liberty Videocon General Insurance Ltd had appealed against a Bengaluru district consumer forum’s June 30, 2020 verdict ordering that the insured value of the vehicle — Rs 1,37,824 — be paid with interest to Sheela Shantharaj, 57, of Kuvempunagar, apart from Rs 10,000 towards damages and Rs 5,000 towards litigation cost. Sheela purchased a Bajaj KTM Duke 200 motorcycle on April 27, 2017 from its original owner Mahesh P by paying Rs 1.5 lakh. On June 2, 2017, the motorcycle was stolen from her residence and she lodged a complaint with Chandra Layout police. With the vehicle carrying an active insurance policy in the name of the original owner till September 26, 2017, Sheela approached the insurer, Liberty Videocon General Insurance Ltd, for a claim for the stolen bike. But despite an active policy in place, the insurance firm turned down her claim, stating that the vehicle was yet to be transferred in her name and she had failed to apply for an insurance transfer till the time of theft. Next, the woman approached a local consumer court, which ruled in her favour. It ordered the firm to pay Rs 15,000 compensation for the delay, apart from granting her the insurance claim of Rs 1,37,824. Claiming that the local court erred in its judgment, Liberty Videocon General Insurance appealed to Karnataka State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission on October 22, 2020. The judges, however, noted that on the date of theft, the vehicle was under insurance cover and the complainant intimated the firm for settlement of the claim and also lodged a police complaint. Further, she had requested the RTO for transfer of vehicle ownership and the stand taken by the insurer that there is no privity of contract between her and them cannot be accepted and they cannot repudiate the claim of the transferee, as there was still an active insurance coverage. The judges further observed that though the woman hadn’t given any application to the opposite party, she had indeed applied to the RTO for transfer.  Hence, there was no negligence on her part as long as a valid insurance cover was present, either in the name of the original owner, or in the name of the transferee. In the circumstances, denial of claim money is illegal and the order passed by the district commission is upheld, the judges stated in their ruling on September 7, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/firm-told-to-pay-claim-even-if-vehicle-sold-to-3rd-party/articleshow/86902310.cms||Petlee Peter

The finance secretary also played down concerns over taper tantrum, or the impact of the withdrawal of surplus liquidity in developed markets, saying the overall financial position in the country was much better. “We do not know the exact timing or the details. Because of high reserves, we are not in a vulnerable situation like 2012-13. Relative to others, fiscally we have been very prudent, we are a positive outlier now. Plus, there are much higher growth prospects,” Somanathan said, adding that the country will grow by at least 6-7% next year over and above projections of double-digit growth during the current fiscal year. Earlier this week, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the government and RBI were keeping close tabs on the situation but most countries had learnt their lessons from the last taper tantrum. The top finance ministry officer said the government’s revenue numbers were looking better but there were risks on the non-tax revenue front, in what may be a pointer to a possible shortfall in funds coming from telecom sector. A day after the government announced the sale of Air India to Tata Sons, Somanathan told TOI that the government will push the national asset monetisation pipeline during the current financial year. The move is seen to be crucial as it will not just generate resources for the Centre and public sector companies but the funds will be redeployed to create fresh assets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/will-ensure-stable-fiscal-health-despite-rise-in-govt-spending-finance-secretary/articleshow/86902976.cms||Sidhartha

The single-day largest set of appointments of CJs includes the transfer of Justice Akil Kureshi from Tripura HC where he was chief justice, to the Rajasthan HC as its chief justice. Kureshi’s exclusion from the list of nine judges recently elevated to the Supreme Court had been commented on as was the reversal of his earlier transfer in 2019 to Madhya Pradesh HC as its CJ before being sent to Tripura HC as its chief justice. The list of 13 CJs appointed and transferred on Saturday is part of the recommendations made by the Supreme Court collegium on September 17. Law minister Kiren Rijiju told TOI that his ministry has been clearing all files of appointments “in record time” and both the SC collegium and the government are “on the same page” on filling up pending vacancies. The eight HC judges elevated as chief justices include Justices Rajesh Bindal, acting CJ of Calcutta HC as CJ of Allahabad HC; Ranjit More as CJ of Meghalaya HC; Satish Chandra Sharma, acting CJ of Karnataka HC as CJ of Telangana HC; Prakash Shrivastava as CJ of Calcutta HC; R V Malimath, acting CJ of Himachal Pradesh HC as CJ of MP HC; Ritu Raj Awasthi as CJ of Karnataka HC; Arvind Kumar as CJ of Gujarat HC and Prashant Mishra as CJ of Andhra Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/8-high-court-judges-elevated-as-cjs-5-cjs-shifted/articleshow/86903212.cms||---

The court added that the Constitution allows one to be atheist, but it does not mean that one can pass obscene remarks against gods and goddesses. These observations were made by Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav while allowing bail application of one Akash Jatav of Hathras, who is accused of sharing objectionable images of Hindu deities on social media. He was arrested on January 4. Last month, Justice Yadav had hit headlines when he had said that the government should bring a bill in Parliament to give fundamental rights to cows and to declare it the national animal. While denying bail to a man accused of cow slaughter, Justice Yadav in his 12-page order had also said that “scientists believe cow is the only animal that inhales and exhales oxygen". In his bail order on Friday, the court also said that there is a need to educate children on this issue by making it a compulsory subject in all the schools of the country and educating the children about Indian culture. The court allowed the bail application, considering the plea of the applicant that he was in jail for the last 10 months. The trial in his case was yet to commence and there was no chance that trial would conclude in near future. On the allegations against the applicant, the court said that there are many countries in the world where there is a provision of harsh punishment for such conduct, but in India there is provision of lesser punishment in comparison to many countries. Elaborating its stand, the court it its 12-page judgment delivered in Hindi further said that “recently, the apex court has given its decision in the Ram Janmabhoomi case in favour of the people who believe in the Lord Ram, who is the soul and culture of India and India is incomplete without Lord Ram”. Besides, the court said that one should respect the deities and culture of the country in which he or she lives, instead of making obscene remarks on such issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bring-law-to-honour-ram-krishna-says-allahabad-high-court-judge/articleshow/86903410.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Giving the Centre four weeks to respond, the bench of Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice B V Nagarathna observed that the issue involved in the petition “concerns a wide strata of society consisting of patients and their relatives who have been overcharged during the pandemic, and the issue would merit serious attention”. The petitioner had argued that during the pandemic, many people were admitted to private hospitals due to lack of a proper public healthcare system. They were handed exorbitant bills, which plunged them into poverty in the absence of any policy or guidelines for the refund of hospital bills. He added that health insurance companies, too, did not have any guidelines regarding reimbursement, forcing patients to exhaust their health insurance limit. The petition adds that though cases of overcharging have been reported from across the country, a few state governments, local bodies and a handful of courts have acted on the issue and directed the refund of money but most states are yet to devise a mechanism for audit and refund. The petition cited an example of Pune municipal corporation, which directed a private hospital to refund the extra money it charged a Covid patient. “...There is no guideline with respect of bills overcharged by private hospitals for treatment of Covid patients,” the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-seeks-government-reply-on-covid-hospital-bills/articleshow/86903541.cms||Prashant Jha

Talks for free trade agreements have been resumed with the European Union and Australia, while the UK and the UAE are the new entrants on the list. In all four cases the government is looking at an ear-ly harvest scheme, or a limi-ted agreement over the next few months.

He added that the countries had also decided to partner in health and agriculture related technologies. To facilitate cooperation for green growth, India and Denmark signed four government-to-government and three commercial agreements. “You are an inspiration for the rest of the world as you have set some very ambitious targets when it comes to clean water for over one million households and renewable energy, including offshore wind,” Frederiksen said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-urges-denmark-for-fast-extradition-of-arms-haul-accused/articleshow/86903681.cms||---
---||Delhi||Tata Power warns Delhi of outages, cites coal shortage||NEW DELHI: Tata Power on Saturday asked consumers in Delhi to use power “judiciously” and cited depleting stocks, stoking fear of power cuts even as central government officials said the required quantity of gas will be supplied to Bawana and Pragati plants. Officials said NTPC has been directed to increase coal stocks “equal to the national average” for Dadri and Jajjhar stations and ensure full availability. They also said Delhi discoms are not scheduling power from Dadri I as they want to exit the power purchase agreement after 25 years. “They have been advised to schedule power,” a source said. Power available, cost for discoms may be higher: Experts While central officials sought to assure that a crisis will be averted in Delhi, several states, particularly in the north, reported outages amid deepening coal shortage at thermal power stations. “Due to limited coal availability in generation plants across north, power supply scenario between 2pm to 6pm is at critical level. Kindly use electricity judiciously. Be a responsible citizen. Inconvenience caused is regretted,” Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd (TPDDL), which supplies power to north and northwest Delhi, said in a message to consumers. Centre said the current coal shortage was due to a combination of factors like a sharp rise in demand as post second wave recovery gains strength, heavy rainfall in certain areas that affected movement of coal and sharp rise in imported coal prices that led to plants dependent on such supplies reducing output. Read AlsoCoal crisis: Punjab faces cuts, buys power at Rs 13/unitAmid the ongoing coal crisis, Punjab, on Saturday, witnessed scheduled and unscheduled power cuts in all major cities like Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar and Patiala as well as rural areas.The Tata Power message was followed by TPDDL chief executive Ganesh Srinivasan warning of intermittent load-sheddings in the capital because coal-fired power stations supplying electricity to the city were left with fuel for 1-2 days against the normative requirement of 20 days. While there is no denying that coal stocks are running low at power stations, the real reason behind TPDDL’s statement appeared to be its move to shut down power stations running on imported fuel as recent spike in international coal prices made their operation unviable. “We have stopped generation at Mundra as high cost of imported coal is making it impossible to supply (power) under the present PPA terms,” Tata Power said in the evening. Reliance Infrastructure discoms BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd & BSES Yamuna Power, which supply to major part of Delhi, did not comment on the issue. Read AlsoAbove normal temperature factor too fuelled power crisis in PunjabThe higher than normal temperature in October has aggravated the power situation in Punjab, already facing acute shortage of coal. These days the average temperature in the afternoon is hovering at 35-36 degrees Celsius compared to 33-34 degrees Celsius, a rise of nearly 2 degrees.But industry insiders said there was no reason for discoms to resort to load-sheddings but their cost of power would increase due to outage of some units at power stations supplying to the capital. “Power is available, though the cost for discoms may be higher due to the current situation. Power could be available at cheaper rate from NTPC’s Dadri station near Delhi. The Delhi government has also ramped up generation of its gas-fired Bawana power plant, for which the Centre has assured gas. Power is available on exchanges too, though the cost is three times the normal rate,” an industry executive said. The Bawana gas-fired plant is currently generating 1,200-1,300 MW per day against its normal production of 380 MW. But due to higher cost of gas, power from the plant costs Rs 17 per unit against Rs 5-6 from coal-based stations. Power is also available on the exchanges but it costs Rs 10-12 a unit, twice the normal rate. Government officials said low fuel stocks did not threaten operation as they were being repelnished daily. “Yes, (fuel) stocks are running low. But it is not as if the supply has stopped and the plants are drawing down from their inventory. Coal supply is improving,” one official said. A power ministry statement late in the evening said the gap between consumption and supply has narrowed on improved dispatch from Coal India Ltd. “The total dispatch of coal by CIL touched 1.5 mt (million tonne), thereby reducing the gap between consumption and actual supply. Ministry of coal and CIL have assured that they are making best efforts to increase dispatch to power sector to 1.6 million tonne per day in next three days and thereafter try to touch 1.7 million tonne per day. Still, many states reported outages as the coal crisis deepened. About 64 non-pithead power plants are left with less than four days of fuel stock, Latest Central Electricity Authority data on coal stocks showed 25 power plants had inventories for less than seven days as on October 3. The report also showed that 17 plants — with a cumulative installed power generation capacity of 21,325 MW — had zero coal stocks while 20 power plants of 22,550 MW capacity had one day of fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/power-available-cost-for-discoms-may-be-higher-experts/articleshow/86903716.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||India||BJP workers’ killing in Kheri ‘reaction to action’: Rakesh Tikait||NEW DELHI: The Lakhimpur Kheri incident was part of a pre-planned conspiracy and attackers tried to terrorise farmers through the violent act, said farmer leader Darshan Pal on Saturday even as another leader, Rakesh Tikait, sought to differentiate between the death of farmers who were mowed down by a vehicle and subsequent lynching of BJP workers by protesters. “That was the reaction to the action. There was no planning involved and that doesn’t amount to murder. I don’t consider them (protesters who might have been involved in lynching) culprits,” said Tikait at a press conference, jointly addressed by other farmer leaders including Yogendra Yadav and Hannan Mollah of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha. Yadav, however, sought to correct SKM’s position and said, “We are sad over the loss of lives, be it BJP workers or farmers. It was unfortunate and we hope justice is done.” Eight people, including four farmers, a journalist and three BJP members, were killed in the violence that broke out on October 3 after a speeding SUV allegedly ran over a group of protesting farmers. Few protesters then turned violent, leading to death of three others. SKM leaders demanded dismissal and arrest of junior home minister Ajay Mishra for conspiracy. “He (Mishra) is protecting the culprits in the case…,” Yadav said. SKM leaders said if all their demands are not met by October 11, the Morcha will hold a nationwide ‘Rail Roko’ (railways blockade) from 10 am to 4 pm on October 18 and organise a ‘mahapanchayat’ in Lucknow on October 26, the day the farmers’ agitation along Delhi borders will complete 11 months. Terming the Lakhimpur Kheri incident the “Jallianwalah Bagh” moment for the farmers’ movement, Yadav said the Morcha would burn the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and local BJP leaders on the day of ‘Dusshera’ on October 15. The Morcha also announced that October 12 will be observed as ‘Shaheed Kisan Diwas’. They announced a five-point programme to build pressure on the government to sack the minister and others. Darshan Pal said that the Lakhimpur Kheri incident didn’t happen suddenly. “Ajay Mishra made some remarks during an event in Lakhimpur Kheri on September 25. It forms the background of what happened on October 3. The video is on Facebook. This incident is a terrorist attack and part of a pre-planned conspiracy,” said the farmer leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-workers-killing-in-kheri-reaction-to-action-rakesh-tikait/articleshow/86903771.cms||Mohua Chatterjee

This is being seen with fares from Mumbai to places like Dehradun, Srinagar, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Patna, Kochi. Airfares to foreign destinations open to Indians too are high, with the only exception of Male, where fares are currently cheaper than those to some domestic destinations. There is a pattern to domestic fares — a return ticket costs higher, especially if the return is on a Sunday or weekend. Passengers who haven’t booked air tickets for October-November Diwali travel can escape high fares by opting to return on a weekday and get a 20-30% cheaper return fare. Like, on Saturday, cheapest return fare on Mumbai-Dehradun non-stop flights around October-end and return on November 7, a Sunday, began at Rs 35,000. It was Rs 29,300 on November 8, a Monday. A yatra.com spokesperson said: “For hotels and flights, we’ve seen an upward trend and 40-50% increase in booking queries with the incoming of the festive season”. Rikant Pittie, co-founder, EaseMyTripAround said: “We’ve seen that airfares can go up around 70% at the last minute and on the week of Diwali. Previously, we had seen a jump of almost 65% on air bookings for the long weekend of Ganesh Chaturthi and a 54% jump on air bookings for the long weekend of Janmashtami. It indicates a trend where people are utilising the festive season to travel. So we are optimistic that travel bookings will pick up during the festive season.” Fares are not only high on international routes, there is a dearth of seats on non-stop flights. Anoop Kanuga of Bathija Travels said: “India should allow airlines to slowly increase capacity on international routes by at least 15-25% a month, until they reach pre-Covid capacity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/air-travel-demand-up-in-festive-season-fares-soar-on-weekends/articleshow/86904229.cms||---

---||India||PM Narendra Modi to unveil Gati Shakti master plan next week||NEW DELHI: PM Gati Shakti, an initiative to be launched by PM Narendra Modi on October 13, is a comprehensive geo-spatial digital platform intended to break silos that often confound government decision-making and bring about a fundamental shift in project planning and execution. The contours of the concept, that are only now unfolding, envisage a national networking group at the Centre that will meet regularly and take stock of projects that have been made part of a national master plan. These projects have timelines running to 2024-25, and will be put through the new approach mentioned by the PM in his I-Day speech. The core of Gati Shakti will have 200 layers that the GIS system offers users to map physical features, district administration offices, rail, road and gas lines, facilities like health and police as well as resources like water bodies and reserved parks and forests. The users, currently central ministries, will be able to benefit from much better logistics planning and connectivity. Official sources said the platform will help private players who are part of central government projects too. “The government wants to look at them as partners, not just contractors. The trove of information will reduce overheads and shorten implementation timelines,” the official said. The initiative is seen to flow from Modi’s view that intra-government coordination is key to faster project roll outs. Accessing a common data base of information will deliver planners a significant advantage will lead to improved multi-modal connectivity as managers spot gaps and develop synergies. It is expected to save time and prevent wasteful duplication of official time and funds. The Centre is in talks with states to onboard them on the Gati Shakti platform and so far the responses have been encouraging. Most states see the benefits of a multi-layered platform that provide 3D visualisation of ground areas and map existing facilities, helping create infrastructure that is efficient and cost effective.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-narendra-modi-to-unveil-gati-shakti-master-plan-next-week/articleshow/86904348.cms||Rajeev Deshpande

Private and government buildings are among the major defaulters. Some of the prominent defaulters include Gaya College and Rajendra Hostel (Rs 2.21 crore), Anugrah Memorial College (Rs 1.28 crore), Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (Rs 1.03 crore), SSP office (Rs 80 lakh) and Gaya collectorate (Rs 29 lakh). According to the information made available by GMC administration, of 75,000 property holders, 46,670 have paid their tax. Around Rs 16.58 crore is outstanding with the defaulters. At a review meeting with councillors on Friday, municipal commissioner Sawan Kumar, mayor Birendra Kumar and deputy mayor Akhauri Onkarnath gave approval for the drive. “Mobile towers will be sealed in case of non-payment of tax. The defaulters should deposit the tax amount before the drive is launched,” the mayor said. The deputy mayor said big defaulters would not be spared. “A team has been constituted to conduct survey of illegal constructions.

NSG conducted various competitions under ‘Agni Pariksha 7’ which included counter-terrorism operation challenges, firing with different weapons, marathon running, fitness competitions and others. A 18-member Octopus squad picked from various ranks had gone to the NSG’s Manesar base in September and took part in the competitions after observing two weeks of quarantine. “The competitions were held for two weeks and the results were declared on Friday. For the first time, Andhra Pradesh police won the overall championship by scoring more marks than NSG and other elite special forces,” as per a release from the DGP’s office. A Papa Rao, who is a head constable with Octopus, won the best all-rounder award. The elite counter terrorism organisation was established on October 1, 2007 in then unified Andhra Pradesh. The force has maintained its status individually post bifurcation. DGP Gautam Sawang congratulated the Octopus team for bringing laurels to the state. “The commandos are trained in such a way that they can handle any kind of situation related to counter terrorism operations. They are highly trained in dealing with any kind of situation and can handle all types of advanced weapons,” he said in the release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/aps-octopus-force-tops-natl-level-meet/articleshow/86899353.cms||---
---||Amaravati||Paradox of low literacy, highly educated candidates in Badvel||AMARAVATI: Badvel, a remote constituency with a low literacy rate, has once again turned into a battlefield of highly-qualified professionals. The literacy rate of the constituency is well below the district and state average, standing at below 60% in at least three of its seven mandals. While Kadapa district has a literacy rate of 67%, almost at par with the state average, Badvel is an outlier on this parameter. Porumamilla mandal, for example, reports a very low literacy rate of around 51%. However, two decades ago, the literacy rate was just around 40%. The situation started to change from 2004 when the then chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, hailing from the district, introduced a fee reimbursement scheme to fund higher education for the youth. The scheme ended up helping thousands of students from remote villages to pursue engineering courses and move to different metros, particularly Bengaluru, for employment. Residents recall this migration of local youth to Bengaluru, the nearest metropolitan city, and how they eventually settled there as software professionals. “The fee reimbursement scheme introduced by the late Y S Rajasekhara Reddy transformed the lives of thousands of local youth. It helped them achieve their goals and send remittances back home,” said a software engineer, Vivek Reddy of Lankamala village. Now, this trend has found an echo among political parties that have started to choose professionals and persons with higher education degrees as candidates for the election. The presence of a large number of educated youth also seems to have prompted parties to scout for candidates with high educational qualifications. Again, it was Y S Rajasekhara Reddy who laid the foundation for the entry of professionals into the political arena. YSR made a group-I officer, D C Govinda Reddy, quit his government job and contest the 2004 elections as the Congress’ candidate. Govinda Reddy freed the seat from the clutches of the Bijivemula Veera Reddy family by winning the election. After the constituency was reserved for SCs, YSR again chose a professional—government junior college principal PM Kamalamma. Kamalamma eventually went on to win the seat. Continuing the trend, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy picked T Jayaramulu, who worked as Pulivendula municipal commissioner before joining the party. Though Jayaramulu switched sides, Jagan zeroed in on a medical professional—Dr G Venkata Subbaiah. Following the untimely demise of Dr Subbaiah, Jagan fielded his wife Dr Sudha, a noted gynaecologist as party candidate. TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu too was compelled to pick candidates with high educational qualifications and fielded orthopaedic surgeon Dr Rajasekhar in the last general elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/paradox-of-low-literacy-highly-educated-candidates-in-badvel/articleshow/86899420.cms||Samdani MN

In the first incident, the Gopalganj police along with an STF team arrested one Dilip Kumar Sharma from Narainiya village under the Mirganj police station area. He was allegedly carrying a carbine when police intercepted him near Siwan border. Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar told TOI on Saturday that the carbine was probably meant for spreading violence during the ongoing panchayat election. “It is not clear from whom Dilip, who has no criminal antecedents, got the carbine and to whom he was going to deliver it,” he said, adding that Dilip’s brother Raj Kumar Sharma was a notorious criminal and murdered two years back. Meanwhile, another team of the STF arrested a Maoist, Rambabu Prasad (50), from Dera Chowk under the Siwaipatti police station area in Muzaffarpur. He was later taken to the Rajepur police station in East Champaran as he had been evading arrest in 2019 a murder case. Rajepur SHO Lallan Kumar said there were at least six cases filed against Rambabu that included the ones related to Maoist violence. In the third operation, the STF with help of the Lakhisarai police arrested a notorious criminal, Bambam Singh, from a place under the Kajra police station area. Lakhisarai Sadar SDPO said Bambam, a multiple murder accused, had been evading arrest in an illegal arms recovery case registered in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maoist-among-three-held/articleshow/86897546.cms||Debashish Karmakar

After inspecting both the branches of the district administration, the DM said, “Of the 36,551 cases filed by different departments with the administration, 5,856 were lodged at the district level.” There are 55 certificate officers in the district, including those at the sub-divisional and circle levels. The DM asked the officers of the requisition and certificate branches to hold regular meetings and review the progress of their works. “Similar meetings should also be held at the sub-divisional level,” he said and instructed the officials to issue notices to the people who had failed to turn up in the meetings. During inspection, the DM also reviewed the status of registration and disposal of the cases related to mutation, encroachment, and land dispute. The certificate branch was earlier under the district revenue department. It became a separate entity in 1988.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/launch-drive-for-hearing-and-disposing-of-certificate-cases/articleshow/86897744.cms||VK Tripathi

After remaining in the ICU for a day, the patient from Muzaffarpur was shifted to the ward. He is now fine and can stand on his feet. The leader of the surgical team, Dr Shashi Pawar of surgical oncology department, said it was a very challenging operation since the tumour, medically described as sarcoma, was exerting high pressure on the arteries, veins and nerves of the patient, thus posing a risk to the normal functioning of his leg. Though the 57-year-old patient weighing 90 kg before going to the operation table had earlier undergone surgery twice at other hospitals, the tumour continued growing aggressively, leaving him to live with unbearable pain and trouble in sitting and walking. The patient finally came to the IGIMS where the doctors conducted the operation with precision to keep the nerves and blood circulation chain undisturbed. Congratulating the team for this operation, Dr Manish Mandal, superintendent of IGIMS, said it was the first case of successful removal of such a giant-sized tumour from any patient at the hospital. “Lack of awareness and neglect of the primary symptoms lead to growth of tumours in different parts of body. In some cases, it proves fatal,” Dr Mandal said. Other IGIMS doctors associated with the team of this rare surgery were Manish, Vinod Verma, Mumtaz and Vibha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/igims-doctors-remove-17kg-tumour-from-patients-thigh/articleshow/86897696.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Bihar: After petrol, diesel breaches Rs 100-mark in many districts||PATNA: Fuel prices hit a fresh high in the city on Saturday as the oil companies increased the rates of petrol and diesel for the fifth day in a row. With the fresh 36 paise per litre hike, diesel prices in Patna touched Rs 99.21 per litre. Petrol became costlier by 35 paise and its price touched Rs 107.16 per litre amid volatility in the global crude oil prices which is trading at $82.39 per barrel. Petrol prices had been on an upward trend over the last two weeks in the city. Price revisions were done eight times in October alone. Petrol prices have gone up by Rs 2.85 and diesel by Rs 3.30 per litre in the last 12 days. Diesel is being sold at above Rs 100 per litre in at least 13 districts of Bihar, including Araria (Rs 100.40), Banka (Rs 100.46), Buxar (Rs 100.05), Gopalganj (Rs 100.39), Jamui (Rs 100.45), Kaimur (Rs 100.27), Katihar (Rs 100.18), Kishanganj (Rs 101.06), Munger (Rs 100.44), Rohtas (Rs 100.1), Sitamarhi (100.07), Supaul (Rs 100.17), West Champaran (Rs 100.77). Fuel prices differ from place to place depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. Ashok Kumar, proprietor of a fuel station near Dak Bungalow, said sales have gone down by 10-15% in the last few weeks. “It is by far the highest rate for petrol and diesel. Earlier, we witnessed fall in petrol sales. However, diesel sales have also been affected now due to price hike,” he added. One Neeranjan Kumar, who was seen buying petrol at a fuel station near Gandhi Maidan, said the way the fuel prices are increasing, it would cross Rs 130-mark by the end of December. “The cost of an LPG cylinder has been increased by Rs 40. As a result, vegetable and fruit prices have gone northwards. People are already suffering from the aftereffects of Covid and rise in fuel prices has added to their woes,” Kumar added. Prabhat Kumar Singh, president of Bihar Petroleum Dealers’ Association, said fuel prices are on the rise due to an increase in global crude oil rates. “However, there are some manipulations in the rates of domestic fuel as Centre and the state impose heavy taxes on oil. They did not reduce the price when it was declining in the global market. In case of no tax, diesel can be sold at Rs 49 per litre,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/after-petrol-diesel-breaches-rs-100-mark-in-many-districts/articleshow/86897859.cms||Faryal Rumi

The agitation severely affected healthcare services at the premier hospital on the first day. Since the retirement of Dr Mani Bhushan Sharma as PMCH superintendent on August 31, the hospital is being managed through ad hoc arrangement. When the then principal of DMCH, Dr H N Jha, superannuated on January 31 this year, the head of paediatrics department, Dr K N Mishra, was given additional charge of the principal on February 1 and he has been continuing on both the posts since then. The climax came on September 1 this year when Dr Mishra was further given additional charge of superintendent over telephone and he reportedly took charge reluctantly. Even after more than a month, permanent superintendent has not been appointed. Since none has been given financial power, nurses were not paid salary for September. The nurses had skipped work for a few hours last week demanding payment of their salaries. They resumed work on assurance from the administration that their salaries would be paid in three to four days. Dr Mishra said he was in talks with the health department for payment of nurses’ salaries. “They should call off the agitation as we are in the process of releasing their salaries,” Dr Mishra said. The nurses, however, are not ready to accept the oral assurance of the hospital administration this time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/1000-dmch-nurses-go-on-strike-over-salary-delay/articleshow/86897537.cms||Binay Kumar Jha

He said the successful implementation of numerous welfare schemes launched by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has won the hearts of the people in the state. Addressing party workers along with Tirupati MP M Gurumoorthy, deputy chief minister SB Amzath Basha and other representatives at Badvel, Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said both BJP and the beleaguered Congress are no match for YSRC and have lost the faith of people. “Both parties lack the backing of people. The public no longer trust them. Neither of them has done any good to the state,” added the minister. Gurumoorthy told party workers that the chief minister has directed the party’s senior leaders to ensure that the polling percentage as well the margin of victory go up in the prestigious bypoll. “The door-to-door campaign showcasing the Navarathnalu flagship programmes of the government has to be aggressive in the coming days”, added Gurumoorthy. The death of MLA Gunthoti Venkata Subbaiah earlier this year necessitated the bypoll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/congress-bjp-lack-backing-of-people-says-minister/articleshow/86899457.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Sanjeev Prasad Toni, chairperson of Navyuvak Sangh Shree Durga Puja Samiti Trust, Dak Bungalow, said as devotees are not allowed inside the pandal, they will distribute the prasad packets among people at the entry point. “To maintain social distancing, we will make separate lines for men and women and distribute them prasad in packets,” he said. “We will distribute halwa on Saptami, kheer-puri on Ashtami and mixed khichdi on Navami. At our pandal, there will be no idol while a digital flex will be set up on which goddess Durga’s image will be shown. Following the government order, we will keep the celebration a simple affair, but the prasad is important part of Durga Puja celebration and it will be given to devotees in packets,” Sanjeev said. At Bangali Akhara Durga Puja Samiti, devotees would be able to savour both bhog and prasad which will be distributed in packets. Saurabh Bhattacharya, assistant secretary of the Samiti, said a head cook has come from Kolkata to prepare the ‘bhog’ and prasad for Durga Puja. “We had earlier planned to serve prasad in earthen plate. However, Covid restrictions forced us to change the plan. In bhog, we will distribute khichdi, five different types of bhujiya, two types of sabzi with curry, kheer and chatni on Saptami and Ashtami,” he said. Bhattacharya added, “On Navami, vegetable pulao will be prepared for over 1,700 devotees. Around 800 food packets will be prepared for Saptami and 1,200 for Ashtami. For prasad, we will use boondi ka ladoo and five different fruits on all three days. Everything will be takeaway.” Santosh Kumar, co-convener of Vijaya Vahini Durga Puja Samiti, said, “It’s a big relief that the state government has allowed holding of Durga Puja. However, we will not distribute prasad this time. Only sugar-coated sweets will be given to devotes on all the three days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prasad-to-be-distributed-in-packets-at-puja-pandals/articleshow/86897722.cms||Faryal Rumi

Addressing the 70th and 71st annual convocations of Karnatak University (KU) virtually on Friday, he said technology-based handling of Covid has reduced the burden of healthcare sector to a considerable extent. “Social distancing, video conference and digital monitoring are best to contain the virus spread,” he said, and added that for collecting data/ location of infected persons, mobile apps and social media have been of great use. Internet of Things (IoT), mega data and artificial intelligence (AI) have also helped trace the mutation of the virus, use of medical facility and implementation of restrictions among others. It has been possible for the people to get online therapy, health check-ups and self-assessment through apps, he explained. Quoting Alvin Toffler, the author of ‘The Future Shock’ book, Kirankumar said: “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Continuous learning helps one face new challenges and enjoy the benefits of new technologies,” he said and advised the fresh graduates to keep learning new things and acquiring new skills. Speaking of the achievements of Isro, Kirankumar said its programmes have played a significant role in the socio-economic development of India. Governor and chancellor of the university, Thavarchand Gehlot, presided over the programme. Pro-chancellor and minister of higher education Dr C N Ashwath Narayana also spoke. KU vice-chancellor K B Gudasi welcomed and introduced the dignitaries. The VC also explained KU’s achievements in the last two years. As many as 4,165 candidates were conferred degrees during the 70th convocation and 4,568 candidates during the 71st convocation. Dr T M Aminabhavi, former professor of the department of chemistry, was presented Diamond Jubilee Professor Award. At an offline function held at the golden jubilee hall, PhD holders were presented certificates. Gold medals will be presented to the winners at a function to be held at the same venue at 10.30am on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/tech-played-crucial-role-in-containing-pandemic-isro-ex-chief/articleshow/86875895.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||How Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s extent changed over the years||VISAKHAPATNAM: Ever since the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) replaced the erstwhile Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (Vuda) in 2018, it has undergone several changes in terms of extent and development area. Giving a push to urbanisation in the north coastal Andhra Pradesh region, the state government upgraded Vuda to VMRDA by notifying the 6,501 square kilometre development area in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts. Subsequently, the VMRDA lost 1,628 square kilometre area in Srikakulam district to the then newly constituted Srikakulam Urban Development Authority (Suda) in 2019. The state government excluded Srikakulam municipal corporation, Rajam Nagar panchayat, Amadalavalasa municipality and 417 villages in 11 mandals to give shape to Suda. This brought down the development area of the VMRDA to 4,873 sq km. Later in January 2020, the state government issued orders for inclusion of Merakamudidam mandal in Vizianagaram district, covering 41 villages, into the VMRDA. Measuring 17,529 hectares or 175.29 sq km, these 41 villages again took the extent of the VMRDA past the 5,000 sq km mark to 5,048.67 sq km. As has become the norm, rapid urbanisation led to bringing 13 more mandals under Visakhapatnam district, spanning about 2,280 sq km, under the jurisdiction of the VMRDA. This increased the extent of the VMRDA to 7,328 square kilometres. This move came after the VMRDA’s officials’ letter to the state government, explaining how the fringe areas of existing VMRDA limits have been experiencing rapid urbanisation. “In order to reduce pressure on the urban infrastructure of the city, to ensure planned development in the fringe areas and to control the haphazard development, the said 13 mandals may be brought under the jurisdiction of VMRDA.,” read the letter to the state government. The state government on Friday, October 8, constituted the Visakhapatnam-Kakinada Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region Urban Development Authority (VK-PCPIR UDA) by replacing the erstwhile Visakhapatnam-Kakinada Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region Special Development Authority (VK-PCPIR SDA). Here, the state government excluded seven mandals, comprising 82 revenue villages, from the VMRDA and brought them under the purview of the VK-PCPIR UDA. This has again brought down the extent of the VMRDA to 6,836 square kilometres from the existing 7,328 sq km. The VMRDA is currently in the process of resolving the objections and complaints received from the public on its draft master plan-2041.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/how-vmrdas-extent-changed-over-the-yrs/articleshow/86899294.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Of the total dengue cases, 21 were reported from Bankipore circle, 14 from Patna City circle, 10 from Patliputra circle, and three each from Azimabad, Kankerbagh, and New Capital circles. The remaining cases were from neighbouring areas like Phulwarisharif, Naubatpur, Bakhtiarpur, Danapur, Sampatchak, and Barh. Patna civil surgeon, Dr Vibha Kumari Singh, told this newspaper on Saturday that most dengue cases were found in Bankipore and Patna City in the last one week. “With a view to curbing the mosquito menace, a team is carrying out a fumigation and an anti-larvae drive in the district with the help of the local bodies,” she added. As many as 60 cases of dengue, two of chikungunya, and three of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) have been found in Patna so far. “These figures are only of the government health facilities. We have, therefore, asked the private hospitals to share their data as well,” the civil surgeon claimed. Dr Manoj Sinha, the superintendent of the New Gardiner Road Hospital, pointed out, “Almost six dengue cases have been reported in the hospital in the last one week, but none of them was admitted here. They all were suffering from mild symptoms like fever, cough, headache, and muscle pain.” On the other hand, four dengue patients have been admitted to the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital in a week. Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, an epidemiologist, said, “There has been a slight surge in dengue cases. While three JE patients were admitted and discharged after recovery, seven patients suffering from pneumonia are still undergoing treatment here.” At the Patna Medical College and Hospital, three dengue patients are being treated at present.

He was addressing a media conference on the severe power shortage and coal crisis across the state here on Saturday. Srikant said that power consumption in the state increased by 20% when compared to consumption in 2019. “Power consumption increased drastically after the Covid-19 crisis. But acute shortage of coal is hitting us badly. Not even a single power plant in the state is generating full capacity power due to coal shortage. Coal reserves for only four days are available with us and an immediate measure is required to continue uninterrupted power supply,” Srikant said. Coal, which cost $86.68 per tonne in April, has now touched the $162 mark, but we are still not receiving sufficient quantities, Srikant added. “The government is taking measures to help power distribution companies and we have released Rs 34,340 crore for discoms,” Srikant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/shortage-of-coal-hit-power-supply-says-energy-secy/articleshow/86899334.cms||---

While the minister was happy with the measures being undertaken at the construction site to handle dust pollution, he said 32 construction sites out of the 103 that were inspected in the past three days, had been fined a total of Rs 15 lakh by the Delhi government for violating dust norms. Rai on Saturday once again asked all construction agencies in Delhi to ensure they were adhering to the dust guidelines issued by the Delhi government, otherwise they, too, could be fined in the coming days. “As part of the anti-dust campaign, DPCC teams are visiting different districts and inspecting all construction sites. I had myself gone to inspect the work of L&T, which is being carried out in front of Pragati Maidan, earlier. There, massive violations of the guidelines issued by the Delhi government were taking place and hence, strict action has been taken against them,” said the minister. The anti-dust campaign is being run by the Delhi government from October 7 to October 29. “Today, I conducted a surprise inspection of the construction site of a commercial complex and found no violation of the rules. I am happy that whatever guidelines have been issued by the Delhi government for the agencies doing construction work, they are being followed here. Tin sheds, anti-smog guns had been installed on the site and water sprinkling was also being done. I am sure that all the construction agencies of Delhi will follow the instructions of the government in the same way,” Rai added. As part of the anti-dust campaign, 31 teams have been formed by the Delhi government, which will be visiting construction sites across Delhi to check whether they are following the guidelines. Teams will have to submit daily reports to the government. Based on the number of violations on a site, a fine will be issued to the erring construction agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dust-32-construction-sites-fined-in-3-days/articleshow/86903671.cms||---

The district heads of all three parties conducted a press conference at the Government Rest House and requested people to participate in the protest. Vijay Karanjkar, the district unit president of Shiv Sena, said his party was always in the support of the farmers and would go to any length to ensure that justice is delivered to them. “The farmers are being held hostage in an agrarian country like India. The incident in Lakhimpur, in which the farmers were mowed down, was highly reprehensible. We will not tolerate such incidents and, therefore, we are participating in the strike,” Karanjkar said. Sharad Aher, the city unit chief of the Congress, also condemned the Uttar Pradesh incident and urged people to raise their voices against such an “inhuman act” by participating in the bandh. “Dedicate a day to the farmers. They need the support of citizens as the BJP is abusing the government machinery and is doing injustice to people,” Aher said. The political functionaries said that if the state of Maharashtra was not governed by the MVA, then similar things would have happened here as well. Ravindra Pagar, the district unit president of NCP, also criticised the BJP leadership saying that they were not able to listen or digest anything that opposed them. “With the farmers’ agitation against the central government laws gaining strength, the BJP and its leadership can stoop to any level to crush the agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mva-leadership-requests-all-to-take-part-in-mondays-stir/articleshow/86896143.cms||---

The allegation levelled by the CMO was denied by Sangeeta Chauhan, BJP legislator from Amroha’s Naugavan Sadat assembly constituency. A video of the purported statement by the CMO is being circulated on social media. In the clip, Agarwal is seen responding to questions by mediapersons over rising deaths due to “treatment” by quacks. He is heard saying, "When we take action against quacks, MP, MLAs and district panchayat members interfere. They exert pressure on us. Some of them say ‘they (quacks) are their men’. That is why we have not been able to put an end to the illegal practice of quacks. However, I am doing my best to curb their practice." The CMO was replying to questions following the death of one Devendra Singh due to excessive bleeding hours after he was operated upon for piles allegedly by a quack at Kheda village Aprola under Nauganva Sadat police station area on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday. A case has been registered against the quack. MLA Chauhan said, “No representative of our party interferes in the crackdown against quacks. On the contrary, we always instruct all officials to curb all illegal activities in the area. We endeavour to get health facilities improved at our community and primary health centres.” According to sources, the poor and illiterate go to quacks for treatment due to lack of medical facilities in rural areas. Besides, quacks are cheaper than genuine doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cant-act-against-quacks-as-public-reps-interfere-says-amroha-cmo/articleshow/86897697.cms||Harveer Dabas

Congress had been denying its ticket to Manohar Tahsildar since the 2018 general election. He and Udasi have fought nine assembly elections since 1983. While Udasi was elected six times, and Tahsildar was elected four times. But Tahsildar is the senior legislator as he was the first to be elected in 1978. Tahsildar, being loyal to Congress, had represented the party all through. But party-hopper Udasi was first elected as an independent, and then represented Janata Paksh, Janata Dal and BJP. Udasi and Tahsildar, having deep connect with the people of Hangal, represented the segment in the assembly for four decades almost by roation. While Tahsildar was denied ticket due to age, Udasi’s regime ended with his demise. “There is no party politics in Hangal. It’s all about persons here. Udasi had won six times from different parties. But Tahsildar had won four times. Both the leaders were easily accessible to to people. Anti-incumbency had a say in their victory or loss,” said A Santosh, political analyst. Meanwhile, loyalists of Udasi family had expected BJP ticket to Udasi Revati, his daughter in-law and wife of MP Shivakumar. But with the party deciding to end dynasty politics in Hangal, Udasi loyalist and former MLA Shivaraj Sajjanar got the ticket. Interestingly, all the three major candidates are not from Hangal — Srinivas Mane (Congress) is from Hubballi; Sajjanar (BJP) is from Haveri; and Niyaz Shaikh (JD-S) is from Shivamogga district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/udasi-tahsildar-era-ends-in-hangal/articleshow/86875953.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

NCB said it questioned Mishra for several hours before he was allowed to leave. Last week, the NCB had arrested Khan’s son, Aryan, and seven others while they were about to board a cruise liner. “Mishra is not involved in the case. He did not arrange drugs for Aryan Khan,” an NCB official said. Meanwhile, NCB said on Saturday it arrested Santacruz resident Shivraj (38), who had allegedly supplied charas to one of the accused and was “one of the biggest links” in the case. Aryan and five others have been lodged in Arthur Road jail’s quarantine cell. It is learnt Aryan, his friend and co-accused Arbaaz Merchant and one more person had left from Bandra for south Mumbai on October 2. When asked if Mishra had dropped them at Mumbai International Cruise Terminal, an NCB official said a probe was underway and he would not comment on it. “We wanted to know Aryan’s movement on that day,” said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director, NCB. On Shivraj, Wankhede said, “Arrested accused Shivraj is one of the biggest links in this case. He had given charas to Arbaaz. We are trying to find out if there are any previous cases registered against him.” Shivraj will be produced before a holiday court on Sunday. “(Drug) seizures were made at the terminal and from the ship as well,” said Wankhede.

Since then, the water board officials started to diagnose the decade old sewerage system. In certain areas such as LB Nagar, Hayathnagar, Autonagar, Sainikpuri, KPHB colony, Uppal, Kapra, Alwal, Rajendranagar and Patancheru, the water board officials have noticed that the sewerage system is defunct due to piling up tons of silt and waste materials like mattresses, pillows, damaged furnitures, bio-waste and animal corpses. The officials have taken photos of these areas for studying it. A detailed report on our observations would be sent to the main office and will be reporting it during the review meeting which is to be held every week, a senior HMWS&SB official said to TOI. First priority is to identify the hotspots in the sewerage network and to attend to the complaints about overflowing due to the heavy rains, added the senior official. Another official said that, “Even though new colonies have emerged in the GHMC periphery, the sewerage system is not updated. It is observed that during the October 2020 floods, over 60% of the sewerage system was washed away. “The GHMC has allotted a budget to take up repair works in certain areas, but they could not complete it due to many reasons. Now, the water board is short-listing those pending works,” said an official. An official said that according to the GHMC records, there are 3.26 lakh manholes in 66 GHMC periphery wards. 1.5 lakh mahholes of them are found damaged due to lack of maintenance. The water board has repaired and placed manhole covers. Revamping of the sewerage system will take at least another six months, an official replied to a query.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-board-in-tangles-over-tackling-ghmc-sewage-mess/articleshow/86901602.cms||Sunil Mungara

The farmers are now sorting out the good ones and dumping the rotten ones in garbage bins.Farmers at Gobichettipalayam, Semmandampalayam, Nambiyur and Elathur villages had cultivated shallots on more than 300 acres this time.M K Narayanasamy, one of the farmers, said they had struggled for three months to grow the shallots to the harvesting stage. Talking to TOI, he said they are preparing to harvest the crop in a week and sell them.“Usually, we get 10 tonnes to 12 tonnes shallots per acre. But this time, we will be lucky if we get at least two tonnes from an acre, as most of the crop had rotten in the rain,” he said.Another farmer said the shallot was presently priced at Rs40 per kg in the retail market. “The rate will shoot up further in the coming weeks, until the new stock hits the market.”Gobichettipalayam and surrounding villages had received good showers in the past couple of days. Most of the cultivated land was submerged in the rainwater, which damaged crops such as paddy, small onions, groundnuts, cereals and pulses. “It was raining incessantly and Gobichettipalayam taluk had received between 40mm and 100mm rain every day,” a meteorological officer said.The farmers have urged the district administration and the state government to send agriculture department officials to inspect their farmlands and assess the damages. “The government should compensate us for our losses. Many of us had taken loans to cultivate shallots. Now that our crops are damaged, we are not in a position to repay the loans,” a farmer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tonnes-of-shallots-perish-in-heavy-rain-in-erode-dist/articleshow/86901607.cms||---

Section 36A of NDPS Act states all offences punishable with over three years’ jail term have to be tried by special courts, as there cannot be two trials for the same FIR, argued NCB through ASG Anil Singh with special public prosecutor Advait Sethna. It recorded Khan’s counsel Satish Maneshinde saying, “Khan is son of a prominent Bollywood film actor, has a bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts, Cinematic Arts and TV production from University of South California, USA. He is a responsible citizen of India... He has retracted his statement recorded by the NCB.” No drugs were found on Khan.

As many as 186 brick kilns units were closed in the Thadagam area after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) took suo motu cognisance of the exploitation of natural resources.The extent of damage caused by the units is being accessed by a special committee formed by NGT’s southern zone.“Officials should not allow earthmovers in the disputed site. Instead of stopping such illegal acts, they are hand in glove with the violators, which will dilute the investigation conducted by NGT,” Ganesh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/govt-staff-helping-illegal-miners-of-thadagam-valley-activists/articleshow/86901616.cms||---

Five of the gang have been arrested. The robbers forced at least 15 passengers to part with cellphones and cash after threatening them. A 21-year-old man who refused to give his phone was pushed out of the train, but as it was moving slowly, only suffered minor injuries to the head. Read AlsoNewly-wed woman wanted to start life in city of dreamsThe 20-year-old woman who has lodged a complaint of sexual assault on board the Lucknow-Mumbai Pushpak Express was on her maiden visit to the city of dreams with her husband. However, the assault has changed her perception towards Maharashtra as being among safe states in the country.The horror took place on board the Lucknow-Mumbai Pushpak Express around 7pm between Igatpuri and Kasara stations as the train was headed to Mumbai. A case of gangrape has been registered after the newly-married woman from UP, who was travelling with her husband, registered a complaint, said railway police 4 of 5 train robbers held are from Igatpuri & MumbaiAs the train entered a long tunnel after Igatpuri, the robbers, taking advantage of the cover of darkness, threatened passengers in the general coach with belts and metal knuckles, forcing them to part with their belongings, said passengers. Some of them whipped out knives soon after the train had left Igatpuri station, some of the passengers told TOI. When they targeted the young woman, her husband and another co-passenger seated close to them tried to stop the assailants but were assaulted. Four of the robbers were arrested soon after the crime while a fifth was apprehended on Saturday, the railway police said. They are from Igatpuri and Mumbai. The railway police claimed that the robbers must have targeted the general coach as Railway Protection Force personnel hardly visit these compartments. One of protesting passengers, 21-year-old Ankush Kumar, was pushed out of the train, passengers said. However, the train was moving at slow speed at the time. A little before this, one of the passengers in the coach pulled the chain. “They snatched my mobile phone and pushed me out,” said Kumar. “But the train was still moving slowly and so I managed to get in into another compartment with help from a passenger who stretched out his hand and pulled me in again.” By then, teams of the railway police and RPF had been lying wait on the platform of the next station, Kasara, to nab the culprits. However, some of them had managed to escape from the station while RPF officials nabbed one of them at the station. After the train left Kasara, passengers realised that one of the robbers had been holed up in the toilet. They latched him up inside and as the train reached Kalyan, he was handed over to the railway police officials at the station. On learning about the sexual assault, railway police officials at Kalyan got in touch with their counterparts at Igatpuri after which two others were nabbed, including those who had sexually abused the woman. The arrested accused have been identified as Arshad Shaikh (19) who lives in Malad, Prakash Pardhi alias Pakya (20), Arjun Pardeshi (20) and Kishore Sonawane alias Kalu (25) – all from Igatpuri. Details of the fifth arrested person were not immediately known. The five arrested persons and their absconding accomplices have been charged with rape, robbery besides other sections of the Railway Act. Some of the arrested men have a criminal background, according to railway police officials. The estimated value of the stolen property is pegged around Rs 96,000, said Quaiser Khalid, commissioner of Government Railway Police (Mumbai). He said phones formed a major chunk of the booty. Goods worth Rs 34,000 have been recovered so far.

With the finalization of all arrangements for the proposed rally, a big band of Congress leaders and office-bearers has already reached the city. Talking to the reporters on the eve of Priyanka’s Varanasi visit, Congress state president Ajay Kumar Lallu said, “To ensure to the farmers killed by BJP leader and Union minister’s son in Lakhimpur Kheri, the party will launch a movement at the rally, after which the party will ensure that this movement reaches each village, locality, market and assembly area of the state.” He claimed that the party’s movement will continue till justice is ensured to the families of the killed farmers. Targeting BJP-led state government on Lakhimpur Kheri episode, Lallu alleged that it is surprising that a government which ensures demolitions with bulldozers and displays posters of criminals in minor incidents, is tight-lipped about the killing of farmers. “The government should tell when it will release the posters of accused persons of Lakhimpur Kheri,” questioned Lallu alleging that the BJP governments at the Centre and state were trying their best to protect the accused and son of the minister. Alleging that UP was facing a ‘jungleraj’ as criminals were roaming about fearlessly after committing crime, Lallu alleged that instead of initiating action against the criminals, the government was standing with them. “It is difficult to understand what message this government wants to give to the people by sending summons to a murder accused instead of arresting him,” said Lallu. “More shocking was to see that when Priyanka was heading to Lakhimpur Kehri to meet the bereaved families of killed farmers, she was arrested and kept in custody for over 40 hours,” said Lallu while demanding sacking of minister and immediate arrest of all accused persons. Earlier, former Rajya Sabha MP Pramod Tiwari along with many party leaders also reached Jagatpur to take stock of the preparations. He said, “All those who want to save the Constitution, farmers and the interest of common man should attend the rally on Sunday.” Many senior party leaders, including national secretaries Rajesh Tiwari and Bajirao Khade, former MP Dr Rajesh Mishra, former minister Ajay Rai, Digvijay Singh, Imran Khan and others were also found busy in preparations for the Sunday’s show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/priyanka-to-herald-congs-2022poll-drive-at-kisan-nyaya-yatra/articleshow/86901633.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The first information report (FIR) quoting the Pune-based woman states that the incident happened at 2.51 am between the Udgir and Latur railway stations. She stated that the man touched her inappropriately twice. When she raised an alarm, co-passengers apprehended the man and summoned the GRP personnel to the coach at Latur station. TOI tried to contact the complainant, but her phone was constantly out of reach. The officer was produced before the special railway court at Aurangabad, which remanded him in judicial custody for 15 days. Quaiser Khalid, commissioner of police, railways, said, “The accused (a Group B officer) has been arrested under sections 354-A (sexual harassment) and 509 (intending to insult modesty of a woman) of the IPC. The woman carried on with her journey (post-registration of the FIR).” Khalid, an officer of the rank of inspector general of police, posted three tweets relating to the incident on his Twitter handle, @quaiser_khalid, confirming the NCB officer’s arrest and a brief account of the alleged incident as “explained by the complainant”. “I have said whatever I had to about the incident in the tweets,” he told TOI. One of his tweets read, “The accused was travelling on the same route upon attending court evidence at Hyderabad.” When contacted, NCB’s Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede told TOI, “The said officer was unwell, is currently on medical leave and was undergoing psychiatric treatment.” Asked about Khalid’s tweet that the “accused” was returning from Hyderabad after attending court evidence, Wankhede said, “We have no idea about this court proceeding.” An NCB officer said the arrested man has been keeping unwell for the past one year and has remained on medical leave for most part of the year. “The said officer met with a life-threatening accident and was on leave for close to five months at a stretch. He joined work for less than a fortnight before going back on leave, which continues till date,” he said, adding that the man has not been part of any raids or actions of the NCB during the past one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ncb-officer-held-after-woman-alleges-he-touched-her-inappropriately-on-train/articleshow/86887930.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Tiwari stated this at a meeting organized by city MP and Union minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari. Similar complaint was raised by former mayor and MLC Pravin Datke, also corporator, at the meeting. As per a press release issued by the office of Gadkari on Saturday, Tiwari was quoted as saying, “It is not necessary for people to approach NMC town planning department for building plan sanction for plots up to 200 sq m. Still, such plans are in large numbers and kept pending,” he said. Tiwari and Datke also said that common man was facing serious problems as they are getting demand note of Rs7-8 lakh for building plan sanction. “Earlier, applications seeking building plan up to 200 sq m used to go to zone offices. Now, all plans are looked in by the town planning department situated at head office. This is also causing serious inconvenience to people,” they said. Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe said, “The statements of Tiwari and Datke make it clear that the BJP has no control over NMC administration. Also, it is proved that BJP does not know how to rule the civic body. People should teach the party a lesson in the upcoming elections. The mayor should resign on moral grounds,” he said. Citing complaints related to NMC town planning department are in large numbers as compared to other government agencies, Gadkari directed the administration to sent resolution passed by the NMC general body for reducing the developmental charges. “If the charges were hiked by the government, then the NMC should conduct study, take legal opinion and chalk out a proper plan to bring them down,” he said. Gadkari also directed the NMC and NIT to start receiving applications for all services and dispose off cases online. “Collector office should issue akhiv patrika from city survey office and other services online,” he said. Gadkari also discussed various issues related to NIT and collector office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/brokers-racket-keeps-bldg-plans-pending-for-8-9-mths-mayor/articleshow/86899613.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Kanpur||Kanpur Metro trains to conserve energy||KANPUR: Following the concept of ‘Clean Metro, Green Metro’ and to fulfill the objective of energy conservation, Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Limited (UPMRC) has claimed another innovation, while executing the Kanpur Metro Rail Project. UPMRC claimed that for the very first time in India it has made the provision in the Kanpur Metro Rail Project for installing a special inverter device with the Third Rail DC Traction System to convert the Direct Current (DC) power regenerated through the train’s breaking into Alternate Current and reroute the same to the Metro System for reuse. Kanpur Metro trains will have the energy efficiency of about 40-45% which means at the expenditure of every 1000 units, upto 450 units can be regenerated through braking and be used again with the help of ‘Regenerative Braking Technology’. No other Metro Project in India, that is running on the Third Rail DC Traction System has such type of arrangement to conserve energy. UPMRC said that at present, Bangalore, Kochi, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, and Gurgaon Rapid Metro Projects are operating on the Third Rail DC Traction System in the country and none of them have any provision to reuse the Direct Current (DC) energy regenerated through train braking. This is because the energy regenerated is in DC form, while the rest of the Metro system runs on AC current. UPMRC has provided the special inverter for the Traction System in Kanpur, which can convert 750 volts DC current regenerated through braking of train into 33 KV AC current for reuse in the system. Managing Director, UPMRC, Kumar Keshav, Managing Director said, “With the objective of ‘Clean Metro, Green Metro’, we have made innovations for energy conservation while executing our projects. In the Metro Projects operating with AC Traction System in the country, including Lucknow, there is a provision for energy conservation with the technique of ‘Regenerative Braking’, but no such system is available for the Third Rail DC Traction System. With the help of this innovation, the Kanpur Metro Rail Project will set an example in terms of energy conservation for all other Metro Projects in the country that are operating on the Third Rail Traction System.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-metro-trains-to-conserve-energy/articleshow/86901660.cms||---

This year, 108 criminals have been booked under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). Pandey said such a large number of criminals booked under MCOCA in one year was a record. He said 86 seasoned criminals were also externed from the city and the district limits this year, while nine criminals were slapped with the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA). The police has taken bond of good behaviour from over 200 criminals on police records at one time. Ahead of next year’s polls, police permission has been made mandatory to put up hoardings along the road. He said many times, hoardings lead to an altercation among people, which at times result into criminal offences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-cops-set-up-preventive-measures/articleshow/86896173.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Addressing a press conference at Press Club, Civil Lines, on Saturday, ACI president Rajanikant Bondre said, “The entrance exam sector requires critical thinking and application of knowledge. In-person teaching is significant in improving these aspects. The first round of JEE Mains exam is set to be held in January and we need to prepare students for it.” ACI vice-president Suraj Iyer, joint secretary Virag Mitkary, patron Narendra Wankhede and member Jayant Ganvir were present at the press conference, where the association also pressed demands for relaxations from the government regarding payment of GST, electricity bills, local taxes etc and requested the government to announce some financial package to revive this sector. ACI stated that it reserved the right to approach the high court against this “unconstitutional discrimination”. Bondre said, “As per government directives, schools have been allowed to reopen for Std VIII to XII. Surprisingly, coaching classes have been omitted from these unlock orders.” He added, “On approaching local authorities with our concern, we were informed that coaching classes cannot be allowed to reopen until they receive government directives.” Shedding light on the plight of students on various fronts, Bondre said, “The rankings of Maharashtra students have dwindled due to lack of in-person mentoring. Due to online education, students are suffering from ailments like obesity, eye problems, psychological disorders etc. Online coaching can never replace one-to-one interaction between students and teachers.” Bondre noted that coaching classes had suffered a loss in admissions by 40%. “Livelihoods of teachers, staff, vendors supplying study material and other people connected to us have been affected tremendously. They have had to go to great lengths to make ends meet,” he said. Bondre further pointed out that hotels are operational while theatres will be reopened soon. He said, “Students are also visiting these places. Coaching institutions will be able to maintain Covid protocol by calling students in batches, yet we have not been provided with any relief under the unlock orders.” Iyer added, “Even parents are requesting us to resume offline classes. They are paying fees with their hard-earned money, but online coaching has failed to deliver value.” (Reporting by Manshika Vaikkath)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coaching-institutes-call-for-reopening-sans-further-delay/articleshow/86899619.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Ram, Krishna country’s heritage, law must be enacted to honour them: HC||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Friday said that “Parliament must bring law to pay ‘rashtriya samman’ (national honour) to Lord Ram, Lord Krishna, Ramayan and its author Valmiki besides Gita and its author Maharshi Ved Vyas, as they are the culture and heritage of the country”. The court added that the Constitution allows one to be atheist, but it does not mean that one can pass obscene remarks against gods and goddesses. The court also said that there is a need to educate children on this issue by making it a compulsory subject in all the schools of the country and educating the children about Indian culture. These observations were made by Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav while allowing bail application of one Akash Jatav of Hathras, who is accused of sharing objectionable images of Hindu deities on social media. The court allowed the bail application, considering the plea of the applicant that he was in jail for the last 10 months. The trial in his case was yet to commence and there was no chance that trial would conclude in near future. On the allegations against the applicant, the court said that there are many countries in the world where there is a provision of harsh punishment for such conduct, but in India there is provision of lesser punishment in comparison to many countries. Elaborating its stand, the court it its 12-page judgment delivered in Hindi further said that “recently, the apex court has given its decision in the Ram Janmabhoomi case in favour of the people who believe in the Lord Ram, who is the soul and culture of India and India is incomplete without Lord Ram”. The court also condemned the practice of caste discrimination. Besides, the court said that one should respect the deities and culture of the country in which he or she lives, instead of making obscene remarks on such issues. “The Constitution of India allows one to be atheist, but it does not mean that one can pass obscene remarks against gods and goddesses,” said justice Yadav. The court gave this decision on October 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ram-krishna-countrys-heritage-law-must-be-enacted-to-honour-them-hc/articleshow/86901747.cms||---

As reported by TOI, over 40,000 trees are proposed to be cut at the lush green land at Ajni for inter-modal station (IMS) and other commercial projects. According to officials, the matter of Ajni Van is now in the hands of state tree authority, as per the amended Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975. The amended act has tightened the rules for felling of trees for development works, identifying 50-year-old trees as heritage and increasing the number of compensatory plantations. Thousands of objection letters have been filed against the tree felling at Ajni with the garden department of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).

---||Nagpur||Rising temp sign of monsoon withdrawal: Met||Nagpur: After receiving good rainfall last month, the city is now sweltering. The rising mercury levels in the city are an indication of monsoon withdrawal, say met officials. On Saturday, Nagpur was the second hottest in the region with a maximum temperature of 35 degree Celsius. This was almost 2 degrees above normal. Bramhapuri was the hottest in the region with its maximum temperature being 35.7 degree Celsius. October is a transition period for the region – it marks the end of monsoon and the onset of winter next month. As per officials, the day temperatures are high while nights and early morning are comparatively cooler. Mohanlal Sahu, deputy director general of the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Nagpur, said, “As this is a period of withdrawal of monsoon, the moisture levels are down which is leading to an increase in maximum temperature. Cloudiness has also decreased and the sky is mostly clear during the day time.” As per Sahu, the possibility of more rainfall in the region is quite less, with probability of only one or two light showers. “Withdrawal of monsoon has taken place in Madhya Pradesh and is expected to reach Vidarbha in next two-to-three days,” said Sahu. While October categorises under the ‘post monsoon’ season, the onset of winter in Vidarbha will be in December. “In Northern parts of the country, winter arrives early. In our region, the cooling will start during November while December will witness complete beginning of winters,” said Sahu. As reported by TOI earlier, Vidarbha received 3% excess rains than the normal this year. No district has been reported to be rainfall deficit. “Some districts received excess rains. While August saw a dry spell, September’s rainfall compensated for it, as was the prediction of met department,” said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rising-temp-sign-of-monsoon-withdrawal-met/articleshow/86899790.cms||Manka Behl

The date of reopening was on Saturday postponed to October 12. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said a revised order allowing colleges, coaching classes and training institutes to reopen from October 12 was issued on Saturday. Kumar did not give any reason for the change in the date of reopening. Pimpri Chinchwad commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI that in view of the October 11 state-wide bandh, the date of reopening was pushed to October 12. “We don’t want any safety issues. Also, we want to give ample time to the college staff to prepare,” said Patil. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Saturday said colleges in rural areas will also reopen from October 12.  Institutes said they expect local students to attend lectures, but students from outside Pune are expected to arrive after the Diwali. Sharad Kunte, president of the Deccan Education Society that runs Fergusson College and Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC), said their institutes will reopen on Tuesday. “All our staff are vaccinated. We do not expect students from outside Pune to be back on campus on Tuesday, but local students, if they are vaccinated, can attend,” said Kunte. Classes will continue in hybrid mode because there will be some students who will not be able to attend classes in person, said Kunte. P B Buchade, principal of Abasaheb Garware College, said more students can be expected at most colleges after Diwali. “We will resume physical classes after a week as we need get the vaccination data of students and arrange classes with fewer students,” said Buchade. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, said the reopening has been planned in three phases. “The first to be called will be outgoing students, which means final-year students in undergraduate and postgraduate courses. We will then concentrate on finishing practicals for all, and then start lectures,” said Zunjarrao. According to Zunjarrao, theory classes will be held in a staggered manner with one-third of the students attending two days a week. Vishwakarma University too is ready to reopen from Tuesday. Vice-chancellor Siddharth Jabade said 85% of their Pune-based students are partially vaccinated while the rest are fully vaccinated, according to the data they have. “In view of the significant number of students who are partially vaccinated, a hybrid model of education will be enabled,” said Jabade. Final-year students’ practicals/ hands-on examinations are a priority, he said. “Students from outside Pune will be provided with an standard operating procedure for accommodation, reaching Pune, food, health check-up etc,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-to-reopen-on-oct-12-focus-on-final-year-students/articleshow/86899773.cms||Ardhra Nair

A probe is already underway in the matter. Shubham Kumawat, the 22-year-old paramedical worker, had gone for Covid vaccination when he was allegedly made to give his swab sample at a government centre on October 7. He later did a Covid test at a private lab on the same day. The private lab shared his Covid+ report on October 7 and a similar outcome of the test done at the government centre was communicated to him over phone the next day. Suspecting foul play, Kumawat said he travelled all the way to Jalna and underwent another RT-PCR test on October 8 at the government district hospital. He received the Covid-ve report on Friday evening. “I was shocked when I came to know that health authorities were aware of the outcome of the test done at a private lab in Parbhani much before me. Therefore, I decided to move to other district headquarter to prove my health status as Covid negative,” he said. Parbhani district civil surgeon Balasaheb Nagargoje said the swab sample of Kumawat has been preserved and will be sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. “The fact-finding in the whole matter is still on and we cannot arrive at any conclusion at this juncture.

According to the data, there has been a 40% drop in cases in the week ending October 6 since August-end. Confirming the trend, the authorities of various hospitals said their total admitted Covid patients currently has been the lowest since a year, including the time the first Covid wave had subsided in 2020. Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of the Symbiosis Society, said there were currently just five Covid admissions at Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre in Lavale, a dedicated Covid facility. “Current Covid admissions are lowest in over a year. One of the major reasons seems to be a rise in vaccinations in Pune. We have had no Covid patient in the ICU since the last 10-15 days. In fact, we have closed the Covid ICU for the time being due to a drop in severe cases,” said Yeravdekar. Not too long in the past, the hospital would have over 200 Covid patients at a time. Dr Govind Kulkarni, senior consultant physician, Sahyadri Superspeciality Hospital, Ahmednagar Road, told TOI, “Major hospitals currently have an average of only 5-10 Covid-19 patients, most from Pune rural or other districts.

Considering the number of devotees from Prayagraj who visit the Badrinath temple in Uttarakhand, at least this one Durga Puja pandal here has chosen to depict the Badrinath Dham temple. A team of 15 artisans and technicians have worked round the clock and completed the Puja pandal at Kashiraj Nagar which is based on the Badrinath temple. The Puja at Kashiraj Nagar Puja pandal will begin on October 11 and the visarjan will take place on October 15. Nayan Jaiswal, organiser of the Puja committee told TOI, “A large number of devotees from Sangam city visit the Badrinath temple every year from the city but due to the Covid-19 pandemic for the past two years, the devotees have not been able to visit the temple." He further added, “Realising that many devotees visit the Badrinath temple to offer prayers to deities, the committee members decided that this year, they would depict their Puja pandal as Badrinath Dham temple”. Nayan further added, “When the devotees will visit the Puja pandal at Kashiraj Nagar, they would feel that they are standing in the vicinity of the Badrinath temple." While the state government has asked for strict compliance for the prevention of the Covid-19 pandemic because of the upcoming festive season, Puja pandal Samiti members reiterated that Covid safety protocols would be followed strictly. “Ahead of Shardiya Navratri, Vijayadashami, and Dussehra festival, the city-based Durga Puja pandal start working on different themes to erect pandals,” said Nayan. “This time, the idea for a pandal based on the Badrinath Dham came to our minds and we started working on it about a month back,” he added. He, however, said that it takes more than a month to erect a pandal and complete all decorations and both artisans and technicians work round the clock to get the work finished on time. “All in all, a pandal is a good example of teamwork and adequate funds were spent on it to make it grand pandal,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/kashiraj-nagar-puja-pandal-to-be-based-on-badrinath-temple/articleshow/86901776.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Three more held in Telugu Akademi’s FD fraud||HYDERABAD: Continuing their crackdown against persons involved in Telugu Akademi’s Rs 64.50 crore fixed deposit (FD) fraud, Central Crime Station (CCS) sleuths arrested three more persons on Saturday. With the latest arrest, 13 persons have been arrested so far in the case. The Central Crime Station assistant commissioner of police Manoj Kumar told TOI that three persons — Vinay, an employee of Telugu Akademi, Bhoopathi and Ramana Reddy — were arrested and sent in judicial remand. “These accused had earned Rs 30,000 for every Rs 1 crore of money siphoned off. The trio had earned Rs 30 lakh and it was shared by them,” the assistant commissioner of police added. Bhoopathi and Ramana were reportedly associates of Sai Kumar, who has already been arrested. These two persons liaised between bank employees and Akademi to submit fake documents, which played a key role in the illegal liquidation of Telugu Akademi’s fixed deposits worth Rs 64.50 crore. The investigator said the two accused had played a key role in getting the funding letters of banks, which were submitted to the Akademi. On October 4, 14 members, allegedly linked to the case, were in Central Crime Station custody. After a local court’s order, Central Crime Station officials took nine persons into custody. Vinay allegedly played a key role in processing documents at the Akademi so that the other accused could execute the conspiracy. The Rs 64.50 crore fixed deposits, which were parked in two public sector banks, were illegally diverted and later siphoned off by at least 13 accused. Police were likely to arrest more persons in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/three-more-held-in-akademis-fd-fraud/articleshow/86899859.cms||---

As a part of Covid prevention measures, the Ajanta and Ellora caves were closed on weekends and had regulated visiting hours on the weekdays. Both sites will now remain open for tourists on Saturdays and Sundays as well — from dawn to dusk. As per the pre-Covid schedule, Ajanta caves will be closed on Mondays, and Ellora caves on Tuesdays. Other monuments including Bibi-ka-Maqbara, Aurangabad caves and Daulatabad fort will allow tourists on weekdays. TOI has carried multiple reports on the local tourism and hospitality industry demanding restoration of the pre-Covid visiting schedule of visitors at the key monuments in the Aurangabad district. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said the pre-Covid timings of the Ajanta-Ellora caves and other monuments would be restored from next week. “Our online ticketing system needs to be adjusted as per the revised timings and the change will be effected from October 11. Visitors and other stakeholders are requested to follow all Covid-appropriate behaviour,” ASI superintendent archaeologist (Aurangabad circle) Milan Kumar Chauley said. As per the official data, 41,134 tourists, including 3,352 foreigners, had visited the Ajanta caves in January this year, before the Covid-related curbs got introduced gradually. Different stakeholders from the tourism and hospitality industry have been demanding the reopening of Ajanta-Ellora caves on weekends. Both ASI and the state tourism department had left it to the district administration to take the necessary call. The demand concerned was being discussed during the weekly Covid review meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pre-covid-timings-of-ajanta-ellora-restored/articleshow/86896303.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik: Rain dampens festive mood in city||NASHIK: Parts of the Nashik city and rural areas received light to moderate rainfall for the second consecutive day on Saturday, which led to the drop in the footfall of devotees at some of the temples. The management of Kalika Temple, which attracts a large number of devotees during Navaratra, said a section of people were not able to visit the temple despite making online bookings for darshan due to rain. Keshav Anna Patil, the trustee of the Kalika Temple, said when it rains, the devotees can’t visit the temple in the allotted time slot and they are also not permitted to take darshan in other slots since it already has the required number of devotees to be allowed. This has been happening for the past two days, he said. Gajanan Chingre, the trustee of the Renuka Mata Temple in Bhagur, said the rain is stopping a large number of devotees from coming to the temple. Even though devotees take the e-pass, they are not turning up for the darshan. The drop in the footfall is between 40% to 50% than what we were expecting. We hope that it will return to normalcy once the skies become clear. Some vendors said the rain has impacted their business. Nashik skies remained overcast on Saturday along with rain in some parts of the city. Some vendors said customers decide beforehand what they want to buy during the festival. So even if it rains, the plan of buying articles is only postponed and not cancelled. Hence, customers will turn up in a day or two. Meanwhile, due to heavy rain in the catchment areas of Gangapur dam, the water resources department has released water at 1,000 cusec.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rain-dampens-festive-mood-in-nashik-city/articleshow/86896284.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Several criminals were still deep in slumber when they woke up to the knocks on the door of policemen. Armed cops searched almirahs, looked underneath beds and pored over documents even as bemused suspects demanded the reason for the police visit. In all, four firearms and 21 swords were recovered during the day. The same scenes followed across the entire city from Moti Dungri to Harmara and from Galta Gate to Muhana. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said the mass arrests preceded long operational planning based on specific information about the locations of 382 criminals active in Jaipur. The prime objective of the simultaneous raids was attributed to contain the growing network of armed criminals and their affiliates. “Following the search, we brought 185 suspects for the questioning at different police stations. We have filed a total of 21 FIRs under which 145 are arrested in drugs, liquor and arms cases. The city police were keeping a close eye on suspects, criminal enterprises and land mafias for over six months now,” Lamba said during a presser. Lamba said all policemen were instructed to carry firearms at all times during the raid and search operations. Police said many of those held or rounded up for interrogation included members of notorious criminal gangs such as Munna Talwar, Ganga Pandit, Vinod Pathena, Vijaypal, Kamal Meena, Sandeep Bungla and Shehjad Dudi. “The raids yield a trove of information about the fledgling gangs and their modus operandi. We have also learned that some of these criminals regularly intimidated their neighbours and shopkeepers in localities,” Lamba said. While cops did not face any major resistance, some of the suspects said that they would come to police stations later in the day. Officials, however, remained persistent with their demand to check houses. “Every corner was checked. At several places we found land deeds and property documents which indicated that the suspects were involved with some land mafia to grab properties,” Lamba told TOI, adding that all suspects under police custody were being sternly interrogated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/clean-bowled-cops-swoop-down-on-gangsters-in-city/articleshow/86901839.cms||---
---||Allahabad||40% houses in Prayagraj turn breeding grounds for mosquitoes: Survey||PRAYAGRAJ: Officials of the health department are in a catch 22 situation after finding that deserted coolers, flower posts and abandoned or unused articles dumped on roof of the houses have turned breeding grounds for mosquitoes in majority of the houses, particularly in the low-lying belt of Ganga, in Sangam city. After carrying out a detailed survey in over 60,000 houses, particularly located in hotspots area like Chota Baghara and Govindpur, the officials found that over 40 percent of the owners or tenants have not cleaned their coolers, flower pots, or have not disposed off unused articles kept on side of the roof of houses since a month. Moreover, due to accumulation of flood water in the open plots and basements in Chota Baghara locality (low-lying area of river Ganga), the area has become hazardous breeding ground for mosquitoes, giving way to rise in cases of mosquito-borne diseases. With tally of dengue patients crossing 347 mark in the city and its tentacles spreading in trans Ganga and Yamuna pockets, joint teams of health, Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) are interacting with residents daily and unabatedly appealing them to take preventive measures to check the spread of vector -borne disease. Out of the total number of patients who contracted dengue in the city in the past one month, the houses of more than 50% of them served as the breeding ground for the female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti – carrier of dengue virus –lays eggs in fresh water and even a small puddle can become its breeding ground. District Malaria Officer (DMO) AK Singh told TOI on Thursday, “Our teams found that larvae were thriving in a number of spots inside residential premises, including abandoned object kept on rooftops, flower pots, deserted coolers, and old tyres. Residents in Chota Baghara have not even wiped out flood water from the basements of their houses. Moreover, open plots in low lying areasof Ganga - where flood water accumulated during floods - have also turned breeding grounds for mosquitoes.” Currently, over a dozen localities, including posh areas of Civil Lines are under the scanner of health officials and anti-larva spraying exercise has been intensified to keep the disease at bay. Health department claimed to have surveyed over 60,000 and three lakh houses in urban and rural areas of the district in past one month. Singh, meanwhile, claimed that things are under control and health teams are knocking every door in rural and urban area to create awareness. A team of district authorities is also conducting verification of at least 150 houses daily that were being surveyed by the basic health workers in city and rural pockets. Senior medical Officer Dr Anupam Dwivedi said, “Aedes mosquito’s egg hatch into larvae in less than a day and attains adulthood within a week. The breeding cycle is 10-12 days.” “House owners or tenants should regularly clean water sites in their houses. If it is not possible to drain out water, a little kerosene can be poured to kill larvae,” he added. With more cases of dengue reported in both rural and urban areas, denizens need to be extra vigilant and check mosquito breeding grounds on an urgent basis. PMC authorities claimed that they have been carrying out extensive anti-mosquito activities like fogging and anti-larvae spraying, but it is also the responsibility of residents to maintain hygiene and they must check the accumulation of water in and around their houses and vicinity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/08-oct-over-40-percent-houses-turn-breeding-grounds-for-dengue-mosquitoes-survey/articleshow/86901836.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: To keep women safe, Margao techie evangelises smartphone SOS feature||PANAJI: When reports of the rape at Benaulim beach broke out, Nestinka Rebello felt she had to do something. The assault on the two minor girls really hit home for the Margao-based techie, who wanted to do something to help women stay safe. Rebello, director and chief technology officer of fintech startup CodeMax, realised that the smartphone was the best weapon for those who find themselves in danger. Every iOS and android smartphone has settings that could send an SOS, including pictures of the assailant with just one click of a button. Most people, says Rebello, do not know of this feature. Rebello started an online initiative, safeus.life, to teach women to use in-built tools on their phones to get help as soon as possible. She put up a step-by-step process to help anyone with a smartphone to set up the emergency locator feature on devices which can send an alert and location by pressing the power button. “When I heard about the rapes in the neighbouring village, it really hit home and we decided that it was high time that everyone should be able to protect themselves,” Rebello said. She found out that many people, including youngsters, do not use the emergency locator feature which is a default on every smartphone. That’s when she set up a website and the #SafeUs campaign to create awareness about the feature. As part of the campaign, once a person activates the setting on their smartphone, they have to pledge to teach their family members how to do it too. Depending on the brand of the smartphone, the setting is known as emergency locator, SOS, safety or panic. Once the preset key is pressed, an alert with your current location is sent to a relative. Some phones even send a picture and audio to the emergency contact. “From Codemax it was more of an awareness program. Basically, I would say that as girls we need to be stronger to face such incidents. At the school-level, self-defence needs to be taught to every child. Every child has a phone today and they and their parents should be made aware of this feature,” Rebello said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-keep-women-safe-margao-techie-evangelises-smartphone-sos-feature/articleshow/86903374.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Pune||Pune: Residents keep hope alive, help sick & homeless in trying times||PUNE: The residents of the Little Hearts Cooperative Housing Society in Undri were left heartbroken when five of their members died of Covid-19 last year. But instead of losing hope, they decided to go out of their way to help the homeless and the sick. The society has around 800 residents staying in 240 flats. “Twenty eight people contracted the Covid infection and five of them passed away. But this didn’t break our spirit. On the contrary, it motivated us to reach out to the needy and help them in every possible way. During the lockdowns, we took it upon ourselves to help the needy in different parts of the city. We provided them with food and other necessities,” Hrishikesh Kulkarni, the chairman of the society, told TOI. The society members also set up a quarantine centre at the society’s clubhouse for the benefit of the residents advised home isolation. “A group was created on WhatsApp to allow the residents post their requirements, which were supplied to them without any delay. A blood donation camp was also organized by the society members in accordance to the Covid guidelines,” Kulkarni said. The residents ensured cleanliness and proper hygiene on the society premises. “Frequent sanitization was carried out under the supervision and keen participation of Trupti Kolhakar, a society member. We ensured that people without masks were not allowed entry into the society. Social gatherings were limited too. The different orders being issued by the local authorities and the state government were constantly circulated among all the residents to keep them updated about the fresh guidelines,” Kulkarni said. More than 10km away, the residents of Surobhi Regency Cooperative Housing Society on BT Kawade Road saw only three-four cases of Covid-19 infection. “We were lucky to have many doctors living in the society, who helped in spreading awareness about the virus,” said chairman of the society Col Avinash Anand (retd). The society has a total of 61 flats. “Apart from organising weekly fruit and vegetable market on the society premises, the residents would take turns to provide food for the ailing families. As children were getting restless, we cleaned up a corner on the premises and converted it into a garden where children were encouraged to sow seeds of their choice and take care of the plants,” he said. An open gym was also set up on the society premises for fitness enthusiasts. Society secretary Ritu Bisht said, “With everyone working and studying from home, it was a stressful situation for many women. We conducted talks and yoga classes for them.” Considering the difficulty of senior citizens who were at a higher risk of contracting the infection, the management built a pathway around the campus for them to take walks without venturing outside. “I had some old tiles left over from a project, which I used to build the pathway,” said Madhu Nair, the vice-chairman of the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-keep-hope-alive-help-sick-homeless-in-trying-times/articleshow/86899906.cms||Joy Sengupta

Police said the accused — 30-year-old Avinash Chavan, a resident of Kehad Wadgaon in Mantha tehsil — had some petty differences with two women in his neighbourhood, including for defecating in the open space in front of his house. Citing information from local residents, the police said there often were heated arguments between Chavan and the women. The latest argument took place on Friday. The women then returned home and informed other male members of their family, who then went to Chavan’s house and got into another argument. Inspector Sanjay Deshmukh told TOI: “After the argument, the man decided to teach the neighbours a lesson. He allegedly wrapped his three-month-old daughter in a bedsheet and banged her against the ground.” The baby died instantly. Chavan raised an alarm claiming that the neighbours, who had been to his house, had killed the baby. A police team rushed to the village and took the baby to the hospital, where she was declared dead. The police then started the investigation, and while doing so, found gaps in Chavan’s story. He was detained early on Friday morning. Within no time, Chavan confessed to killing his daughter to frame the neighbours. The police have also found that Chavan was frustrated following the birth of a second daughter — he also has a three-year-old daughter. Based on his brother’s complaint, Chavan has been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/father-kills-baby-to-frame-neighbours-arrested/articleshow/86896346.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sessions court permits further probe into ‘cheating’ at co-perative bank||MUMBAI: A sessions court judge here upheld a magistrate’s order permitting further investigation into an alleged cheating and fraud case against the president and directors of Mumbai District Central Co-Operative Bank Ltd. Pravin Darekar, who in 2016 left MNS to join BJP and is an accused in the case, as chairperson of the bank. The magistrate “categorically mentioned’’ discrepancies in investigation, “pointing out gross financial irregularities’’ and “rightly rejected” a closure report filed by police, said additional sessions judge Dr A A Joglekar in a detailed order made available on Friday. The report mentions “cheating and financial loss to the bank’’ and is the reason the magistrate ordered a further probe, said the judge. The bank, Darekar and Purushottam Dalvi, vice-president of the bank and a co-accused, in the 2015 case probed by Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police, had filed separate revision applications, taking exception to a June 16, order of Esplanade court magistrate. The state through EOW, after investigation, filed a C summary closure report (done when a case is neither true nor false, or is of a civil nature, not criminal or complaint was filed due to mistaken facts). The FIR was lodged by Vivekanand Gupta, who the sessions court noted, had “conceded’’ to accepting closure, but businessman, Pankaj Kotecha protested before the magistrate and sought a further probe. His lawyer, Pradeep Havnur, said his complaint was not addressed by police despite being filed in 2014. Senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani for Dalvi said there were no financial irregularities. He said the magistrate failed to consider if Kotecha, who is neither a shareholder nor account holder in the bank, was a victim and had a right to be heard. In any case, his grievances “duly complied with’’. A M Chimalkar, counsel for Darekar, argued he was not bank chairperson for most of the period when the offence was allegedly committed, and on becoming chairperson, he took steps for recovery of bank dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sessions-court-permits-further-probe-into-cheating-at-co-op-bank/articleshow/86901873.cms||Swati Deshpande

Speaking at a programme ‘Export potential of agricultural produce and vegetables in Vidarbha’ organized by the Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APFPEDA) and Agrovision Foundation, Gadkari said that to boost horticulture in the region, the farmers need to market orange-citrus, lemon, custard apple and other fruits that are in a huge demand internationally. The minister said that the Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT) is also trying to export the oranges directly to the Bangladesh market in air-conditioned food containers from Sindi dry port in Wardha. “This facility will reduce the transportation cost of oranges and will benefit the farmers,” he said. Stressing providing good quality seedlings to the farmers, the city MP said, “Central Orange and Citrus Fruit Research Institute (CCRI) and Punjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV) should take the initiative in this regard. An agro convention centre of Rs150 crore has been proposed on PDKV’s 55 acres land on Amravati Road. The project would be expedited if APFPEDA and PDKV extend their help.” He also said that export value of honey and other forest products produced in the tribal areas of East Vidarbha and Melghat should be identified and a proposal should be submitted for their export. Pointing out that proper packaging and processing of shrimps available in plenty at various Malgujari lakes in Vidarbha would provide a lot of employment opportunities, he suggested APFPEDA to ink pact with private airlines to explore possibility of exporting agriculture products, since city has direct connectivity with Doha and Qatar. “There is a lot of scope for milk production and fishing in Vidarbha. Mother Dairy group is providing grants for projects to produce milk from 200 cows. There is a need to increase research in this regard,” Gadkari said and added that if there is an office of APFPEDA in Nagpur, it would go a long way in benefiting the farmers’ community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/market-products-abroad-for-better-prices-gadkari-tells-farmers/articleshow/86899889.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, told TOI, “The number of Covid-19 cases has dropped drastically at all medical facilities, many of which were converted into dedicated hospitals during the Covid-19 second wave peak as a stop-gap arrangement. Many of such hospitals have single entry and exit, and are standalone facilities. After the Covid-19 case numbers dropped, these hospitals stopped admissions and have started admitting non-Covid patients.” He said around 100-120 small private hospitals were earlier admitting Covid-19 patients. “Nearly 60-70 of them have now stopped taking in such patients in the last 15 days. These hospitals were not even getting Covid patients on a daily basis. Having said that, the hospitals can restart admissions for these patients whenever required,” Dr Patil said. Dr Manjusha Kulkarni, the secretary of the Association of Hospitals, Pune, told TOI, “The number of Covid-19 patients has come down drastically and most of them do not require hospitalization. Therefore, some private hospitals have stopped Covid admissions because municipal hospitals now have enough beds to treat such patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/50-small-private-hospitals-stop-new-covid-admissions/articleshow/86899948.cms||Neha Madaan

Around 700-odd of these students, it appears, continued studying in the same medium by shifting to government-aided schools. The directorate of education’s statistics for 2020-21 show a loss of 2,080 students in private English medium schools from Class I to X during the academic year as against the enrollment in 2019-20. The data shows a corresponding gain in the enrollment of aided schools by 723 students. It is worrying, however, that there is no record of the other 1,000-odd students who deregistered themselves from private schools from Class I to X. The government-run schools themselves show a decline in enrollment in 2020-21, indicating that state schools did not receive these students lost by private schools It appears that the inability to pay fees during the pandemic could be one reason for students leaving private schools. Some institutes have already been vocal about this, claiming a loss of numbers in 2020 due to parents being unable to afford fees. Private schools lost the biggest chunk of 1,156 students from Classes I to IV and 923 from Classes VIII to X. Only one student from Class V to VII shifted out, the data indicates. After English medium schools, Marathi medium institutes lost the biggest number, of around 850 students, followed by over 200 in Konkani medium schools. In the case of Marathi and Konkani medium, the enrollment has dipped across government, aided and private schools, showing that these students have fallen out of the mainstream education system. A majority of Marathi and Konkani medium students to leave were from government schools, possibly indicating the impact of the exodus of the migrant workers following the pandemic related lockdowns last year. Hindi and Telugu medium schools, which are government-run and which mainly cater to migrant children, also showed a dip in enrollment. In the case of Urdu, however, like English, data reflects a shift of enrollment from unaided to aided schools. Interestingly, Urdu is the only medium where students appear to have possibly left government schools to join aided ones during the pandemic year. The directorate of education data shows a loss in number of students in state-run Urdu schools with corresponding gain in enrollment in government-aided Urdu medium institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-pvt-eng-medium-schools-lost-2k-students-20-21/articleshow/86903384.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The collector of Nashik, who is the chairman of DMA, has issued orders to take strict measures to contain the spread of Covid cases in three talukas — Niphad, Sinnar and Yeola — which are witnessing the rise in active covid cases in Nashik district. “I have ordered the health authorities in the three talukas to carry out extensive contact tracing of covid positive persons. I have also asked the local authorities to close all institutions that frequently feature in contact tracing list,” said collector of Nashik Suraj Mandhare. The authority has also put the onus of testing people for visible symptoms like higher temperature, catching cold etc and maintaining register of the same, on the institutions and establishments that witness a large footfall. “Any person with symptoms found in these establishments should be referred to rapid antigen test (RAT) centre raised in the villages and failure of this would also call for action against the establishment,” collector added. The DMA also has asked the taluka officials to find out the hotspots in their areas. Arrangements should be made to carry out Covid tests of people visiting these areas and RAT centres should be established at these spots. The authorities have also been made responsible for ensuring effective implementation of containment zones. Since there were violations in home isolation leading to more cases, the administration has decided to disallow the facility for some time in these talukas and all people detected with Covid have to be compulsorily institutionally quarantined, Mandhare added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/shut-firms-with-repeat-covid-cases-mandhare/articleshow/86896380.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The data provided by the state health department revealed that there are 51 active mucormycosis cases in north Maharashtra at present — Nashik (23), followed by Nandurbar (14), Ahmednagar (13) and Jalgaon (1). As many as 1,345 cases of black fungus were reported in the five districts, with Nashik district alone having 763 cases, followed by 300 cases in Ahmednagar. Dhule had a total of 105 cases. The death toll due to the ailment in the region has been 142 — Nashik (82), followed by Jalgaon (30), Ahmednagar (24) and Dhule (6). Nandurbar did not have any deaths due to the disease. The state health department officials said that the situation related to mucormycosis in the district has vastly improved from what it was in May this year, when cases first came to the fore. mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, created havoc during the initial period of the second Covid wave in the region after some Covid-19 patients or those who recovered from Covid were found infected with the disease. The symptoms of mucormycosis include headache, fever, pain under eyes, nasal or sinus congestion and partial loss of vision. “By end of May, the five districts had 791 cases, with Nashik and Ahmednagar districts registering the highest number of 349 and 225 cases, respectively. As many as 60 deaths were reported in that month,” said health authorities. Dhule Covid-19 coordinator Dr Vishal Patil told TOI that Dhule was free of mucormycosis cases about a month ago. “With the second wave of the pandemic ebbing in Dhule, the district had few cases of mucormycosis cases in the last couple of months and in the last one month the Dhule did not report any fresh mucormycosis case,” added Dr Patil. State health officials said Jalgaon too would soon become mucormycosis free as it has just one active case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dhule-first-dist-in-n-maha-to-be-free-of-mucormycosis/articleshow/86896387.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Goa||Hotels packed to capacity as domestic tourists rush to Goa||PANAJI: Even as Goa witnesses a rush of domestic tourists since last month, the picture has been rosy for starred as well as smaller hotels, with most running at 80% occupancy. After the first wave of the pandemic last year, it was a matter of survival to them. On offer were attractive packages and discounts as the competition heightened, as everyone tried to grab the attention of domestic tourists who turned to Goa to unwind after six months of stress in the full first phase of the pandemic. Now, slowly, hotels are returning to the true element of the pre-Covid period, confident by the signs of buoyancy in the market. Vincent Ramos, area director, IHCL, and general manager, Taj Resort & Convention Centre, Goa, said they are doing extremely well with over 80% occupancy at most times. “Our is the strongest brand and occupancy at our properties has been extremely good, but we are conducting the operations by following Covid protocols,” said Ramos. Goa is also seeing a rise of high-end tourists, Ramos said, because with the restrictions on international travel, that segment is choosing Goa. Plus, with a majority of Goa’s population been vaccinated, it has added to the state’s profile. “With Goa’s population being 100% vaccinated with the first dose of vaccine and about 50% of the adult population fully vaccinated, the state has benefited,” Rajendra Menon, general manager, Zuri White Sands Goa Resorts & Casino, said. “Since we opened after the second wave, every month has been better than the previous one. In September, we had one of the highest occupancies of 83%, while in July and August, it was about 50%. The domestic market is travelling big time. Earlier, the occupancy was robust mostly on weekends, but now it is a quite good throughout the week,” Menon said. Many expect the bullish trend to continue for the entire season, and that the hospitality industry will be likely be bullish till the season ends. The season may even surpass its past gains as Goa stands to benefit as it is one of the most sought-after wedding destinations in the country. Guitry Velho, vice-president at Select Hotels Goa, (the Heritage Village Club), said that business has increased with the rise in domestic tourist arrivals. “We are still operating on a smaller inventory as our rooms are being renovated but on a lesser inventory our occupancy has been about 85% and it augurs well for the industry.” After four bad months, Velho said that although the tariff was very competitive in September, in October, due to the rise in the volume of arrivals, rates are witnessing an upward trend. This trend will continue in the winter months from November till February. The opening up of inbound tourism is very good news for the hospitality industry as well, he said Starred hotels may be able to command pre-Covid rates from November onwards. In fact, for the wedding segment, the rates may be 10-12 % more than the pre-Covid period. “We are looking at one of the best seasons, though people may term it as revenge tourism or whatever. We are not complacent in taking precautions because we do not want a repeat of the past,” said Menon. Velho said that though the tariff is still competitive, overall rates are picking up. “When hotels opened after the Covid break, they all offered attractive rates, but we expect rationalisation of tariff in October and November, and after that, we will see an upward trend,” he said. The mid-range hotels that largely catered to charter tourists, however, will have to wait for a while for business to pick up. Few have opened, and they are operating at around 25% occupancy. “For us, occupancy so far is about 20%. Low-end and high-end hotels are running at full capacity, but the mid-level segment is still feeling the hit of the pandemic,” said Tito Proenca, director, Marinha Dourada. The problem with mid-range hotels, Proenca said, is that over the past two decades, they only concentrated on charter tourism. “We did not build a good base with Indian clients. Opening of the charter market is really good news and hopefully, there will be no third wave,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hotels-packed-to-capacity-as-domestic-tourists-rush-to-goa/articleshow/86903386.cms||Bindiya Chari

According to the FIR, she and her husband Suresh had gone to sell scrap iron after leaving their six-year-old daughter and Varshan at home on September 29. On their return in the afternoon, they found their son down with diarrhoea and sick. The couple rushed the boy to a private hospital where he was given first aid. Later in the day, he was admitted to Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH). Since he failed to recover, Dhanabakiyam said they shifted the boy to ICHHC in Chennai on October 5. The boy’s health deteriorated and he died on Friday there. Acting on the complaint, police booked a case of suspicious death under section 174 of CrPC. A city-based paediatrician said that the boy may have consumed iron tablet in large numbers which could have caused diarrhoea. “Consumption of iron tablets meant for adults by children will cause diarrhoea but it can be treated. There are incidences of children consuming tablets for diabetic and hypertension patients. Such cases can also be saved,” paediatrician Dr V Gananavel said. He advised parents to keep medicines away from children as always cautioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/5-year-old-boy-dies-after-consuming-nutrient-tablets/articleshow/86901918.cms||---

Chairing a meeting to review functioning of the backward classes (BC) and extremely backward classes (EBC) welfare department, the CM also asked the officials to expedite construction of the Jannayak Karpoori Thakur hostels in the districts. The JKT hostels were allotted to the boys of the EBC category. “Altogether 27 JKT hostels are operational across the state. Buildings of two other hostels are ready, but yet to be made operational. Buildings of six other hostels are under construction,” an official of the BC & EBC welfare department told TOI, adding the department also runs 14 welfare hostels for the OBC boys. The CM also ordered immediate payment of the remaining amount of scholarship/stipend to the beneficiaries from the OBC category. Nitish said his government would soon start coaching and online class facilities for different competitive examinations in all the OBC welfare hostels, the JKT hostels, the SC/ST hostels and the minorities’ hostels. He asked the officials to make all necessary arrangements in these hotels to start coaching and online classes. “I have been informed that several boys and girls are getting benefits under the Chief Minister Civil Service Incentive Scheme. It is a matter of happiness,” the CM said. Students belonging to the SC, ST and EBC categories of Bihar are provided an incentive of Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh on cracking the BPSC preliminary test and the UPSC prelims, respectively, under the Chief Minister Civil Service Incentive Scheme. The incentive is provided to help the students from weaker sections in preparation of the main civil service examination and interview in a better way. BC and EBC eelfare department’s secretary Pankaj Kumar made a detailed presentation before the CM about the current status of different schemes run by the department.

Over the last 12 months alone, the state has not only completed 10 million square feet (sft) of green building footprint but also committed to add as much as 60 million sft —higher than most others including Tamil Nadu and Delhi – in the next few years. Of this 95% is in Hyderabad. The latest Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) data shows that 55 upcoming buildings, commercial and residential, have registered with the body between October 2020 and now to get a green certificate. These structures, as per the rulebook, have a range of environment-friendly features – are built with locally-sourced material, have fixtures for water conservation, are low on waste generation, high on energy efficiency, among others. This comes at a time when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report has sent alarm bells ringing the world over, with the UN terming it as ‘code red for humanity’. “While incorporating green standards have increased our cost of construction by 4% to 5% (approx.), it is a price that even the client (homebuyers and corporates) is willing to pay now for a healthier environment,” said Shyam Rao Jupally, managing director, My Home Constructions that has multiple IGBC-certified projects. Nationally too, India is making quick progress to multiply its green building count even as it plays catch-up with the rest of the world, experts say. In fact, Knight Frank’s recent report on green cities of the world featured six Indian cities, including Hyderabad, on the top 286. “The level of awareness in developing nations, such as ours, is still limited. But with climate change becoming a critical conversation in real estate circles, globally, we are seeing developers and buyers warming up to the idea,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist and national director (research), Knight Frank India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amid-code-red-green-bldgs-rise/articleshow/86900297.cms||---
---||Trichy||Ill-kept, British-era SWD fails to feed Trichy canal||TRICHY: Poor upkeep and inadequate spending on refurbishing the British-era stormwater drains that served as water feeders for the Uyyakondan canal passing through Trichy city continue to keep the historic Cantonment locality waterlogged after every rain. Urban planners say that mapping and reconstruction of the decades-old drains are the need of the hour to eliminate flood threats and ensure copious flow in the Chola-era canal while ensuring the rainwater is harvested. Comprising five civic body wards (number 44 to 48), the Cantonment locality of the erstwhile Trichinopoly district of British colonial rule has well-laid stormwater drains that collect runoff water from the wards and drain them into Uyyakondan near the district court. Although the localities were provided underground drainage in the late eighties, several properties continue to misuse the drains for discharging sullage and even sewage. The apathy of authorities and failure to strengthen the draining system have led to pollution of the canal. “There is a network of drains capable of collecting the surplus water to feed the canal. A proper survey using topography tools is needed, both to avoid inundation in Cantonment and prevent pollution in the Uyyakondan,” Vijayakumar Sengottuvelan, senior architect and urban planner in the city, said. With the drains not properly maintained over the years, waterlogging persists even in the district court, railway junction and central bus stand localities. The network of drains that served as feeders makes an interconnected link among Williams road, Major Saravanan road, Alexandria road, Warners road, McDonalds road, Heber road and Collector office road. The collected runoff water was intended to enter Uyyakondan near the MGR statue situated within half a kilometre radius. However, at multiple locations including on Major Saravanan road, the feeder network remains clogged and damaged, thus causing the inundation even for a mild rainfall. “Inundation makes it difficult to access the treasury office in the district court complex. The surplus rainwater can be routed to the Uyyakondan canal running behind the district court,” V Baskaran, a resident of Woraiyur, added. As the canal is recharging 36 water tanks, urban planners opined that strengthening the drain network will check pollution level in the 1,000-year-old canal and ensure constant water flow. Trichy corporation said that stormwater drain in only a portion of Benwells road will be revamped in the Cantonment locality. “Unfortunately, the smart cities mission project did not cover the Cantonment area. With the fund crunch prevailing, we are unable to renovate the existing drains immediately,” an official source with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/uyyakondans-ill-maintained-drains-of-british-era-inundate-cantonment/articleshow/86901955.cms||Deepak Karthik

The two were dragged out of their house and stabbed multiple times. Their throats were also slashed. The victims were identified as Shashi Thakur (35), a wholesale fruit trader, and his wife Sangeeta Devi (29). Sangeeta was in the fifth month of her pregnancy. The couple had two little sons who were inside the house when the incident occurred around 6am. Police said a dispute over 22-kattha ancestral land at Jarang Rampur village led to the twin murder. Shashi had filed a title suit in the court to claim his portion of the land. Three close relatives of Shashi, including his cousin Harinarayan Thakur (40), were injured as they were attacked with sharp-edged objects. Quoting locals, SHO of Vaishali police station Sanjay Kumar said it was Shashi who had first attacked his relatives. “He was then attacked by his cousins and nephews who eventually killed him and his wife by stabbing them multiple times and slashing their throats,” he said, adding Sangeeta’s mother, Ahilya Devi, has lodged an FIR against 17 family members of Shashi. The SHO said the bodies were dumped in a small plot near Harinarayan’s house. “Harinarayan’s son Sunny Thakur is the prime accused. He is evading arrest,” the SHO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaishali-couple-brutally-killed-over-land-row/articleshow/86898065.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Police later said the woman must have died five days ago. The incident happened in Sokkampatti village near Manapparai late on Friday night where police arrived based on an anonymous call that a rotten smell was emanating from the residence of B Mary, a retired teacher. Manapparai police inspector S Karunakaran said the woman’s unmarried daughters B Jayanthi, 43, and B Jacintha, 40, refused to let them in and locked the door from inside. Subsequently, police sought the help of the village administrative office (VAO) who in turn warned the women that they would break open the door if they did not open. “They maintained that their mother was alive and that her sacred soul will be hurt if we enter the house. Finally, they relented and we found the decomposed body of Mary inside the house,” Karunakaran told TOI. The police rushed the body to the government headquarters hospital in Manapparai. The post-mortem was performed on Saturday morning but for that police had to struggle to convince the daughters. “Even after bringing the body to GH, they argued with us that their mother was alive. They maintained the same even after conducting the post-mortem,” said the inspector. The police accompanied the daughters with the body which was later buried.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/2-women-pray-with-moms-body-for-5-days-to-resurrect-it/articleshow/86901939.cms||---

Raut said he had a meeting with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and it was decided to launch such actions in other states. “Maharashtra is the first state to have a bandh against the violence but there will soon be similar actions in other states. We want all to know that the public is not sleeping and farmers are not alone,” he said. Malik said the Centre wanted to crush farmers. “Even 10 months after the agitation on the Centre’s farm laws, the Centre doesn’t meet the farmers.

The civic body has planned to focus on these centres and the surrounding areas in the ensuing special vaccination programmes.Officials said that the data reflects a pattern of vaccination trend to an extent. Bhima Nagar UPHC that was utilised for all the mass vaccination camps has alone vaccinated 2.92 lakh people while the other 17 UPHCs altogether have vaccinated only 2 lakh people. Kamaraj Nagar near Trichy airport and Irudhayapuram near Palakkarai have vaccinated only 19% and 21% of the eligible population. Srirangam, EB Road, Thennur and E Pudur have also vaccinated less than 25% of the population. Whereas, Periyamilaguparai, Subramaniapuram, Gandhipuram and Woraiyur have vaccinated more than 35%. “Unvaccinated people are being identified through the electoral roll.

In September, 4.3 lakh passengers moved through Goa International Airport and the numbers are only going to rise in the coming months as Goa’s tourism season takes off. Arrivals and departures also hit a six-month high in September spurred by demand from fliers who have been cooped up for far too long because of the second wave of Covid. On Saturday itself, 66 flights landed at Goa International Airport bringing in 9,527 passengers to Goa. An equal number of flights departed, while 32 flights were cancelled, as per the Airports Authority of India data. “Passenger movement is picking up,” Goa airport director Gagan Malik said. The close to 70 daily flights into Goa from across India are packed. There are 23 flights from Mumbai, 13 flights from Delhi with several flights from Bengaluru and Hyderabad too, all of which have a high passenger load factor. According to the Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) data, in 2019-20, Goa International Airport handled 53,636 flights with 76.5 lakh domestic passengers and 7 lakh international passengers. According to an industry study, in 2019, the domestic tourists arriving in Goa accounted for approximately 71 lakh, while the foreign tourist arrivals stood at 9 lakh. The year 2020 was largely washed out due to the pandemic, which has seen two waves in the state. The state-wide curfew and the Covid-19 testing curbs restricted travellers for a few months, but ever since Goa relaxed the rules, there has been a steady influx of domestic travellers. With international travel restricted, many people who opt for foreign holidays have turned to Goa for their break. In mid-September, chief minister Pramod Sawant officially announced that the state is ready to welcome tourists back to its beaches, historic sites and clubs. The state government also received permission from the Union ministries of home affairs and external affairs for international charter flights to land from mid-November. “As of now no applications for landing slots have been received. It will take time for charter operators to identify slots, arrange the aircraft, market the flights, find the proper crew all of which will take a fortnight,” Malik said. With Goa’s Covid-19 numbers “under control”, Sawant said that he expects the “tourist season for Goa will be good” this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/travellers-take-to-skies-to-get-to-goas-beaches/articleshow/86903396.cms||Newton Sequeira

Police arrested a 37-year-old woman from Pattukottai town for kidnapping the infant to deceive her partner and amass his wealth pretending that the baby was their child.Police identified the baby’s parents as Gunasekaran, 24, a resident of Burma Colony, and his wife G Rajalakshmi, 22. Nine months pregnant when admitted to the government hospital on October 5, Rajalakshmi delivered the baby the same day. On Friday, a woman under the pretext of helping the young mother made away with the four-day-old baby when she went to the restroom. She carried the infant in a big shopper bag. Based on the complaint lodged by the parents, police analysed CCTV footage in the hospital and other establishments nearby. The woman was seen buying diapers from a shop where she had given her mobile number while billing. Within hours the special team tracked her down and identified her as Viji. Divorced a couple of times earlier, she was said to have married one Balamurugan. Police said Viji had pretended to be pregnant by stuffing things on her stomach for the past few months. Meanwhile, she hatched a plan to kidnap a just-born baby from the government hospital to claim it as her own. Police rescued the baby and admitted her to Pattukottai hospital for a brief while. Later, it was handed over to the parents by superintendent of police G Ravali Priya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cops-rescue-abducted-baby-from-woman/articleshow/86901982.cms||---
---||Mumbai||As expected, Narayan Rane and Maharashtra CM spar at Chipi airport event||MUMBAI: A war over credit for the new airport developed at Chipi in Sindhudurg district broke out between chief minister Uddhav Thackeray of the Shiv Sena and union minister Narayan Rane of the BJP on the inauguration stage on Saturday. Rane, who spoke first, listed out the work he had done for the coastal district since the 1990s. “Infrastructure in the district is due to Narayan Rane, no one can come close to it. When Sunil Prabhu and I had come to do bhoomipujan of the airport project in 2009, there were many who were protesting against it. These were the same people who stall road projects and stand in front of contractors every month and some of those people are sitting on stage together,” Rane said. He also went back to his days in the Shiv Sena and spoke about the qualities of Thackeray’s father. “Balasaheb Thackeray sent me to Sindhudurg in the 90s. Saheb did not like people who lied,” he said. It was for the first time that Rane and Thackeray shared the stage after the former chief minister’s arrest in August following comments against the incumbent chief minister. Thackeray, when it was his turn to speak, took a jibe at Rane saying that the people of Konkan knew who had done what and that is why they had stood by the Shiv Sena for so many years. “Sindhudurg fort was built by [Chhatrapti Shivaji] Maharaj, but someone here will say he built it. And yes, Balasaheb did not like people who lied and so he had thrown out many such people,” Thackeray said. Thackeray said that while it was an important day for the development of the Konkan, some people had a habit of politicising every issue. “Just like we put a black tikka to ward off evil during auspicious occasions, there are some people who say such things,” the chief minister said. The inauguration event was attended virtually by union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scidia. During his address, Rane said development projects had been stalled. “What developmental are they talking about? Where is the development? All the dam works are stalled. Even this airport doesn’t have electricity and water and the road, too, hasn’t been completed,” he said. Since Rane’s exit from the Shiv Sena in 2005, for which he has always blamed Thackeray, the two have been at loggerheads. Thackeray said the development and growth of Konkan will be accomplished under the current government. “You [Rane] are a minister. So what if it is micro and small? It is an important portfolio and we hope you will use it to benefit Maharashtra,” he said. A total of 934 hectares of land was acquired for the Chipi airport project, which hopes to put the different Konkan districts on the world map of tourism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-as-expected-rane-and-cm-spar-at-chipi-airport-event/articleshow/86902042.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Goa||Diploma courses may replace vocational: Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: CM Pramod Sawant on Saturday said that the state government intends to do away with vocational stream at higher secondary level and instead introduce a three-year diploma course after the Class X. “Vocational courses are being run at higher secondary level like fashion designing, hospitality management, but we want to add one more year to the same course and make it a three-year diploma course and this is under consideration. Before the next academic year, we will give permission to start this course with the existing manpower and infrastructure,” he said. Sawant said that students will benefit from such a course and the state government will also be able to have more skilled manpower in Goa. The chief minister said that since an international airport is coming up at Mopa in Pernem taluka, this skilled manpower is very important. “XII vocational certificate is not useful for employment and that is the reason we want to introduce this course,” he said. CM: New educational policy from next yearSawant said the committees formed by the state government to look at implementation of the new education policy have submitted their reports and the new education policy will be implemented next year. He said that to encourage students to join technical education, the state has started a new scheme and the fees have been reduced by 50% for students joining technical education in private and government colleges. The chief minister said that graduation level fees have been reduced by 50%. He also said coding and robotics will be introduced from Class VI and training for master trainers has already started. “I always look at the future of the students and we want to produce technocrats in the next 25 years,” he said. Sawant said that the intention of passing the private university bill was to make different courses available for students after Class XII, graduation and postgraduation. He said the state government wants a skill development university and designing university to start. He further said that the state government has given approval to three private universities to start in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/diploma-courses-may-replace-vocational-cm/articleshow/86903419.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Pune||Covid-19: Rajesh Tope to request ICMR to reduce gap between two doses of Covishield||Pune: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday told TOI that the state would be reaching out to the Indian Council of Medical Research next week seeking reduction in the interval between two doses of Covishield vaccine, against the backdrop of fewer eligible beneficiaries for the second shot than the stock because of the 84-day gap. “The Centre did make an exception for those travelling abroad and reduced the gap between doses of Covishield. We want the same because we are keen on fully vaccinating the maximum eligible population at the earliest,” Tope said. On Friday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had also said the state would request the Centre to reduce the gap between the two doses of Covishield. “Considering the availability of vaccines now, the interval can be reduced. But it is up to the central government to decide as they had decided on the gap based on the efficacy study,” he had said. The state government desperately wants the gap between two Covishield shots to be reduced following an assured supply of 2 crore vaccines in October. Of it, a total of 1 crore doses have reached Maharashtra. Tope said many districts were getting adequate vaccine supply but were not seeing enough beneficiaries because of the long gap between two Covishield doses. The issue assumes significance considering that Maharashtra is in the process of unlocking. Complete Covid-19 vaccination is compulsory for the residents for reaping its maximum benefits. N Ramaswami, the commissioner of the National Health Mission, said 57 lakh beneficiaries were due for the Covishield second dose and 14 lakh for the Covaxin second shot in the state, as on Saturday. “Reducing the gap will definitely help speed up the vaccination drive but it is a central government policy and instructions have to be issued by the Centre,” he said. The state’s target beneficiaries above 18 years of age is 9.14 crore. “Of them, a total of 28% (2.59 crore) people have been completely vaccinated and nearly 65% (6 crore) have been administered the first dose. “We plan to vaccinate 10-12 lakh beneficiaries daily to speed up the vaccination,” Tope said. Ramaswami said, “The Centre has assured us that there would be enough supply of vaccines in future also and there won’t be any shortage.” He said the dose distribution process was dynamic. “If a district gets more supply and has less beneficiaries at a given time, the extra doses are given to other districts,” Ramaswami said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-to-request-icmr-to-reduce-gap-between-two-doses-of-covishield/articleshow/86900067.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Woman sets self, her two children ablaze in Rajkot||RAJKOT: In a tragic incident, a 28-year-old woman allegedly set herself and her two sons ablaze at Nakravadi village near Rajkot on Saturday morning. Police said that the woman took the extreme step following a tiff with her mother-in-law. According to police, Daya Dedaniya, a resident of Nakravadi village, had an argument with her mother-in-law over cooking food on Friday evening. The quarrelling continued on Saturday morning after Daya’s husband Vijay left for work. After some time, Daya took her two sons — seven-year-old Mohit and four-year-old Dhaval — inside a room. Daya poured kerosene over the two and herself before setting them ablaze. Alerted by the smoke coming out of the room, the family members and neighbours broke open the door. But it was too late by then as they saw badly burnt bodies of the three. The 108 ambulance staff that rushed to the spot declared the three dead and informed the police control room. Assistant commissioner of police (north) S R Tandel said that the husband of the deceased woman was questioned following the incident. “The primary interrogation reveals that there was no argument between the husband and the wife. But Daya had a tiff with her mother-in-law a day before the incident. Looking to the crime scene we believe it’s a case suicide. We will register an FIR if the deceased’s family comes forward,” Tandel said. The police have registered an offence of murder against the deceased woman. According to police, Daya and Vijay were married for nine years. Daya’s parents live in a nearby village while Vijay works as a labourer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/woman-sets-self-her-two-children-ablaze/articleshow/86900102.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Residents feel cheated, say they got only Rs 600 per acre||MUMBAI: Amid the high-profile inauguration of Chipi airport on Saturday, there were allegations by activists that locals who gave their land to the project received only Rs 600 per acre as compensation. In a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray, the Bhoomi Bachao Kriti Samiti alleged that locals received just Rs 15 per guntha (Rs 600 per acre) for 272 hectares of land acquired by the MIDC in 2006-7. The land was then leased by the MIDC to a private entity to develop the airport at Rs 8,000 per guntha. And 34 acres of additional land was acquired from villagers at Rs 25,000 per guntha after they went to court in 2010, the body alleged. “We demand fair compensation, a share of the developed land as per MIDC law, and declaration of our status as project-affected people,” said Chandravandan Alve, president, Bhoomi Bachao Kriti Samiti. The Janata Dal’s Prabhakar said the government had given Rs 1.5 crore per acre to acquire land for the Mumbai-Goa highway and even larger sums for the Mumbai-Nagpur expressway. “The Chipi compensation is a cruel joke,” he said. The samiti handed over its letter to Sindhudurg guardian minister Uday Samant. Samant told the media: “We will organise a meeting in 15 days between locals and the MIDC or the airport development authority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-residents-feel-cheated-say-they-got-only-rs-600-per-acre/articleshow/86902062.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Pune||Pune: Stones pelted at civic body workers, cops||PUNE: The Airport police arrested a man, booked three men and five women on the charge of pelting stones at the Pune Municipal Corporation workers and police personnel over demolishing an illegal construction at Kalvad Vasti in Lohegaon on Friday afternoon. The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) junior engineer Faruk Patel registered a first information report (FIR) with the Airport police for rioting and preventing the civic body and police personnel from discharging their respective duties under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. Patel told TOI, “An illegal building, comprising ground and first floor, was constructed on a 3,500sqft land without leaving space for the side margin. The suspects, staying on a neighbouring plot, opposed the demolition claiming that they had legal possession of the land. However, they could not furnish documents in support of their contention.” Patel said the legal owners of the property had previously filed numerous complaints with the civic body to demolish the illegal structure constructed by unauthorized persons. “We had served a notice giving time to illegal occupants to demolish the property, but in vain. We then took a call and demolished the building on Friday,” he said. “As the demolition work started, the suspects opposed the municipal workers, but they were evicted by the police. In a bid to halt the demolition, the suspects pelted the driver of an earthmover and others with stones, he said.” He added that no one was injured. Senior inspector Bharat Jadhav on Saturday said the suspects abused and charged at the Pune Municipal Corporation workers and police personnel and pelted them with stones for demolishing the building. “We have arrested one man and served notices to five women asking them to join the police in investigations. Three more men are on the run. We are working on some clues and arrest them as soon as possible. Further investigation is under way,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stones-pelted-at-civic-body-workers-cops/articleshow/86900112.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Skill sets can be developed with practice: Mahatme||Nagpur: Apart from knowledge, students and institutions should focus on improving skills and attitude for holistic progress in any field, underlined Rajya Sabha MP Vikas Mahatme. He was speaking at a webinar held on Friday to commemorate the 12th foundation day of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) Nagpur Regional Centre. The session was on ‘Online learning experiences of IGNOU Nagpur, tribal, rural and urban students during Covid19’. Mahatme said, “Skill sets can be developed with practice. In order to work efficiently in a team, one must possess a positive attitude. Our thinking and how we manage emotions is crucial for decision-making in teamwork.” He added, “It is important to carry out an assessment of these skills and the appropriate attitude on an institution-level.” Speaking about academic challenges faced by students in remote areas, Mahatme said, “People are eager to pursue education but accessibility is a huge obstacle.” He urged people to make the most of IGNOU’s distance and open education courses. Students enrolled in various courses shared their learning experiences during the lockdown. Senior citizen Purushottam Shukla from Nagpur, who is studying psychology, said, “I joined this course as I was interested to know more about the subject. The assignments helped me improve my handwriting and thinking and I understood that I was able to grasp the concepts. The age-factor never became an impediment to my learning. The only drawback of online training during the pandemic was that there was no in-person contact with the teachers.” Dhananjay Bhute, a civil engineer from Amravati who completed several courses, said, “The university smoothly sailed through the transition to online classes during the lockdown. All the doubts of students were cleared during lectures. I was able to utilise the knowledge I obtained from these courses in the technical industry.” Gondia resident Komal Bajaj, “Teachers have taken extraordinary steps to shape our learning during the lockdown. The regional centre is always available to resolve our issues. The authorities never refuse help.” Postgraduate diploma in journalism student from Nagpur, Juveriya Khan, Gondia citizen Milind Rangari and Seema Rathore from Hingoli gave an insight into their training as well. Regional director P Sivaswaroop was present. Assistant regional director K Brumot conducted the programme while CH Rajgure proposed a vote of thanks.

---||Mumbai||For BMC polls, Sanjay Raut says Shiv Sena will go it alone||MUMBAI: Despite the success of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in the recent rural local body polls, the Shiv Sena is set to go it alone in the BMC election. The party, which has ruled the BMC for over two decades, is preparing to fight over 200 seats and expand the party base in Mumbai. The party has set a target of at least 100 seats out of 227 in the BMC.  Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the party would go solo in the BMC polls to expand its base in Mumbai. Raut said the view of the Sena was that the party should expand. “That’s why the Sena is fighting alone. We are preparing to get over 100 seats. We are a big party and will have a majority in the BMC. The next mayor will be from the Sena. We even fought the last BMC polls on our own,” he said. In the recent rural local body polls, the Shiv Sena was in fourth position even though the MVA collectively performed better than the BJP. Sena strategists have said that instead of a formal alliance, the party may have an “understanding” with the Congress in key areas to defeat the BJP. A Sena functionary said that it would be difficult to make room for the Congress in an alliance since the Sena has for decades contested over 200 seats in the 227-member BMC. “The Congress has a strong presence in many pockets and will not accede to less than 80-100 seats. It won’t be possible for us to give seats to both Congress and NCP. If we do that and end up contesting only 150 seats, then we won’t be able to come close to the halfway mark of 114,” the functionary said. Last week, the MVA trumped the BJP in the bypolls to 85 seats in six zilla parishads. The MVA won 46 seats, over twice the BJP’s tally of 22, though the latter was the single-largest party. The BJP had a setback in its bastion, Nagpur, home to union minister Nitin Gadkari and former CM Devendra Fadnavis, and lost a seat while the Congress won the most seats. The functionary said the party can have an understanding in 40-50 seats. “We have to ensure that the Congress wins at least 50 seats, only then will there be a big gap between the Sena and BJP. Usually parties have a 50% strike rate in BMC polls, so we have to fight at least 200 seats and the Congress will have to fight at least 100 seats. We can have an understanding in slum pockets and minority seats where the Congress has a base and support,” the functionary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-for-bmc-polls-raut-says-sena-will-go-it-alone/articleshow/86902094.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

It is sad to see so many dead fish, while the authorities have not done enough to stop this on time,”said a local resident. Environmentalist D Stalin who is also a member of the Bombay high court appointed wetlands protection panel, said the food put in the water tank cause depletion of oxygen, leading to critically low levels of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) for the resident fish, leading to their deaths. “This can be averted if the BMC officials put up bold notices and warning signboards at Banganga about this issue,” he said. Last year the fish at Banganga had survived during Pitrupaksha due to the strict lockdown, which did not allow many citizens to venture outside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hundreds-of-fish-dead-at-banganga-due-to-pollution/articleshow/86902140.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Delhi||Coal shortage may cause blackout, Delhi govt warns; CM Arvind Kejriwal writes to PM Narendra Modi||NEW DELHI: Power minister Satyendar Jain has warned of a blackout in Delhi after two days if coal supplies to the coal-fired power plants do not improve immediately. Delhi and other parts of the country are on the brink of a power crisis as coal supplies to the power plants are dwindling, says the Delhi government. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi on Saturday, seeking his personal intervention to solve the crisis at the earliest so that a blackout can be averted. “The whole country is facing a coal crisis due to which power plants are not able to function properly,” said Jain on Saturday, after attending an emergency meeting for reviewing the power situation in the capital. “All the power plants that supply electricity to Delhi are supposed to keep 30-day reserve stocks of coal but at present have only one day of stocks left. The power plants are not able to produce the required amount of electricity. Even the hydroelectric power plants are not running at full capacity. If they are run at full capacity at least during peak hours, it will be a huge relief.” The chief minister is keeping a watch on the situation and the Aam Aadmi Party government says it is trying its best to avoid a crisis. The coal shortage situation has prevailed for the past three months and has affected power generation at the major central plants that supply power to the capital, Kejriwal said in the letter. Jain said the crisis appears to be man-made because neither the coal-fired power plants, nor the gas-based ones are getting supplies despite the country having three-and-a-half times higher coal production capacity as compared to the demand. “There is politics. If you create a crisis and solve it, it appears that some great work has been done. On Friday, the gas supply to the Bawana power plant was suddenly stopped by the Centre,” Jain said. Delhi produces very little power and purchases most of it from power plants located outside the capital. “Most of the power is procured from the central government’s NTPC, where coal reserves have to be kept for at least one month. That has come down to a day. We appeal to the Centre to arrange railway wagons and transport coal to these power plants at the earliest and ensure that coal reserves of at least one month are maintained. Along with this, all the power plants of the country should be run at 100 per cent capacity. Delhi may face a blackout if the supplies are not resumed at the earliest,” Jain said. The minister pointed out that there are three power plants in Delhi and the Delhi government will ensure that they produce the amount of electricity that they can, irrespective of the rate. The Delhi government is trying to fulfil the city’s needs by purchasing power by any means and at any rate. NTPC is providing only half of its committed supply to the Delhi government, the minister said. He added that the Delhi government was procuring electricity on the spot at exorbitant rates to avert a crisis. Because of this situation, “the dependency on gas stations supplying power to Delhi increases. However, the gas plants…do not have adequate APM gas to run at full capacity,” said the CM, adding that if this situation continued, it would severely impact the power supply situation in Delhi. Kejriwal has asked for the PM’s intervention to resolve the crisis at the earliest, requesting that adequate coal supplies may be diverted from other plants to plants like Dadri-II and Jhajjar TPS, which are supplying to the capital. APM gas may be allocated to plants like Bawana, Pragati—I and GTPS supplying power to Delhi and adequate quantity of NAPM gas be supplied to power stations in Delhi. The maximum rate of power sold in any slot through the exchange, currently at Rs 20 per unit, may be suitably capped to discourage profiteering by traders/generators from the current crisis, the CM has requested. “The above measures are essential to maintain uninterrupted power in Delhi which is catering to strategic and important installations of national importance apart from supplying power to essential services like the cold chains for the vaccination drives, hospitals, health care centres, Covid care centres etc,” Kejriwal stated. “Kindly issue necessary instructions to the concerned ministries and offices for addressing the above suggested steps in resolving the current crisis at the earliest but also take steps to avoid such a situation in future,” Kejriwal said in his letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/coal-shortage-may-cause-blackoutdelhi-govt-warns-cm-writes-to-pm/articleshow/86900121.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Pune||Pune: Property registrations on the rise ahead of Dasara||PUNE: The state registrations department on Saturday said it was witnessing an uptick in property registrations in the days leading to Dasara. Officials said they expected the numbers to increase in the coming week and said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the real estate sector appeared to be on the wane. In the first week of October, daily registrations slowly increased from four digits to five digits. “On October 4, we had 8,936 registrations; there has been a continuous rise in registrations from October 5. On October 6, there were 16,407 registrations. This increased to 24,113 on October 6. On Friday, we had 36,080 registrations,” October 6. September too had witnessed high-value property registrations that helped the department rake in revenue higher than pre-pandemic levels. Nearly 1,8 lakh properties were registered last month, generating Rs2,655 crore. The same period in 2019 saw 1.91 lakh registrations and Rs1,977 crore in revenue. Hardikar said they would take a call on keeping offices open on Dasara, a Friday, based on demand. State Credai president Sunil Furde said the market sentiment was positive. “We are receiving positive feedback from all our members. The festivities will herald further growth,” he said. Credai national vice-president Shantilal Kataria said the state’s initiative to start e-registrations too will help the sector further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/property-registrations-on-the-rise-ahead-of-dasara/articleshow/86900131.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Hubballi||Schools reopen, but not many autos to ferry kids||Hubballi: Schools have started, albeit for select classes, from the first week of September. Those studying in classes 6 and above are attending offline classes. But vehicles ferrying them to school and back, like autorickshaws and vans, are yet to resume their services fully.As trnasport service providers are getting only a few students, they are charging additional fare from parents. With many parents preferring online classes for their wards, the service providers are going slow in scaling up. Autorickshaw drivers say full-fledged services may start once the government allows on-campus classes for even younger schoolchildren.Fakiresh Kundagol, an autorickshaw driver, said he used to pick up and drop students from MR Sakhare, Surabhi and Kendriya Vidyanalaya No. 1 before the pandemic struck. “As children studing up to Class 5 still have online classes, we have not resumed our services fully. Since we cannot break even in such a situation, we charge double the amount to ferry students studying higher classes. Both parents and service providers are helpless. We cannot help due to a steep rise in fuel prices,” he rued.Vinayak Kalaburagi, a van driver, said he used to charge each student Rs 700 to ferry him/ her from Gokul Road to Vidyanagar earlier. “As only 3-4 students are opting van service now, I’m collecting Rs 1,500. Despite incurring loss, I’m offering service for fear of losing students. I will reduce it to Rs 1,000 once lower primary classes start,” he added.Sudhir Kakade, a parent, said the charges have increased from pre-pandemic times’ Rs 600 to Rs 1,500 now. “The pandemic has hit our income hard. We hope the fare will be normalised after offline classes for lower classes resume,” he said.Shekharayya Mathapati, president of Hubballi Autorickshaw Owners’ and Drivers’ Association, said he used to ferry over 60 students during pre-Covid times. The driver with 26 years of experience said: “Now it’s hardly 15 students. As the school hours for Class 10 students are different from that of Class 6 students, we do multiple trips. Also, many drivers are now into agriculture, petty shop business and other odd jobs. They will come to driving once schools resume completely. We will soon hold a meeting with auto drivers to reduce fare and bail out parents,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/schools-reopen-but-not-many-autos-to-ferry-kids/articleshow/86898182.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man beaten up, robbed after landing from Qatar||NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old man, who flew back to Delhi from Qatar, was thrashed, robbed and held hostage by a group of men inside a shop near RK Ashram Metro station. Cops have registered a case in this regard. According to police, the incident was reported on Friday when Rakesh Kumar flew back to Delhi around 2am. “I was outside IGI airport searching for a cab for New Delhi Railway Station as I have to travel home to Gonda (Uttar Pradesh) by train,” Kumar told the cops. Outside the airport, a taxi driver approached Kumar asking him where he wanted to go. “I told him that I had to reach New Delhi Railway Station. The driver asked me to pay Rs 500 and both of us agreed,” the complainant said. During the cab journey, the driver asked Kumar where he wanted to travel from the railway station. “The cabbie said that he can get me a train ticket as he knew someone who worked at a tours and travel shop,” the complainant told police. At the tours and travel shop, Kumar was infromed that his train ticket to Gonda would cost Rs 1,000 and that he would get the ticket later that evening. After paying for the railway ticket, Kumar left with the cab driver, who dropped him off to a hotel near New Delhi Railway Station. Later that evening, when the complainant visited the shop for his ticket, one of the five men at the shop told him that he had to pay 960 riyals, as his ticket had been booked using his passport number. The accused men claimed that any person who lived in another country had to pay the ticket price in foreign currency, and in case they denied paying the money, they would be sent to jail for two months. When Rakesh denied paying the money, the accused thrashed him and stole the 1,000 Riyal (Rs 20,000) he had in his possession. Cops have filed a case sections 365, 395, 120 B and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and are probing the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-beaten-up-robbed-after-landing-from-qatar/articleshow/86900175.cms||Abhay Singh

The PPS is known to follow Hindutva ideology and has a close association with the BJP. The leaders of the outfit, without naming any political party, said that the PPS supported parties following Hindutva ideologies, however, local leaders of these parties have gone soft on these ideals to remain in power. Swapnik Naik, a PPS leader, said, “The PPS has always raised its voice to protect the rights of citizens in the city. In the forthcoming elections, we will have our own representatives who will fight elections as independent candidates with the full support of the PPS.” He said, “The PPS will bring about overall development of the city.

---||Delhi||Centre has refused nod to ration scheme: AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Saturday said that the Centre has once again blocked the AAP government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme despite the Delhi high court’s nod. The Centre has written a letter to the Delhi government saying that it will not allow it to go ahead with the scheme on the ground that it goes against National Food Security Act guidelines. The letter came after Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers’ Sangh made a representation to the lieutenant governor against the scheme, claimed Bharadwaj. “The BJP has lost all sense and morality and gone against a high court order that permitted the Kejriwal government to implement the doorstep delivery of ration scheme,” said Bharadwaj in a statement. “This scheme is not just a regular ambitious scheme that the government wants to implement. It is a gamechanger which has been supported by thousands of families. These families are eagerly waiting for this scheme to be implemented so they can get out of the shackles of the ration mafia, but BJP does not want that. It will totally stop ration theft and the arbitrary attitude of ration dealers.” Commenting on Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers’ Sangh, Bharadwaj said: “These are the same people who had gone to court against the Kejriwal government and witnessed the court give the green signal to the scheme. It is astonishing that the BJP is working at the behest of a group of ration dealers and is even willing to go against the court for them. This points towards a clear nexus between the BJP and the ration mafia.” He said the Centre had voiced no objection in court but in the letter they have said that the AAP government scheme goes against National Food Security Act (NFSA) guidelines. “First, if the Centre thought so, why did it not say the same in court? Second, the high court had clarified that the ration delivery scheme does not go against the NFSA guidelines. All of this has been fuelled by BJP’s political malice,” said Bharadwaj. In the latest letter, the union ministry of food, consumer affairs and public distribution has told the department of food and civil supplies of the Delhi government that while distributing food grains among the eligible NFSA beneficiaries under the public distribution system, it has to comply with the norms and provisions of NFSA Act 2013. It has also said that the department will not have any objection if the state government draws up a separate plan without adding the elements of NFSA food grains. The letter says that the proposal under consideration with the Delhi government for home delivery does not meet the norms of NFSA and hence the Government of India would not allow it. “It is noteworthy that the high court refused to accept these submissions,” Bharadwaj said. In the wake of the HC order, CM Arvind Kejriwal had recently sent the file of the scheme to LG for approval. Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers’ Sangh president Shiv Kumar Garg said the association does not have any political affiliation. “We are only bothered about the livelihoods of 2000 ration dealers. The AAP government is unable to supply ration to the existing 2000 fair price shops. The ration for the two ongoing schemes should have been delivered to the fair price shops by October 1, but till now the ration for October has not been delivered. When the government is unable to provide ration to the 2000 dealers, then how can it provide ration to 17 lakh ration card holders,” asked Garg. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the AAP leader was making baseless allegations and added that neither the Centre nor BJP has any objection if the AAP government purchases ration and distributes it under the doorstep delivery scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-has-refused-nod-toration-scheme-bharadwaj/articleshow/86900155.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Lucknow||SC asks ICERT to aid probe in La Mart student’s death||Lucknow: The Supreme Court has directed the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (ICERT) of the Union ministry of electronics and information technology to help the special investigation team (SIT) in investigation into the alleged murder of Class 9 student, Rahul Sridhar, in 2015. Rahul (15), a student of the La Martiniere Boys College, had fallen to death from the 60-feet tall Constantia building on the school campus on April 10, 2015. Disposing of the case, the apex court issued the directives on a petition filed in 2017 by Rahul’s brother, Rohit Sridhar, who informed the police that Rahul was in touch with one ‘Larry Conners’ through the internet and investigators have not been able to trace him. He said ‘Larry Conners’ might have a role in Rahul’s death. “We are not averse to issuing a direction to the SIT to find out Larry Conners. If some information is forthcoming in that direction, the SIT would pursue that as there is no other aspect on which we can issue any other directions to the SIT,” the order said. “The SIT would endeavour to conclude this aspect as early as possible. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team under the ministry of electronics and information technology will render whatever assistance is required,” the order added. The petitioner had raised several objections to the probe conducted by the SIT, which was formed on the directions of the SC in 2019. Following the objections, the court issued an order on November 2, 2020 regarding the constitution of another SIT to conduct a fresh probe. The counsel for the victim, Alok Singh, told TOI that Rahul was being misguided by a person, ‘Larry Conners’, as it appears from virtual chats on Facebook. “He was not acting on his own volitions but was under influence,” he said, adding that Lucknow police got details from Facebook, including email IDs and IP addresses, but did not act on the details and the investigation met a dead end. A week after his death in 2015, his parents filed a murder case against unidentified persons. However, in its final report submitted to the trial court, police termed Rahul’s death a suicide. In February 2016, the family challenged the report in the court of the chief judicial magistrate who ordered a reinvestigation. Next year, the family moved the high court and sought a CBI probe but HC directed the police to conclude investigations. The family was forced to knock on the doors of the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sc-asks-icert-to-aid-probe-in-la-mart-students-death/articleshow/86903453.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Broken manholes, pothole-riddled roads trouble citizens||Pune: Uneven and broken manhole covers, pothole-riddled roads, incomplete footpaths, old electric poles and increasing mosquito menace have posed problems for 21 societies in the Panchavati area. Residents said hardly any corporator visited Panchavati, a secluded area, despite repeated complaints. A broken wall near the Panchavati hill area has become a cause for concern as residents said it was used by unruly people to go up and down the hill at night. Anjali Kshirsagar from Khagol society said the footpath work has become an annual event now. “Every year, corporators say so many lakhs have been sanctioned for the footpath work. The work starts in January and ends after some stretch has been cemented. To date, the work has not been completed. The same is the case with the main road, too. Besides, it was decided that the garden waste from within Panchavati would only be dumped on the foothills of the Panchavati hills, we see trucks coming in from other places, too. This is not pure garden waste, but also has plastic and other things in it which is not good,” said Kshirsagar. Madhav Awate, chairman, Panchavati Utkarsh Seva Sanstha, said there was neglect from the elected members towards Panchavati. “The road leading to the State Bank has very deep-set manhole covers, making the road dangerously uneven. There is a drain cover which is broken. It can cause accidents. We have already submitted a letter to the PMC asking them to evict hawkers occupying the footpath at the entrance of Panchavati on Pashan Road,” said Awate. Rameshwar Giri, secretary, Vrindavan Society C, said the compound wall of the Panchavati hill was broken, which has prompted random people to use the way to trespass the hill at odd hours. “It needs to be repaired soon to avoid any nuisance in future. The PMC also needs to fumigate the place as mosquito menace has increased in the area,” said Giri. A senior Pune Municipal Corporation official said they would visit the area to take stock of the situation and complete the repair work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/broken-manholes-uneven-roads-trouble-citizens/articleshow/86900163.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Delhi||Delhi: Kashmiri Pandits rue eviction from home||NEW DELHI: Members of the Kashmiri Pandit community gathered at Jantar Mantar on Saturday to hold a protest against the recent targeted killings of minorities by terrorists in the Valley. One of the protesters, Rakesh Mantu (32), was holding a placard that read “Where is my home?” “I was a resident of Srinagar. When I was studying in Class 7, I was forced to leave my native place due to violence in the Valley. I have never visited my birthplace since then, as there is no security for Kashmiri Pandits there,” he added. Others present there to protest the targeted killings echoed the same sentiment. They held placards and raised slogans against the killings of civilians by the terrorists. A placard held by another protester read, “One demand one voice our homeland”. The recent incidents have triggered fear among the minority community members and may lead to their exodus from the Valley, the protesters said. Rajeev Kaul, a protester said, anti-social elements don’t like a peaceful society. “In 1990, I left my hometown, which was in downtown Kashmir to save myself,” he added. Pran Kishan Raina, who was standing next to Kaul, said he was pained by the recent incidents in Kashmir and was fearful of going to his hometown. People from different age-groups were present at the spot. Many of them were wearing t-shirts on which it was written “Aakhir Kab Tak” (For how long). 68-year-old MK Kaul, another protester, claimed that in 1989, he left Tral with his family and went to Jammu. Later in 1998, he came to Delhi. “I don’t want to go back out of fear. I can’t take risks in my life now, as I have a family,” he said. The protesters also demanded recognition of “minority genocide” and a designated place for settlement of Kashmiri Pandits in Kashmir. Around 5.45 pm, the protesters started a candle march from Jantar Mantar to Janpath. Traffic snarls were reported on the route during the march. Police also marched with them to avoid any untoward incident. DCP (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said there was no permission for the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kashmiri-pandits-rue-eviction-from-home/articleshow/86900231.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Amritsar||Above normal temperature factor too fuelled power crisis in Punjab||BATHINDA: The higher than normal temperature in October has aggravated the power situation in Punjab, already facing acute shortage of coal. These days the average temperature in the afternoon is hovering at 35-36 degrees Celsius compared to 33-34 degrees Celsius, a rise of nearly 2 degrees. This has led to a surge in power demand of 8600-9000 MW in Punjab. The lockdown last year had considerably cut the power consumption and the anticipated third wave in September-October, of which there are no signs as yet, have upset the calculations of the authorities. Mismanagement is also being seen as a reason for the grim situation, said an official of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). The pan-India coal shortage has spurred demand from the central pool as more states are buying electricity, and this has pushed up rates of power in the central pool. Punjab, which is purchasing up to 1500 MW power, has to pay even up to Rs15 for a unit, a PSPCL official said. Apart from the overall coal shortage, the impact of climate change also has a serious impact on the situation. Climate activist Gurpreet Singh Chandbhaja said relying more on fossil fuels, which leads to more carbon emissions is playing its part. The sooner we turn towards cleaner sources and reduce emissions the better, or we will have to keep on facing such grim situations. The power demand has always remained high during these months in many states, but the situation in Punjab has remained comfortable and the state used to sell power at lucrative rates. However, this time the apparent miscalculation has resulted in the state having to purchase power at higher rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/above-normal-temp-factor-too-fuelled-power-crisis/articleshow/86902143.cms||Neel Kamal

Metropolitan Magistrate Dev Saroha directed the investigating officer to take all necessary steps to ensure the presence of the convict before the court on November 15. The former employee was convicted on September 16, 2020 under Section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of IPC. The court had asked him to physically appear before it to pass the order on sentence. Counsel for the convict had stated that he be allowed more exemption on the ground of travel restrictions due to Covid and his medical condition. The court noted that he had produced medical documents stating that the convict has been advised not to travel through air at least for next six months. It further noted that the investigating officer has filed a report stating that the passenger flights are being operated between Sri Lanka and India according to Bubble Agreement and any person having valid travel authorisation/documents may travel to India through these flights. “Details of flights operated/proposed to be operated by each airline in the months of September and October 2021 are also filed along with the report. Thus, argument of the counsel for convict that there are no flights between India and Sri Lanka cannot be accepted,” it said in the order. The court further said that despite repeated adjournments since the conviction in 2020, done through videoconferencing due to Covid-19, his counsel has not filed even a single document to prove that the convict has even once tried to get the visa. “This misleading interpretation of the provisions of Bubble Agreement between India and Sri Lanka and no attempt by the convict to apply for Visa shows the intention of convict to not to appear before this court,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nbw-against-airlines-ex-regional-manager-in-staffer-harassment-case/articleshow/86900220.cms||Usha Das

He was, however, discharged late at night and sent back to Mathura jail. Rahman was taken to the AIIMS two weeks after a special court in Lucknow asked the Mathura district jail to ensure "proper treatment". A PhD scholar at Meerut's Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Rahman was arrested last year with Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan and two others while on their way to Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district to meet the gang-rape victim’s family. They were charged with sedition and slapped with the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Later, the enforcement directorate began probing money laundering charges against them. Rahman’s father-in-law, Sakhawat Khan, who was also at AIIMS, told TOI that doctors have advised a surgery, as his condition is "critical" and an estimate of Rs 2 lakh along with 10 units of blood has been given by them. The doctors have asked him to visit the hospital after a week. Confirming this, jail superintendent (Mathura) Brijesh Kumar, said that he has received the estimate and the doctors have asked for follow up after a week. “We will send the estimated demand to the government for approval and will follow up with the AIIMS,” he added. Rahman was being taken to the special court of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for a hearing on September 22 when he fell ill. He was sent to a community health centre, from where he was shifted to the district hospital in Agra and then to SN Medical College. The doctors there referred him to a higher centre — Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) in Lucknow or AIIMS in Delhi. But, authorities took him back to jail. Later, the jail authorities approved his checkup at the AIIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hathras-case-phd-scholar-needs-surgery-say-doctors-at-aiims-delhi/articleshow/86896669.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Nagpur||Few takers for paid jabs as NMC offers free vax to corporates too||Nagpur: Not just the common man but corporate houses are also now banking on the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s vaccine stockpile for getting their staff vaccinated. This has, however, not gone well with private hospitals as a majority of beneficiaries are now preferring the free vaccine over paid jabs. In June, when the drive was extended beyond public vaccination centres, big private hospitals were flooded with corporate enquiries amid shortage of doses. Once the supply got steady, even well to do people preferred vaccination at public centres instead of the paid jabs. NMC officials said several banks, government and private offices are approaching the civic body with vaccination queries. As on date, just over 5% vaccination has been done by private hospitals in the city. Currently, around 10 private hospitals are running the programme. On Tuesday, only 323 jabs were given at these hospitals. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said even those who can afford a paid jab have started queueing up at NMC’s free vaccine centres. “The income tax office alone got 600 to 700 staff and their relatives vaccinated through one of our centres. Availability of doses, good ambience and hygienic conditions at the vaccination centres are attracting people from all backgrounds. Even the school rooms being utilized for the programme have been properly cleaned to ensure people are comfortable during the process,” he said. Regarding corporate camps, Joshi said the civic body held two camps for an IT company recently. “A couple of more big units in IT Park were also covered. The camps are not exclusive for the companies, but open to all in the vicinity. We utilize their space to inoculate employees as well as those from nearby organisations or residents,” said Joshi. Vidarbha Hospitals Association convener Dr Anup Marar admitted that Covid vaccination pace in private hospitals has reduced considerably even with the capped rate norms in place. “This is mainly due to the fact that NMC is accepting the requests of even corporate houses and companies for free vaccination drive in their establishments. This goes against the Centre’s policy to have 75% free vaccination at government centres for economically weaker sections and 25% paid jabs in private centres for those who can afford it,” he said. Dr Marar added, “No private hospital would have contemplated to purchase vaccine and join this drive if they had been made aware of the fact that NMC would be entertaining on-site free vaccination camp requests of industries. Authorities should now have a vaccine buyback policy to prevent wastage.” Box ‘Anyone can approach NMC for free vaccination’ Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi has appealed to the citizens, public and private establishments to approach the NMC in case they wish to hold vaccination camp. “Interested people from civil society, private organisations and government offices can approach chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar, immunization officer Dr Gowardhan Navkhare or myself if a sizeable number of beneficiaries wish to take the jab. The vaccination would be free of cost, but private organizations will have to provide space to conduct the drive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/few-takers-for-paid-jabs-as-nmc-offers-free-vax-to-corporates-too/articleshow/86895047.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Chandigarh||Pratibha living in palaces, does not know life of soldier: BJP leader hits back||Shimla: Congress candidate for Mandi Lok Sabha seat Pratibha Singh’s reminder to BJP candidate Khushal Thakur that “it is not a battlefield but a political arena” elicited a response from Himachal BJP in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna on Saturday. Khanna said Pratibha had been born in palaces and living there, so she did not know the challenges of a soldier. He said those who led a life of convenience found everything as easy as a field, whereas soldiers stayed away from home and family, and faced icy mountains and scorching deserts. Khanna said the job of soldiers was to face challenges all the time. “Pratibha Singh should tell why she had left the field due to the fear of defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and today she is talking about the political arena,” he added. He said BJP had fielded a soldier from Mandi, which the Congress candidate was not able to face. He said Brigadier Khushal Thakur had earlier protected the country while in the Army, and now he would serve the people by winning Mandi parliamentary seat. He asked Pratibha why she did not intend to roam among the public when she was an MP in the past. “Today, when they feel that their path can be made easier by gaining sympathy, they are contesting elections; it will not be possible,” he said. He said the public had given Pratibha two chances in the past. He said she had been elected MP twice, but after winning the elections she failed to look after the people of constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pratibha-living-in-palaces-does-not-know-life-of-soldier-bjp-leader-hits-back/articleshow/86902227.cms||---

Diesel was hiked by Rs34/litre in one-and-a-half years. Petrol was hiked here to an all-time high of Rs109.83/litre. Since January, diesel rates in Mumbai have risen by Rs20/litre as retailers passed on the impact of rising crude price and a weakening rupee. The hike was around Rs3 in the last 10 days alone. The price of diesel in Jaipur is Rs101.94, followed by Hyderabad (Rs100.89), Bhubaneswar (Rs100.85), Mumbai (Rs100.29), Chennai (Rs97.03), Kolkata (Rs95.58) and New Delhi (Rs92.47) on Saturday. The price of petrol and diesel in Thane and Navi Mumbai was Rs109.97 and Rs100.42. Transporters fear diesel going over Rs100 will impact the economy, and will lead to a rise in cost of transportation and prices of essentials, like vegetables and fruits. Small transporters are on the verge of shutting shop across the state, associations said. A transporter said, “We have an urgent meeting of transporters on Monday. All will depend on the deliberations/views of members. Although we may not go on any strike, we will request the government to undertake corrective measures like reduction in fuel prices.” He added, “If we are pushed to the wall, freight could be revised if fuel hikes remain unchecked. It will be the only viable option before the industry.” Bal Malkit Singh of All-India Motor Transport Congress said Navratri and Diwali will be in the dark if diesel, petrol and LPG cylinder prices keep increasing. “The brazen hikes in diesel price is a mockery of poor and middle class of India, who are the main taxpayers in the country,” he said. The rush at petrol and diesel pumps continued on Saturday despite the hikes, said a member of the Petrol Dealers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-diesel-price-now-over-rs-100/litre-a-hike-of-rs-34/litre-in-1-5-years/articleshow/86904815.cms||Somit Sen

Meanwhile, videos of the incident went viral in which the woman was being pulled by hair, abused, slapped and hit with chappal. However, police, which booked some unidentified persons, claimed the injuries to the woman were not serious. “Since she did not suffer serious injuries, a non-cognizable offence has been registered. We will now start arresting the assailants,” said a police officer.  Investigation so far revealed that the woman, a resident of Bilimora town in Navsari district, had gone to Pariya with her 19-year-old son on a motorcycle. She was moving door-to-door asking for Navratri alms while her son waited at a distance. “In the afternoon, locals started inquiring out of suspicion as to why she is moving around in the area. Soon a group of people gathered and someone alleged that she was trying to kidnap a child,” said police.  Villagers then called the police and handed her over to the cops. She described the torture at the police station.

---||Mumbai||Pandemic forced lakhs to seek mental health support in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The Covid-19 pandemic and its effect on mental health led a record number of people—3.5 lakh—to seek counselling and treatment from the public health system in Maharashtra in 2020-21. In Mumbai, another 80,000 people have called up BMC-Mpower helpline for Covid-related grief since April 2020. “In 2020, we counselled many migrants who were leaving the state due to Covid and we also held special OPD counselling clinics, resulting in a higher outreach,” said Dr Sadhana Tayade, state deputy director of health services. The growth in state services can be judged from the fact that only 1.3 lakh reached out to the state district mental health network in 2016-17. In 2021 so far, 1.19 lakh have been helped. “These numbers don’t include the patients with chronic diseases under treatment at state government hospitals for long,” said a state official. Activists said the pandemic has demonstrated the need to upgrade mental health services within the public health system. “Covid has disrupted lives. An online support group for those in grief caused by Covid has seen steady members for the last few months,” said psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty, who is partnering with NGO Mpower for the initiative. The group has parents, siblings and colleagues who lost someone to Covid. “People attending the support group meetings want solace and support. While face-to-face counselling is the best, under the circumstances we have been able to help people support each other through grief,” said Dr Sapna Bangur of Mpower. In Mumbai, where 16,000-plus have died due to Covid, the BMC-Mpower helpline has seen maximum calls from people in the 18 to 40 age group. “Millennials were the most impacted, as most callers (53%) were between 26 and 40 years,” said an official. On the occasion of World Mental Health Day on Sunday, WHO has asked countries to strengthen services to meet the increased need. “Majority of people living with mental health problems in low-and middle-income countries do not get adequate treatment,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director WHO South-East Asia region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pandemic-forced-lakhs-to-seek-mental-health-support-in-maharashtra/articleshow/86902307.cms||---

---||Surat||Surat: AAP leader faces wrath over water supply||SURAT: After winning 27 seats in Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has staged multiple protests over civic issues in the city. But in a sort of role reversal, a councillor of AAP, despite being the opposition party, had to face the anger of people of her area. A group of women from the residential society where Payal Sakariya lives arrived at her home and broke earthen pots in protest. The women were protesting over the short supply of water by the SMC in the society for the past three months. Meanwhile, Sakariya claimed that she too joined the protest, and the locals were not protesting against her. The women gathered outside Sakariya’s home on Saturday morning and shouted slogans for restoration of water supply. They later broke the pots at Sakariya’s home. Later, the group went to the entry gate of the society and continued with the protest. “The protest was against the councillor and also the SMC. We are not getting even basic facilities despite Sakariya being from our society. We are not getting enough water for the past three months and despite multiple representations no one is solving the problem,” said Shailesh Dhanani, president of Narayan Nagar Society. “I too joined the protest and it was not against me. Some people from opposition parties are spreading misinformation,” Sakariya told TOI. The society has 525 homes and faces many civic issues such as erratic water supply, drainage problems and bad roads. “Our councillor got elected earlier this month but still we are facing the same issues. We expect our councillors to solve people’s problems on a priority basis. The roads in our area are in pathetic condition,” said Dhanani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/aap-leader-faces-wrath-over-water-supply/articleshow/86900375.cms||---

The staff took this decision on Friday after discussing the matter with the chairperson and chief officer. Chief officer Manoj Khorgaonkar told TOI that the council is currently facing a financial crunch and they are unable to pay the staff salaries of four months. After discussing the matter with the chairperson, Khorgaonkar told the agitating staff that they will find a solution to pay the salaries within seven days. Council supervisor Luis Santan Fernandes said that his family is going through difficult times, as he finds it tough to even feed his family due to non-payment of wages. Situation of Khushali Salgaonkar, a labourer, is even worse. “I come from a remote place, I do not have money to fill petrol in my scooter to join duty. How many more months will we work without payment?” Salgaonkar said. The chief officer said that shopkeepers occupying municipal shops had refused to pay rent for the last five years and their arrears are over Rs 50 lakh. “I will send them a notice on Monday to pay all the arrears within 15 days. The council will seal the shops if they fail to pay before the deadline ends,” he said. Shopkeepers had earlier requested the council to waive off the interest on arrears and accordingly the council had taken a resolution. The resolution has been sent to the director of municipal administration for approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sanguem-civic-staffers-warn-of-hunger-stir/articleshow/86902309.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Must bring law to accord national honour to Ram, Krishna, says Allahabad HC judge||PRAYAGRAJ/AGRA: A judge of the Allahabad high court on Friday said that “Parliament must bring law to pay ‘rashtriya samman’ (national honour) to Lord Ram, Lord Krishna, Ramayan and its author Valmiki besides Gita and its author Maharishi Ved Vyas, as they are the culture and heritage of the country”. The court added that the Constitution allows one to be atheist, but it does not mean that one can pass obscene remarks against gods and goddesses. These observations were made by Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav while allowing bail application of one Akash Jatav of Hathras, who is accused of sharing objectionable images of Hindu deities on social media.  Jatav was arrested on January 4. Last month, Justice Yadav had hit headlines when he had said that the government should bring a bill in Parliament to give fundamental rights to cows and to declare it the national animal. While denying bail to a man accused of cow slaughter, Justice Yadav in his 12-page order had also said that “scientists believe cow is the only animal that inhales and exhales oxygen". In his bail order on Friday, Justice Yadav also said that there is a need to educate children on this issue. This, he added, can only be done by making it a compulsory subject in all the schools of the country and educating the children about Indian culture. The judge allowed the bail application, considering the plea of the applicant that he was in jail for the last 10 months. The trial in his case was yet to commence and there was no chance that trial would conclude in near future. On the allegations against the applicant, the judge said that there are many countries in the world where there is a provision of harsh punishment for such conduct, but in India there is provision of lesser punishment in comparison to many countries. Elaborating its stand, Justice Yadav it its 12-page judgment delivered in Hindi further said that “recently, the apex court has given its decision in the Ram Janmabhoomi case in favour of the people who believe in the Lord Ram, who is the soul and culture of India and India is incomplete without Lord Ram”. Besides, the judge said that one should respect the deities and culture of the country in which he or she lives, instead of making obscene remarks on such issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/must-bring-law-to-accord-natl-honour-to-ram-krishna-judge/articleshow/86903486.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Citizens told TOI that they have no problem with maintenance work, but were angry at being left in the dark with the department not declaring any shutdown in the area. “When we called the electricity department staff and the 1912 helpline, they were unable to tell us when power supply would be restored. How are we supposed to work effectively like this? No shutdown was declared by the department. We were without power for almost four hours in the morning and then again for two hours in the evening,” a resident of Church Colony Azossim told TOI. The assistant executive engineer, Bambolim sub-station, said that “there was no major issue” in the area, and that “old lines are being renovated”. “We were stringing those lines which were loose. There was no breakdown,” he told TOI.  “We cannot declare shutdown as it was not major work that was carried out on the whole transformer. It was work carried out in small patches, not along the full stretch,” he added. He also said the department “didn’t expect” the work to carry on for so long, and said the department would issue a shutdown notice in future for such work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/azossim-locals-fume-after-unannounced-power-cut/articleshow/86902355.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Lucknow||Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan lauds UP CM Yogi Adityanath for good governance||LUCKNOW: Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan praised the Yogi Adityanath government for its good governance and taking ‘reformist’ steps to ensure quality education to all in the state. Pradhan, who was in Lucknow on Saturday to review the functioning of education departments, praised the state government for initiating the implementation of the New Education Policy (NEP) in letter and spirit. “UP has around 18% of all students in the country. Close to 5 crore students are studying in UP which is more than the population of few countries,” said Pradhan, who is BJP’s UP election in-charge. “UP has a reformist government. If there is good governance in Uttar Pradesh, if we properly implement anything here and present a good model, it will be easy to replicate it in different parts of the country in an effective manner,” Pradhan said. The Union minister also commended the UP government’s decision to construct roads in villages in the names of meritorious students. “The Gaurav Path, the name decided by the UP government, is truly an encouragement for rural students,” Pradhan said. Making NCERT books accessible to secondary students has been another good step of the government, he added. “The government has provided quality NCERT books keeping in mind the UP curriculum. These books are available at low cost, so, no student is deprived of good learning material,” added Pradhan. Pradhan also praised the UP government for bringing the Fee Regulation Act. “This has helped the middle class afford quality education. It’s a progressive step which was even appreciated by the judiciary. It is a model for other states too,” he said. There have been qualitative improvements too as the dropout rate has declined in UP. I can see this government working towards creating synergy between academics and imparting skills for employability. The state’s efforts in encouraging girls to take NCC is also commendable,” Pradhan said. UP has set benchmarks in quality development and PM’s Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme is being implemented by Yogi government efficiently, with education being its core, he said. On being asked a question on the Lakhimpur incident, Pradhan said, “I am here till tomorrow. We will talk about it. Let’s discuss departmental work here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pradhan-lauds-yogi-for-good-governance/articleshow/86903494.cms||---

Acting on a complaint filed by alert locals and activists, Goa Police personnel arrived on site and took some of the workers to the Panaji police station for inquiry. The blatant destruction, in an eco-sensitive buffer zone, is supposedly to create access to a new resort that was recently inaugurated. Former Panaji mayors Surendra Furtado and Uday Madkaikar said that Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate has a vested interest in the project and is driving the destruction of the trees and sand dunes. Locals have threatened to approach the court to stop the destruction. “How can someone simply destroy trees and sand dunes without permission? Trees have been directly cut just to build a road. We have already seen how fields in Taleigao were destroyed and now it hurts to see these trees and the beach being destroyed,” said Madkaikar. Joe Martins, a resident, claimed that he had filed a complaint with the Corporation of the City of Panaji and Greater Panaji Planning and Development Authority (GPPDA) and even sought copies of the permissions through RTI. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/trees-cut-dunes-levelled-at-caranzalem/articleshow/86902380.cms||---

Police said a large police force had to be deployed around the temple as tension prevailed in the area after the discovery of priest Kripal Singh’s body. Confirming the arrest of one Razzak, 45, for the murder, Udai Shankar Singh, Etah SSP, said preliminary investigation revealed that the two men were friends and often shared meals. On Friday, Razzak and the priest were having dinner together, when they got into an argument. An enraged Razzak took an axe lying nearby and allegedly killed Singh. He was under the influence of drugs at that time. Villagers said Razzak, father of three children, is a quack who treated people for dental problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/drug-addict-hacks-to-death-priest/articleshow/86896894.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Hyderabad||Mental care still inaccessible for many||Hyderabad: Treatment for mental health still remains inaccessible for many due to various reasons. Right from not having the means to afford treatment, to not being able to identify and get required support, overlooking of symptoms or confusing them with old age. For 25-year-old Sushma (name changed on request) a sudden depressive disorder led her to a psychiatrist’s desk. After months of extreme mood swings and staying alone during the pandemic, she was unable to continue with day-to-day activities. “The psychiatrist recommended me to take two weeks off from work but my seniors brushed it off saying that ‘we all have depression.’ What’s worse is even after a year, whenever I want to take up a lead role, I am reminded of the episode citing it as a weakness,” she said. “Contrary to the mental health promotions that corporate companies do, a lot of corporate employees express their disappointment about not getting the right kind of support and acceptance when they tell their colleagues or higher officials about their mental health issues. Mental health is seen differently as compared to a physical illness,” said Dr Virinchi Sharma, consultant psychiatrist and director at Manasa Hospital. The fact that mental health problems may manifest differently in older adults as compared to younger adults, makes treatment inaccessible for this category. “We need to watch out for those initial signs and not dismiss them as a normal part of ageing,” said Dr Jayashree Dasgupta, project director and co-founder, Samvedna Senior Care. Mental health inequalities causes harm to people, families and communities, stress experts. “Asking for help is the first step, and it is often the hardest part. Coming to terms with treatment can be very difficult, but in order to find the right tools to help live with psychological disorders, one must first find acceptance,” explained Dr Johnsey Thomas, mental well-being consultant, Aster Prime Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mental-care-still-inaccessible-for-many/articleshow/86901704.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Amid Code Red, Green Bldgs Rise||Hyderabad: A late entrant to the ‘green’ party, Telangana is fast picking up pace now to grab a seat at the toppers table. Over the last 12 months alone, the state has not only completed 10 million square feet (sft) of green building footprint but also committed to add as much as 60 million sft —higher than most others including Tamil Nadu and Delhi – in the next few years. Of this 95% is in Hyderabad. The latest Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) data shows that 55 upcoming buildings, commercial and residential, have registered with the body between October 2020 and now to get a green certificate.These structures, as per the rulebook, have a range of environment-friendly features – are built with locally-sourced material, have fixtures for water conservation, are low on waste generation, high on energy efficiency, among others. This comes at a time when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report has sent alarm bells ringing the world over, with the UN terming it as 'code red for humanity'. “While incorporating green standards have increased our cost of construction by 4% to 5% (approx.), it is a price that even the client (homebuyers and corporates) is willing to pay now for a healthier environment,” said Shyam Rao Jupally, managing director, My Home Constructions that has multiple IGBC-certified projects. Nationally too, India is making quick progress to multiply its green building count even as it plays catch-up with the rest of the world, experts say. In fact, Knight Frank’s recent report on green cities of the world featured six Indian cities, including Hyderabad, on the top 286. “The level of awareness in developing nations, such as ours, is still limited. But with climate change becoming a critical conversation in real estate circles, globally, we are seeing developers and buyers warming up to the idea,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist and national director (research), Knight Frank India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amid-code-red-green-bldgs-rise/articleshow/86901913.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Dehradun||SC issues notice to Centre on petition seeking audit of Covid-19 hospitalisation bills; judges say ‘issue concerns wide strata of society, merits serious attention'||Nainital: Acting on a petition filed by Dehradun resident Abhinav Thapar, arguing that there was no uniform policy on claiming refund of expenses incurred due to hospitalisation for treatment of Covid patients, the Supreme Court (SC) on Friday issued a notice to the ministry of health and family welfare. Giving the Centre four weeks to respond, the bench of Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice BV Nagarathna observed that the issue involved in the petition “concerns a wide strata of society consisting of patients and their relatives who have been overcharged during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the issue which has been raised, would merit serious attention”. The petitioner had argued that during the pandemic, many people were admitted to private hospitals due to lack of a proper public healthcare system. They were handed exorbitant bills, which plunged them into poverty in the absence of any policy or guidelines for the refund of bills charged by hospitals, the petitioner alleged. He further said that health insurance companies, too, did not have any guidelines regarding reimbursement, forcing patients to exhaust their health insurance limit. The petition goes on to say that though cases of overcharging have been reported from across the country, a few state governments, local bodies and a handful of courts have acted on the issue and directed the refund of money but most states are yet to devise a mechanism for audit and refund. The petition cited an example of Pune municipal corporation, which directed a private hospital to refund the extra money it charged a Covid patient. “The insurance regulatory authority has also failed to discharge its duty in keeping a check on the exploitation of Covid patients having health insurance and there is no guideline with respect to charge of medical bills and expenses overcharged by private hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients,” the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-petition-seeking-audit-of-covid-19-hospitalisation-bills-judges-say-issue-concerns-wide-strata-of-society-merits-serious-attention/articleshow/86896937.cms||Prashant Jha

The searches began on Wednesday and documents seized revealed forged and bogus billings, tax evasion and money laundering by the group, sources said. The company was into manufacturing Covid treatment drugs and exported its medicines to the US, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Some of the drugs which were in very short supply during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic in April-May are also manufactured by the company and exported. “During the search, several bank lockers have been found. The searches have resulted in seizure of unexplained cash amounting to Rs 142.87 crore so far.” “The unaccounted income unearthed is estimated to be in the range of about Rs 550 crore till now,” said the IT department. An official statement from the department said: “Hideouts were identified where a second set of books of accounts and cash were found. Incriminating evidence in the form of digital media, pen drives, documents have been seized.” Officials said evidence collected during raids pointed to “purchases made from bogus and non-existent entities and artificial inflation of certain heads of expenditure”. The I-T department also claimed that illegal cash generated from tax evasion was used for purchase of land and other assets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/i-t-raids-on-hyd-pharma-co-yield-rs-140-crore-cash/articleshow/86902464.cms||---
---||Kolkata||EIMPA plea to CM for full occupancy in halls||Kolkata: After some states allowed cent percent occupancy in theatres, the Eastern India Motion Pictures Association has appealed to the chief minister to allow the same here during the Pujas. Even with 50% occupancy, five Bengali movies are releasing in cinemas on Panchami (Sunday). Some single screens, including Basusree and Minar, that were shut for renovation are reopening soon. In his letter to the CM, the chairman of EIMPA’s exhibitors' section, Ratan Saha, pointed out that the governments of Rajasthan, Karnataka, Telengana and Uttar Pradesh have allowed cinemas to operate with 100% occupancy. Saha’s letter has urged her to take a “suitable decision” and allow cinemas to operate with full capacity once the festival begins. Five Bengali movies – Dev’s ‘Golondaaj’, Jeet-Mimi’s ‘Baazi’, Chiranjit-Saswata-Arunima’s ‘Shororipu 2: Jotugriho’, Ankush-Bonny-Ritabhari’s ‘F.I.R NO: 339/07/06’ and Parambrata-Koel’s ‘Bonny’ – will be releasing on Sunday. Soumitra Chatterjee’s ‘Phire Dekha’ released this Friday. Though the fear of the third wave still remains, exhibitors are hoping this content will draw more viewers to theatres. Navina will have three shows of ‘Golondaaj’ and one of ‘No Time To Die’ from Sunday. Basusree’s Debjiban Basu told TOI he had kept his cinema shut for maintenance from September 24. “This is to ensure all the machines were well-oiled before releasing ‘F.I.R NO: 339/07/06’ and ‘Baazi’ on Sunday.” Minar’s owner Suranjan Paul told TOI that its renovation is almost over. “Every attempt is being made to reopen during this festive week,” Paul said. Though the audience turnout has been better in 2021 than in 2020, exhibitors have struggled to survive. Indira, which had opened its doors in 1948 with ‘Sadharan Meye’, started screening new Punjabi movies for the night show before the run-up to the Pujas. “Since Bhowanipore has a sizable Punjabi population, this audience turnout is better than the figures for matinee and noon shows where Bengali films release. Sometimes, people drop in half an hour before the screening to catch up with others in the community. This strategy can work for those cinemas which have such locational advantage,” said Indira’s owner Rajendra Bagadia. The week before Pujas saw Indira screening two shows of the Punjabi release, ‘Hausla Rakh’. “During Pujas, we can’t give shows to the film since we have three shows of ‘Golondaaj’ and one of ‘Bonny’,” Bagaria added. Once Pujas are over, he will resume the trend of screening Punjabi movies. Priya is located close to the Lake Market area that has a decent South Indian population. “For Pujas, we are screening ‘Shororipu 2: Jotugriho’ and ‘Bonny’. Screening of Tamil and Telugu movies is an option we will explore to tap into the South-Indian cine-going crowd in and around Priya’s locality,” said Arijit Dutta of Priya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/eimpa-plea-to-cm-for-full-occupancy-in-halls/articleshow/86900570.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

After visiting Lucknow to attend ‘Azadi@75 — New Urban India: Transforming Urban Landscape’ conference-cum-expo on October 5, the PM is likely to pay two more visits to the state this month. While the PM will visit Kushinagar on October 20 to inaugurate an international airport, he may also visit his parliamentary constituency, Varanasi, on October 25. Sources in the government said the PM’s programme was being chalked out, adding that the schedule for the first visit was almost final. According to officials, the Kushinagar international airport would give a boost to tourism, especially Buddhist tourism, as Kushinagar is the place where Lord Buddha breathed his last. Several Buddhist temples and guest houses have been built around the main temple, also known as Mahaparinirvaan Sthal. The first flight to the international airport is likely to arrive from Sri Lanka, which has a huge population of Buddhists. The first flight is likely to carry the President of Sri Lanka, other delegates and Buddhist pilgrims, a senior government official said. During his Kushinagar visit, the PM is likely to lay the foundation stone of a medical college. On October 25, the PM is likely to launch an all-India scheme related to health infrastructure from Varanasi. The details of the programmes were still being finalised. Sources said the PM’s focus on the state would continue even after October as several projects would be ready for inauguration or foundation laying. Some of these projects include Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway and several medical colleges. Besides the PM, Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and other senior leaders are also likely to visit the state before the notification for the assembly elections is issued, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/focus-on-up-modi-likely-to-visit-kashi-kushinagar-this-mth/articleshow/86903520.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Dr BK Sharma, honorary consultant at the RST Regional Hospital told that Nagpur is second in Maharashtra after Mumbai where the highest age-adjusted rates (AAR) are recorded per one lakh population. “108 out of one lakh men and 116 out of one lakh women are detected with some or the other cancer in Mumbai every year. Nagpur follows with 91 men and 90 women per one lakh population. Even Pune is behind Nagpur at 83, Aurangabad at 70, and Osmanabad below 40,” said Dr Sharma. In childhood cancer, Nagpur is at more risk. “Among boys, Mumbai has high childhood cancer rate in 0-14 age group (107.1) and 0-19 age group (108.6). Among girls, Mumbai had a high incidence rate (73.7) in the 0-14 age group. In Nagpur, the highest incidence rate (85.4) is in the 0-19 age group. One out of 10 men and one out of 11 women in Nagpur is at risk of cancer.

Ashish had skipped summons by the SIT on Friday, after which a second notice had been issued asking him to appear. “He has been arrested for not cooperating with the investigation and giving evasive answers,” DIG Upendra Agarwal, who is heading the SIT, said on Saturday night. Around 10.30am, Ashish entered the Lakhimpur Kheri crime branch office by the backdoor, escorted by over 10 cops. He was accompanied by two lawyers, Avdhesh Kumar Singh and Jitendra Singh. Ashish had been asked to appear at 11am in the second notice put up outside his house on Friday. “My client has come with video evidence to show he wasn’t there (the site of the killings) that day,” his counsel Singh said in the morning. They also reportedly presented 12 affidavits of people saying Ashish was not at the Banbirpur violence site that day. As internet services were suspended again, police from neighbouring districts had been called to Lakhimpur Kheri and SSB jawans were deployed. BJP workers from across the district converged at the party office in Lakhimpur city. Security around the district jail and the collectorate was suddenly stepped up in the evening. When asked if it was preparation for arrest, ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar had earlier in the evening told TOI that he “didn’t know”. He added, “Local police have taken their own decision to maintain law and order.” A senior official from the administration, however, said the security was in place to prepare for both scenarios. “Whether he is arrested or not, we are ready for both. We have ensured required security to maintain law and order. The decision on his arrest rests with the SIT,” the official told TOI. Around 11pm, Ashish was finally arrested. Police were preparing to take him before a remand magistrate at the time of filing the report. Protesting farmers, meanwhile, had laid out their plan in the afternoon in case they "didn’t get justice for the four farmers’ deaths". “On the call of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), October 12 will be celebrated as Shaheed Kisan Diwas across the country," they said. "SKM appeals to the farmers of UP and all over the country to pay tribute to the martyr farmers by attending the Antim Ardas (Bhog) on October 12 at Tikonia,” a statement by SKM, the umbrella body of farmer organisations, added. SKM also asked farmer organisations to organise special prayer meetings or tribute meetings for "martyr farmers" at their respective places on that day at "gurdwara, temple, mosque, church or any public place, toll plaza or morchas". If Teni is not sacked and Ashish not arrested, SKM had said, it would hold an Asthi Kalash Yatra with farmers marching and holding the ashes of those killed. They would also organise a country-wide rail roko on October 18 and a mahapanchayat in Lucknow on October 26, and “burn effigies” of PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on Dussehra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/union-mins-son-arrested-after-12-hrs-of-quizzing-by-sit/articleshow/86898601.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Business||Confident of privatisation of PSUs in pipeline in 2021-22: Dipam secretary||Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary in the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam), told TOI in an exclusive interview, that privatisation of Neelachal Ispat and Central Electronics may be through during the current quarter, with the sale of BPCL and BEML likely by March, along with the mega LIC initial public offer. He stressed the annual disinvestment target should not be looked merely as a number to bridge the fiscal deficit but part of a larger agenda to revamp the public sector and sell non-core assets, given the opportunity cost of holding on to companies that are loss-making or becoming obsolete. Excerpts of the interview: What are your learnings from the Air India privatisation?The last privatisation happened many years ago and since then we have been doing minority stake sales. The eight disinvestment transactions that we did were from central PSU to central PSU, with the whole process under the government’s control. Air India was a complex transaction as nothing is there, unlike even BEML or Shipping Corporation. Because of the entire process, we have come to grasp a lot of things better. In 2019, we changed the process so that Dipam could drive it and take a hands-off view instead of the administrative ministries running the show. We will further simplify the process as people were not pushing things earlier because they were afraid. Now, we are more confident, several policies have been settled, many of the inter-ministerial processes have been tuned. The bidders and advisors are also more aware of the process. This (transaction) will improve the climate for privatisation. What does it mean for the other transactions such as BPCL and Shipping Corp? Will they move faster?During the current financial year, we are looking to conclude several transactions that are running parallely — BPCL, BEML, Shipping Corp, Pawan Hans, Neelachal Ispat and Central Electronics. In the third quarter, we may be able to clinch Neelachal Ispat and Central Electronics. Will you be able to meet the target given that LIC is also proposed to be listed? Will you look at a listing LIC overseas too?We are looking to list it in the fourth quarter. There were suggestions for a simultaneous listing, but we will list it in India. This will fire up the Indian stock market. Money will come from all over the world and domestic money is also important with 35% meant for retail investors. Are you also getting the pipeline ready for next year?Some transactions will roll over to next year. For example, it will take nine months to a year for a strategic sale like IDBI Bank. We need the RBI at every step and will speak to them. We will try and bring the expression of interest by December. What about the general insurance company that is to be privatised?The law has been amended and now we will take it forward after discussing with the department of financial services. It will be part of next year’s pipeline. Will NITI Aayog come out with a fresh list as part of the larger agenda for privatisation?Yes, NITI Aayog will work in the strategic sector. They have no role in non-strategic areas because they will either be privatised or closed. The policy itself states that timing will be contingent upon the market interest, feasibility and other things. For example, look at steel. We have Neelachal Ispat, then we have Nagarnar plant, which will be demerged, and then, RINL. These are big steel units and you require bidders, there should be appetite. If you open four transactions at a time, then it becomes difficult. There are a lot of loss-making PSUs which the government had identified for sale. What is the progress?Out of the list, eight transactions have been done, four have been closed. One or two are under litigation. There are a few consulting companies. One Cement Corporation unit in Nayagaon will be dropped because there is nothing there. We will clean up the whole list. We have to be very clear that all these big fiscal targets are not supported by government equity. You have reached the 51% limit in so many companies, you can’t do anything. You can’t disinvest in Powergrid. You can’t disinvest in NTPC. It is handling 50%-60% of your power portfolio. Who has the capacity to handle this? These are strategic things, which cannot be done. We have to move away from fiscal targets and move towards reforms. Are you suggesting delinking the disinvestment target from the fiscal deficit?Yes. My suggestion would be that very tall target fixation just to plug the fiscal deficit, time has come to review this strategy. We should rather look at implementation of the new PSE policy. If I am able to conclude four or five (transactions), look at the opportunity cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/confident-of-privatisation-of-psus-in-pipeline-in-2021-22-dipam-secretary/articleshow/86904537.cms||Surojit Gupta

Nagaraju, who did not even campaign, got the votes simply because the symbol allotted to him – a rolling pin or roti maker – looked strikingly similar to TRS’ car. This was enough to confuse many voters and TRS lost the election to the BJP by a margin of just 1,431 votes. It is not surprising, therefore, that as many as 20 candidates – both independents and those from smaller parties – are insisting that they be allotted symbols like the road-roller, truck, auto, tractor and roti maker, for the Huzurabad by-election to be held on October 30. All of these symbols resemble TRS’ car. TRS leaders say it would be a mistake to allot such symbols to smaller players again as it has hurt their chances in the 2019 Lok Sabha election as well.This time around in Huzurabad, Anna YSR Congress party candidate Mohd Mansoor Ali, Praja Ekta Party nominee Srikanth Silveru, Dalit Bahujan Party candidate Devunoori Srinivasu, Ambedkar National Congress Party leader and several other independents like Podishetti Raju, Buchireddy Abbadi, have asked the election authorities to allot road-roller, truck and tractor symbols. Returning officer of Huzurabad, Ch Ravinder Reddy, told STOI that he would take a call on allotment of symbols during scrutiny of nominations. “It is true some candidates have asked for road roller, truck and tractor with a specific intention. The candidates have given their preferences which is not final,” the returning officer said.Nominations for the Huzurabad bypoll ended on Friday. Sixty-one candidates, including those from recognised national parties, regional parties, registered political parties and independents have filed their nominations. While TRS, BJP and Congress are major parties with reserved symbols, the returning officer will be allotting symbols to other candidates. TRS is planning to approach the Election Commission asking it to not allot the confusing symbols to anyone. The party had complained to the commission after the 2019 elections as well and had some symbols removed. On the advice of the commission, TRS even redesigned its car symbol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/contestants-seek-car-like-symbol-give-trs-the-jitters/articleshow/86902484.cms||Koride Mahesh

Police said that the incident occured in the early hours of Saturday when a group of seven tourists in two separate cars were returning from a party at Morjim to their accomodation at Assagao. These tourists hail from Delhi, Haryana and Mumbai, and a majority of them are airline employees. Police said that on the Siolim-Assagao slope, one of the cars hit a nearby electricity pole while an attempt to reverse it was made. The panicked tourists quickly alighted from the vehicle and dashed off in different directions. Police said that a search was carried out, after which the tourists were located by noon. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cops-locate-missing-tourists-at-assagao/articleshow/86902483.cms||---
---||Lucknow||After crushing farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, BJP trampling law of the land, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Holding Bharatiya Janata Party responsible for the death of farmers and a journalist in Lakhimpur, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav said after crushing farmers in Lakhimpur, BJP is now trampling over the law of the land and the Constitution. He said it is time for the wheels of change to roll and SP’s Vijay Yatra starting on October 12, will mark the beginning of this change. “Pehle kisan ko kuchla, kanoon ko kuchalne ki taiyyari hai aur samvidhan ko kuchalne wali ye sarkar hai (First farmers were crushed, now the BJP is trampling the law of the land the Constitution),” Akhilesh said addressing the media at the party office. “Everyone has seen the videos of the incident, police are witness to what happened in Lakhimpur and the local intelligence unit are aware who was driving the vehicles and who was present at the site but the government is trying to delay action against the accused only to deny justice to the families of the victim,” he said. The former UP CM said when he met the family members of the farmers killed in the Lakhimpur violence, the common demand was that they want justice, stringent action against the accused and that the guilty must not be spared. The families are apprehensive that justice will not come easily till the time the minister does not resign. The delay in bringing the accused to justice seems deliberate, he said. Targeting the Union minister of state for home for his recent statements, Akhilesh said: “Just look at the language of our Union minister of state for home. He says he is not only an MP and has been an MLA but is something else as well and that he can teach a lesson to the farmers in. This is how a minister is supposed to publicly threaten farmers,” he asked. Akhilesh said it is time for wheels of change to roll and Samajwadi Party’s Vijay Yatra, slated to begin from October 12, will mark the beginning of this change. In the first leg the Yatra will start from Kanpur to end at Hamirpur. “People have decided and signs are clear for everyone to see. People are ready to vote out BJP in the elections and are just waiting for the time when elections are held,” Akhilesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-crushing-farmers-bjp-trampling-law-of-the-land-sp/articleshow/86903524.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: UDH gears up to implement zonal development plans in major cities||JAIPUR: After the Rajasthan High Court banned the regularisation of illegal colonies in cities without having zonal development plan, the Urban Development and Housing (UDH) department has swung into action for its implementation. As per the mandatory rules, cities having more than 1 lakh population can only be regularised after the implementation of zonal development plan. For the same, the state government has to notify zonal development plan of 28 cities. An official said, “The suggestions and objections from the public in 13 cities to implement zonal development plan has been implemented. Similarly, draft of 11 cities has also been prepared and objections will be invited soon.” Other than this, the state government has disposed of objections received on zonal plan in three cities — Alwar, Chittorgarh and Nagaur. The plan will be finalised soon. The state government recently launched the ambitious six-month special campaign, ‘Shahar-2021’ to issue lease deeds. However, its plan was stalled after Rajasthan High Court on Wednesday banned the regularisation of illegal colonies in cities without having zonal and sector plan. The decision was given on the petition of Roshan Vyas. An official said, “The UDH department has called a meeting on the implementation of zonal plan on October 12. In the meeting, experts including adviser to state government for Shahar-2021, GS Sandhu (former UDH principal secretary) will be present. Based on the discussion, reply will be filed in court.” The government aimed to issue 10 lakh lease deeds during the campaign. The major attraction of the campaign was regularisation of colonies on agriculture land. It is estimated that about 7-8 lakh houses partially or fully constructed on agriculture land need title deeds. Sources said, “After the court order, the government cannot issue lease deeds on 70% plots, which it promised.” The court has also banned the regularisation of plots developed on the facility area. Following this, the UDH department on Wednesday also issued orders to withdraw the previous orders to regularise the plots on facility area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/udh-gears-up-to-implement-zonal-development-plans-in-major-cities/articleshow/86902472.cms||---

As the Union cabinet had approved the right to operate, develop and maintain it for the next 50 years, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) released by the letter of award to the company last year.  For the last two months, Adani officials had been observing operations at the airport. The infrastructure developed in the last five years does not leave much for the private operator to do though officials claimed that in the coming years, they could develop a third terminal. A total of 167 employees of AAI will also be absorbed by Adani Group. Jaipur airport director J S Balhara said, “We are handing over the complete airport to M/S Adani Jaipur International Airport Ltd in a very good shape with latest world-class infrastructure. Presently, this airport has sufficient capacity but I believe in 4 to 5 years down the line they may need to develop Terminal 3 depending on the market situation. ATC & CNS services will still be provided by AAI.” There could be provisions for restricted and time-bound entry of vehicles at the porch of the airport. There is a provision for developing terminal-3 by the group within the existing area of the airport. Authorities expect things to be a little expensive at the airport with the development of infrastructural facilities. Except for Air Traffic Control (ATC) and Communication, Navigation & Surveillance (CNS), everything would be operated by the Adani Group. As per the tender conditions, the group will have to pay Rs 174 for each passenger’s departure and arrival for domestic operations and Rs 348 for every passenger travelling from and to international destinations once the firm takes over in next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/adani-group-will-take-over-jaipur-airport-from-tonight/articleshow/86902482.cms||Yeshika Budhwar
---||Meerut||Right-wing groups in UP try to forcibly shut meat shops||MEERUT: With Navratri festivities on, several right-wing outfits tried to forcibly shut meat shops and take meat dishes off the restaurant menu in Uttar Pradesh districts which led to some tension in Saharanpur and Bulandshahr. In Saharanpur, there was an alleged clash between two groups which led to "firing" on Friday night. Purported videos of small groups moving around and trying to force the shops to shut have gone viral. There were similar scenes in Bulandshahr. According to police sources, members of such organisations reached Nawabganj crossing in Saharanpur area and demanded the meat shops be shut immediately. They didn't even spare restaurants serving non-vegetarian food. It led to a heated argument and tension in the area. Timely intervention by police and local authorities kept the situation under control. Mohd Danish, a restaurant owner at the crossing, said, "All of a sudden 70 to 80 men barged in and asked us to shut the place. We pleaded with them to give us a few hours. But, they wouldn't listen. It led to an argument, and some of them fired shots in the air, not us." Kapil Moda, a member of Hindu Mahasabha, claimed, "Shop owners called in their people and there was stone pelting. Five rounds of firing occurred from their end." Later, a police force led by SP (City) Rajesh Kumar arrived. Kumar said, "We listened to both sides. Things are completely under control now. They agreed to shut their shops during the festive period." In Bulandshahr's Sikandrabad on Friday, Hindu Jagran Manch (HJM) activists threatened to launch a stir. SHO of Sikandrabad Jaikiran Singh said, "We served notices to all meat shop owners and directed them to keep their shops closed during Navratri." District president of HJM Ravindra Sharma said, "We hold religious processions on the main routes during Navratri and it is quite offensive when meat shops are open on the way. We had asked the local administration to look into it, but then nothing much happened." Meanwhile, in Meerut, right-wing groups staged a protest on Thursday and handed a memorandum with two main demands. Bajrang Dal's city general secretary Deepak Tyagi said, "First, all activities related to slaughtering of animals should be stopped with immediate effect. Second, shops or hawkers should not be allowed to sell meat or meat products." When contacted, additional SP, Meerut, Suraj Rai said, "There is no blanket ban on meat shops during Navratri. But, during peace committee meetings, the decision to keep shops closed - on certain routes where a religious 'yatra' is supposed to pass by - is voluntarily taken by locals." Rai added, "Yes, there are fringe elements, in some isolated cases, who try to dissuade shopkeepers and they are dealt with accordingly."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/right-wing-groups-in-up-try-to-forcibly-shut-meat-shops/articleshow/86897057.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s inbound tourism gains from travel upsurge||With more people getting fully vaccinated, the number of Covid-19 cases remaining capped, and consumer sentiment optimistic, tourism within Gujarat is set to gain this festive season. People cooped up within their homes over the past year and a half are pining for their favourite escapades and are decidedly more confident about travel, suggest tour operators. With restrictions on international travel continuing, the preference for domestic and short-distance travel remains strong. Manish Sharma, chairman, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI) – Gujarat, said, "As a travel company, we usually book a maximum of outbound holidays, both international and domestic. However, there has been a paradigm shift in the travel pattern and preferences of people over the past two years, i.e. since the pandemic. More people are travelling within Gujarat to short-haul destinations at a drivable distance. They don’t want to take chances amidst the uncertain Covid-19 scenario with guidelines varying from state to state." For holidays within Gujarat, uptakes are vigorous for pilgrimage tours at Somnath and Dwarka. People also prefer flocking to the Union territories of Diu, Daman, Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Bookings at resorts in Gir Forest, Saputara and the tent city at Statue of Unity as well as Rannotsav, which kick-starts from November 1, are quite good, say travel industry players. Junagadh, Sasan, Somnath, Dwarka and Kutch are also some of the key destinations preferred by people during Diwali festival holidays. Dwarka and Mandvi have emerged as major tourist attractions because of the temple and Shivrajpur beach, which has bagged the coveted Blue Flag tag. In fact, hotel tariffs have shot up in the wake of the buoyant demand, suggest tour operators. Sanjay Mehta, a Rajkot-based travel agent, said, "In Kutch, bookings for Rannotsav and Mandvi beach are robust. Almost 70-80% bookings are full and room tariffs have increased threefold." Tents sold out at Statue of Unity, for Rannotsav Diwali falling in November has come as a boon for the annual desert festival – Rannotsav that takes place in Dhordo, Kutch. This year, Diwali falls in November and therefore, bookings and inquiries for the tent city are agreeable. "Bookings are solid for the Rannotsav from people within Gujarat as well as outside the state. Last year, train connectivity was a challenge due to Covid-19 restrictions. However, with connectivity improving, we have bookings from tourists from Maharashtra as well," said Nikhil Aggarwal, partner at the hospitality firm which manages the tent city at Rannotsav and Statue of Unity. Echoing a similar view, Sargam Gupta, chief managing director, BRG Group, which has a 143-room hotel near Statue of Unity (SoU), said, "The tourist inflow has increased over the last few months at our hotel. In fact, not a single room has been vacant for weeks. After the second wave diminished, people started booking rooms and the tourist traffic has gone up." "While Gujaratis are flocking to tourist spots in large numbers, bookings from other states have also gone up. We are getting a lot of visitors from Mumbai and interestingly many of them are repeat visitors," Gupta told TOI. Heritage Hoteliers getting wholesome business in Diwali season The growing preference for safe, driveable and short-distance travel is indeed spelling out fine news for heritage hoteliers in Gujarat, as boutique heritage properties are catching the interest of travellers. "Over the past few months, the trend of holidaying and unwinding at a destination within a drivable distance has been emerging, revealing that people don’t want to travel by flight or train. Travellers now want privacy, and remoteness of destinations, all at a boutique or luxury property and thus, occupancies at heritage hotels are up," said Ranjitsinh Parmar, secretary, Heritage Hoteliers’ Association."Unlike a majority of hotel occupancies being driven by foreign nationals during the pre-pandemic period, now we’re getting most guests from within Gujarat," he added.  Union territories see return of footfalls, healthy bookings The Union territory of Daman, a popular tourist destination, saw a tremendous spike in the number of visitors recently and the festive season looks upbeat, say industry players. "Over the last couple of months, tourist inflow has increased manifold in Daman. Beaches are crowded over the weekends and tourist attractions such as Light House Beach Road have become very popular among tourists. With the authorities now permitting water activities too, we are expecting a heavy rush this festive season," said Khurshid Manjra, a tour operator from Daman. Inflow of tourists from neighbouring states is strong. Devan Shah, president, Travel agents association for Saurashtra and Kutch, said "In absence of international connectivity, the NRI rush will not be as great this Diwali. We’re already witnessing splendid bookings from within and outside Gujarat, and in the run-up to December, we expect to see a robust rush of NRIs, soon after international commercial flights resume." Eco-tourism picks up: Locked up at home for the last 18 months, Gujaratis are flocking to the eco-camps too for some adventure. "The crowd at our eco-camp sites and resorts is gradually picking up. The rush is heavy on weekends as people just want to move out of their homes and relax. Most of our visitors are from Gujarat, but we are expecting tourists from the other states in the coming months," said Bandish Shah, owner of Orsang Eco-camp and Dev Camp Resort.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-inbound-tourism-gains-from-travel-upsurge/articleshow/86902616.cms||Niyati Parikh

The shuttlers will be competing in the 50-plus age category. Women shuttlers — Jahanvi Adhikary and Dr Sharmila Verma — from the city will be participating in an international event for the first time. Age seems to be no bar for the duo that is competing hard at a stage when most would be happy doing their morning walk routines. The tournament to be held at Huelva, Spain, will be the precursor to the world championships to be held in December. The tournament for seniors is divided into nine different age groups beginning for players who are at least 35-year-old. The selection was thanks to the bronze medal they won at the All India Master Badminton Ranking Tournament held in Goa last month. While Adhikary and Verma will play in the 50-plus women’s doubles. Adhikary will also team up with Mitesh Mehta from Surat in the mixed doubles event in the same age group. “It feels really proud to represent the country at the international level. We will be playing at the same venue where the top players including those from India will perform after some days,” said Adhikary, a communication fitness coach. Verma is a dentist who had given up badminton after school for over 27 years until she resumed playing about a decade ago. She is also an avid golfer. “I am extremely thrilled. We have worked really hard for this,” she said. Like professionals, the duo has a coach who trains them regularly and fitness experts. Anand Keneth coaches them even as Sanjib Hazarika and Hitesh Surve ensure they stay fit. The duo has now been playing together for eight years, but this will be their first tournament abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/veteran-vadodara-shuttlers-to-represent-india-in-spain/articleshow/86900611.cms||Sachin Sharma

For a long time, we have been hearing that they will be shifted underground but so far, no such action has been undertaken,” said Yesh Veer Arya, a Doon resident. According to the Smart City plan, overhead wires were to be moved underground in multi-utility ducts at four identified localities — Rajpur Road (1.8 km from Dilaram Chowk to Clock Tower), EC Road (3 km from Behl Chowk to Aaraghar Chowk), Chakrata Road (1.8 km from Clock Towerto Kishan Nagar Chowk), and Haridwar Road (1.5 km from Prince Chowk to Aaraghar Chowk). However, the dangling wires are yet to be moved underground. When queried, Shailendra Singh, superintendent engineer, Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL), told TOI, “The work to move wires underground has already started.

The 32-year-old, a resident of Fatehpur, is also accused of duping several people under the pretext of providing them jobs in the Indian Army. During the investigation, it was found out that the man took Rs 2 lakh from each job aspirant. After receiving the money, Sachin used to hand over fake appointment letters to them. Besides, he has also posted his pictures in the Army uniform on social media. The STF teams have also seized his laptop and recovered fake Army IDs, appointment letters and two cell phones from his possession. The accused, at present, is being interrogated. This comes a few days after a man hailing from Hanumangarh in Rajasthan was arrested by the military intelligence team in Dehradun for posing as an Army personnel. The accused, identified as Sunil Kumar, would often roam around Indian Military Academy (IMA) and other military establishments in Dehradun, Joshimath (Chamoli), and Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-held-for-duping-people-by-promising-indian-army-jobs/articleshow/86897055.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Mumbai||‘Many cancer patients are hesitating to take Covid vax’||MUMBAI: As the drama over vaccine availability settles down, public health experts now acknowledge there is another problem affecting India’s Covid vaccination plan: Vaccine hesitancy. Consider the ‘hesitancy’ among cancer patients, one of the most vulnerable groups who doctors say need the vaccine the most. A survey-based study in June among 435 patients aged 45 or more at Tata Memorial Hospital (Parel) found that 80% of them had not taken the first shot. “Vaccine hesitancy is common in our patient population. It is due to misplaced notion about side-effects and effects on cancer. We have started work on educating patients on this issue,’’ said Prof Kumar Prabash, one of the authors of the study. The study, in the medical journal ‘Cancer Research, Statistics, and Treatment’, said reasons for not taking the Covid-19 vaccine could be considered as vaccine hesitancy in 259 (77%) patients. “The most common ones were fear in 124 (38%) patients (fear of side-effects and of impact of vaccine on cancer/therapy) and lack of information in 87 (26.7%) patients,’’ said the study. Another study from Tata Memorial Hospital in the same journal looked at data from CoWin to establish “vaccine hesitancy’’ was rampant, especially in remote areas and regions with restricted connectivity. “This is where vaccination teams were unable to obtain 100% coverage after several visits, even when vaccine doses were available,’’ said Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, one of the authors of the paper. His paper listed reasons for vaccine hesitancy in India: Distrust in safety of recently approved vaccines, fear of adverse effects and rumors concerning infertility and death as a result of Covid-19 vaccine. “Covid Symptom Survey in India said the top reasons provided for not getting vaccinated included waiting for others to get it first (42%), other individuals need it,’’ said Dr Chaturvedi. Dr S Banavali, Tata Memorial Centre academic dean, said cancer patients heard about them being vulnerable to Covid as their immune system was weakened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-many-cancer-patients-are-hesitating-to-take-covid-vax/articleshow/86902510.cms||---

This comes after disclosures made by Kulbeer Rawat, coach of a Dehradun-based cricket academy, who was nabbed earlier this week. Rawat used to work with Secure Corporate Management (SCM), a company which is accused of telling players that they worked with cricket bodies and assured them of selection in state cricket teams in return for money. Gurugram Police had earlier said that they are investigating links between CAU and Rawat. “Rawat has mentioned the names of some CAU officials but we will issue a summon only when we gather significant evidence against an office-bearer of the association. We will issue a notice to someone only when we are extremely confident of something,” said Umesh Kumar, investigating officer and sub-inspector, Gurgaon Police. He added, “After Rawat, another coach involved in the gang has been nabbed from Himachal Pradesh. Our probe has revealed that SCM owner Ashutosh Bora transferred money into his account.” Meanwhile, the CAU has issued a statement stating that the selection of all their teams is conducted impartially. CAU also maintained that its officials have no links with the gang under the lens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/gurugram-cops-likely-to-interrogate-cau-officials-over-duping-of-budding-cricketers/articleshow/86897061.cms||Mohammad Anab

He was reportedly driving the vehicle in the convoy which was just behind Mishra’s SUV. The driver is also accused of helping Ankit Das escape from the spot. Meanwhile, another aide of Mishra, said to be present at the scene of crime, was also detained. Senior police officers did not disclose the names of the accused saying they had not been arrested and are being questioned. Ankit’s uncle Akhilesh Das was a Congress MP and the national general secretary of BSP. He passed away in 2017. Ankit is said to be a close associate of Ashish Mishra and his father. An official said the name of Ankit Das surfaced after a video went viral a day after the violence in Kheri. In the video, a man, having injuries on his head, is seen claiming that he was in the second SUV with Das. A policeman is also spotted in the video who is holding a microphone and asking the injured man about the incident. He tells cops that the vehicle belonged to Ankit Das. The injured man is heard telling cops that he hails from Charbagh area in Lucknow and had accompanied Ankit Das to Kheri for work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/driver-of-ex-congress-mps-nephew-detained/articleshow/86903533.cms||---
---||Dehradun||CM Dhami meets Niti Aayog V-C, seeks more funds for border area development||Dehradun: In a meeting with Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar at the secretariat in Dehradun, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami sought more funds for the Border Area Development Plan. The CM pointed out that Uttarakhand has “an important strategic position due to its international borders with China and Nepal”. CM Dhami also urged Kumar to continue providing compensation to Uttarakhand in lieu of the revenue loss suffered by the hill state due to the GST rollout. As per section 10(2) of the said GST Act, the states are being compensated for any loss of revenue arising on account of the implementation of GST for five years. However, the five-year period would end in 2022 as the GST was rolled out in the country on July 1, 2017. “This will create a financial problem for the state. Considering the limited resources of the state, the compensation needs to be continued for Uttarakhand even further,” the CM said. The issue of forest clearance was also discussed in the meeting. After a presentation by state officials, Kumar said that the process of forest clearance needs to be simplified and the Aayog would take up the matter with the Centre. Also, Kumar agreed to assess the carrying capacity of the national parks in view of the increase in the number of elephants and tigers in them. Kumar also assured the state of all possible support from the Niti Aayog. "All possible assistance related to development will be provided to the state government. Niti Aayog will hold discussions with the central government ministries on various issues put forth by the state government. Meanwhile, the concerned officials of the state government should conduct a regular follow-up,” he said. Kumar appreciated the state government's move of setting Sustainable Development Goals for each district. He said this would encourage healthy competition among the districts. He added that a sector-wise and overall plan should be prepared for the development of the state and stressed the need for procedural simplification at the grass-root level. The approvals required by the investors in various sectors should be simplified and minimised, said the Niti Aayog official. Coming to agriculture, Kumar said natural and organic farming should be promoted to double farmers' income. He suggested devoting one village in each block to natural farming and encouraging the cultivation of high-value medicinal plants. He pointed out that more work can be undertaken for the rejuvenation of rivers while promising Aayog's support to the state through the Namami Gange scheme. Besides, Kumar batted for the use of more local resources in the tourism sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-dhami-meets-niti-aayog-v-c-seeks-more-funds-for-border-area-development/articleshow/86897068.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Idols back in many pandals, but Durga Puja still missing its sheen||NEW DELHI: With food stalls prohibited and restriction on the number of visitors, Durga Puja this year would be a sombre affair in the national capital, if not a muted one like last year. Apart from the religious rituals, the five-day long Durga Puja celebrations in the capital are also marked by pandal hopping, cultural programmes, feasting and revelry. Last year, most Durga Puja committees performed a ‘ghat’ or ‘kalash’ (sacred water vessel) puja, but this year, many committees are performing pratima puja. Delhi’s mini Bengal — Chittaranjan Park — which is home to some of the most popular Durga Puja pandals and is thronged by lakhs of visitors during the festival, saw almost all puja committees opt for a ghat puja last year. “We will have a one-day ghat puja and there will be no prasad or bhog this year too,” said Narayan Dey, secretary of Mela Ground Durga Puja Samiti, Delhi’s biggest in terms of size and scale. Tamal Rakshit of B Block Durga Puja Samiti said that there would be a one-day ghat puja. Prodip Ganguly, managing committee member, Chittaranjan Park Kali Mandir, said that like last year, the puja would be livestreamed and devotees can offer pushpanjali online. “We are allowing the public to visit for darshan, in batches of 50 at a time. They will enter from one gate and after darshan, leave from another gate with the entire movement properly channelised,” Ganguly said, adding that proper measures are being taken to ensure there is no crowding both inside the temple complex and outside, with help from district authorities and Delhi Police. The Sarbojanin Puja Samiti, D Block, CR Park, is holding its silver jubilee celebrations and would have pratima puja and a small eco-friendly pandal. “We are introducing a token system so that people can be allowed to have darshan in batches. The entry and exit would be properly barricaded and we would have security guards too,” said Sujoy Ghosh, general secretary of the samiti. Samir Banerjee, general secretary of Durgotsab, Greater Kailash-II, said that this year, very limited arrangements for darshan have been made as the Durga Puja venue usually sees a huge footfall. “We have brought an idol of 3.5 feet from Asansol (West Bengal) and after the Puja, immersion would take place in Vrindavan,” Banerjee said. The Durga Puja would be performed at Sanatan Dharam Mandir in GK-II this year and private security guards would be deployed. The puja celebrations would also see cultural performances including Hindustani classical and Bharatnatyam and Kathak recitals in the evening, but a very limited number of only fully vaccinated guests would be allowed. Amitava Dutta, secretary of the Kali Bari Mayur Vihar Samiti, said that a pratima puja with all rituals would be performed but ‘pushpanjali’ would be online. “Devotees would enter from one gate and leave from another gate after darshan. We are following all DDMA guidelines strictly,” he said. Sowmojeet Banerjee, joint secretary, said that cultural programmes would be posted online. The 112-year-old Delhi Durga Puja Samiti, known as Kashmere Gate Durga Puja and famed for its sandhya aarati and food stalls, will see a ghat puja this year too. Som Prakash Mitra of the samiti said that the time available was too short to organise puja at the usual scale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/idols-back-in-many-pandals-but-durga-puja-still-missing-its-sheen/articleshow/86903528.cms||---
---||Dehradun||4 days after HC lifts daily limit on Char Dham pilgrims, number of visitors doubles||Dehradun: On October 5, with around one month to go before the four Char Dham shrines would close for winter, the Uttarakhand high court lifted the daily cap on pilgrims to Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. This reflected on the pilgrim footfall, which rose steadily and has now nearly doubled. As compared to the 2,086 pilgrims who visited Char Dham on October 1, a total of 4,587 people visited the shrines on October 8. Stakeholders of the yatra like hotel, eatery, shop owners, prasad makers, mule owners, etc. said it’s a brief but much-needed relief. The shrines were allowed to open to visitors in mid-September, with curbs and a daily cap of 1,000 pilgrims for Badrinath, 800 for Kedarnath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri. A total of 2,381 pilgrims visited the shrines on October 2, 2,363 on October 3, 1,997 on October 4 and 1,838 on October 5, the day HC lifted the cap. On October 6, the shrines saw a total turnout of 3,707pilgrims and it grew to 3,452 on October 7. “The livelihoods of a large number of people depend directly or indirectly on this annual pilgrimage. Ahead of the yatra, people buy products in bulk and when the pilgrimage is cancelled, they suffer heavy losses. When the Covid numbers receded, we knocked on doors of the HC to allow the yatra to open for pilgrims, assuring them we would follow all necessary guidelines. We are taking all steps necessary to prevent the virus from spreading,” said state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj. “Now that the monsoon has also subsided, we expect the number of pilgrims to go up in October,” he added. Brijesh Sati, the spokesperson of Char Dham mahapanchayat, a body of priests from all four shrines, concurred, saying even though the footfall is mild now, it is expected to grow in the next few days. “The number of pilgrims goes up in October every year before the portals close for winter. We expect it to happen this year too,” Sati said. Rajesh Singh Negi, a dhaba owner in Rudraprayag, said the short window for which the shrines were opening would not make much of a difference but it is still a start. Earlier, when the daily limit was in place, a high number of pilgrims would apply for e-passes on the government portal but most would not be able to visit. He said, “Like last year, the shrines have opened to the public close to the closing dates this year too. Shop owners made large-scale repair works, prasad makers bought raw material in bulk and then ran into heavy losses. Pilgrim footfall for a month will not help us completely recover from those losses, but at least the wheels have been set in motion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/4-days-after-hc-lifts-daily-limit-on-char-dham-pilgrims-number-of-visitors-doubles/articleshow/86897093.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Delhi||Bridge over Agra Canal open, to cut travel time||New Delhi: A new bridge over Agra Canal in Badarpur was opened to the public on Saturday. Constructed by the flood and irrigation department of Uttar Pradesh government, the bridge will shorten the route to Mathura Road and Kalindi Kunj for residents of the area and reduce traffic congestion. Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri inaugurated the new bridge and said that the link will be useful for the people of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Haryana, and will ease traffic congestion in the surrounding areas as well. “During the last assembly elections, when UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath came for campaigning in Badarpur, he had promised construction of the bridge over Agra Canal,” said Bidhuri. The bridge comes under the UP government. The bridge replaced the old one constructed in the British era, which had been earlier declared dangerous. The road connected by the bridge connects Delhi with Haryana and UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bridge-over-agra-canal-open-to-cut-travel-time/articleshow/86903532.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||New Covid cases still 500-plus in Mumbai as Maharashtra witnesses dip||MUMBAI: The city recorded over 500 cases for the second consecutive day on Saturday. In contrast, the cases in the state have been dipping at a steady pace. After 529 cases on Friday, 523 cases were registered on Saturday, taking the overall Covid-19 tally in Mumbai to 7.48 lakh so far. The city has registered 500-plus cases for five of the past 11 days. The state added 2,486 cases and 44 deaths. It also reported a drop in active cases to 33,000. The rise in cases in the city is also apparent in the caseload for the first week over recent months: while 2,726 cases were registered between August 1 and 9, the caseload climbed to 3,907 in September for the same period. In October so far, the tally is higher at 4,288. The trend is reversed for the state. The state reported 23,906 cases in the first nine days of October, which is the lowest since February this year. The tally for the first nine days of September was 37,215, and 51,787 new cases were reported in August in the same period. Senior state government officials said that since the peak of the second wave hit different parts of the state at different times, the decline has been at the same pace. While most smaller districts and towns are not reporting a significant number of cases, districts like Mumbai, Pune and Ahmednagar are driving the Covid-19 graph of the state. “Clearly, the turning point has been the unlocking that started on August 15,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. “However, we are not worried as yet because the number of critical cases isn’t rising nor is the number of patients needing oxygen support rising,” he added. He said the trend will be watched closely over the next week. State government officials say that although the cases are low, they are still gearing up for a third wave and are trying to achieve maximum vaccination across the state to push the third wave away by a few months and also reduce its severity. “The slight increase in many cities like Mumbai, Pune is not worrisome as hospital infrastructure is available and the number of critical patients too hasn’t increased,” said the official. With all sectors open in the state, the state government has directed all districts to ramp up testing and also ensure that there is adherence of Covid-19 protocol of masking up and maintaining distance. The daily testing in the state has dipped to an average of 1.15 lakh, which is lower than the 1.5 lakh tests the state was conducting till mid-last month. “We have asked districts to ramp up testing as well, especially in the festive season,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-new-cases-still-500-plus-in-city-as-state-witnesses-dip/articleshow/86902593.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Lucknow||UP: Mayawati promises jobs to stop migration if voted to power||LUCKNOW: In her first election rally ahead of the 2022 UP Assembly elections on Saturday, BSP chief Mayawati announced that her party’s main poll plank this time would be employment for the youth, promising that if voted to power, nobody will have to migrate to other states. She also said that she would soon write to the election commission, asking for a ban on exit polls as they worked to swing the election in favour of the ruling party. Giving the example of West Bengal, she said that all exit polls showed Mamata Banerjee losing whereas she won the election to become the CM. Speaking to party supporters at Lucknow’s Kanshi Ram Memorial to mark the party founder’s death anniversary, the former UP chief minister demanded Bharat Ratna for him and said that her government would give the most importance to poor and unemployed youth and give them means of earning so that they don’t have to migrate from UP. “All the schemes we started for various sections of society which were stopped by BJP and SP will be restarted. We will also set up a commission to consider all demands being put up by employees of various departments and those which are acceptable, will be implemented. Extremely backward areas will be developed on priority and the Dr Ambedkar Gram Vikas Yojana and Manyawar Shri Kanshi Ramji Shahari Samagra Vikas Yojana will be restarted to develop villages and cities,” she said, adding that no new hospitals, medical colleges, schools, roads and bridges would be built till the existing ones are not repaired. Insisting that her government would not be vindictive like other parties, Mayawati said that no work initiated by any political party will be stopped if it was for the public good. “All the projects taken up by BJP in Ayodhya, Varanasi, Mathura and other religious sites are still under construction and I promise that they won't be stopped when we come to power. All good schemes of centre and state won't be stopped. Unlike BJP and SP, I will also not unnecessarily change names of places etc given by previous governments. All existing schemes will be reviewed and the good ones will be extended,” she said. The party chief also promised to look after the welfare of all minority communities, especially Muslims, and said that nobody would have any reason for disappointment. Hitting out at other political parties, Mayawati hinted that one party takes “selfish people of other parties” and when it was in power, people were highly upset with the law and order in the state. Recently, several members of BSP have switched over to SP. She also mentioned AAP and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, saying that the party was promising things in UP which it had failed to implement even in Delhi. BJP, she alleged, would start misusing government machinery close to the elections to create an environment in its favour and if that did not work, it would try and communalise the environment. Congress, on the other hand, was responsible for the massive migration of people to other states, she said. Accusing the party of not having done anything for people, she said that both Congress and BJP did not even ensure employment for people. “With farmers and some castes like Jats and Gujars angry with BJP, it has been forced to set up universities and statues for them and also appointing ministers from castes they have ignored. Nobody is going to fall for this anymore. People like Asaduddin Owaisi are also in UP for votes while they did nothing for their community in times of crisis like Covid,” Mayawati said, adding that people should also be wary of small parties and organisations which would be working behind the scene to benefit BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mayawati-promises-jobs-to-stop-migration-if-voted-to-power-in-up/articleshow/86903554.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Agra||Must bring law to accord national honour to Ram, says Allahabad high court||PRAYAGRAJ/AGRA: The Allahabad high court on Friday said that “Parliament must bring law to pay ‘rashtriya samman’ (national honour) to Lord Ram, Lord Krishna, Ramayan and its author Valmiki besides Gita and its author Maharishi Ved Vyas, as they are the culture and heritage of the country”. The court added that the Constitution allows one to be atheist, but it does not mean that one can pass obscene remarks against gods and goddesses. These observations were made by Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav while allowing bail application of one Akash Jatav of Hathras, who is accused of sharing objectionable images of Hindu deities on social media. He was arrested on January 4. Last month, Justice Yadav had hit headlines when he had said that the government should bring a bill in Parliament to give fundamental rights to cows and to declare it the national animal. While denying bail to a man accused of cow slaughter, Justice Yadav in his 12-page order had also said that “scientists believe cow is the only animal that inhales and exhales oxygen". In his bail order on Friday, the court also said that there is a need to educate children on this issue by making it a compulsory subject in all the schools of the country and educating the children about Indian culture. The court allowed the bail application, considering the plea of the applicant that he was in jail for the last 10 months. The trial in his case was yet to commence and there was no chance that trial would conclude in near future. On the allegations against the applicant, the court said that there are many countries in the world where there is a provision of harsh punishment for such conduct, but in India there is provision of lesser punishment in comparison to many countries. Elaborating its stand, the court it its 12-page judgment delivered in Hindi further said that “recently, the apex court has given its decision in the Ram Janmabhoomi case in favour of the people who believe in the Lord Ram, who is the soul and culture of India and India is incomplete without Lord Ram”. Besides, the court said that one should respect the deities and culture of the country in which he or she lives, instead of making obscene remarks on such issues. “The Constitution of India allows one to be atheist, but it does not mean that one can pass obscene remarks against gods and goddesses,” said Justice Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/must-bring-law-to-accord-national-honour-to-ram-krishna-says-hc/articleshow/86897151.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Authorities of the church, which was established in 1839, allege that some individuals have illegally purchased a part of the church’s property. On their complaint, an FIR has been registered against five persons. Kenneth Simon, general secretary of Indian Church Trustees, the organisation that manages the affairs of the church, alleged that the property was unlawfully sold in 2008 after getting power of attorney with the help of a person who was shown as the managing director of Lucknow Diocesan Trust Organisation, although the Lucknow diocese denied that the person whose name was mentioned had ever held the post in their diocese. “The power of attorney is null and void,” Bishop Morris Edgar Dan, managing director, Lucknow Diocesan Trust Organisation told TOI. Meanwhile, when queried, Sanjay Kumar Goyal, one of the persons named in the FIR, refuted the allegations. “We have all the documents. In the past, too, the matter was taken to the court, which gave the ruling in our favour,” Goyal said. Established in 1839, Christ Church is an iconic landmark of Mussoorie. “It will be the first church raised amid the eternal snows of upper India,” wrote Rev Daniel Wilson, the Bishop of Calcutta in his journal, after laying its foundation stone on May 14, 1836. In 1906, Mary of Trek, the then Princess of Wales, who was later crowned as Queen Mary – wife of King George V -- had planted a tree on the church premises during a visit to Mussoorie. The tree still stands tall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/oldest-church-in-himalayas-located-in-mussoorie-in-midst-of-land-row/articleshow/86897174.cms||Anmol Jain

The power crisis also forced Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to buy around 1800MW of power from outside the state at a cost of Rs 13 per unit approximately. Sources in the power sector revealed that three-four hour power cuts were imposed on domestic consumers in Punjab as the gap between demand and supply could not be met after some units of private power producers and government-run plants stopped generating power. One unit of Talwandi Sabo Power Limited stopped generation on Friday night due to technical fault. Two units of the government-run thermal plant at Ropar and one unit at Lehra Mohabbat power plant also faced shutdown. Northern states are facing power shortage due to dwindling coal stock at thermal plants. Sources claimed that both government-run Lehra Mohabbat and Ropar thermal plants have coal stock of 4.9 and 4 days, respectively, and all three private plants in Punjab have less than two days of coal stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-reels-under-3-4-hour-power-cuts-as-coal-crisis-hits-plants/articleshow/86904604.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: 10,000 YSR health clinics by next Republic Day||VISAKHAPATNAM: The state government is setting up about 10,000 YSR rural and urban health clinics. While the existing primary healthcare centres are primarily functioning from the mandal headquarters, the health clinics are expected to take care of the health needs of the entire population. The village clinics have been attached to village secretariats, and each clinic covers a population of 2,000. Besides establishing these health clinics, the state government is spending Rs 16,203 crore to revamp government hospitals and medical colleges to strengthen public healthcare and infrastructure. All the YSR village health clinics will be operational by the next Republic Day. The village clinics will be linked with the PHCs through video conferencing. According to the health officials, the village clinics will also be tied up with the laboratories. “Health records of the villagers will be available in the respective village clinics through Aarogyasri cards. These details can be accessed by the nearby PHC doctors visiting the village under ‘family doctor’ concept, which in turn will be useful in diagnosing and treating the cardholder,” said a health official. Mid-level Health Providers (MLHPs), who have completed BSc (nursing) and CPCH (certificate programme in community health) courses, are being appointed in village clinics along with an ANM (auxiliary nursing midwife). Asha workers will report to these village clinics. While replying to the debate on the motion of thanks to the governor’s address during the budget session of the assembly in May, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had explained the concept of village clinics. He said he knew the value of a life. “It is for this reason that we made changes in the Aarogyasri scheme and extended its coverage to all those whose annual earnings are below Rs 5 lakh. The ailments covered under the scheme have been increased to 2,400 from 1,000.

Major gang wars were averted following a city-wide police operation on Saturday. DCP (North) Paris Deshmukh said police arrested Arjun Saxena from Brahmpuri and recovered a pistol with a huge cache of ammunition. Besides Saxena, 11 swords were found from Salim, alias Bhand, from Galta Gate. “Arjun Saxena has no case against him since 2004. He was lying dormant to evade suspicion. But the discovery of pistols and ammunition indicates that he had some plans afoot,” Deshmukh said, adding Saxena had a rivalry with Gagan Pandit gang.Police said Saxena was involved with land mafias and was under their vigil for a long time. “Criminals usually try to stay away from the police radar so that they could plan their next move. But we searched his house and discovered arms from him. He is being interrogated,” Deshmukh said.Similarly, the police team was shocked when they found 11 swords from Salim during a search at his house in Galta Gate. The accused jumped off his building and fractured his legs. According to Deshmukh, the accused is being investigated to find out why he had amassed so many sharp objects. “Raids are still underway. Some of the accused are being quizzed to find out details of their other aides,” Deshmukh said, adding that people who aides these gangsters will also be arrested.“We intend to continue with these operations in coming days to keep a tight control over the organised crime,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raids-averted-major-gang-wars-violence-say-cops/articleshow/86902646.cms||---

Sheela, the erstwhile spokesperson and a close associate of spiritual guru Osho Rajneesh, has lived many lives in one. The 16-year-old from a Gandhian family in Vadodara rose to become a powerful leader of the Rajneeshees, as followers of Osho called themselves, practically running the affairs at Rajneeshpuram in the US’ Oregon, only to find herself behind bars for her role in the 1984 bio-terror attacks. She has since then rehabilitated herself, doing odd jobs like that of a dog walker and a housemaid, before finally running retirement homes spread over several countries. “There is no possibility of an explosion now,” Sheela said in mirth during her conversation with author Devapriya Roy at the Times LitFest. “I could command a whole commune, but could not control a dog. I used to beg it,” she said, hinting at the challenges she faced after 20 years in prison. Her book, By My Own Rules, traces her eventful life journey. Sheela said the greatest learning from Osho or Bhagwaan, as she called him, was the understanding that a person could create her own heaven or hell. “Bhagwaan once told me a story of a Zen master who abused a samurai. The samurai became angry and drew his sword. The Zen master said, ‘This is hell.’ The samurai pushed back the sword in its sheath. The master said, “This is heaven.’ Bhagwaan taught us we make our own hell and paradise. So I create paradise wherever I am.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/i-create-paradise-wherever-i-am-says-sheela-oshos-close-aide/articleshow/86903561.cms||---

With the state having topped in the country with 2.57 crore fully vaccinated individuals among other states recently, state health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday told TOI that many districts were getting adequate supply but were not seeing beneficiaries due to the gap between two Covishield doses (84 days).

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Cuddalore MP booked for murder of worker||CUDDALORE: DMK MP from Cuddalore, T R V Ramesh, was booked and five others arrested on Saturday on charges of murdering a worker at the MP’s cashew nut unit in Panruti last month. CB-CID sources said the MP, who is the prime accused in the case, was not at home when a police team went there in the morning. The five arrested were the MP’s personal assistant Natarajan, cashew factory manager M Kandavel, M Allah Pitchai, K Vinoth and Sundararajan. They are accused of murdering G Govindarasu, 63, of Melmampattu in Panruti, who worked for the past seven years at TRV Gayathiri Cashews owned by the MP. When Govindarasu did not return home after work on September 19, his son G Senthilvel lodged a complaint with the Kadampuliyur police. Senthilvel said the MP’s personal assistant called him from his father’s mobile phone at 2.25am on September 20 and said his father had consumed poison at the unit and had been taken to Panruti government general hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. Senthilvel, a truck driver, was in Chennai then and requested his cousins Raghuraman and Ananthraj to visit the Panruti hospital. The two men visited the mortuary and found injuries on Govindarasu’s left eye, face, neck and several parts of the body and blood stains on the clothes. “My father was a mentally strong man. There was no major reason for him to commit suicide,” Senthivel said. In his complaint to the police on September 20, Sentilvel accused Ramesh, Natarajan, Kandavel, Allah Pitchai, Vinoth and workers in the cashew unit of attacking his father and murdering him. Kadampuliyur police registered a case of suspicious death and began investigation. Meanwhile, PMK’s legal unit moved the Madras high court seeking a CBI probe and demanded that the MP and his associates be booked for murder. The case was transferred to the CB-CID on September 27. The agency, after undertaking a preliminary probe, booked the MP and the five others under IPC sections 302 (punishment for murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) and 120-B (punishment of criminal conspiracy). PMK legal wing president K Balu, who filed the petition before the high court, accused Kadampuliyur police of acting in a negligent manner. He alleged that Govindarasu was brought to the station on September 19 with severe injuries on his body with a complaint against him for stealing cashewnuts. He alleged that the police, instead of taking Govindarasu to hospital, just told those who brought him to take him to hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cuddalore-mp-booked-for-murder-of-worker/articleshow/86900783.cms||Bosco Dominique

Cops from Karelibaug police station said that during patrolling near Muktanand Circle, they saw a large crowd gathered outside and inside an open plot.

---||Mumbai||Navratri spirit affecting vax turnout in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The Navratri festival spirit seems to be affecting vaccine turnout in both Mumbai and Maharashtra,, where health officials aim to vaccinate 15 lakh people daily for the week-long Mission Kawach Kundal. On Saturday, 8.28 lakh people – including 80,965 in Mumbai – took the Covid vaccine. In Mumbai, where the BMC had organized an only-women’s day at the public vaccination centres, only 48,000 women turned up for the free vaccine. In the last two only-women days, over a lakh had turned up. “The only explanation could be that as it is Navratri, women fast and are busy with poojas,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. Administrators from other districts offered similar reasons for the lower-than-expected turnout on Saturday. A district health officer said, “We had a target of 10,000 vaccinations today, but we managed only 4,000-odd. Generally vaccine turnout is higher on Saturday as it’s an off from work for many, and they do not lose out on a working day due to side-effects.” Kakani said a new plan to be finalized on Monday will focus on neighbourhood vaccination. “We want to ensure there is a vaccination centre for a clusters of 20-30 housing colonies/buildings. People will turn up as the centre is so close to them as they can walk in,’’ he said. Health minister Rajesh Tope is likely to review the special drive on Monday and the experiences of districts will be used to fine-tune the drive for the remaining days. Mission Kawach Kundal ends on October 14. A state official said they would now take vaccinations to the village level. Many districts have had localised special drives to commemorate Gandhi Jayanti and they are finding it hard to sustain the momentum for all such drives. “With ample stocks and ebbing second wave, there is no sense of urgency with respect to vaccines anymore,” said a district official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-navratri-spirit-affecting-vax-turnout-in-state/articleshow/86902707.cms||---

In order to ensure that the whole operation remains secret, the in-charges of various police stations were not informed about the names of the history-sheeters to be raided. From using different name for the operation at the initial stage to involving offbeat cops to gather information on the history-sheeters, the senior police officers of Jaipur police did everything to ensure that the details of the operation were not leaked. TOI on Saturday spoke to the police officer who led the operation that was by and large flawless and fetched 21 FIRs related to Arms Act violation, property disputes, assaults and others. "We were planning on this for past few months. We took some of our officers of CST and some from various districts on board and thought of executing the whole thing ahead of the festival time. Some of the policemen from police lines were also involved in the task," said Ajay Pal Lamba, additional commissioner of police (crime) who supervised and led the whole operation. Also, to minimise the chances of the operation getting leaked there were some plans. "We kept the survey of the history-sheeters hidden from police stations as we assigned the task to some other policemen. Also, fearing leakage of the plan we named the operation ‘Shudh Ke Liye Yudh’ during the planning stage three months ago so that people might confuse it to be a campaign to check adulteration," Lamba added. “On Friday evening prior to the raids we revealed the original name ‘operation clean bold’,” he said. “Usually, ahead of festival season history-sheeters merely get a phone call and are called to the police station and urged not to engage in criminal activities. But this time, we raided their houses to ensure people in their neighbourhood also get aware of their criminal activities,” Lamba said. houses, stayed at their localities for more than three hours to ensure people in their neighbourhood become aware of their acts," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3-months-of-planning-behind-covert-dawn-to-dusk-police-op/articleshow/86902703.cms||Ashish Mehta

Further, MahaMetro said it was developing an additional depot, in a sunken pit, in Pimpri for the maintenance or repairs of Metro rakes. The depot at Shivajinagar will cater to the Pimpri-Swargate line, while the one at Vanaz will take care of the Vanaz-Ramwadi corridor. The construction of the former is 89% done, while the Shivajinagar facility is over 80% complete, MahaMetro officials said. Both depots will handle the daily maintenance, as well as minor and major repair of rakes. The facilities will also comprise stabling tracks used to park the rakes. MahaMetro officials said all the major work at the depots was nearing completion. This includes construction of an engineering train unit (ETU), a cleaning shed, an integrated workshop building, a pit wheel lathe shed, and an auxiliary substation building. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said, “Both the depots will play a vital role in the smooth operation of the trains. The facilities are an important part of the project, though they are not commuter-facing hubs. MahaMetro is providing world-class equipment for the maintenance of rakes at the depots. The water utilized at the facilities will be recycled and reused.” MahaMetro said the sunken pit depot will cater to takes arriving at the Pimpri station. The facility, being close to the station, will save time and effort in maintenance of rakes that will be introduced on the priority PCMC-Dapodi stretch, an official said. Earlier, MahaMetro had said the same depots and existing infrastructure would cater to the rakes in the second phase of the project, which could potentially expand the city’s Metro rail network from the current 35km by an additional 80km. Recently, the state government approved studies for the slew of expansion proposals. MahaMetro said it would prepare detailed project reports (DPRs) for the extensions, including till Wagholi, Warje, Khadakwasla, Chandni Chowk and Hadapsar, and a new Hadapsar-Kharadi link, by next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-80-work-finished-on-2-metro-depots-viaduct-almost-complete/articleshow/86900854.cms||Sarang Dastane

"I will fulfill all responsibilities given to me. Till I am a minister, I will work for the government. If not, I will work for the party," said Sharma. He is likely to begin his three-day Gujarat visit from Sunday to meet the Congress party leaders and grassroots workers. Sharma is starting his new political innings after becoming incharge of Gujarat. When asked about possibility of cabinet expansion, he said, "Cabinet expansion is the jurisdiction of chief minister, only he can comment on it. I am just a party worker. Whatever the direction given to me by the aala kamaan (party’s central leadership), I will follow it. We are here to work for the party. We have the power in the state. My first priority is my party and I will work for it," said Sharma. He further added, "Whatever directions party gives me, I will follow them. It is not my work to decide my role, it is decided by the party. Until I have this department (health minister), I will work for it and the day I will not have this department, I will work for the party, I have no problem." Soon after being given new responsibility, Sharma launched a scathing attack on BJP ruling Gujarat for over 20 long years. "Is there anyone in Gujarat who could ask questions. In 2017, BJP formed government. Till four years government worked and after that whole government changed. CM was changed, deputy CM changed, ministers have also been changed. The people of the country have a right to know what led you (BJP) to change the entire face of the government in Gujarat, that too, a year before 2022 elections. If there was governance in four years, there was no reason to change the face of the government. The change of face of government in Gujarat itself shows that there was no governance. BJP should come clean on it," said Sharma. When asked that Gujarat is Modi-Shah’s bastion, will it be a challenging task for him, he said, "Challenges should always be tough."He added that, "Some 26 years ago, Congress party had won the elections, now for over 20 years BJP is in power in Gujarat. Despite that, Congress party and its workers are firmly holding their ground. The last election was held in 2017. It was not an easy victory for BJP in Gujarat. In the coming time, Congress party will form its government in Gujarat. Congress is in the DNA of the country’s people." Showing a lot of confidence, Sharma is hopeful that Congress will win 2022 Gujarat elections. "I am going to Gujarat today for three days.Apart from one-to-one interaction with senior party leaders, I will hold discussions with MLA group. We have 65 MLAs in Gujarat. We will have one-to-one interaction with district incharges. After the interaction, we will work on strategy for fighting elections and also for devising training programmes. In the coming time, Congress will form government in Gujarat."Earlier in 2017, chief minister Ashok Gehlot was the party incharge in Gujarat. Sharma that that Gehlot’s experience will help him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ready-for-any-role-that-party-gives-me-says-raghu-sharma/articleshow/86902714.cms||---

Last year, the Centre had pushed for home-based test kits to decrease the load on laboratories. Dr Samiran Panda, head, epidemiology and communicable diseases, said even as the apex research institute has approved three home-based test kits, it is up to states to decide on them.

On his complaint, another case was registered. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Alok Kumar said, during the probe, they arrested one Vinit from Gurgaon. He admitted that Goel and Sumit Yadav were the main conspirators. Later, a team formed under ACP (crime branch) Girish Kaushik arrested Goel from Noida and Yadav was caught outside the Chandigarh high court. Special commissioner of police (crime) Devesh Srivastava said, to settle an old dispute with Mittal, Goel, along with his associates, committed the crime. “Vinit was PSO of Goel and Yadav was his friend. He started threatening the survivor with the help of two of his associates,” the officer said. Vinit was also sent to Civil Lines Metro Station for threatening the survivor. Yadav, as per plan, was present at the spot and later became a witness. In 2016-17, Goel had duped people of more than Rs 200 crore on the pretext of providing them cheap smartphones. “After coming from jail, he started dry fruits business. He again duped people,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/freedom-251-scamster-held-for-threat-calls/articleshow/86900836.cms||---

The Government Railway Police (GRP) on Saturday said one of the robbers sexually assaulted a 20-year-old woman passeger. The passengers were robbed of their belongings, mostly cellphones, worth over Rs 96,300 when the train was in motion through the tunnels in the ghat. There is a series of six tunnels between Igatpuri station in Nashik district, which is at a height of 598m above the mean sea level, and Kasara station, located at 293m above the mean sea level. The GRP of Kalyan station has lodged an FIR against the robbers and four of them have so far been arrested. Valuables worth over Rs34,000 were recovered from them. GRP-Mumbai commissioner Quaiser Khalid said, “The robbers boarded the train at Igatpuri station, where it had a technical halt. After the train crossed the mandatory ‘stop’ point and started descending the ghat, these robbers started targeting the passengers.” The officer said when the train approached the Kasara station, some of the passengers pulled the alarm chain at 7.09pm and called for help. “Alerted by this, the GRP personnel on duty went to that coach and arrested the kingpin of the gang. The rest of the robbers managed to flee,” Khalid said. “The GRP personnel conducted search operation throughout the night and more personnel were sought from Kalyan. Three more robbers were subsquently arrested. Two of them are residents of Ghoti village near Igatpuri in Nashik district,” a GRP official said. All four arrested were in the age group of 19-21 years. Khalid said the woman, who was abused, was taken for medical examination by a female GRP officer. “Her condition is stable. We are making all efforts to arrest the remaining members of the gang involved in the robbery,” said Khalid. The officer also said he was in touch with the Nashik rural superintendent of police and getting the suspects’ past records checked to ensure maximum punishment. He said measures were being taken to ensure proper patrolling increases, especially in the trains that cross the ghat section at night. He also stressed on intensifying the frisking of section of people who were travelling alone and even without luggage just to try and find out the intentions of such persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/armed-men-rob-passengers-on-pushpak-express-4-held/articleshow/86895916.cms||Abhilash Botekar

There was no planning. Who do you call a culprit? Two cars collide, both drivers step out and fight on the street. What is that? That’s a reaction. It’s not murder,” Bhartiya Kisan Union spokesperson Tikait said at a press conference organised by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of protesting farmer organisations, in Delhi. When asked if he considers those who killed the BJP workers guilty, he responded, “Nahin maante doshi (I don’t accept they’re culprits).” Tikait has been leading the negotiations on behalf of farmers with the government since the violence on Sunday, in which four farmers, two BJP workers, a journalist and a driver were killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/reaction-to-action-not-murder-says-tikait-on-bjp-workers-killing/articleshow/86898844.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Air travel demand up in festive season, fares soar on weekends||MUMBAI: Festive season demand for travel has sent airfares for non-stop flights soaring on several domestic routes. This is being seen with fares from Mumbai to places like Dehradun, Srinagar, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Patna, Kochi. Airfares to foreign destinations open to Indians too are high, with the only exception of Male, where fares are currently cheaper than those to some domestic destinations. There is a pattern to domestic fares — a return ticket costs higher, especially if the return is on a Sunday or weekend. Passengers who haven’t booked air tickets for October-November Diwali travel can escape high fares by opting to return on a weekday and get a 20-30% cheaper return fare. Like, on Saturday, cheapest return fare on Mumbai-Dehradun non-stop flights around October-end and return on November 7, a Sunday, began at Rs 35,000. It was Rs 29,300 on November 8, a Monday. A yatra.com spokesperson said: “For hotels and flights, we’ve seen an upward trend and 40-50% increase in booking queries with the incoming of the festive season.” Rikant Pittie, co-founder, EaseMyTrip said: “We’ve seen that airfares can go up around 70% at the last minute and on the week of Diwali. Previously, we had seen a jump of almost 65% on air bookings for the long weekend of Ganesh Chaturthi and a 54% jump on air bookings for the long weekend of Janmashtami. It indicates a trend where people are utilising the festive season to travel. So we are optimistic that travel bookings will pick up during the festive season as we have seen a jump of around 450% in advance bookings for Diwali week when compared to last year.” Fares are not only high on international routes, there is a dearth of seats on non-stop flights. Anoop Kanuga of Bathija Travels said: “India should allow airlines to slowly increase capacity on international routes by at least 15-25% a month, depending on route density, until they reach pre-Covid capacity.” Pittie said international travel is expected to grow in the upcoming festive season. “There’s been a 50% jump in international travel bookings in the current period as against start of the year between January- March,” Pittie said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-air-travel-demand-up-in-festive-season-fares-soar-on-weekends/articleshow/86902776.cms||---

The families of both have now said that no senior party leader has come to visit them yet. Shyam Sundar, 32, was a contractual labourer who was appointed booth in- charge for BJP at Singha Kalan village. Locally, he was the party’s Dalit mobiliser. “He would be at every BJP event in the area. He was loyal to the party,” his father Balak Ram told TOI. He was talking to two policemen about security when TOI visited his house. “Shyam loved watching wrestling. He would go watch the annual event at Banbirpur every year. That day, he’d left for the match early in the morning.” A video of Shyam, pleading for mercy upon being beaten up by farmers after the convoy he was part of ran over protesters, was shared widely. “He never harmed anyone," Balak said. Farmer leaders, meanwhile, have maintained that they handed Sundar over to the police alive. “I am not sure,” he said. “But it would mean a lot if party leaders tried to help me get justice. No one has reached out yet.” In Lakhimpur city, a similar narrative has been playing out. Shubham Mishra, the other BJP worker who died at 29, was also a booth in-charge of BJP. Married three years ago, he left behind a year-old daughter. “He would actively participate in BJP’s work in the region. But not one senior BJP leader has visited us the way political leaders of other parties have met the families of farmers who died,” said Vijay Mishra, Shubham’s father, a businessman. “No senior party leader came to fight for us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/no-party-leader-visited-us-say-families-of-2-bjp-workers-killed-in-kheri-violence/articleshow/86898958.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nashik||Maharshtra: RPF steps up security on passenger trains||Nashik: The Bhusawal division of the Central Railway (CR) has taken a series of decision to enhance passenger security on trains plying on one of the busiest divisions by increasing the number of personnel in the escort party. Bhusawal division railway manager Shambhu Kedia on Saturday chaired a meeting involving top officials following the armed robbery in the Igatpuri-Kasara section of the neighbouring Mumbai division. Divisional security commissioner Kshitij Gurav said that in all long-distance trains the Railway Protection Force (RPF) squads would be increased from existing three members to four with immediate effect. “Earlier, we had a three-member escort party in the train, among them one officer was armed. We will have an additional RPF personnel who will also be armed now,” said the officer. According to him, the suspects, who boarded the train at Igatpuri, were ‘unauthorised’ since only passengers with confirmed tickets were allowed entry to any railway station at present. “We have taken a note of this and we are writing to all railway station authorities across the division to ensure that the unauthorized entry was strictly restricted,” the officer added. “We are also in the process of informing RPF personnel across all stations to step up their vigilance and examine the trains, when they halt to keep an eye on any kind of trouble in the coaches,” he added. Bhusawal division is the busiest division in the country as a number of trains running from Mumbai towards eastern India, West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, and towards north, Uttar Pradesh, New Delhi and Punjab, run through the route. According to the officer, senior RPF officials have also been decided to carry out surprise checks in trains to ensure the escort parties patrol all coaches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rpf-steps-up-security-on-passenger-trains/articleshow/86895935.cms||Abhilash Botekar

A police team reached the spot after receiving information, appealed to them to maintain peace and warned them from creating law and order situation, but they refused,” said senior inspector Shankar Khatke. “The suspects picked up a dispute with the cops over the issue of not allowing them to take out a rally. After the dispute between the two parties turned heated, they hurled abuses, charged at the policemen, and deterred them from discharging duty,” he said. “The suspects, fearing arrest, took to heels, but the policemen nabbed two men after a brief chase and brought them to the police station. The duo, during questioning, told police that they were planning to organise grand dinner party to celebrate Ukare’s release on bail,” he said. Khatke said, “Investigations revealed that the suspects created a reign of terror among local residents and violated the Pune police order prohibiting them from carrying weapons and forming an unlawful assembly. The suspects’ plan to take out a rally was foiled because of the timely information received by the police,” he said. An FIR relating to rioting, forming unlawful assembly and deterring policemen from discharging duty was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act, Maharashtra Police Act, and the Criminal Law Amendment Act, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-held-14-booked-over-jail-release-victory-rally/articleshow/86900888.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kallar-Ponmudi road: PWD submits report on damages||Thiruvananthapuram: The public works department (PWD) on Friday submitted a report to the government on the damages the Kallar-Ponmudi road suffered when the Kallar river overflowed on Tuesday. The road suffered damages worth over Rs 60 lakh as the river overflowed following heavy rains. Currently, tourist activities at Ponmudi hill station and Kallar eco tourist centre are halted owing to the Kallar ward being a Covid containment zone. According to the PWD authorities, the road near Kallar has suffered serious damages after the retaining wall that protected the road from the Kallar river was destroyed for more than 75 meters. The damages have been reported at a crucial spot just before the first hair pin curve after the Kallar ecotourism ticket counter. Though the road is currently motorable through one lane, and it is feared that the increased volume of traffic might lead to adversities if extreme care is not maintained, the PWD officials who inspected the spot claimed. On Friday, the PWD authorities forwarded a report informing the government regarding the damages and expressing the need for immediate maintenance works. Another report with the estimated budget needed for the works will be submitted to the government on Monday. ''As per our assessment the maintenance works here will need a budget of at least Rs 60 lakhs,'' said a PWD official attached to the Nedumangad sub division. It was only on last Monday, the PWD launched another work worth Rs 27 lakhs to repair the damages suffered by the road during the rains in the month of June. The road between hairpin curves 11 and 12 suffered damages at several spots after the soil under it eroded. This resulted in depressions forming on the road surface. The rainwater kept seeping in through the gaps formed by soil erosion whenever it rained, posing a risk of caving in of the road. Besides this, crash barriers at hairpin curves 18 had also collapsed during the rain. The place was closed for tourists for a few weeks after the damages were reported. Meanwhile, the police authorities said that there was no reason to worry at present. Additional Superintendent of Police Raj Prasad of Nedumangad sub division said that despite the damages on the road, safety of tourists and motorists in general can be ensured through proper traffic management. ''We are expecting the containment zone restrictions at the Kallar ward will be lifted in a few days and in the meantime we are taking necessary steps to improve the traffic management on the road by employing new tactics,'' the Additional Superintendent of Police said. The Ponmudi road was not the only one that suffered damages. Two tribal villages at Mannakkudi and Devakkal were isolated from the mainland after the panchayat road leading to these villages from Kallar was destroyed in the flash flood that occurred on Tuesday. Senior officials of revenue, police and PWD departments have visited the area and assessed the damages ahead of launching maintenance works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kallar-ponmudi-road-pwd-submits-report-on-damages/articleshow/86879135.cms||---

---||Nashik||Must address inequality in mental healthcare: Experts||AURANGABAD: On the occasion of World Mental Health Day (October 10), which this year has ‘Mental Health in an Unequal World’ as the theme, experts have highlighted that inequality prevails in many aspects within the Indian society that makes it a Herculean task to get the desired attention. Neuropsychologist Dr Shraddha Jadhav-Vakil said it was common in our society for communities to be largely shaped by caste, religion, socio-economic status, gender, as well as sexual orientation, which, in turn, decide the quality and ease of access to mental health service for those in need. “The most important aspect to be taken into consideration is that inequality happens knowingly or unknowingly. The public health system is failing to address the issue due to inadequate research. It is expected to protect the vulnerable groups, especially the poor and marginalised people, by addressing the inequities induced due to societal conditions,” she said. Citing examples, Jadhav-Vakil said people from the lower strata of the society, a large section of women and members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (Queer) community are often subjected to the issue of inequality in mental healthcare. Consultant neuropsychiatrist Dr Gaurav Murambikar said vulnerable groups and the public at large should understand the benefits of investing in mental health. “By investing in mental health, one can reap the benefits in multiple crisis situations and old age. It can be achieved by following the basics such as avoiding all forms of addiction, regular and active participation in family and social gatherings, balanced diet, regular mental and physical check-ups, and avoiding unnecessary stress,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/must-address-inequality-in-mental-healthcare-experts/articleshow/86895943.cms||---

Authorities claimed this is for the first time in the state that the open source apps have been used to detect cases. Taking cognisance of the trend of some people who have defaulted on vehicle loans using vehicles with forged number plates, Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta directed registration of cheating cases. Soon after implementing the initiative earlier this year, the police officers noticed impressive results, following which, detailed training was imparted to all the four divisions of the traffic police, crime branch as well as to the police station personnel. Crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav told TOI, “We have effectively used open source intelligence and were able to get some impressive results within a short span of six months.” The training included using the Parivahan App, traffic e-challan machine, RTO office’s official data, CCTNS data as well as the data compiled by the modus operandi branch. Accordingly, each policeman on stopping a vehicle, cross verifies its details. Using the applications, Aurangabad city’s traffic police have managed to detect 47 cases of cheating as well as vehicle thefts. “Amongst all the apps, e-challan is turning out to be more useful as it is connected with RTO data. The moment a vehicle registration number is punched, we get all the information including colour, make, model, year of passing, owner, address, engine number, chassis number,” said assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Suresh Wankhede.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/open-source-apps-help-crack-100-cases/articleshow/86895948.cms||Mohammed Akhef

But passing through terminal 2 of the Mumbai airport to reach the boarding gates was not as chaotic as it was on Friday. Many morning flights were delayed, largely by 20-25 minutes, showed Flightradar24, a live flight tracking app.  Deepa Verma (name changed), a media professional, said: “I reached the airport at 8.15 am for my 10.30 am flight. I spent 20-25 minutes in queue to enter the airport and another 40-45 minutes to clear security. I had no check-in bags, so thankfully could skip that queue.” She said airport staff were milling around, moving passengers to shorter queues. The airport continued to make its appearance on social media. Photos taken inside the terminal building showed crowds waiting to clear security. “Never seen Mumbai airport mad like this ever. Not even back in the day. This is just another kind of mad. Again kudos to the staff and CISF,” tweeted @virnakai. A low-cost airline official said that Friday morning is the most popular day of the week to fly out of the city. “Since Pune airport will be shut from October 16 to 29, we’re expecting higher passenger load on October 22-,” the source said. Airports Authority of India data showed that Pune airport handled 8,900 domestic passengers per day in August. “Though majority of Pune passengers are likely to postpone their flights or claim a refund, many might route their journey via Mumbai, given the festive season,” the source added. Airlines like GoFirst have offered Pune passengers the choice to board from Mumbai. GoFirst though will be moving all its flights to terminal 1 at Parle from October 13. “Other busy days for Mumbai T2 would be the weekend days of October 16,17, 23 and 24. T2 congestion will ease next month as IndiGo will move some of its flights to T1-Parle on October 31,” the source said. Mumbai International Airport Ltd had announced on Friday that over the next four day, the airport will be installing additional X-ray machines for cabin bag scanning and will be deploying additional personnel to handle passenger inflow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-festive-weekend-rush-continues-with-long-queues-to-enter-airport/articleshow/86902848.cms||---

---||Delhi||‘Perception that Hitler was friend of India flawed’||Right from his days as a struggling politician giving speeches in the beer halls of Munich to the day he killed himself in a bunker in Berlin, Adolf Hitler made no secret of his views about India and Indians. “In 1936, while addressing a political rally in Munich, Hitler said that Indians could not even walk and that it was the British who taught them how to walk,” said Vaibhav Purandare, author of ‘Hitler and India: The Untold Story of his Hatred for the Country and its People’, in a Times Litfest conversation with Kishwar Desai that served as a quick refresher course in the forgotten chapters and missing nuances of India's history from the time Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose shook hands with the German dictator during the Second World War. “For Hitler, race was everything. The brown and black races did not count as human beings,” said Purandare, whose decade-long investigation of Hitler's attitude towards India was prompted by a passage he stumbled upon in ‘Mein Kampf’, Hitler's biography . “I was completely taken aback because in that passage, Hitler was abusive about India and dismissive of its demand for freedom,” said Purandare. Besides complexities such as why India had sought Germany's help in the freedom struggle despite being aware of Hitler's anti-India stance, the session also offered insights into the contradictions of one of 20th century's most controversial figures who--unlike what his military uniform suggested--was prone to waking up late, having lazy lunches and watching movies at his Bavarian mansion. When the author attributed post-Independence India’s flawed perception of Hitler as “a friend of the Indian people” not only to the iconic black-and-white image of Bose’s meeting with Hitler in 1942 but also to Hitler having fought the British during the Second World War, the sub-text was clear: the enemy’s enemy isn’t necessarily a friend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/perception-that-hitler-was-friend-of-india-flawed/articleshow/86903582.cms||---

After five months, he had developed a community of friends and they played an online multi-player roleplaying game. The teen’s parents started worrying about him when his grades started falling, he complained of fatigue, remained irritated and had difficulty in concentration. Detox is generally associated with cleansing of the body. However, city-based psychologists and psychiatrists are increasingly turning to ‘digital detox’ for teenagers and even younger children, to deal with screen addictions. Dr Deepti Bhatt, a psychiatrist with the Government Hospital for Mental Health (HMH), said that before the pandemic, they used to get about one case every month with parents complaining about excessive digital device use. “After the pandemic, we are getting an average of four cases per week, a twenty-fold increase,” she said. Thus, HMH is inaugurating a ‘Digital Wellness Centre’ primarily aimed at digital detox for children and adults. “The pandemic worsened our digital dependence and this has far-reaching implications, especially for the toddlers who don’t understand the addiction,” said Dr Ajay Chauhan, medical superintendent of HMH. “In many kids, it reduces social interaction, and in turn their ability to learn words and motor skills.” Dr Pradip Vaghasiya, MD of city-based GIPS and psychiatrist, said that they have seen cases where the persons might be glued to the screen for up to 14 hours. “In about 50-60% patients, it leads to frustration and anger, in 40-50% cases lack of concentration, in 30-40% cases anxiety and palpitation. We lead them to ‘disconnect to reconnect’ and ask them to explore the world outside the screens,” he said. Experts emphasized phase-wise weaning off of children and teens. Priyanka Adalaja, a senior counselor at Jeevan Aastha, said the pandemic gave children greater access to digital devices, something that fascinated them and also introduced them to a whole new world. “Thus, we have seen cases of pornography addiction, gaming addiction, online splurging using their parents’ cards, romantic relationships online or simply getting dazzled by social media,” she said. “We tell callers that there’s a huge difference between the real and virtual world, and they must not sacrifice the former for the latter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/care-facilities-start-digital-detox-for-teenagers/articleshow/86900961.cms||Parth Shastri

The museum is a joint venture between the tourism department and the Southern Air Command of the Air Force. The museum was inaugurated by minister for tourism P A Mohamed Riyas in the presence of Air Marshal J Chalapati, Air Officer Commanding-In-Chief of the Southern Air Command. The idea of building a museum was conceptualised at the Southern Air Command in 2018. The concept was taken up with the department of tourism and was mutually agreed to execute the project. The infrastructure cost of the museum was agreed to be borne by the tourism department while exhibits in the museum would be provided by the Air Force. The work for the museum commenced in October 2019 and the project was completed in record time. The aim of the aircraft museum is to make it a highly attractive tourism spot for the public within and outside Kerala and also to motivate the youth of the state of to join the Air Force. The museum has been built in the shape of an aircraft which is an unmistakable symbol of aviation. A flight simulator is also installed in the museum which will give realistic piloting experience to the public. The project is being implemented in two phases. The first phase is being implemented at a cost of Rs 88 lakhs and the second phase costs Rs 99 lakhs, tourism department officials said. The tourism department expect the aircraft museum and the flight simulator to be crowd pullers. The simulator has been set up on the ground floor of the museum. Entry will be restricted to one person at a time in the simulator. A motivational kiosk that will celebrate the glorious achievements of the Air Force awaits the visitors on the upper floor. The pictures and information depicting the history of the Air Force will also be displayed at the museum.

Chief officer of the MMC, Agnelo Fernandes, had urged traders last week to come forward and repay the taxes owed by them to the municipality to help it tide over the financial crisis. The ‘weekend drive’ received a good response, Fernandes said, as many traders visited the municipality and paid up their outstanding taxes on Saturday. “Many citizens and businessmen after repaying their outstanding taxes, called me up personally, thanking me for the reminder and initiative, and making it easy to repay, especially through the online option,” MMC chief officer said. The drive continues with online repayment option provided by the council on https://goaulbservice.gov.in/Margao.aspx, https://goaulbservice.gov.in/PayHouseTax.aspx. “Ten teams with six officials each visited most of the areas within municipal jurisdiction on Saturday. The teams were earlier briefed on their approach and pitch and cautioned to politely request and not force to repay their dues, with the theme – ‘Municipality at your Doorstep’, Fernandes said. About 100 staff of MMC participated in the drive. Fernandes said that MMC will adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards those doing businesses without trade licences and permissions. He said he will not tolerate any such activities and will come down heavily in yet another drive against illegal businesses. The MMC has given a time limit of upto October 15 for existing businesses to apply for a trade licence. “We have given a long rope to the defaulters. MMC has been very understanding to the hardships due to the virus and lockdowns, but we have now opened up and business is as usual; MMC also needs income for it to function efficiently,” Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-civic-body-nets-rs-3-3l-in-weekend-tax-drive/articleshow/86902970.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Now, Mumbai police cyber cell summons CBI director Subodh Jaiswal||MUMBAI: The cyber cell police station of Mumbai Police issued summons to IPS officer and CBI director Subodh Jaiswal to record his statement on October 14 as part of its probe into the leak of a confidential report by former state intelligence chief on political influence in postings. The report by IPS officer Rashmi Shukla was submitted last year to then DG of Maharashtra police, Jaiswal. Both were at loggerheads with state government over the issue and opted for Central government deputation. Jaiswal was unavailable for comment and a CBI spokesperson declined to comment. Acting DGP (Maharashtra) Sanjay Pandey and chief secretary Sitaram Kunte did not appear before CBI on Saturday to record statements in a corruption case against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. CBI is investigating the case against Deshmukh for asking now dismissed police officer Sachin Waze, to illegally collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month. Pandey and Kunte reportedly cited a prior engagement and sought another date. The cyber cell is investigating Shukla’s role in the leak. Last year, Shukla was commissioner of Maharashtra’s SID when phones of influential people were tapped by her department. Some were politically connected and were allegedly heard discussing transfers and posting of officers, including IPS officers, in exchange for money. Shukla submitted a report on phone-tapping to the chief minister through then DGP Jaiswal and additional secretary (home) but no action was taken. After former city police chief Param Bir Singh said Deshumukh demanded money from restaurants and bars through Waze in March, Shukla’s report leaked and Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis demanded a probe. Shukla moved Bombay HC, saying Maharashtra government made her a “scapegoat” and was harassing her by registering an FIR in the phone-tapping case. HC is to hear Shukla’s quashing petition against the cyber cell FIR against unknown persons into the ‘report leak’ on October 20. On October 1, the state continued its May 6 statement of “no coercive action’’ against the ex-intel chief. HC’s order said relief will continue till October 21. Cyber police earlier recorded Shukla’s statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/now-mumbai-police-cyber-cell-summons-cbi-director-jaiswal/articleshow/86902932.cms||Vijay V Singh

On being alerted by their son, fire and rescue services personnel rushed to the spot and put out the fire. They recovered the burned bodies of the couple and sent them to Government Rajaji Hospital for postmortem.

The intensity was such that walls and windows of even the adjacent houses developed cracks. The explosion almost engulfed the Bind family, most of whom were in slumber when the incident took taken place at 5.45am. The family suffered losses worth more than Rs10 lakh. Gajanan Bind, 60, was almost swept away by the blast that left him scalded. His wife Urmila, 55, and Arti, 29, were also injured in the incident. Gajanan's grandson, Sankey Wankhede, too received some burns. Furniture, walls, electronics gadgets like TV and other materials were damaged in the explosion. Fire officer Anil Gode from Ganjipeth fire station and his team responded quickly after cops alerted them. The fire team under the supervision of chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake ensured that the losses were restricted to some extent. Sources stated the Bind family had replaced a refilled LPG cylinder around couple of days ago. It's learnt the family used to utilize the LPG gas for bathroom geyser too apart from kitchen. Senior inspector Mukund Thakre of Kotwali police station said that the prima facie reason behind the blast is LPG leakage. “Before trying to open the kitchen door, Gajanan switched on the light which probably worked as an ignition for the blast. We have summoned various agencies, including sniffer dogs and bomb detection and disposal squad (BDDS), to probe the matter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/four-injured-in-lpg-cylinder-explosion/articleshow/86894447.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Many doctors, who were transferred to government-run medical colleges in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Rajkot to fill up vacant positions ahead of the Medical Council of India’ (MCI) inspection, are yet to be re-transferred, three months after the inspection is completed, said sources close to the development. Earlier this year, a large number of doctors who are professors and associate professors were transferred from BJ Medical College to six colleges in the state where MCI inspections were to be carried out for postgraduate courses. “At BJ Medical College, there is likely to be a decline in seats in PG medicine and PG anaesthesia programmes. A similar situation has been created at medical colleges in places like Rajkot and Vadodara as well,” said sources. There are 1,874 PG medical seats in the state. “Such transfers are routine. Once inspections are over, the government sends the teachers back to their original postings. But there has been a delay in this process this year,” said sources. Presently, there are six seats per unit per academic year. A unit consists of one professor, one assistant professor and an associate professor. While three seats are earmarked for the professor, two are for assistant professor and one seat is marked for associate professor. There is a cap of six seats per unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/number-of-pg-med-seats-may-decline/articleshow/86901002.cms||---
---||Madurai||Chance to win washing machine, gold used to lure people to take Covid vaccine across Tamil Nadu||MADURAI: Gold coins, washing machines, smartphones are among the prizes announced by various district administrations and corporations to lure the people to take vaccine against Covid-19, at the fifth mega vaccine drive to be conducted across the state on Sunday. Madurai Corporation has 75,000 doses and will carry out the vaccine drive through 500 booths in its limits. City health officer Dr S Raja said that they had already been able to vaccinate the entire eligible population in seven of the corporation wards, which included ward 10, 12, 46, 68 and 82, in the previous camps. Twenty more wards were what the civic body aimed at fully covering in Sunday’s mega camp. To achieve it, the workers went on a door-to-door survey to get the status. “People above 18 years of age, who had not vaccinated and are willing to take the vaccine, would be invited to the nearest booth for taking the jab. That is how we achieved full coverage in the seven wards,” he said. On Sunday, those who take their vaccines, first or second dose, would be given tokens. Lots would be drawn and the lucky winners stand to win prizes given by the corporation, which includes, a first prize which would be a washing machine, two second prizes of android phones, ten third prizes of pressure cookers, and thirty consolation prizes of sarees or dhoties. In all 13 panchayat blocks in the rural Madurai as well, prizes worth around Rs 2 lakh will be given away for lucky winners selected by drawing during the mega Covid-19 vaccination drive. “We will collect the list of names of all those who are taking the first dose from all panchayats in the block. Later, panchayat unions will draw lots to determine the winners,” said a panchayat official. Two lucky winners will get a bicycle or a mixie, while three lucky winners will get a pressure cooker. As many as 50 lucky winners will also get silver vessels. “In the first two mega vaccination drives, we received incredible responses. The public response started waning, during the past two camps so we are hoping that such incentives will motivate the public to come to the camps on Sunday,” added the panchayat official. In Kanyakumari district, meanwhile, it has been announced that 22 lucky winners will get a gold coin of 1g each. One person getting their first dose and one person getting their second dose in the mega vaccination drive will be picked as winners in each of the nine panchayat unions and the corporation in Kanyakumari. Further, two more winners will be picked at district level. Theni district collector M V Muralidharan has conducted fifteen street corner meetings asking people to take their vaccines on time. He recalls an incident where he was able to take a teenager from a tribal village to take her vaccine, by telling her that she would not be able to see her favourite actor Vijay’s movie if she did not take her vaccines now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/chance-to-win-washing-machine-gold-used-to-lure-people-to-take-covid-vaccine-across-tamil-nadu/articleshow/86900993.cms||---

Police said the accused man was claiming the woman had stolen Rs 20 from him and an argument was going on. The victim, who runs a pan kiosk, tried to pacify the quarrel, during which the accused picked up a stone and hit him, leading to his death. The woman could not give an exact description of the youth, who fled the spot. According to the police, late on Wednesday night, a call was received about a kiosk owner being hit by a stone. “A team of police officers reached the location where they came to know that the injured had been transferred to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital by CATS Ambulance. The injured was identified as Radhe Shyam, who was undergoing treatment at the hospital. During the treatment, he died and the body was shifted to the mortuary.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Garba curbed, no amour in snoops’ eyes||AHMEDABAD: In normal times, about a month ahead of Navratri, a professional detective’s office would be flooded with calls from spouses, in-laws, and parents wanting surveillance on their favourite suspects. Before the pandemic, young men and women venturing out during Navratri were followed, their activities monitored, and their families and future partners informed about their whereabouts and encounters. However, this year garba circles have shrunk with events going private due to the Covid-19 pandemic and so have people’s incomes. Therefore, the focus of local Sherlocks has turned on helping corporate houses and politicians track rivals, and on finding missing persons. Not that professional detectives didn’t have other streams of revenue before. But the Navratri period brought significant business two to three years ago. However, the pandemic, income cuts, and digital proliferation have caused a paradigm shift in the way these professional detectives operate. M M Khan, an Ahmedabad-based professional detective, said: “There are few queries and cases from families and individuals.” Khan added: “The reason is pretty clear: people don’t have spare income. Instead, we’ve been getting a slew of requests to help find missing persons.” Khan went on to say: “Corporate houses and private company owners too approach us with a variety of cases. They want financial gains, they want to know what their rivals are up to.” Information is a powerful tool, Khan said. “Before the pandemic, we used to hire informers, especially during Navratri. The circumstances have undergone a major shift now,” Khan added. Professional detectives said that they are also getting an increasing number of inquiries from politicians in the run-up to the elections. The widespread use of social media is disrupting snooping too. “With social media, people themselves stalk their suspects online, keeping close tabs on who they interact with,” said another city-based professional detective. “It is easy to track movements based on people’s posts and therefore a professional detective’s services are less in demand.” Nayan Trivedi, a city-based detective, said that this year he got about 50 requests from families, mainly NRIs. “Many of them approach us for a background check of their spouses-to-be,” Trivedi said. “Some who got married and left the country want to keep an eye on their spouses stuck here due to the pandemic.” He added: “But the requests have drastically gone down. I used to attend to at least 100 cases before the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/garba-curbed-no-amour-in-snoops-eyes/articleshow/86901033.cms||Niyati Parikh

They said Sri Lankan Navy has been lining up its vessels along the international maritime boundary line (IMBL) like a wall from Wednesday to protect their fishermen. The accident had happened within Sri Lankan waters, beyond Katchatheevu, on Monday night, sparking strong protests at Kurunagar near Yalpanam, where the three fishermen hail from. Lankan fishermen have been staging protests urging their government to put an end to Indian fishermen entering their waters.N J Bose, president of a mechanised boat association in Rameswaram, said, “We are unable to catch fish in Katchatheevu area (in Sri Lanka) which is our traditional fishing ground and are returning empty handed.” He attributed banned bottom trawling for the accident and the increasing attacks on Tamil Nadu fishermen by the Lankan navy. “There are 634 registered mechanised boats in Rameswaram. There are around 300 unregistered bottom trawlers here that damage the sea bed and fishing grounds on Indian waters and are now doing it on Lankan waters,” he said.With Indian fishermen encountering violent attacks on and off from Sri Lankan Navy, Monday’s accident has left Rameswaram fishermen worried. As a self-disciplining measure, mechanised boat owners have urged the state and Union governments to inspect illegal bottom trawling high power engine boats and stop them being used for fishing. They also said that the government must identify the Indian boat involved in Monday’s accident, punish its operators and make them pay compensation to the affected Lankan fishermen. At a meeting of ten mechanised boat associations on Saturday, it was resolved to facilitate action against erring high power boats from the island. They announced a week-long strike in support of these and other demands.Resolutions were also passed seeking intervention of governments to get back the traditional fishing rights in Katchatheevu and to arrest the soaring diesel price that is making it difficult for them to go fishing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fishers-worried-after-3-lankans-injured-in-accident-involving-indian-trawler/articleshow/86901005.cms||---

Donations, both from individuals as well as corporate bodies, have started pouring at the hospital for the unit. While its accessories has been donated by Crompton Greaves Ltd from its corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, the Institute of Kidney Diseases (IKD) is providing technical support to the unit. “We had just finished installation of the haemodialysis machine. And on the very first day of Navratri, we did haemodialysis on the minor who had visited many hospitals in the past six weeks and finally reached us with renal failure, severe metabolicacidosis with severe anaemia,” said Dr Sheila Aiyer, head of paediatric department. Aiyer said that so far, such children with kidney failure and severe anaemia had to be referred to Ahmedabad as the government hospital was not equipped to handle such cases. “Now, we have become the first public hospital in Central Gujarat which has a functional haemodialysis unit,” she said. The department in total has received Rs 1 crore worth equipment, including hi-end ventilators that have been donated by Crompton CSR foundation, apart from five paediatric ventilators that have been donated by Siemens CSR foundation. The neonatal intensive care unit of SSG Hospital takes care of around 4,500 newborns every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ssg-now-has-a-fully-functional-hemodialysis-unit/articleshow/86901077.cms||---

The trust had also written a letter to chief minister Ashok Gehlot on September 9 to intervene in the matter as the gaushala is grappling with shortage of funds and health of the cows was getting affected. However, nothing has been in the matter so far. TimesViewRajasthan’s biggest cow shelter is facing an acute funds crunch despite the state having a dedicated department for cow welfare for which it levies surcharge on stamp duty and alcohol. Despite the civic bodies not releasing funds for Hingonia Gaushala for the past five months, there has been no effort by the state government to address the issue even after the chief minister was informed about it. The state must intervene and ensure that funds are released.With over Rs 6.52 crore of unsettled dues on corporations coupled with rising cattle population at the gaushala, sheltering the bovines is becoming a herculean task for the partner foundation. Raghupati Das, in-charge at the Centre said, “JMCHeritage has not cleared the dues of Rs 3.44 crore in the past five months. Similarly, JMC-Greater has not cleared dues of last 3 months, which amounts to Rs 3.7 crore.” An official at JMC-Heritage said the issue had occurred as JMC-Greater did not transfer grant money received by the state government in heritage corporation’s account. After the city was divided into two corporations, it was decided that 60% of the expenditure cost will be borne by Greater and 40% by heritage. “The state government also provides annually grant to the gaushala. The money was transferred into Greater corporation’s account as it was registered at the directorate of Gopalan. But, Greater till date has not transferred Rs 1.64 crore, due to which payment of gaushala cannot be released,” an official said. The trust is also apprehensive of receiving the state government’s forthcoming grant of Rs 3.97 crore in October as the Gopalan department has asked Greater corporation to transfer the previous payment. The cow shelter requires approximately 60 tonne fodder and 15,000 kg cattle feed per day worth Rs 6 lakh. As over 30 – 40 stray cows are brought to shelter from the city, the situation is expected to become grimmer in absence of funds. “As there is shortage of funds, we are providing less fodder and cattle feed. This could affect the health of the bovines at the shelter in the long run,” said a source at Hingonia. On October 28, 2017, Sri Krishna Balram Seva Trust (SKBT) entered into an agreement with the JMC for daily management of cattle rehabilitation after mass deaths were witnessed. In the letter to CM, the trust has also highlighted various problems of inadequate staff in maintaining the shelter with large population of cows and not revising the rates in past five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hingonia-gaushala-with-over-11-0000-cows-in-dire-straits-in-absence-of-funds/articleshow/86901079.cms||---

---||India||When Indira Gandhi said sorry to ‘Dear Jeh’||NEW DELHI: Former PM Indira Gandhi had written to JRD Tata shortly after he was removed as chairman of Air India by the Morarji Desai government in February 1978, saying she was “sorry” that he was no longer chairman of the airline — a position he held since March 1953. “Air India must be as sad at the parting as you yourself. You were not merely chairman but the founder and nurturer who felt deep personal concern,” Gandhi, who was not in office at that time, said in her handwritten letter to JRD Tata. The exchange between the two was shared on Twitter by Congress functionary Jairam Ramesh. “It was this and the meticulous care you gave to the smallest detail, including the decor and the saris of the hostesses, which raised Air India to the international level and indeed to the top of the list,” Gandhi said in her letter, adding that no one could take this satisfaction from JRD nor belittle the government’s debt to him. She addressed JRD as “Dear Jeh” in the letter. She also went on to refer to the “misunderstanding” between the two in her letter but did not elaborate. “There was some misunderstanding between us but it was not possible for me to let you know of the pressures under which I had to function and the rivalries within the ministry of civil aviation. I would like to say no more,” Gandhi said in her letter which was written on the Guwahati-Calcutta flight on February 14, 1978, according to the copy of the letter shared by Ramesh on Twitter. The senior Congress leader also attached JRD’s reply to Indira Gandhi on February 28, 1978. JRD addresses her as “Dear Indira” and said he was touched by the trouble she had taken to write to him regarding termination of his services by the government from Air India. “I was touched by your kind reference to the part I played in building up the airline. I was fortunate in the loyalty and enthusiasm of my colleagues and staff and the support I got from government without either of which I could have achieved little,” said JRD signing off the letter as “Jeh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/when-indira-said-sorry-to-dear-jeh/articleshow/86904625.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Residents protest alleged encroachment on DP road||Nagpur: Residents of around 20 localities on Saturday staged a protest over encroachment on Development Plan (DP) Road connecting Hazaripahad with Katol Road in West Nagpur. Congress corporator Kamlesh Chowdhary claimed that a portion of the proposed DP road admeasuring around 500 metre of the road portion had been illegally encroached by two persons — Jwala Dhote and Dr Prakash Jain. Local residents claimed that they had been using the road since 10 years and suddenly a few months ago, a portion of around 500 metre of the road had been encroached illegally. Residents gave a month’s time to the concerned authority to take necessary action to free the encroachment. “If they failed to act upon, we will open the road forcefully,” threatened Chowdhary. “Due to this encroachment, we are being forced to take a detour,” claimed a local resident Sarika Chawhan. TOI too spotted that fencing was done to prevent tresspassing. Even hoarding of Vidarbha Anyay Nivaran Samiti having pictures of Jwala Dhote was found there. With no other option left, residents of Hazaripahad, Anupam Society, Nasheman Society, Gayatri Colony, Jai Society are being forced to use a narrow road passing through Ganga Nagar slum in west Nagpur. Dharampeth zone’s assistant municipal commissioner Prakash Warade confirmed that there is some dispute in land reserved for DP road in Hazaripahad. He further said that a DP road has been proposed there. “Owner of the land said that unless proper formalities are being followed, he will not part with his piece of land,” said Warade. “Even he (owner) further claimed that the DP road plan has been revised and as per new plan the proposed site for new road has been changed,” the assistant commissioner pointed out. Another official from the zone said that it is being claimed that a piece of land is owned by one Prakash Jain. After the zone received complaints from the local residents about the encroachment on proposed DP road land, we approached the district collectorate to know the owner of the land and whether any DP road had been proposed or not. “During our inquiry, it came to fore that the portion of land encroached is a Nazul land. Even the 7/12 extract shows state government as property owner,” the official said. The NMC has sought the help of nazul department to initiate action against the encroacher. Once the road is cleared and NMC will get its possession, the remaining 500 mt DP road will be constructed, said the officer. TOI tried to contact Jain but he did not respond, while Dhote refuted the allegation made by local residents. She claimed that the land is owned by Jain who had purchased it some 40 years ago. “Fearing encroachment by land mafia, he fenced his premises,” she claimed hence she is protecting Jain from encroachment of his land. “If any DP road has been proposed, the government will do it by following all due procedures,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/residents-protest-alleged-encroachment-on-dp-road/articleshow/86894514.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Madurai Rifle Club Secretary S Velshankar said that around 170 shooters across Tamil Nadu are taking part in the competition held between October 8-10 in 12-18 years age group in air pistol and air rifle categories.Indian Olympic Association joint secretary DV Seetharama Rao, who is also the president of Tamil Nadu Shooting Association, said that the event to identify young shooters under Khelo India was being held in Tamil Nadu for the first time. “The Covid-19 pandemic definitely had an impact on shooters. The sport of shooting has specialized requirements and need for practice facilities, which could not be made available for shooters amidst the pandemic. However, now, things are reviving slowly,” he said.“Based on the results of the meet, shooters will be selected for the ‘Khelo India’ programme. Tamil Nadu is pushing for 18 shooters to be selected. Under the programme, shooters will get special care, undergo coaching camps, learn from foreign coaches, and be provided better equipment and support. In the long term, we are aiming to have more Tamil Nadu shooters bag international medals,” said Seetharama Rao.The meet, which will end on Sunday, saw participation from many talented young shooters, including from Madurai Rifle Club. Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, coaches and shooters did their best to stay in shape. “Shooting is an expensive sport comparatively and we need the support of parents. During the pandemic, we practised holding weapons and worked on mental and physical fitness from home. But, even then, it is still a challenge to get back to normal,” said K Amar Chakravarthy, a 19-year-old shooter, who has been competing in tournaments for more than eight years. Another shooter S Ragul,17, said that professional shooting sport requires a lot of investment and is hoping to get a better chance through the Khelo India programme.Young women shooters were also equally enthusiastic to participate. R Princy Beatrice said that in shooting, men and women have a level playing field and that many women shooters in Tamil Nadu and India have proven themselves with international achievements. “I got interested in shooting because of my uncle. Initially, it was something different compared to other sports. But, I started to enjoy it and it helps me improve with my concentration,” said S Samiksha, a 13-year-old shooter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/young-shooters-compete-in-state-level-meet/articleshow/86901092.cms||---

Cops said that as soon as they received reports on Friday night, they scanned CCTV footage around the gaushala. The footage showed the man abandoning the baby at 9.20pm on Friday. Later, the culprit was identified as Sachin Dixit. After dumping the baby, Dixit was spotted running away from the area.

He has alleged that the state government's mismanagement and wrong policies are the reasons for the current severe power crisis facing the state. It is alleged that the state government did not pay the coal companies on time. Due to mis management, the coal companies did not give full coal quota to the state. Due to the shortage of coal, the power generation units of many power plants in the state have to be closed. Electricity demand is highest during the current festive season. But the businessmen and common people are upset due to the mismanagement of the government. The government should have made arrangements by estimating the demand for electricity in the festive season in advance. But for the second time in the last three months due to government disturbances, the state is facing power crisis today. Rathore said that there was shortage of coal due to non-payment of coal companies on time and mismanagement by the state government. Five units of 250-250 MW of Suratgarh Thermal Power Plant are closed and due to technical reasons 1 unit of 660 MW of Chhabra, 1 unit of 600 MW of Kali Sindh and 3 units of 250 MW of Chhabra Thermal are closed. Despite no scheduled power cuts for the state capital announced by the JVVNL the other day, several places in Jaipur witnessed power outings. As per the JVVNL announcement, only municipal area except district headquarters to have power cut for an hour and rural areas to have four to five hours from Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rathore-seeks-mins-resignation-over-power-crisis/articleshow/86901155.cms||---

The affected private hospitals said this prolonged storage of huge quantities of BMW owing to partial pickup is hazardous to healthcare workers, frontline workers, patients and their relatives. SHD general manager Atul Panat admitted that their vehicles were unable to collect all the BMW from three big hospitals, which have Rs30 lakh dues pending. “Services for prompt payees are going on uninterrupted. The rates were revised as per norms by NMC approval. All are paying up, except these three. They are also provoking other hospitals to join them and not pay us. As their waste quantity is huge, we need a bigger vehicle. They also defaulted on Covid waste charges but we never made it an issue and continued the services,” he said. Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA), in a press note, claimed that hospitals have been regularly paying the waste disposal charges as per the agreement. The tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between NMC, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Nagpur and SHD — applicable for 30 years — states that the rates will be revised by 10% every year. The VHA note states, “Hospitals have been regularly paying the demanded Covid waste charges as well as the non-Covid waste charges (as per the previously agreed arrangement). The issue pertains to the hiked up part of non-Covid waste (so called ‘excess quantity’) charges unduly and unilaterally levied by the service provider. The so-called excess waste is well within the prescribed limit as specified in the authorization issued by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to the respective hospitals.” VHA has also written to the municipal commissioner, drawing his attention to the BMW pile up. “The contractor has alleged the hospitals have been asking the company to pick up more BMW without paying the excess charges. It has cited payment issues from hospitals’ end for this situation, which is patently incorrect. In fact, had the payment issue even been genuine, in the larger public interest, the service provider cannot stop or slow down (partial collection), which they are duty-bound to, in line with the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016,” the note adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-contractor-pvt-hospitals-in-tussle-over-waste-charges-amid-health-scare/articleshow/86894543.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The cloudburst which was first reported in LB Nagar zone around 5 pm spread to almost all the other areas of the city within the next 30 minutes. The intense rain triggered heavy inundation for the second consecutive day, as several low-lying regions across the city came under sheets of rainwater, with the GHMC building near Tank Bund recording 95.5 mm rainfall around 8.30 pm. In several localities surrounding Saroornagar lake, water was seen entering not just the residential colonies and houses but also commercial complexes. The Asian Shiva Ganga theatre at Gaddiannaram in Dilsukhnagar was flooded with rainwater which led to the collapse of a compound wall. Almost 50 parked vehicles were damaged in the mishap, the locals said. In Old City, life turned unpredictable for thousands of residents, especially those living in the downstream areas of Musi river, as heavy inflows from upstream areas led to opening of eight floodgates of Himayat Sagar and four flood gates of Osman Sagar with 5,600 and 2,250 cusecs outflows. The residents living in these low-lying areas said they had nowhere to go if their localities were inundated. “The officials have alerted us about the flood for the fourth or fifth time this year and yet not enough shelters or arrangements have been made,” Fatima Begum, a resident of Shaikpet, said. However, GHMC officials monitoring the situation said they have already issued a high alert in these areas and made necessary arrangements. “We have informed the locals that we are making all necessary arrangements in our community halls,” GHMC deputy commissioner, Charminar zone, G Rajnikanth said. Visuals of several vehicles and auto trolleys being swept away on the roads after the heavy rains on Friday also went viral on social media. In Old City, rainwater entered into an Irani cafe, where the customers were seen sitting and having food with their legs covered in floodwater. Other videos showed auto trolleys and cars parked being swept away in areas where the currents were stronger. Among the flooded areas in Old City, Yakutpura, Tolichowki, Rein Bazaar, Moazzam Jahi Market, Noorkhan Bazaar, Dabeerpura, Chatrinaka, Bahadurpura and Azampura were the worst affected. The downpour also disrupted traffic across all the major thoroughfares. Several commuters took to Twitter and posted visuals of vehicles being stuck on roads due to heavy inundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/thunderbolts-jolt-hyd-rain-pain-back-after-break/articleshow/86899169.cms||---

Pune city with 32 police stations has three senior women in-charge. Nagpur with 33 police stations has four women in-charge. Mumbai, having more than 90 police stations, has a dozen women in-charges, followed by Nagpur. Thane has only one police station with woman cop as in-charge while Aurangabad two. In addition, Nagpur has Aswati Dorje as the first joint CP. Women officers are also in-charge of units like state criminal investigation department (Rajlaxmi Shivankar), state intelligence department (Rashmi Nandedkar) and Government railway police, Nagpur (Manisha Kashid), in the city. In almost half a dozen police stations, women are second-in-command as senior inspector, crime, who had led from front in critical situations. Inspector Amita Jaipurkar had worked shoulder-to-shoulder with Parag Pote to close down Ganga Jamuna. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who had initiated the ‘Women’s era’ for Nagpur police, said the police stations were allotted to women cops based on merit and their abilities. “Women PIs are competent and at times better when it comes to crime prevention, detection, man management and crisis handling,” he said. The CP said that women cops also seem to be better responders to grievances. “A lesser number of complainants are approaching the higher level officers regarding issues of police stations,” he said while extolling efforts of Ashalata Khapre of Wathoda, Shubhangi Deshmukh of Bajaj Nagar and Vaijayanti Mandodhawde of Mankapur police stations, who were posted by him before Todase at Wadi. Joint CP Dorje said that she has found 99.9 % of women cops to be sincere. “They are active listeners, remain calm and don’t get stressed in crisis,” she said and added that women cops often prove better in winning trust of a victim which helps in the probe. Senior PI Khapre, who had rescued five minor girls last month, said she had led 18 raids against bootleggers, half a dozen gamblers and arrested two bookies. “My family stays in Pune. When I miss my children, we bring them to Nagpur but my focus is always on the job,” she said. Another senior PI Mandodhawde (Mankapur Ps) had made several detections in the last few months, recovering arms and weapons. She was probably the first women in-charge of bomb detection and disposal squad. After becoming the police station in-charge, Mandodhawde also roped in asst PI Mangala Mokashe as the first women in-charge of detection wing for a police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-women-in-charge-at-4-police-stations-city-at-2nd-place-in-state/articleshow/86894565.cms||Soumitra Bose

According to police, the accused, Nikhil Jose, declined the allegations and claimed to have changed the password of his social media account when the matter came to his notice. However, the police officials did not believe him as the messages were being sent for a period of over five months, but he never found out about the nature of those messages or deleted his account. Police said Jose was asked if he had filed a complaint at any cybercrime agency about it and he said he had informed the school principal about the matter who asked him not to report the matter to anyone and he will take care of the matter. Police said that the principal will be interrogated as he did not report the matter even when he was aware of the incident. “The teacher has claimed that he had informed the principal about the matter. Now it is a matter of separate investigation to see what he claimed is true,” a police official said. Meanwhile, the teacher was given bail on Saturday because police had booked him under bailable offences of the IT Act. “The case is under investigation and a chargesheet will be filed if all allegations are found to be true,” said an official. Police said that the role of the principal will also be examined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/school-principal-to-be-quizzed-after-teacher-held-over-lewd-texts/articleshow/86901224.cms||---
---||Delhi||North Delhi Municipal Corporation clears the way for Roshanara Bagh Lake 2.0||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation carried out a drive to clear plants from the dried-up Roshanara Bagh Lake on Saturday. The civic body officials said that this would help Delhi Jal Board initiate the establishment of a new sewage treatment plant (STP) for reviving the lake by the end of the month. The STP will have the capacity to generate 6-7 million litres daily of treated water — sufficient to fill the pond and irrigate parks within the 57-acre lake premises. A DJB official said, “While the tendering process for the restoration of the lake has been completed, work couldn’t start on time due to administrative reasons. As soon as the final budget is approved, we will issue a formal letter to the contractor selected to begin work at the site, possibly by the month-end.” The official explained, “We will tap water from the neighbouring sewer lines and treat it properly at the plant before utilising it. As for the north corporation clearing the weeds, they do it annually, as they did last year too.” The municipal corporation has also established a Jal Shakti Kendra where methods of water conservation and rainwater harvesting are being displayed through various mediums for the knowledge of the citizens. It will be inaugurated on Monday. Horticulture director Ashish Priyadarshani said the kendra would help resolve people’s queries about rainwater harvesting systems and other water related issues. “The initiative is a part of the Centre’s Jal Shakti Abhiyan. We are also exploring ways in which we can reach the maximum number of people,” Priyadarshani said. The concessionaire finalised by DJB will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the estimated Rs 11-crore STP plant for 15 years. The Roshanara Bagh lake has dried up because there is no channel for water supply. For some time, it was fed by rainwater and channels from Najafgarh drain. “But because of a change in the slope of the surrounding area and increased concretisation, it has been dry for a long time, except in 2012-14, when a railway underbridge was constructed nearby and water from the excavation site diverted here,” revealed a corporation official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpn-clears-the-way-for-roshanara-bagh-lake-2-0/articleshow/86901220.cms||Vibha Sharma

The Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) control room was flooded with complaints from across Greater Hyderabad since Saturday evening for restoration of power supply. Residents of several colonies were furious over non-restoration of power for over four hours. “Power snapped in our area on Saturday around 5 pm and was restored only at 9 pm. Since there was no power for so many hours, we could not even charge our phones and raise a complaint with the electricity department,” said G Sundeep, a resident of Hill Top colony at Erramanzil. Many other areas such as Begumpet, Fatehnagar, Qutbullahpur, Red Hills, Kavadiguda to name a few, reported power outage for several hours. Many aggrieved consumers took to Twitter seeking help from the TSSPDCL’s official handle. Sai Kanth Ghanathey @saikanthrocker tweeted, “Power outage in Kavadiguda. Trying to reach local office, unable to connect. Please look into the matter and resolve at the earliest.” The electricity department has attributed the power outages to heavy inundation and snapping of power lines and feeder issues across the city. “Major complaints were on feeder trips, electrical wire snapping, burning of transformers and poles and jumper cuts. In several areas the power cuts were due to snapping of power lines due to tree falls and tripping of feeder. Our teams are constantly working to address these issues,” TSSPDCL director (operations), G Srinivas Reddy, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/downpour-snaps-power-lines-locals-grapple-with-fury/articleshow/86899204.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Air quality dips to 3-month low||NEW DELHI: Following the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon, air quality has begun to deteriorate in Delhi. Track the pollution level in your cityWhile the capital’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was 167 (moderate) on Friday, the 24-hour average was 171 (moderate) on Saturday. In comparison, the AQI was 127 on Thursday and 114 on Wednesday. Experts say change in wind direction and reduction in surface wind speed are making it difficult for local pollutants to disperse freely. Instances of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana have also become more prominent. Data from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed this is Delhi’s worst AQI in nearly three months, with a worse AQI (178) last recorded on July 7. Back then, monsoon rains were yet to hit the city, with the onset over Delhi officially being declared only by July 13. “Wind direction has begun to change to westerly-northwesterly and local wind speed is not that high. Mist is now being seen in the morning and local pollutants are not dispersing as freely,” said a met official. CPCB data showed that at least seven stations were in the ‘poor’ category on Saturday morning, including Narela, Wazirpur, Bawana, Mundka, Anand Vihar, Chandni Chowk and Shadipur. Anand Vihar, which recently saw the installation of an anti-smog tower, had the worst AQI of all, at 286. CPCB classifies air quality as ‘moderate’ when it is between 101 and 200, as ‘poor’ when the AQI is between 201 and 300 and as ‘very poor’ when it is between 301 and 400. Beyond 400, air quality is termed as ‘severe’. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the AQI could deteriorate further in the next three days and possibly touch the ‘poor’ category. “Delhi’s AQI is in the moderate category with PM10 as the primary pollutant, as fire emissions upwind along with local and regional dust are playing a part under dry conditions. Owing to these dry conditions, both fire emission and dust-suspension are going to further deteriorate AQI to the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category for the next three days,” said SAFAR. According to the early warning system developed for Delhi, AQI is likely to remain in the higher end of the ‘moderate’ category till October 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-quality-dips-to-3-month-low/articleshow/86903618.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Jain, who was arrested from Palitana, was taken to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital on Saturday morning after he failed the potency test in Vadodara on Friday. Police officials said that due to scare or nervousness a person may fail the potency test. “However, the test was successful in Ahmedabad on Saturday and the semen samples have also been collected,” said assistant commissioner of police D S Chauhan. After returning from Ahmedabad, Jain was taken to Helly Green building in Vasna, where the alleged crime took place. After reconstruction of the crime scene, Jain was taken to Nisarg building in Diwalipura, where the law student used to live in a rented apartment. “The accused said that he is not aware of the spy camera installed at the complainant’s rented home and also did not know how his photos had been captured,” said a police official. On Sunday, a team of cops will take Jain to Lonavala and Goa. Jain had admitted that while on the run, he had gone to Lonavala and Goa. “We will be taking him to places where he stayed and will investigate if somebody helped him there,” the police official said. Meanwhile on Saturday, bootlegger Alpesh Waghwani alias Alpu Sindhi’s statement too was taken. Police have said that Sindhi is an important witness while people close to Jain have alleged that the entire case is a conspiracy cooked up by Sindhi. Police sources said that Sindhi admitted having helped the law student. He said that because he was wanted in prohibition cases registered at Warasia and Varnama police stations, he had been on the run. “He said that he was scared of getting arrested, so he did not accompany the complainant at the time of registering the offence and instead sent his man,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ca-passes-potency-test-at-ahmedabad-hospital/articleshow/86901294.cms||---

Most of it, however, largely rides on sales in districts. Hyderabad ranks third among the state’s districts with most sales. Beer sales increased in September this year after a decline due to price increases. The total earnings from liquor sale was Rs 2,250 crore more in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year (April-September 2020), when sales contributed Rs 11,800 crore. Hyderabad, which has the most liquor stores, is in third place with Rs 1,483 crore in booze sales. Rangareddy district has the highest liquor sales, with Rs 3,241 crore, followed by Nalgonda district, with Rs 1,599 crore. According to department sources, Rangareddy has more stores and pubs in the metropolitan area, whereas sales in Nalgonda are strong due to the current situation in neighbouring AP. In the last six months, the state’s 2,216 liquor outlets, pubs and bars sold a total of 1.7 crore liquor cases and 1.57 beer cases. In September, beer sales were on the rise which had been declining for a few months due to a price increase from Rs 90 to Rs 150. The 20% Covid- 19 cess on liquor bottles is still in effect throughout the state while prices increased from May last year. But after the state government cut prices, sales increased significantly. In September this year, a total of 24 lakh beer cases were sold, up from 21 lakh in the same month last year. The state earned a total of Rs 2,267 crore in September of this year from liquor (beer and IMFL) sales.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/liquor-sales-see-boost-as-districts-drive-up-alcohol-demand-in-state/articleshow/86899225.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

CEPI, which comes under the Union ministry of home affairs, has issued show cause notices under Section 11 of the Enemy Property Act, 1968, to as many as 15 encroachers that include some prominent and politically well-connected individuals, TOI has learnt. According to sources, the notices issued pertain to encroachments spread on over 50 survey numbers covering over 540 acres of the enemy property and over the coming days, a few hundred more notices are expected to be served to encroachers. CEPI has given the encroachers 15 days time to respond to the notice and stated that it proposes to take over the management and control of the enemy property for which it would be issuing orders under Sections 5 and 24 of the Act. A senior officer from the Mumbai office of CEPI is also currently camping in Hyderabad to ensure proper implementation of the process for eviction of encroachers as well as a detailed survey of the property, sources added. When contacted, the Custodian of Enemy Property of India, Saurav Ray, confirmed that his office has initiated action regarding encroachments on the property with the help of the Telangana government. He, however, refused to divulge any details. The crackdown comes barely a month after the Telangana government directed the Rangareddy district collector to conduct a detailed survey of this prime enemy property that sits pretty near the Shamshabad international airport and straddles the Nehru Outer Ring Road. The RR district colletor was also directed to identify and stop encroachments and also carry out eviction proceedings against encroachers. With land sharks and realtors eyeing greener pastures, many have set their sights on this property in Kothwalguda where prices are pegged at around Rs 2 crore and Rs 5 crore per acre for land falling under the GO-111 belt and from Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore per acre for land outside the GO-111 areas. The property belonged to Syed Qamruddin Hasan, son of famed Hyderabad lawyer Syed Mohd Hasan Abedi, but became an enemy property after he migrated to Pakistan in 1967. Any property, movable and immovable, that were left behind by those who migrated to Pakistan after the 1965 and 1971 wars were taken over by the Indian government as enemy property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cepi-cracks-down-on-shamshabad-squatters/articleshow/86899239.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

While most of us experience such problems once in a while and get rid of it by having medicines, some people face this more frequently and have serious effects of the same. This condition is called Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This backwash (acid reflux) is not only irritating but also damages the lining of the esophagus. Recently, a 24-year-old girl who had severe Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) was treated in Nagpur by performing a novel procedure — “Anti Reflux Mucosectomy” (ARMS). This technique is relatively new endoscopic procedure for GERD treatment introduced just four year ago by Japanese professor Haruhiro Inoue. It was performed for the first time in Central India at Midas Hospital by Dr Saurabh Mukewar and his endoscopy team — Dr Shital Ganjre, Shailesh Chawhare, Kumar Sambodhi and Pooja Fodekar. “The patient was a young girl with troublesome symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation. She was diagnosed to have GERD. She was treated with medications, which improved her symptoms of heartburn but she continued having troublesome regurgitation causing her significant discomfort. She desired to have a non-surgical “scarless” option for management of her symptoms,” said Dr Saurabh Mukewar. While speaking about the ARMS, he said that it’s an “incisionless”, “scarless” and “painless” procedure performed using minimally invasive approach with endoscopy. “In this procedure, the upper layer of the stomach lining just below the connection with esophagus is removed with endoscopy. Following removal, the tissue heals by “scarring” and thus results in reduction in “reflux” of contents into the esophagus and resolution of symptoms,” he said. Treatment of GERD involves taking acid suppressant medications, which are very effective but have been associated long-term complications such as dementia, kidney failure, loss of bone density. “Patients with GERD often have to take these medications on a daily basis. ARMS procedure provides a simple non-surgical option for treatment of this condition. Majority of patients undergoing ARMS procedure have improvement in their symptoms and patients can stop or reduce the dose of their acid suppressant medications,” said Dr Mukewar. “The patient was having a long and active life ahead to live. So, we decided to go for this process. Follow up will tell us more about the success of the process. This could be a game changer in treating GERD in future,” said Dr Shrikant Mukewar, veteran gastroenterologist of Central India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/acidity-reflux-treated-endoscopically-in-first-arms-process-of-central-india/articleshow/86894591.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Delhi||Bane to boon? Stubble to boost income||NEW DELHI: Any farmer you talk to in Delhi-NCR region would tell you how bad the practice of stubble burning is for human and soil health, but they would also argue that immediate concerns, including high cost and time-consuming option of better farm practices, force them to opt for burning the paddy harvest remnant. Sensing this dilemma, the central government’s apex farm research body — Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) — has stepped in to devise ways that would directly help farmers in earning money through trade in carbon credits accumulated by adopting sustainable farm practices such as by not burning biomass or opting for crop diversification/methods that lead to lesser methane emission. Use of the Pusa bio-decomposer, a bio-enzyme developed by the ICAR’s Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) to break down crop stubble, is one such method which is slowly gaining ground among farmers of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh after successful trials in Delhi. IARI director A K Singh told TOI that farmers earning carbon credits would be the next big thing in boosting their income. This would not only help them monetarily, but also save Delhi-NCR regions from the menace of air pollution linked to the burning of crop remnants after the paddy harvest in early winter. Asked how this is possible when most farmers cannot do it themselves, Singh said, “IARI has licensed 10 private companies and each is keen to help farmers to curb the straw burning through mass production of the Pusa bio-decomposer product and its ready availability. We have also got these companies in touch with state governments to increase the footprints of the decomposer’s use.” Singh said one company, nurture.farm, a subsidiary of UPL Group, has already taken on board thousands of farmers to use the bio-decomposer free of cost in Punjab and Haryana. The company will also assist farmers on a carbon credit trading platform. Over 20 districts in Punjab and Haryana have already signed up to spray the Pusa bio-decomposer over six lakh acres of paddies owned by nearly 26,000 farmers with the help of nurture.farm, which has been doing business in sustainable farm practices. Since farmers have to convert the Pusa bio-decomposer capsules into a solution through a time-consuming process, the company has converted the bio-enzyme capsule into powder form that can be mixed with water and more easily used by farmers. “We realised that one of the impediments in the mass scale adoption of the Pusa bio-decomposer was the unavailability of a ready-to-use solution. We, along with IARI, devised a mechanism to convert the capsules into a ready-to-use spray,” said Pranav Tiwari, CTO, nurture.farm. “We have deployed 750 boom sprayers to carry out the spraying activities. We have already sprayed 20,000 acres. We noticed the stubble began decomposing within eight days, allowing farmers to go for sowing at that stage itself.” Farmers are, however, sceptical about the outcome as this is the first season they are trying the decomposer. “We’ll get to know its result after a few days. If this is successful, we won’t mind paying for the powder and use of boom spray from the next season,” said Bhupinder Singh of Takhana village in Haryana’s Karnal district. Interventions in other states, including UP, will eventually see farmers using the bio-decomposer over nearly 12 lakh acres of paddy farm this year. Though this is just over one-fifth of around 57 lakh acres of fields where farmers burnt paddy stubble, its success in 2021 will lead to substantial jump in its use in the coming years. Asked how soon farmers could earn money from the carbon trading mechanism if they resorted to a sustainable way of managing their paddy stubble and adopted other farm practices, IARI’s Singh said the feasibility study was being done. It involved private partners and it would make it possible for farmers to earn money from as early as 2022. “There are many high emission industries such as fertilisers, cement and others that would be interested in buying carbon credits from farmers under an evolved mechanism of carbon trading,” noted Singh. It was a revelation for user of Pusa capsules Rajesh Saini of village Mirpur in Hoshiarpur district of Punjab when the TOI asked him whether he was also using the bio-decomposer powder for spraying it in his paddy field to manage stubble. “I didn’t know about the ready to use solution. I had to first prepare the solution myself using capsules and jaggery. It took seven days as I had to leave it to get it properly fermented before use on stubble in the farm. If such ready to use solution or powder is made available, more and more farmers will use it in coming days,” said Saini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bane-to-boon-stubble-to-boost-income/articleshow/86903650.cms||Vishwa Mohan

---||Pune||Pune: Evening rain turns nightmare for citizens, many areas flooded||PUNE: It took Preeti Pardeshi nearly 90 minutes to reach her home near the Pune-RTO from Kalyaninagar, a distance of less than 5km, as all roads on the way were inundated due to the intense spell of rain on Saturday evening. “As I moved out of Kalyaninagar at 7.30pm and took Central avenue, the road looked flooded. I took some bylanes, which were also inundated and vehicles could barely move. At Shastrinagar Chowk, water was almost touching the knees. I saw a woman falling from her scooter. Thankfully, a passerby came to her rescue. Reaching home was an ordeal,” said Pardeshi, a store executive by profession. The rain caught Navratra shoppers unawares, drenching many who had ventured out in the evening. The city received a sharp spell for nearly half-an-hour to 45 minutes, with Shivajinagar receiving 49.2 mm of rain in a short time. Lohegaon received a significant 75.8mm of rain from 8.30am till 8:30 pm on Saturday. From 8.30am till 5:30 pm, Lohegaon had received 40mm rain. During the evening shower, it received another 35.8 mm rain. Chinchwad also received about 70mm of rain from 5.30pm to 8.30pm, India Meteorological Department (IMD) data showed. Massive water logging occurred in areas such as Kalyaninagar, Kondhwa and Shivajinagar due to the convective rain. The Pune city fire brigade received seven calls for flooding on the roads and an equal number of calls about water entering houses in the low-lying areas. Among the affected areas were Yerawada, Tingrenagar, Dhanori, Mumjaba Vasti, Wakadewadi, Taiwan road and Kalyaninagar. Four trees fell due to the intense spell. The fire brigade was removing trees from various roads in Yerawada and the old parts of the city till late in the night. The basements of a few housing societies in Yerawada remained submerged till the time of going to the press. Traffic snarls were reported from the Vimannagar, Dhanori and Wadgaonsheri areas. Vehicular movement on the Ahmednagar road remained disrupted for nearly an hour due to the rain. A thunder bolt also hit an electricity pole located near Undri gram panchayat. Following this, electricity meter boxes of a society caught fire. Fire brigade officials rushed to the site and extinguished the flames. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) deputy commissioner Madhav Jagtap said earthmoving machines were deployed in Dhanori to clear the blockages. The flooding triggered a traffic snarl on Dhanori road. Mayor Muralidhar Mohol said civic teams had been deployed at the water-logged locations. Local MLA Sunil Tingre said water gushed into many houses in the low-lying areas of Vadgaonsheri andDhanori. The Central avenue lane in Kalyaninagar, which has rarely seen any waterlogging during monsoon, was flooded on Saturday evening. The lane next to Neptune Society had ankle-deep water. Similar was the scene at the Joggers’ Park street. Many passengers were stuck at the airport due to the rain, as they could not find any autorickshaw or cab. Ganesh M, a flyer, tweeted, “I reached Pune around 7pm and had to go to Swargate. But I was stuck in the traffic for hours.” Between 6pm and 9pm, six arriving flights and seven departing flights were delayed due to the rain. Alpana Jolly, a flyer, tweeted, “All passengers stranded at the airport and there is no mode of conveyance. Huge traffic jam outside.” Kalyaninagar resident Anand Bagmar, who had gone to the airport to pick up his relative, said it took him 2.5 hours to reach his residence. Convective rain is associated with local instability and accompanied with thundery activity and lightning. During daytime, temperature is high, which can cause formation of cumulonimbus clouds, particularly in afternoon and evening time. These clouds are thunder clouds which cause convective rains. Such rains are usually intense and last for half an hour to an hour. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting, IMD, Pune, said, “Lohegaon and Chinchwad recorded 70mm or more rain on Saturday. This is isolated heavy rain and a result of local instability. High temperature (around 33°C) with high moisture led to formation of 2-3 octa cumulous clouds in, which turned into one octa cumulonimbus clouds on Saturday evening/night. This caused moderate to isolated heavy rain even in city areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/evening-rain-turns-nightmare-for-citizens-many-areas-flooded/articleshow/86901266.cms||---

---||Lucknow||‘Swachhata part of our sanskriti, time to keep waterways clean’||Drill down into layer after layer of India’s history, and it becomes clear that clean water and sanitation are India’s birthright. From the great baths and flush toilets of the Indus Valley Civilization to the fines imposed by Chanakya for people who polluted or misused water, to the public toilets of the Gupta period and beyond, India’s sanskriti is swachh. Thousands of years ago, when the ‘Neolithic British’ were still mastering the basics of farming, cities were rising at India’s Indus Valley Civilization that more closely resembled those of modern times. Such a civilization could be considered nothing less than a miraculous testimony to the ingenuity, intelligence and fortitude of the people who laid the historic foundations of ‘Incredible India’. The wonders included the world’s first water-flushed toilets and our planet’s first sewage system. And they worked well. Filth was kept away from homes, and cities and waterways glistened. During the Vedic period, cleanliness was also of foremost importance. The Yajur Veda says, “Do not disturb the sky and do not pollute the atmosphere” (5:43). The Manu Smriti also warns against polluting our waters. “Let him not throw urine or faeces into the water, nor saliva, nor clothes defiled by impure substances, nor any other impurity, nor blood, nor poisonous things” (4:56). Ancient Ayurvedic physicians knew that contaminated water could lead to serious diseases, a fact that would remain unknown to the western world for thousands of years. The Quran would later teach that water is a sacred gift, asking, “And have you seen the water that you drink? Is it you who brought it down from the clouds, or is it We who bring it down? If We willed, We could make it bitter, so why are you not grateful?” (56: 58-70). The Bible says, “You shall not pollute the land in which you live” (Numbers 35:33). Later in history, humanity was poetically reminded by the Sri Guru Granth Sahib that, “Air is the Guru, Water the Father, Earth the great Mother, and Day and Night the two male and female nurses in whose lap the entire world plays” (SGGS, 8).  As time advanced, many ancient ways were sadly forgotten. Across our nation and around the world, we are now seeing rivers, lakes and seas flooded with sewage, chemicals, trash and other impurities. As they become increasingly polluted, entire ecosystems are at risk, as is the health and longevity of ourselves and our children. Today, as water levels dry up across much of India, we are at a precarious tipping point, in which the fate of countless millions of men, women and children are at stake. Without decisive action, Niti Aayog predicts that water shortages will would more frequent, creating serious water scarcity. As water availability falls, there will be less dilution capacity for rivers, ponds and lakes to clear themselves of pollution, creating increasingly-toxic conditions that can spread disease. Already, 70% of India’s surface water is contaminated and 163 million people don’t have clean water near their homes. It is essential that we heed the calls of our ancestors, sages and holy scriptures, and keep our waterways clean. To uphold our Swachhata Sanskriti we must find out where our community’s sewage is going. If it is falling into open nullahs, ponds, lakes or rivers, now is the time to advocate for change. If you have a septic tank, make sure you clean it every three years. Only engage certified companies to clean your septic tank, and find out where the waste is going. Some companies secretly dump toilet waste right back into our rivers and other drinking water sources. Make sure your septic tank has been built in a way that your drinking water is protected from contamination. The right design should have two chambers and a soak pit. Be the change you wish to see and participate in regular clean-ups. Plant trees for a green and serene future. (The writer is the director of Programmes, Policy and Development of the Global Interfaith WASH Alliance (GIWA)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/swachhata-part-of-our-sanskriti-time-to-keep-waterways-clean/articleshow/86903627.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: From victuals to vaccination drives, housing societies keep up vigil||MUMBAI: As the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic ebbs, two housing societies in Bandra and Oshiwara continue to keep vigil. From initially arranging supplies to sanitisation, both have now graduated to holding vaccination drives for members. Each society is also sponsoring shots for service personnel working there. Jade Gardens MIG-III society in Bandra (East) has a large number of senior citizens residing at its 168 flats. Its Covid care initiatives ensured their safety and comfort. Volunteers arranged for vendors to provide milk, groceries, medical supplies and sundry items within the society premises. Honorary secretary Bhadresh Kamdar said, “Members would fill out e-forms citing their requirements. They were allotted token numbers, after which they would come down at the appointed time to collect the items. Schedules were dispersed to ensure there was no crowding, and physical distancing norms were followed. Masks were mandatory.” ATM vans were invited to the complex, which removed another need to step out. Jade Gardens made provision to house and feed the society staff as well. Kamdar said, “We opened the banquet hall to our watchmen, gardeners and lift personnel, and provided raw material and space for cooking. In addition, the society contributed money to the CM’s Covid Relief Fund.” According to Rakesh Coelho, secretary of Tarapore Towers society in Oshiwara, the pandemic and the ensuing lockdown brought people closer. “I say so because our residents visited elderly neighbours to provide cooked meals and clean their homes. They even cooked three meals for our staff daily for six months because the rice plate stalls were shut.” Tarapore residents paid their maids and drivers full salaries even when they were unable to come to work. Coelho said, “Sanitisers and masks were distributed, and wash basins with soap were installed in the lobby. We forged tie-ups for hospital beds and even assisted a nearby society with an oxygen cylinder. Now three vaccination camps have been conducted already.” Tarapore Towers society conducts multi-faith festivals in its compound but members willingly called them off for the greater good.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-from-victuals-to-vaccination-drives-hsg-socys-keep-up-vigil/articleshow/86903286.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Screen time robs eyesight, triggers obesity in children||PUNE: Prolonged screen exposure has brought along with it a fresh set of health problems for students, including eyesight issues, obesity, backaches and headaches being reported. Lack of physical activities has led to weight-gain among children, prompting several parents to get gym equipment to keep their kids active at home. Teachers and parents both say these troubles mainly crop up amid students in higher age groups, from Std VII. Preeti Lahoti, a parent, said, “Children are confined to their homes now and it impacts them. My son had to be taken to the doctor as he was putting on tremendous weight. Now, he is on a diet plan.” Another parent said her son’s screen time has increased to nearly 12 hours — eventually, he had to be taken to the doctor to remedy his poor vision. She said, “His eyeglasses prescription number is very high. Doctors said his screen exposure time, which was just a couple of hours earlier, has increased hugely, leading to poor eyesight. We are very cautious now and try to engage him in different activities not requiring electronic devices.” Child specialist Arvind Ghodegaonkar said, “ Parents are bringing children with complaints like backaches to lethargy and even severe depression. So, we suggest that parents keep them active, ask them to cycle on the society premises for 30-40 minutes, find some ways to keep themselves engaged, take a walk, skip rope on the terrace or be involved in other activities that energise.” He added that the only medicine for such health issues is to keep children engaged. Several schools across the city are also undertaking initiatives to help, and adapting children to e-schooling. Damini Joshi, principal of Sanskriti School, said, “We have physical education classes conducted regularly for our students, and also have a wellness team that keeps organising sessions on topics like stress and time management.” At Podar International School in Chinchwad, when parents started complaining of screen addiction issues, the management tackled it by organising various sessions on eye care, conducted by the school nurse. School principal Shehnaz Cottar said, “We are educating our students on how proper distance can be maintained from gadgets. We also taught them eye relaxation techniques and splashing of cool fresh water on one’s eyes, which has proved useful.” Secondary coordinator at HDFC School Pune, Pooja Rai, said they regularly conduct ‘circle time’, wherein class teachers interact with students; here, discussions on health and hygiene have always taken centre stage. “Family fitness sessions were also conducted to bring in a healthy culture. Activities and projects related to health and hygiene spread awareness amongst students. Std VII students prepared meal plans for teenagers and had a classroom discussion on the same. Std VIII prepared an elaborate project on Sustainable Development Goal – Zero Hunger,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/screen-time-robs-eyesight-triggers-obesity-in-children/articleshow/86899320.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Ahmedabad||‘PPP model worked well during pandemic’||Ahmedabad: Covid-19 pandemic changed the healthcare industry across the globe like no other force in the past several decades. It also held several valuable lessons for both hospital administrators and government officials. But the lessons must not go in vain when the Covid cases are down, opined the participants at a seminar organized by Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA) in association with IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A) on Sunday. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of AHNA, said that the public-private partnership (PPP) model worked very well in context of the pandemic where the private hospitals admitted the patients whose bills were footed by the government. “We came up with the protocols, developed concepts such as oxygen bank and also devised systems of grievance redressal. The learning must be taken forward for other healthcare issues. PM-JAY can be a good example of the approach,” he said. He advocated uniform code of ethics and appointment of an ombudsman at AHNA for its members for uniform services. Prof Rajesh Chandwani, a faculty at IIM-A, spoke on the theme of PPP in healthcare. “The parties should know why they are in engagement and must find a way to make it work. It may have hiccups, but the end result must reflect the need for public good. It should not be a person- or organization-centric approach but a code-driven system,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ppp-model-worked-well-during-pandemic/articleshow/86921029.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NIT not recovering premium for delay, user change from Glocal Mall developer||Nagpur: The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has not recovered crores in premium over delay in completion of construction and change in user of Glocal Mall project being developed by Pune-based Goel Ganga Infrastructure and Real Estate Private Ltd at Sitabuldi. The developer is also operating shops despite lacking occupancy certificate (OC) and rejection of application seeking the mandatory OC a few days ago. The controversial project is in the news again after NIT rejected the application by the developer seeking partial OC on September 30. West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre said in his complaint lodged with NIT chairman Manoj Kumar Suryawanshi that NIT did not recover additional premium for change in user to give more benefits to the developer. “Use of land on which the project is being constructed is residential and commercial in city’s development plan. NIT sanctioned commercial building on entire land. NIT was supposed to recover additional premium for change in user, which was never taken,” he said. As per condition number ‘e’ and ‘e-1’ in lease deed dated August 26, 2009, executed between NIT and seven persons from Buty family for the land on which the mall is coming up, the entire project was supposed to be completed within three years. In case of delay, NIT chairman can grant extension of one year, subject to payment of additional premium. Currently, the developer is yet to complete G+1 of total seven-storeyed project. Activist Kamlesh Shah told TOI, “NIT is not recovering additional premium and also not giving extension, causing loss of public money in crores since 2014. NIT recovered additional premium and gave extension in 2013 and 2014. No recovery of additional premium and extension was granted after 2014 till date, which amounts to loss of over Rs16 crore to NIT. There is another provision in the NIT Act and also in lease deed that NIT can take back land in case project is not completed within six years. This action was also not taken.” Thakre also alleged in the complaint that NIT allotted the land to developer at 50% of total estimated cost. “There are also various deviations in the building compared to sanctioned plan. NIT should fixed responsibility and initiate action against concerned officials who caused financial loss and also overlooked violations. NIT should issue notice and demolish the unauthorized constructions,” he said. Suryawanshi did not respond to TOI’s call and message. Vice-president of Goel Ganga Infrastructure too did not respond to TOI’s call and message. NIT officials said the developer is yet to pay entire amount of revised sanction plan. Citing 14 violations, NIT had denied partial OC. This indicates the building does not have OC. However, the developer has started using the building for last over one year. Many shops were also operating in the under-construction mall on Friday. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is running drive-in vaccination and also operating lactation cuboid in the mall which lacks OC. The developer has also continued operation of temporary shops constructed in front margin of the mall and on some part of Abhyankar Road. The shops are causing severe congestion on the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nit-not-recovering-premium-for-delay-user-change-from-glocal-mall-developer/articleshow/86894631.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Ahmedabad||Making cities more livable, inclusive||Ahmedabad: The function of a city as an urbanscape is to facilitate smooth exchange of assets — both human and non-human — while providing amenities in a compact fashion. But the Covid pandemic forced the urban planners to see beyond transport, amenities, housing and commercial areas of a geographic location. It forced them to think about contingencies and how to make cities more resilient. It was the central theme of ‘Plan OK Please,’ a two-day virtual symposium organized by CRDF of CEPT University and GIZ of German Embassy recently. The event witnessed participation of 400-plus experts from across the globe representing governments, NGOs, civic bodies and academia. “The cities must adopt an approach for planning which takes care of its citizens while benchmarking the provision of health infrastructure and public amenities. The cities must engage people to participate in making the city and not just in making the plans. Planning must also find solutions to address regional imbalances and address both the urban and rural development,” said one of the participants. Prof Saswat Bandopadhyay, a faculty at CEPT University, said that planning is a constant process, and not a product. “The pandemic has taught us that it has to evolve constantly. Cities must be considered the places of culture and need to respect its people and environment. Capacity building on several aspects is as important,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/making-cities-more-livable-inclusive/articleshow/86920984.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi University: Most courses with 100% cutoff still open||NEW DELHI: Eight of the 10 courses in Delhi University that had a cutoff of 100% in the first cut off list remained open in the second list released on Saturday. Of those for which admission wasn’t offered under the second list included political science (H) at Hindu College and computer science (H) at Hansraj College. At Ramjas College, while political science (H) remained open, the second cutoff for the course remained unchanged with an asking score of 100%. Physics (H), which also had a qualifying mark of 100% in the first list, saw a marginal dip in the cutoff to 99.33% in the second list for the general category. The benchmark for computer science (H) at both Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies went down 1.5 percentage points to 98.5%. DDU said that for admissions to the course, science students would have to include one language, mathematics and two subjects from physics, chemistry and computer science or informatics practices while calculating their best of four aggregate. For students from other streams, one language, mathematics and two academic subjects will be considered, though with a deduction of 2%. Even in the commerce stream, the courses where the qualifying bar was set at 100% in the first list remained open in the second list. At Shri Ram College of Commerce, the cutoff for economics (H) reduced from 100% to 99.75% and BCom (H) from 100% in the first list to 99.12%, a reduction of 0.88 percentage points. At Ramjas College, students can still apply for the various combinations under the BA programme course, which had a cutoff of 100% in the first list. The new benchmark is now down half a percent to 99.5%. Anju Srivastava, principal of Hindu College, said, “Several courses including political science (H), which had a 100% cutoff in the first list, are no longer open for admissions due to the large number of intake under the first list. Among the courses that remain open, the slide in the required marks is marginal.” According to DU officials, nearly 9,200 applicants to DU had the perfect 100% aggregate this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/most-courses-with-100-cutoff-still-open/articleshow/86901349.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Pune||Pune: Rise in back pain issues among kids and teens||PUNE: Prolonged studying from home, incorrect posture due to poor ergonomics and inactivity owing to remaining indoors have led to more and more children and teenagers experiencing backache. “My 14-year-old son has been complaining of back pain for the last few months. We tried home remedies, such as applying hot and cold compress, but he got no relief. Initially, the doctor recommended medication, but when the problem persisted, he suggested physiotherapy for posture correction,” said a concerned parent. Increased screen time, poor posture, physical inactivity, and erratic schedules have induced back pain in children, said doctors. Trupti Pioli, a paediatrician, said, “It is advisable for parents to ensure that their child participates in an hour of physical activity at home daily.” Orthopaedic surgeon Mayank Pathak said that there has been a 100% rise in back pain among those between the ages of 8-20. “Binge-watching movies, with lack of sleep and rest while at home can cause stiffness and back pain,” he said. “Chronic back pain might be indicative of serious underlying issues. Parents should keep an eye on weight loss, gait disturbance, fever, bowel or bladder dysfunction or weakness in the nerve,” said Sujith Rao, physiotherapist. Vishwajit Chavan, orthopaedic consultant, Apollo Spectra, Pune, said, “Don’t just let your kid rest on bed for long as the body can become stiff. Make them get up move, stand and stretch to manage lower back pain. Avoid sugary, processed and fried foods that can increase the pain.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rise-in-back-pain-issues-among-kids-and-teens/articleshow/86899340.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The NMC standing committee will take a decision on the proposal seeking administrative approval and starting the tendering process in a meeting to be held on October 12. Two proposals are on the agenda of which one is related to expenditure of Rs 1.99 crore on civil works and another pertaining to greenery work of the garden amounting to Rs 33 lakh. Tiwari planned the garden on the public utility (PU) land and part of the open space of the textile park’s layout of the Maharashtra State Textile Corporation (MSTC) on a sprawling 13,122 sq.mt area. Tiwari had managed funds for construction of the compound wall from Central Nagpur MLA Vikas Kumbhare and also started the work. Tiwari had earlier claimed that NMC funds will not be utilized for the garden due to the financial crisis. The garden is being planned on the proposed controversial road in Empress Van which falls in Tiwari’s ward. The area is close to Gandhisagar where three gardens already exist. Also, no mass residential areas are situated adjacent to the proposed garden. Tiwari had also planned an e-library proposed in his ward and the civic body is spending around Rs 5 crore for it. The committee will also take a decision to issue a work order to a private agency for finding spaces for new hoardings, conducting survey for improvement of existing hoardings, revise rates etc. Also, the proposal is to end long-legal battle with Signpost India Private Ltd, the erstwhile Cartel Outdoor Advertising Agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-financial-crisis-nmc-plans-to-spend-rs2-3cr-on-vande-mataram-park/articleshow/86894640.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

They also plan to run a skeletal service at night, though restrictions have been eased during the Pujas. According to bus owners, they cannot provide night services due to the exorbitant fuel costs. However, bus owners promised to review the situation once Puja gets underway. Police have cancelled their meet with bus owners stating that most revellers were planning to use personal vehicles to visit pandals. “Even though the night curfew has been relaxed during Puja, this time there is little possibility of running buses all night. Several routes have been sent notices for charging extra and with diesel now at Rs 95 per/litre, losses are bound to rise,” said Tapan Banerjee of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicate. Pradeep Narayan Bose, general secretary of the Bus-Minibus Owners Association, said on Friday, “I have verbally informed the police about the situation. There will be some buses on the routes where we will find a steady flow of passengers,” he said. Swapan Ghosh of Minibus Operators Coordination Committee echoed the same sentiments. Till 2019, keeping in mind passenger needs, a coordination between bus owners, police and transport department was undertaken before Pujas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/puja-revellers-may-face-bus-scarcity/articleshow/86899350.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

And while eight courses with a 100% cutoff under the first list still remained open, entry to various other courses have already ended. Seats in history (H), English (H) political science (H) were no longer available in some colleges. Miranda House, which had a cut off of 99% for English (H) English and 99.75% for political science (H) closed admissions in the general category for both the courses. However, the cutoff for most popular courses in North Campus colleges like Hindu, Ramjas and Kirori Mal offered a chance to aspirants at 98-99%. Economics (H) and history (H) saw a dip of 0.5% and 0.25%, respectively, from the first list. BCom (H) and BCom also continued to have a high qualifying mark across colleges. Science courses also had minuscule dips in the cutoffs in the second list. At Lady Shri Ram College for Women, the maximum drop was by 0.25%, said principal Suman Sharma. “Courses like mathematics, philosophy and Sanskrit have closed after the first list itself,” said Sharma. “For the first time, we also saw many courses in the reserved categories being filled under the first list itself. We have had over-admissions in courses like BA (programme).” Psychology (H) at Daulat Ram College and Indraprastha College for Women is 0.25% lower in the second list at 98.75% and 98.5%, respectively. At LSR, economics (H) and history (H) are pegged at 99.5% and 99%. Political science (H) and psychology are now being offered to those who have 99.5% in aggregate at the college. The cutoff for BCom (H) at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College and Sri Venkateswara College stood at 98.75% in the second list, while Sri Guru Gobind Singh College of Commerce and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya (DDU) College had a bar of 98.25%. Delhi College of Arts and Commerce’s benchmark for the course was 98.75%. At Kamla Nehru College and Maharaja Agrasen College, BCom (H) closed after the first list despite the high cutoffs of 98% and 97%, respectively. Colleges like PGDAV (Evening) and Aditi Mahavidyalaya which had set the qualifying mark at 95% and 92%, respectively, have also filled up their seats fully. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, Daulat Ram, Dyal Singh and Miranda House, among others, have no more seats for mathematics (H). The first list cutoff was above 95% in most of the colleges, with Miranda asking for 98.75%. Honours courses in physics and chemistry have high demands even in the second list. At Sri Venkateswara College, the bar dropped marginally from 99% to 98.33% for physics (H) and from 98.33% to 97.66% for chemistry (H). Several combinations of BA programme courses have closed in several colleges. DU’s data showed that 36,000 students were admitted under the first list for the available 70,000 seats.

Sensing that going the extra mile will only help the party make a comeback, letters have been written to every village pradhan to bring up issues that need to be addressed in the manifesto, sources said. Tasting defeat in the 2017, 2014 and 2019 elections, the RLD is treading the path with caution. Not denying the fact that villagers and farmers call the shots in polls, Chaudhary while invoking former PM Charan Singh, said the latter believed that village heads had a major role in the development of any state. “Though 73rd amendment to Article 243 of the Constitution and strengthening of the Panchayati Raj system empowered village heads, the system is yet to be implemented in all the states,” he said. Chaudhary also spoke of administrative meddling in some states, which obstructed rural development. “In such a situation, village heads should not only try to get works done but also exercise their rights by not giving in to any sort of pressure,” he said. Just a week ago, he had shot off a letter to gram panchayat heads, giving a message that the RLD manifesto will be prepared by the public. Appreciating the move, head of Nagla Mubarik village in Muzaffarnagar, Satender Kumar said, “I received a letter from Chaudhary on Friday, enquiring about the issues plaguing the village. It is a welcome step.” Listing the problems, the village head said, “Issues like poor roads, waterlogging and unemployment should be sorted out first. If people have jobs, there won’t be any exodus.” Meanwhile, Chaudhary will be in Muzaffarnagar to address Jan Ashirwad Rally in Budhana constituency on October 11. The move is being seen as an attempt to appease Jat and Muslim voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/rld-ropes-in-59k-village-pradhans-to-advise-on-poll-manifesto/articleshow/86897647.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The councillor Parakramsinh Jadeja, who lives at Harni-Sama Link Road, lodged a complaint of cheating against Laxman Suthar at Sama police station on Friday. According to Jadeja, he had placed an order for a bed, a sofa and two side tables with Suthar, a resident of Gota in Ahmedabad, on August 5 last year. Jadeja had specifically asked Suthar to make the furniture from teakwood and paid him an advance of Rs 4 lakh. Suthar made the bed first and delivered it to Jadeja’s home, but the councillor found out that the bed was made from inferior quality plywood. He asked Suthar to take it back and make it as specified by him. Suthar took the bed back but did not deliver the furniture. As the work was not moving ahead, Jadeja asked Suthar to return the advance amount. However, Suthar kept dilly-dallying so Jadeja approached the police and lodged a complaint against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bjp-councillor-accuses-carpenter-of-cheating-with-poor-quality-furniture/articleshow/86901419.cms||---
---||Mumbai||3 freed in cruise drugs case over mounting pressure from BJP: Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik on Saturday alleged the Narcotics Control Bureau freed Rishabh Sachdeva, Prateek Gabha and Amir Furniturewala, detained in the drugs case, following mounting pressure from the BJP. According to Malik, Sachdeva is the brother-in-law of BJP leader Mohit Bhartiya. Sachdeva and friends Gabha and Furniturewala are among 11 persons, including actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan, who were detained by the NCB during a raid on a cruise on October 2. Following Malik’s allegations, Bhartiya has served a Rs 100 crore defamation notice on the NCP leader. Meanwhile, reacting to Malik’s statement, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said, “Instead of supporting the NCB, NCP has politicised the entire issue. I am told that among the three persons freed by NCB, one is a friend of a high-profile NCP leader’s son.” In a press conference, Malik said, “My contention is that due to the BJP’s mounting pressure, Sachdeva, Gabha and Furniturewala were released. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede must explain to the people why the three were let off. When Sachdeva was emerging from the NCB office, he was accompanied by his father and uncle.” Malik released a series of videos on the entire episode to make his point. The NCP leader reiterated the October 2 raid was fabricated to defame the MVA government as well as the film industry. A senior NCB official said Malik’s information is “half-baked, false, baseless, motivated, an afterthought and prejudiced” .“Not 11, but 14 persons were brought to the NCB office. All of them were served a notice under the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act. Their statements were recorded and thereafter, eight persons were arrested and the remaining six were let off since no incriminating evidence was found against them,” he said. The NCB official reiterated all have been treated on par. “NCB follows a professional and unbiased approach in its ongoing mission of tackling the drug menace in the country. It takes serious action either on the basis of inputs received from public sources or based on developed intelligence inputs incorporating surveillance means,’’ he said.  Malik demanded examination of call detail records of Wankhede, Sachdeva and his father, “so people will know with whom they were in touch with after his detention and release. NCB’s operations have a direct link with the BJP”.  Meanwhile, Bhartiya said, “I have served a Rs 100 crore defamation notice on Malik. He should tender an unconditional apology for making baseless charges. Malik is misusing his official position as a cabinet member. For obvious political reasons, he is hitting out at diligent officers of the NCB for the sole and ulterior motive of seeking vengeance for arresting his son-in-law.’’ Bhartiya added he is not an office bearer, but a BJP sympathiser.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-freed-in-cruise-drugs-case-over-mounting-pressure-from-bjp-malik/articleshow/86901547.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

Citing the incident of a Dalit youth allegedly lynched to death in Rajasthan, whose video went viral on social media, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said another Dalit youth had been killed in a similar way in Rajasthan recently. Bhatia said the Center and BJP-led state governments are committed to safety and welfare of the weaker sections but Congress is maintaining double-standards as it is indifferent to Dalit and women in states governed by the party. “A Dalit youth was lynched to death in Rajasthan. The visuals are bone chilling ,” he said, adding, “Neither our Dalit brothers and sisters are safe in Rajasthan, nor are women safe there.” He said there is a section in society that puts cost of human beings on the basis that crime has happened in BJP or Congress-governed state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-gandhis-silent-over-crimes-in-congress-led-states-asks-bjp/articleshow/86904705.cms||---

Intelligence sources told TOI that pistols were delivered to these neo-recruits by Pakistani handlers specifically for the strikes and later taken back, allowing them to conveniently return to their homes in populated neighbourhoods. Read AlsoFaceoff: Targeted killings of minorities in Kashmir evoke anger and outrageRecent incidents of targeting civilians, mainly non-Muslim minorities has evoked a lot of anger and outrage among the netizens on micro-blogging platform Twitter. Many are claiming it seems like a return of 90s in Kashmiri, when Kashmiri Pandits faced ethnic-cleansing and genocide at the hands ofSources said using “neo-recruits or hybrid terrorists” who beat surveillance with one-off attacks, helps Pakistan-based masterminds maintain deniability and project attacks in J&K as indigenous. Pakistani terrorists — in this case possibly freshly infiltrated — prefer to play handlers and hand small weapons to the neo-recruits to hit “soft-targets” and then lie low. Read Also2 teachers killed in terror attack in Srinagar"At about 11:15 am, terrorists shot dead two school teachers at Sangam Eidgah in Srinagar district," a police official said. This comes days after three people, including prominent pharmacist Makhan Lal Bindroo, were shot dead in Srinagar and Bandipora in separate incidents.A police officer said this calls for a more proactive strategy focused on a full crackdown on terror eco-system including overground workers, watching youths with family and friends across the border and tracking movement of weapons. Perpetrators and facilitators of attacks must be identified expeditiously, tracked and engaged. If arrested, it must be ensured that they are interrogated or incarcerated outside Kashmir. Interestingly, past experience shows that most terror local recruits are killed or arrested within a month of joining a terrorist outfit. There were 52 local terrorists active in J&K from January 2021, of which 20 were killed and nine were arrested within the first month of joining.

Among the 28 civilians killed by terrorists in J&K so far this year, seven were non-Muslims, including one Kashmiri Pandit, while 21 were Muslims. A source said terrorists have been choosing their targets so as to send out a message with each killing. Earlier, they were targeting panchayati raj representatives and workers. Now, the victims have changed. Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit, was targeted on October 5 to protest J&K government’s initiative to help Kashmiri migrants reclaim their properties in the Valley. There is evidence that Kashmiri attackers are acting on directions of handlers based in Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/intelligence-links-hybrid-ultras-to-jammu-and-kashmir-civilian-killings/articleshow/86904730.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Nagpur||‘Mental health issues are real, but treatment exists’||October 10 is observed as World Mental Health Day. With the need for addressing mental health problems more than ever before due to the pandemic, the Psychiatrist Society of Nagpur in association with medical institutes, hospitals and NGOs ran a series of awareness campaigns from October 4 to 10. Different groups, including nurses, teachers, journalists, parents and commoners have gained from the initiatives. Psychiatrist Dr Suleman Virani, who too initiated online campaigns during this week, talks to TOI in detail about the core issues in mental health, the way ahead and the stigma which hounds urban and rural population alike. Citing this year’s WHO campaign slogan ‘Mental healthcare for all — let’s make it a reality’, the director of Asssan Hospital feels that despite the prevalence of the stigma, people have realized that mental health problems are real and there exists a treatment. Excerpts...  Q. What are the recent causes of mental health issues?  A. Mental health issues are on the rise and there are various reasons. Psychosocial factors play a crucial role. Nuclear families makes it more challenging to balance work and family time. Globalisation has taken a mental toll on all. The migrated population shows a lot of mental health issues. Unrealistic expectations from self/others create a lot of stress in the mind. The notion of becoming super rich in quick time is definitely challenging and stressful. Sudden death of a loved one, failure in academics/relationships, trauma, physical/sexual abuse, substance abuse, hormonal imbalance, Covid pandemic, natural disasters all have a severe psychological impact. Genetic vulnerability also predisposes you to depression and other mental health issues. Q. What is the magnitude of mental health problems in India?  A. Mental health issues are a growing concern. One in 7 people in India is suffering from a mental health issue. 15 are depressed while 10 are anxious in every 100. So, we have around 5 crore people suffering from depression and around 4 crore suffering from anxiety. Don’t forget these are individual cases. Worst part is when an individual is mentally ill, the whole family suffers. This affects the morale and productivity of the family. Unemployment, divorce, suicide are the worst results in many untreated cases. Youth between 18-30 years are most vulnerable to suicide. Every hour one student is committing suicide in India. Depression can come to anyone, whether you are a common man, celebrity, doctor, politician or spiritual healer. No one is immune to it as no one is immune to a heart disease and other illness. Mental health issues don’t discriminate among rich or poor, young or old, urban or rural. Q. Has Covid exacerbated the magnitude of this problem?  A. To some extent, yes. Initially as the pandemic struck, everyone was in panic and denial mode. Gradually, this went on to the anxiety of survival and fear of threat to life. Though with proper scientific education and counselling this phase eased out. Then came the 2nd wave which impacted everyone financially and mentally. We saw severe depression ranging from lack of confidence to suicidal attempts. Alcohol and other drug abuse increased. Kids’ all-round development was affected as they were confined to their home with online education. Kids’ irritation and screen obsession cases are also rampant. Doomscrolling — continuously scrolling social media or surfing the web and taking in a constant torrent of bad news. It’s an unending act, you cannot stop scrolling and think hard about the real problems. Old age memory problems, loneliness and depression also increased. Yet, people learnt from the pandemic that mental health problems are real and there exists treatment. Q. How can such problems be prevented?  A. Sleep for at least 8 hours. A balanced diet and regular exercise will help your mood and immunity. Yoga and mind relaxation techniques help a lot. Take out time for yourself as short breaks help a lot in unwinding. Nurture your hobby which will give you peace and happiness. Stay away from bad habits of substance abuse, gambling. Stay away from negative people, negative news and social media. Whenever you feel low or stressed, talk to your family members or close friends. This offers ventilation and you feel reassured. When things are severe, never hesitate to take professional help. Leave the stigma behind and come forward. With proper therapy and medication, all such problems can be dealt with. The best part is when diagnosed early, mental health issues can be treated easily and a person can be free from all problems. Have a positive attitude towards life. Face problems courageously. Problems do come and go, what matters is how you handle them. Believe in yourself. Also don’t waste free time. Upgrade your skills which will help you in the future. We need to be mentally strong and resilient to face tough times. Q. Is stigma still attached to mental health?  A. Stigma is societal disapproval or when people judge you because of your mental illness. More than half of mentally ill patients avoid or delay treatment because of this stigma or fear of losing their job or livelihood. This prejudice or discrimination is a big problem in society. Stigma comes from lack of understanding or fear. Inaccurate/misleading representations of mental illness in media contribute to this factor. That’s why awareness of masses is critical and the first step. Every year mental health week is observed around the globe to raise awareness about mental illness. Mental health experts, NGOs, the Union health ministry and public at large should come together to reduce this stigma. Last month we saw actor Deepika Padukone advocating mental health in KBC. We need more celebrities and politicians to fight against this stigma. Recovered people can come forward and their life examples can motivate others to seek help. Q. What is the difference between urban and rural patients? A. Awareness is low in rural areas. Quacks or spiritual healers are preferred more than qualified doctors. Financially, it is difficult for rural patients to approach a good doctor. Sudden break up of a marriage or relationship, acute stress induced by financial loss and late reporting are plaguing rural areas. If they report early, they can recover within a year. Urban patients have the advantage of better facilities. But whether urban or rural, the stigma still hinders treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mental-health-issues-are-real-but-treatment-exists/articleshow/86894994.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

One question was on everyone’s mind and lips as pictures of the infant happily playing with keys and drinking from a milk bottle were flashed on media and social media-- how could anybody have the heart to abandon such a lovable child! Within 20 hours of the infant being deserted by a man at the Swaminarayan Gaushala in Pethapur near Gandhinagar at 9.20pm on Friday, the state police, which launched a massive hunt for the infant’s parents, claimed to have cracked the case by identifying the person who abandoned him – *Shyam who had fled to Kota in Rajasthan. *Shyam, suspected to be the father of the child, is being brought back to Gandhinagar. Mystery over why the infant, identified by Saturday evening as *Amit aged between 8 to 10 months, was abandoned was not completely unravelled. Addressing media at night, Harsh Sanghvi, MoS (home), said that *Amit is not the child of *Shyam’s wife. Sources close to the development said that the toddler could be a love child, but more details could be ascertained once Dixit is questioned.  “Reasons behind his desertion will unravel once DIxit is interrogated,” said senior police officials. According to Gandhinagar police, the child was left inside Gaushala’s gate by a person who had come in a hatchback car. The locals spotted him, after which Deepti Patel, a local councillor, informed police and later took the child to Gandhinagar Civil Hospital for medical check-up. The incident became a sensation as the cherubic infant’s pictures and visuals were splashed across the media the whole day. Fourteen teams of Gandhinagar police were formed to find the infant’s family. Police also checked CCTV footage from nearby areas, employed technical surveillance and door-to-door survey to establish the identity of the child. “The teams worked round the clock for over 20 hours to crack the case. The first clue was found with identification of the car used in the incident,” said Sanghvi, adding that he lives in Gandhinagar with his parents, wife and child. Sanghavi added that the questioning to the neighbours confirmed that Shivansh, the child, is not of Dixit’s wife. The minister said his office got about 190 calls to adopt the child.  “Several police officers who were involved in the case also got requests from their families to raise the child if the parents can’t. I thank the lakhs who prayed for him and helped find his family,” said the MoS.

---||Goa||Railways carry noodles, chocolates from Goa||MARGAO: Chocolates and noodles from Goa are the new categories of consignments that the South Western Railway (SWR) has added to its freight on air-conditioned parcel express trains. “For the first time, SWR utilised idle AC coaches to transport chocolates and other food products that require low and controlled temperatures during transit,” an SWR spokesperson said. On Thursday, chocolates and noodles weighing 163 tonnes were loaded into 18 AC coaches — 12 of three-tier AC and six of two-tier AC —from Vasco to Okhla in Delhi. The AC parcel express train will cover a distance of 2,115km before reaching Delhi. The initiative has fetched the Railways a revenue of Rs12.8 lakh. SWR sources said it was due to the marketing efforts of the business development unit (BDU) of the Hubballi division that this new stream of traffic — which traditionally used roadways — has been captured by the Railways. Congratulating the efforts of the BDU, Hubballi divisional railway manager Arvind Malkhede said the Railways has been proactively reaching out to customers to utilise rail services that are “faster, smoother and cost-effective”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rlys-carry-noodles-chocolates-from-goa/articleshow/86902496.cms||---
---||Goa||GIDC: SC status quo not for land returned by five SEZ promoters||Panaji: Nearly a month after questions were raised about the auction of 5 lakh sqm of repossessed SEZ land, Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) has said that the status quo ordered by the Supreme Court does not apply to the area which has been returned by five SEZ promoters.  The GIDC said that the status quo is only on 12.3 lakh sqm of land at Keri - Ponda and 2 lakh sqm at Verna. Meditab Specialities and Maxgrow Finlease are the two SEZ promoters who have not yet returned the land to the GIDC through a mutual settlement as agreed by the other SEZ promoters. “The Goa Industrial Development Corporation has informed that the status quo is not operative as against the area which has been already repossessed by Goa IDC after refunding the amounts as per the judgment of the Supreme Court nor there are any legal impediments for GIDC to auction the plots I-1 to I-31 advertised recently,” a GIDC statement read. After the GIDC decided to auction 31 industrial plots at Verna, Franky Monteiro, one of the petitioners in the case pending before the Supreme Court, sent a legal notice to chief minister Pramod Sawant, industries minister Vishwajit Rane and the GIDC. Monteiro claimed that on January 10, 2011, the Supreme Court had directed all stakeholders in the case to maintain the status quo. The GIDC said that the Supreme Court disposed of the appeals filed by Peninsula Pharma Research Centre, K Raheja Corp, Paradigm Logistics & Distribution, Inox Mercantile and Planetview Mercantile after the five companies agreed to return the land and claim a refund. After the GIDC returned the funds, the status quo was lifted and the petitions were disposed of. GIDC officials said that Monteiro’s lawyers were present during the hearings and when the order was passed in October 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gidc-sc-status-quo-not-for-land-returned-by-five-sez-promoters/articleshow/86902578.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Mapusa oppn councillors demand new chief officer for civic body||330 words. EDITED Times News Network Saligao: Opposition councillors of the Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC), under the Mapxeakaracho Ekvott panel, have demanded with chief minister Pramod Sawant that the present MMC chief officer be transferred and that a new officer be appointed in his place. The chief officer is not keeping in good health and as a result, a number of files are pending, they said. The councillors said that after getting elected, their panel supported the MMC chairperson to carry forward development of Mapusa, but that the chairperson has failed to discharge her duties efficiently. Councillor Shashank Narvekar said that locals visiting the municipal office face a lot of harassment with regards to issuance of permissions and licenses and that the time taken to issue the permissions is also very long. “An application was submitted to the municipality in April for grant of NOC for water connection for a shop. The owner has been paying all the taxes, including the establishment tax for setting up a beauty parlor. However, till date, he has not received the NOC,” Narvekar said. “The administration should build confidence in the minds of citizens that they can come to the municipality without any hassles or difficulties and their work will be done.” “We demand that the chief officer should be transferred as he is not keeping in good health, which has resulted in a number of files remaining pending. Around 25 to 50 files come to the municipality and after officials of various departments have done the notings, they go to the chief officer for his signature. So, if the chief officer himself is not present in office, how will these files move forward?” Narvekar said. They said that despite Mapusa being a B-grade municipality, which has a huge population, the government is still not efficient in appointing a full time chief officer. “We have requested the chairperson to at least write to the DMA to relieve the present chief officer from additional charges which he is holding,” Narvekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-oppn-councillors-demand-new-chief-officer-for-civic-body/articleshow/86902676.cms||---

If they all run at full capacity — which will be required in the coming irrigation season — the coal stocks will run out in three days, say sources. The situation is critical but the government will manage, principal secretary energy, Sanjay Dubey told TOI. At Shri Singaji Thermal Power Station, the biggest and one of the newest in MP, the coal stock will last only 1.5 days if it runs at full capacity, say sources. At this point, coal is being procured on a daily basis. Officials are reviewing the situation at least four times a day and taking all measures to ensure supplies come through on time It is a national, rather international, crisis but we will manage. Coal is arriving every day and we are procuring a little more than what we are using up. We are taking all measures to ensure there is no disruption in supply. The situation is critical but we are taking all measures to augment supply, including transporting coal via road and rail from different areas,” principal secretary energy, Sanjay Dubey told TOI . “As of now there no black-out situation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/coal-runs-low-at-madhya-pradesh-power-plants/articleshow/86904909.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Supriyo said he remained a BJP MP as he was yet to get Speaker Om Birla’s appointment to resign from the Lok Sabha. Supriyo said he had written to the Speaker on Friday. He posted on Twitter: “No rocket science involved here. Please note I’m still a BJP MP. In fact, I wrote another humble request to Honourable Speaker Sir to kindly grant me some time to meet him and resign as per rules. Very thoughtful of Trinamool Congress to allow me some time to settle in Kolkata after shifting base.” The 20-member TMC star campaigner list led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee includes Abhishek Banerjee and senior party leaders. It also includes Dev and Mimi, both MPs who had campaigned extensively in the 2021 assembly polls, June and Sayantika Banerjee, actors who contested, and Aditi Munshi, the kirtan singer, now also an MLA. Supriyo, incidentally, was named in BJP’s star campaigner list for the Bhowanipore, Jangipur and Shamsherganj bypolls that concluded on October 3. He didn’t campaign for BJP. He also didn’t campaign for TMC, urging party leaders not to put him in a spot to campaign against Priyanka Tibrewal, whom he calls his sister. Supriyo had been in Delhi immediately after his September 18 defection to resign from the Lok Sabha. But he didn’t get an appointment with the speaker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/babul-clears-air-on-tmc-star-campaigner-list-says-hes-yet-to-resign-from-ls/articleshow/86901966.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Fresh off the Success Loom||The textile and apparel industry is the second largest job generator after agriculture and contributes 2% to the country’s GDP. Covid-induced economic challenges have prompted market leaders in the segment to reinvent themselves with ample support from e-commerce giants Kolkata: Being challenged in life is inevitable. Being defeated is optional. And, apparel captains of Bengal are not willing to throw in the towel yet in their battle against a pandemic. In fact, they are reinventing and re-strategising to create opportunities amid a crisis. Lux Industries, for one, has ramped up its online presence with ample support from Amazon, Myntra, Flipkart, Ajio and Nykaa Fashions. “Teaming up with e-commerce platforms has improved the company’s visibility in general and has been beneficial for our brands — Lux Cozi, ONN, One8, Lyra and Lux Venus — in particular,” said chairman Ashok Kumar Todi. Ashok Kumar TodiThe company is also generously using social media to keep its customers updated on new launches, campaigns and brand vision. “During the lockdown, we had launched a full-fledged campaign on the ways consumers could distinguish Lux’s white vests from competing alternatives. The company wove the product’s positioning around 21 distinctive attributes with the punchline ‘Ikkis khoobiyon wali baniyaan’,” said its managing director Pradip Kumar Todi. Pradip Kumar TodiLux Industries first opened shop in 1995 with the vision of becoming a leading manufacturer in “comfort innerwear” in the country. Its flagship brand Lux Cozi was born in 2001, following which the company gained momentum and transitioned from an unorganised sector to a brand-driven organised sector. At present, it offers a wide range of hosiery products for men, women and children, and has launched its exclusive brand outlet ‘CozyWorld’ to extend consumer engagement through retail. With an annual turnover of Rs 1,964.86 crore (till March 2021) and a workforce of 2,400-plus people, Lux Industries has also evolved into a multi-continental brand that is available in 47 countries. A greenfield expansion of Rs 110 crore is on the cards. The textile and apparel industry is the second biggest employment generator after agriculture and contributes 2% to the country’s GDP. Both unorganised and organised sectors employ millions of workers, who are either intrastate rural migrants or migrants from neighbouring states doing the same job for lower wages than local labour. Since this workforce had to return home during lockdown and is not back in full strength yet, the textile industry is grappling with inadequate human resource. Ramesh Agarwal“Covid-19 has been unkindest to the vulnerable groups of our society. Many big hosiery businesses have set up hostels for labourers so that the latter do not lose their source of income and production continues despite restricted workforce movement,” said Ramesh Agarwal, whole-time director and CFO, Rupa. However, as the hosiery industry continues to remain largely unorganised and heavily reliant on cash and credit, smaller players are still struggling to recover from the economic slump. “These players have had to shut down their businesses owing to overstretched working capital and liquidity, as well as increasing raw material prices,” he added. A Kolkata-based company that began its journey in 1968, Rupa is among the largest knitwear brands in India that produce innerwear, casual wear, thermal wear and sleepwear for men, women and children. While Frontline is its flagship brand, Rupa also has others like Softline, Euro, Bumchums, Torrido, Thermocot, Macroman and Jon. Vinod Kumar Gupta“When lockdown was imposed, most retail outlets had to shut down and business was hit. However, online hosiery sales saw a surge, courtesy customers from tier-2 and tier-3 cities. We are trying to expand our e-presence through our exclusive ‘Rupaonlinestore’ and in partnership with key e-players like Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra,” Agarwal said. “Our annual turnover for 2019-20 was Rs 975 crore and for 2020-21 Rs 1,313 crore. We have grown by 35% in turnover and by 34% in net profits in 2020-21,” he added. According to Vinod Kumar Gupta, the managing director of Dollar Industries, the shortage of yarn in the domestic market is a major challenge that has resulted in an increase in prices of hosiery and knitwear products. “The production of yarn in factories was put on hold during the lockdown. Additionally, the surge in yarn export to Europe and the US since October, owing to disruptions in their domestic production as well as sourcing from China, essentially resulted in a yarn shortage in the domestic market. As a result, hosiery brands have jacked up prices,” he said. Instead of being paralysed by an abnormal hike in yarn prices, Dollar Industries shifted focus to new business avenues. “Since work-from-home has become the new normal, athleisure has gained popularity across demography. We recently made forays into this segment and around 7% of our total turnover is coming from it,” Gupta said. Established in 2008 as a one-stop shop for innerwear needs of men, women and children, Dollar Industries has emerged as one of the leading brands in the hosiery sector with an enviable 15% market share and a significant percentage in textile exports of the total production in the Indian hosiery market. Given the company’s extensive presence across social media and e-commerce platforms, it has also emerged as the highest-selling Indian innerwear brand in the UAE and West Asia. “We have tied up with Amazon, Myntra and Flipkart, and witnessed a 3X growth in our online sales,” Gupta said. Sanjay K JainEstablished in Kolkata in 1964, TT Limited is an all-India brand dealing in innerwear and casuals. Its manufacturing units are located in Tamil Nadu, UP and Gujarat, besides Bengal. According to its MD Sanjay K Jain, the GST Council’s decision to correct inverted duty structure to lessen the tax burden on the apparel industry is a key problem. “It came as a shock because the common man will have to pay 7% extra, which may impact the MSME and retail sectors. Reduction in working capital and a sharp drop in cash flow are challenges too,” he said. To stay competitive in this new environment, TT is resorting to cost-efficient practices and has prioritised the use of technology to continue operations despite mobility restrictions. “We are currently selling across leading online platforms like Flipkart, Amazon, Ajio, Paytm and Snapdeal,” Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fresh-off-the-success-loom/articleshow/86902825.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Nadda may inaugurate online BJP’s EZCC Puja||Kolkata: TheDurga Puja at Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC), being organised by the Bengal BJP, is likely to be inaugurated online by the party’s national president J P Nadda on Mahasashthi Monday. Last year, PM Narendra Modi had done the honours along with e-launching five other pandals in the city. This year, the BJP was late in sending requisition for the Puja at EZCC. Party leaders pointed out that according to the Shastras, the rituals must be held at least thrice at the same place. Sources said a request had been forwarded to Nadda. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh, however, is not in favour of a Durga Puja under political patronage. He said since the Puja had already been performed once, he wanted it to be held in a “smaller format” this time. During a meeting last week, state BJP president Sukanta Majumdar supported the abridged Puja version and Bengal unit vice-president Pratap Bandyopadhyay was given the charge to organise it. While there were suggestions to host the rituals in a hall on the EZCC premises, it was finally decided that the Puja would be held where it was held last year. “The party’s cultural cell is organising the Puja. Invitations have been sent to people on behalf of the BJP parivaar. The idol will be brought on Sunday and the inauguration is slated for Monday in presence of the state president,” said a party leader. While giant screens will be put up for revellers, the rest of the celebrations will likely be muted. The BJP is yet to take a call on whether to set up party stalls near the pandal this time. Meanwhile, on Saturday, BJP leaders inaugurated various pandals, including the one at Santosh Mitra Square and another hosted by murdered BJP worker Abhijit Sarkar’s family in Kankurgachhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nadda-may-inaugurate-online-bjps-ezcc-puja/articleshow/86901967.cms||Rohit Khanna

These birds, commonly found in Australia, were handed over to the Bethuadahari Wildlife Sanctuary Authority. A troop of BSF jawans were manning the Indo-Bangladesh border when they spotted cartons and found the birds inside. “These are farmed birds and need specialized facilities that can handle them. South Africa is a big hub for straw-necked ibis, but some European countries breed them too,” said Sujan Chatterjee, secretary of the Bird Watchers’ Society. “Black ibis, glossy ibis and red-naped ibis can be found in India. But this species has not been spotted in the country,” said Suman Pratihar, a bird enthusiast and assistant professor of zoology at Keshpur College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bsf-seizes-5-birds-being-smuggled-to-bdesh/articleshow/86902190.cms||---

When police attempted to intervene, an aide of the pradhan beat him up. The incidents led to massive unrest in the area. Prohibitory orders had to be imposed to prevent the violence from escalating and a huge force was deployed to contain the situation. The first incident happened late on Friday. The pradhan of the Trinamool Congress-controlled Patkata gram panchayat, Pradhan Hembram, got into a feud with a local over a minor accident following which he allegedly beat up the man. This triggered fury among residents of Indira Gandhi Colony and they thrashed Hembram. As news of Hembram, a close aide of Trinamool’s SC/ST cell president Krishna Das being beaten up spread, a huge team rushed to Indira Gandhi Colony from Patkata’s Natunbas area. By that time police had reached the spot and the cops were trying to control the situation when another aide of Krishna beat up ASI Mukul Ishwar. Mukul is now undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Siliguri. Hembram is undergoing treatment at Jalpaiguri Superspeciality Hospital. Police have lodged a suo motu complaint. Forces from Jalpaiguri. Alipurduar, Cooch Behar and Darjeeling have been deployed to avoid any further untoward incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/village-head-beaten-up-cop-injured-in-jalpaiguri-violence/articleshow/86902049.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||Bhopal||Top in first jabs, Madhya Pradesh ranks poor in second dose coverage||BHOPAL: With 89% coverage, Madhya Pradesh leads the highly populated states when it comes to administering first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. However, it is among low performing states in country when it comes to second dose vaccination. Reason: The slowed down vaccination in this month so far, data shows. Out of an estimated eligible population of 5.5 crore, around 4.89 crore people have been administered with the first dose of the vaccine and so far 1.62 crore second dose of vaccines have been administered across the state. Since a large portion of population has been administered with the first dose, majority of the vaccine doses that are being administered are second doses, officials said. So far in this month, only around 16.88 lakh doses have been administered in the state. It averages to around 1.8 lakh vaccine doses per day. However, if target of fully vaccinating each and every eligible individual is considered, at least 3.8 lakh vaccine doses need to be administered everyday in the state. It would be only after this that the entire eligible population could be vaccinated by the end of 2021. Sources within the health department said that there is no shortage of vaccines. However, there are a few reasons that are impacting the vaccination as of now. Firstly, it is harvest season and even after motivators reaching them, people are avoiding citing urgent time-bound field works. Moreover, this is season of festivals. Earlier there was ‘pitrapaksha’ and now Navratri is going on. As such, a large number of people undergo fasting. Thus it is being expected that vaccination will gain momentum only after the first fortnight of Octobersaid sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/top-in-first-jabs-madhya-pradesh-ranks-poor-in-second-dose-coverage/articleshow/86904993.cms||Amarjeet Singh

---||Nagpur||ZP-PS bypolls show BJP losing ground||Nagpur: After an unexpected debacle of BJP in zilla parishad (ZP) and panchayat samiti (PS) bypolls in Nagpur district, considered to be the party’s stronghold, Congress leaders predict similar trend to continue in the forthcoming civic elections, scheduled in February-March next year. Besides the anti-incumbency factor, leaders from the grand old party expect raging issues like skyrocketing prices of fuel and essential commodities along with unemployment to go against the saffron party that has been ruling the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for the last 15 years. On the other hand, BJP leaders are confident that people would vote them back to power with a clear mandate, like in 2017 elections, on the basis of developmental works like cement roads, 24x7 water supply, Metro and national-level education institutions, during the party’s regime of one-and-a-half decades. “The BJP tried all tricks to defeat Congress in ZP and PS bypoll by blaming the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for failure to defend OBC reservation in the local bodies. However, people have now realised their folly and have voted them out. Nothing can be more ironic than the fact that BJP lost three seats from Hingna, where it was having a sitting MLA (Sameer Meghe). Even in the NMC, BJP has failed on all fronts, as all its promises have turned out to be mere rhetoric,” said Congress city president Vikas Thakre. BJP city chief Pravin Datke expressed confidence that people of Nagpur would once again repose their faith in his party during the next year’s elections, not only on account of development, but also due to party workers extending all help to Covid victims’ families, risking their own life. “In the recent NMC bypolls, we have won the seat by a record margin, which indicates people still trust us. However, we are not overconfident and working at the grass roots level to address people’s grievances across the city. The people are witnessing the phenomenal work done in the last 15 years under the guidance of our top leaders — Union minister Nitin Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis,” said Datke. Pointing at the high inflation and ever growing fuel and LPG prices, Congress MLC Abhijit Wanjari said the voters have started realising about the misrule of the BJP at the Centre and NMC. “The setback in ZP bypolls is certainly an indication toward waning popularity of the BJP. Look at their mishandling of the entire Lakhimpur Kheri incident. Though farmers and other communities are suffering due to the pandemic, the Modi government is not controlling the prices of essential commodities. The Congress would certainly put up a good show in civic polls as voters have fed up with the BJP’s misrule and want change,” he said. Terming Congress claims as “gossip”, BJP state secretary Archana Dehankar said there is absolutely no relation of ZP and PS polls with those in the city, as the conditions are altogether different. “We are just reduced by one seat in comparison to the last ZP election, which is not a big deal,” she said. “Politics in rural and urban areas is completely different. In cities, development matters, and people have seen extraordinary works done by the BJP in the last 15 years, which has catapulted Nagpur into one of the world’s fastest growing cities. Earlier, it was known as a big village under the guise of a city, under the Congress regime,” said Dehankar.

---||World||China reunification with Taiwan ‘must’ be fulfilled: Xi Jinping||BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed on Saturday to achieve “peaceful reunification” with Taiwan, and did not directly mention the use of force after a week of tensions with the Chinese-claimed island that sparked international concern. Taiwan responded shortly after by calling on Beijing to abandon its coercion, reiterating that only Taiwan’s people could decide their future. Democratically ruled Taiwan has come under increased military and political pressure from Beijing to accept its sovereignty, but Taipei has pledged to defend its freedom. Speaking at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Xi said the Chinese people have a “glorious tradition” of opposing separatism. “Taiwan independence separatism is the biggest obstacle to achieving the reunification of the motherland, and the most serious hidden danger to national rejuvenation,” he said on the anniversary of the revolution that overthrew the last imperial dynasty in 1911. Peaceful “reunification” best meets the overall interests of the Taiwanese people, but China will protect its sovereignty and unity, he added. “No one should underestimate the Chinese people’s staunch determination, firm will, and strong ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Xi said. “The historical task of the complete reunification of motherland must be fulfilled, and will definitely be fulfilled.” He struck a slightly softer tone than in July, his last major speech mentioning Taiwan, in which he vowed to “smash” any attempts at formal independence. In 2019, he directly threatened to use force to bring the island under Beijing'’ control. Still, the speech was poorly received in Taiwan. The presidential office said they were a sovereign independent country, not part of the People’s Republic of China, and had clearly rejected China’s offer of “one country, two systems” to rule the island. “The nation’s future rests in the hands of Taiwan’s people,” the office said. In a separate statement, Taiwan’s China-policy making mainland affairs council called on Beijing to “abandon its provocative steps of intrusion, harassment and destruction” and return to talks. China’s air force mounted four straight days of incursions into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone from October 1, involving close to 150 aircraft, though those missions have since ended. Xi made no mention of those flights. Taiwan officially calls itself the Republic of China, the name of the country established in 1912 after the fall of the Qing dynasty. That government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists, who set up today's People’s Republic. Taiwan marks October 10, the date when the anti-imperial revolution began in China, as its national day, and President Tsai Ing-wen will give a keynote address in Taipei on Sunday. Tsai, speaking at a pre-national day reception on Saturday, thanked the armed forces for protecting Taiwan, though did not mention the tensions with China. “We will continue to work hard to hold fast the front lines of democracy and freedom,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-reunification-with-taiwan-must-be-fulfilled-xi-jinping/articleshow/86905000.cms||---
---||Kolkata||CBI arrests 11 for Nandigram BJP worker’s death||Nandigram: The CBI on Saturday arrested 11 people in connection with the alleged murder of BJP worker Debabrata Maiti at Chillogram in East Midnapore’s Nandigram after the assembly election results were declared on May 2. The arrests sparked a political row with the Trinamool Congress linking the development to BJP MLA Suvendu Adhikari’s reported statement that “everyone implicated in the NHRC report will be arrested” and the BJP dismissing the allegation saying that the CBI action was part of a “high court monitored probe”. The agency had on Friday filed a murder charge sheet in the case that named only three persons. However, it grilled 11 people accused in the FIR and arrested them within 24 hours. They were produced in the Haldia ACJM court and remanded in CBI custody for three days. Those arrested include Trinamool leader Sheikh Sufiyan’s son-in-law Sheikh Hakibul, husband of Kendmaari panchayat pradhan Sheikh Sahauddin, husband of Nandigram panchayat pradhan Sheikh Baitul Islam and Mohammadpur panchayat pradhan Sheikh Habibul. Sufiyan, who was chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s election agent in Nandigram and has been quizzed by the CBI in the past, said Adhikari came to Nandigram on Mahalaya and claimed two persons would be arrested soon in connection with the Maiti case. “This clearly shows that the accused are being victimised under political patronage,” Sufiyan added. The BJP’s Tamluk organisational district vice-president Pralay Pal rubbished the allegations. “He (Adhikari) had only said that those who figure in the NHRC report to Calcutta High Court would be arrested. The HC ordered the CBI probe (into post-poll violence) and is monitoring it. How can there be any question of influence? They (Trinamool) are trying to mislead people,” Pal said. Adhikari did not issue any statement in this regard. BJP worker Maiti was allegedly attacked on May 3 and he succumbed to his injuries in hospital on May 13. “Police had earlier arrested three persons in the case. One of them is in custody now. The CBI’s charge sheet also mentioned those three. The 11 arrested had already faced CBI interrogation and had cooperated with the agency,” said defence lawyer Bimal Kumar Majee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbi-arrests-11-for-nandigram-bjp-workers-death/articleshow/86901958.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Nagpur||Ex-dy mayor fined Rs10k for filing PIL with personal agenda||Nagpur: Continuing its tough stand on people filing frivolous public interest litigations (PILs), the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court slapped Rs10,000 fine on former deputy mayor and sitting BJP corporator Satish Hole for misusing the judicial tool to fulfil his personal agenda. Hole was deputy mayor of the ciity in 2016. “The petitioner’s move unmistakably shows the personal agenda behind the facade of public interest. If such a move is encouraged in any manner by this court, it would lead to causing immense harm to the interest of the public. Such a tendency must, therefore, be discouraged, rather be nipped in the bud,” said a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor. “We find that this petition has not been filed in a bona fide manner and in good faith,” the judges said, before dismissing the PIL. Further directing the corporator from South Nagpur to deposit the fine amount with the High Court Legal Services Sub Committee within two weeks, the bench asked its registry to place this petition before it for necessary coercive order, in case of his failure to follow the orders. Hole, who is working with the Nagpur University, had moved the HC for directives to the respondents, including Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), to make parking arrangement for vehicles in Rashtriya Gandhi Market situated at Sakkardara bearing city survey no. 83 in zone no.1 and at city survey no. 148 in zone no.2, by keeping some shops vacant. Through counsel Vilas Waghmare, Hole had demanded to prohibit NMC from allotting vacant shops and vending platforms to respective bidders by virtue of e-tender notice. “The petitioner, in the name of removing inconvenience to the public, appears to be pursuing his own agenda. Otherwise, he would not have made any such prayer for issuance of a directive to the respondents. When we notice this prayer, a firm impression that arises in our mind is that there is some hidden agenda behind filing of the petition,” the bench said. The judges noted that unused shops and vending platforms are legal constructions made by the NMC and therefore, it would have every right to deal with those to serve the interest of the public and which would lead to earning some income. “But, the petitioner does not see a larger public interest in such an action. On the pretext of providing sufficient parking space at Rashtriya Gandhi Market, the petitioner is bent upon stalling e-auction,” the judges noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-dy-mayor-fined-rs10k-for-filing-pil-with-personal-agenda/articleshow/86923604.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kolkata||Bengal to get 27 companies of central forces for Oct 30 bypolls||Kolkata: The EC has decided to initially deploy 27 companies of central forces for the October 30 by-elections in four assembly seats of Bengal. The forces are expected to arrive by October 13 and start area domination for holding peaceful polling. Sources said the 27 companies would comprise eight of CRPF, nine of BSF and five each of CISF and SSB. “The EC is likely to send in more central forces, but the same will be finalised after the law and order situation is reviewed in the poll-bound districts,” an official said. The apex poll panel is likely to be extra cautious in posting central forces in Cooch Behar district, where four persons died in alleged CISF firing near a Sitalkuchi booth on April 10 during the assembly elections. On Saturday, expenditure observer for Gosaba seat Tamizh Vendan held a meeting with district officials of South 24 Parganas at Alipore in the presence of ADM (land reforms) Nitesh Dhali and additional director of IT JP Yadav. Gosaba fell vacant following the death of Trinamool MLA Jayanta Naskar as did the Khardah seat, where Trinamool’s winning candidate Kajal Sinha died of Covid before the assembly poll results were announced on May 2. State agriculture minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who stepped down as Bhowanipore MLA to make way for CM Mamata Banerjee, has filed his nomination from Khardah. By-elections are scheduled in Santipur (Nadia) and Dinhata (Cooch Behar) because the winners there decided to retain their Parliament memberships. BJP MP Nisith Pramanik had contested from Dinhata and won by 57 votes against Udayan Guha of Trinamool Congress. But, he resigned from the assembly and is now Union minister of state for home. Similarly, BJP’s Jagannath Sarkar won from Santipur, but chose to remain a Lok Sabha MP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-to-get-27-companies-of-central-forces-for-oct-30-bypolls/articleshow/86901994.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The contraband consignment, the biggest ever in recent times, was busted by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence on September 16. Since national security issues are also involved in the seizure of almost three tonnes of heroin, the investigation was handed over to the NIA. After taking over the charge, the NIA conducted the raids in Vijayawada and a few other places across the country. The NIA had seized some documents from the premises of Aashi Trading Company during the searches. Later, the NIA issued a statement that it had conducted searches in Chennai, Coimbatore and Vijayawada on the premises of accused/suspects involved in import of semi processed talc stones with the contraband concealed. The NIA took up the probe on Wednesday and registered a case under sections 120 B IPC, section 8 (C), 23 of NDPS Act and section 17, 18 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. “During the searches various incriminating documents, articles and other items have been seized,” the NIA said. On September 16 the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) upon credible information raided and seized almost three tonnes of heroin in two different containers at Mundra port. Drugs were concealed in import consignmentPreliminary investigation revealed that drugs were concealed in import consignment of ‘semi-processed talc stones’ originating from Afghanistan, which had arrived from Bandar Abbas Port, Iran.

The company is owned by Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali. Officials arrested Vaishali and her husband Machavaram Sudhakar, native of Kakinada, from Chennai. Along with them, four Afghan nationals, an Uzbek woman and others have been arrested by the DRI so far.

The exercise, which has started six months ahead of the state budget, will have three stages before it is considered for inclusion in the state budget 2022-2023. According to sources, the state government has sent communication to the gram panchayats asking them to prepare their budget plan. The panchayats, which were formed after the elections early this year, would consider the requirements in the villages including roads and drinking water while preparing plans. The budgets prepared at the village panchayat, would be sent to the mandal parishad, where the budgets of all villages will be considered. The mandal parishad would then prepare its own budget, consolidating the budgets received, from the village panchayats. The budgets prepared at the mandal level would then be sent to the zilla parishad which, under the guidance of the district collector, would consolidate and prepare a budget for the district and then send it to the state with department-wise expenditure and plans. The state government is planning to take the budget proposals received from the districts before giving a shape to the state budget. The government plans to have an inclusive budget taking into consideration the aspirations of the people represented from the grassroots level. Meanwhile, the state government has sent requisitions to all the departments to start the work on budget and send the proposals. The heads of departments (HoDs) have already started the work on preparing the requirements and estimates. Gandhi’s ‘Gram Vikas’ to be realityThe HoDs were also asked to revisit all the projects and have physical verification of every proposal before mentioning it in the departmental proposal to be included in the state budget. “It is a good exercise with laborious task. Gram Vikas dream of Mahatma Gandhi will become a reality if the budget proposals are taken from the village panchayats as being planned now,” a senior officer told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-begins-budget-preparation-from-village-panchayat-level/articleshow/86899158.cms||Gopi Dara

The truck driver was killed, too. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia expressed their condolences. The Ahirwar family of Anjania Taparia village, around 50km from Damoh district headquarters, was settling down for the night when tragedy struck. Hariram and Neha were watching TV and their children — Omkar, 16, Akash, 17, and Manisha 19 — were already asleep when the truck slammed into an electric pole, careened off the road and toppled on their hut around 9pm. A mountain of gravel buried the house, and the truck tumbled on top of the heap. The noise brought villagers running to the site. “We could see only a heap of gravel where the house was,” said Raghvendra Ahirwar, a local. Villagers began digging with shovels and even bare hands to rescue the trapped family. Police arrived, too. It took an hour for them to reach the victims. By then, the three teenagers were dead.

---||Vijayawada||AP: Police arrest international red sanders smuggler linked to 60 cases||TIRUPATI: Chittoor district police on Saturday arrested international red sanders smuggler G Ramanadha Reddy, who has allegedly smuggled 500 tonnes of red sanders logs, worth several hundreds of crore rupees so far. Special enforcement bureau (SEB) joint director V Vidyasagar Naidu said that Ramanadha Reddy, a resident of Chendluru village in Chapadu mandal of Kadapa district, is a notorious red sanders smuggler, who is a key accused in 60 smuggling cases registered at various police stations in Kadapa, Kurnool, Anantapur, Chittoor and Nellore districts.

---||Ludhiana||Coal crisis: Punjab faces cuts, buys power at Rs 13/unit||PATIALA: Amid the ongoing coal crisis, Punjab, on Saturday, witnessed scheduled and unscheduled power cuts in all major cities like Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar and Patiala as well as rural areas. The power crisis also forced Punjab State Power Corporation Limited to withdraw around 1800 MW of power from outside at a cost of Rs 13 per unit approximately. Sources in the power sector revealed that three-four hour power cuts were imposed on domestic consumers in Punjab as the gap between power demand and supply could not be met after some units of private power producers and government-run plants were stopped from generating power. One unit of Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) stopped generation on Friday night due to technical fault. Two units of the government-run thermal plant at Ropar and one unit at , also faced shutdown. "We had to impose power cuts of around two hours in both urban and rural areas due to the coal crisis. We had to purchase around 1800 MW of power from outside sources at a higher cost of Rs 13 per unit," said chairman cum managing director PSPCL, A Venu Parsad. On Friday, PSPCL had purchased 131 lakh units at Rs13.52 per unit. The power demand in Punjab is around 1900 lakh units and there is a shortfall of at least 90 lakh units. Northern states are facing power shortage due to dwindling coal stock at thermal plants.Sources claimed that both government-run Lehra Mohabbat and Ropar thermal plants have coal stock of 4.9 and 4 days respectively and all three private plants in Punjab have less than two days of coal stock. The TSPL spokesperson claimed that only one unit was shut down due to technical fault. "We have three days of coal stock and will get a huge consignment within a few days to supply uninterrupted power," he added. Punjab has floated tenders for 500 MW of solar power to meet the crisis. Punjab CM has directed that half of this power be purchased at less than Rs 2.50 per unit and another half at Rs 2.70 per unit. "Rajasthan is also facing power cuts of up to 14 hours a day in certain pockets due to the closure of thermal units following the coal shortage. In Uttar Pradesh, the gap between demand and supply is around 5000 MW, and 5-hour power cuts have been imposed in rural areas and unannounced cuts in urban areas. In Haryana, thermal plants at Khedar, Yamunanagar, and Panipat also have coal stock in the supercritical category. As per the latest CEA report, 110 out of 135 thermal plants in the country have coal stock at a critical or supercritical level. Around 16 plants have zero stock and 30 plants have just one-day coal stock. Another 18 and 19 thermal plants have three-four days of coal stock. The dwindling coal stock at all thermal plants across the country is posing a severe power shortage problem across India," said VK Gupta, AIPEF spokesperson. Ensure coal supply, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi urges Centre:Slamming the Centre for inadequate coal supply against the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited agreements with various subsidiaries of the Coal India Ltd (CIL), Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi on Saturday urged the Centre to immediately enhance state’s coal supply according to quota to tide over power crisis with impending shutdown of its thermal plants due to fast depleting coal reserves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/coal-crisis-punjab-faces-cuts-buys-power-at-rs-13/unit/articleshow/86905171.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||World||Nobel-winning journo Maria Ressa calls FB ‘biased against facts’||MANILA: Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa used her new prominence to criticise Facebook as a threat to democracy, saying the social media giant fails to protect against the spread of hate and disinformation and is “biased against facts”. The veteran journalist and head of Philippine news site Rappler said after winning the award that Facebook’s algorithms “prioritise the spread of lies laced with anger and hate over facts”. Her comments add to the pile of recent pressure on Facebook, used by over 3 billion people, which a former employee turned whistleblower accused of putting profit over the need to curb hate speech and misinformation. Facebook denies any wrongdoing. Sought for comment on Ressa’s remarks, a Facebook spokesperson said the tech giant continues to invest heavily to remove and reduce the visibility of harmful content. “We believe in press freedom and support news organisations and journalists around the world as they continue their important work.” Ressa along with Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, for what the committee called braving the wrath of the leaders of the Philippines and Russia to expose corruption and misrule, in an endorsement of free speech under fire worldwide. Facebook has become the world’s largest distributor of news and “yet it is biased against facts, it is biased against journalism,” Ressa said. “If you have no facts, you can’t have truths, you can’t have trust. If you don’t have any of these, you don’t have a democracy,” she said. “Beyond that, if you don’t have facts, you don’t have a shared reality, so you can't solve the existential problems of climate, coronavirus.” Ressa has been the target of intense social-media hatred campaigns from President Rodrigo Duterte’s supporters, which she said were aimed at destroying her and Rappler’s credibility. “These online attacks on social media have a purpose, they are targeted, they are used like a weapon,” said the former CNN journalist. Rappler’s reporting has included close scrutiny of Duterte’s deadly war on drugs and a series of investigative reports into what it says is his government’s strategy to “weaponise” the internet, using bloggers on its payroll to stir up anger among online supporters who threaten Duterte’s critics. Duterte has not commented on Ressa’s award. Filipinos top the world in time spent on social media, according to 2021 studies by social media management firms. Platforms like Facebook have become political battlegrounds and have helped strengthen Duterte’s support base, having been instrumental in his election victory in 2016 and a rout by his allies in mid-term polls last year. The Philippines will hold an election in May to choose a successor to Duterte. who under the constitution is not allowed to seek another term. That campaign “will be a battle for facts,” Ressa said. “We are going to keep making sure our public sees the facts... We are not going to be harassed or intimidated into silence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/nobel-winning-journo-maria-ressa-calls-fb-biased-against-facts/articleshow/86905148.cms||---

The decision is likely to be taken after Diwali. Parents’ consent will still be mandatory. Parents are alarmed at the prospect of schools reopening full-strength, pointing out that Covid cases are inching up and fearing that the post-festive period may see a surge, just like last year. On the other hand, there has been no noticeable spike in Covid infections among children since schools reopened at 50% capacity — classes 1-5 since September 15 and the higher classes since July-August. There have been a couple of cases in Chhatarpur district, leading to shutdown of schools for 10 days. Most parents have refused to send children for physical classes. Attendance barely touches double digits. At best, it touches 15%, say sources. Sources said the government is keeping a close watch on Covid cases and a decision to allow 100% attendance will be taken only if the situation allows. Several private schools, meanwhile, have begun telling parents and children that they will have physical classes “in a few days”. “If all goes well, the department may allow schools to run full-strength from classes 1 to 12,” said an official, adding that parents’ consent will be a must. Parents who have been opposing even the reopening of primary classes vehemently object to such a move. Schoolteacher tests positiveA teacher in a government school in Chhatarpur district tested positive for Covid on Saturday. The administration will decide on Sunday whether to shut down the school for a few days as a precaution. Covid test samples have been taken from 50 students of the school. Barely 10 days ago, a seven-year-old child tested positive in the same district, leading to a 10-day shutdown of his school. Parents question ‘hurry’ in reopeningThis will be a disaster. Already there is huge pressure on parents after the state government allowed schools to reopen campuses. Allowing schools to run at 100% attendance will put students in peril,” said Avinash Singh, whose child is in class 1. Parents wonder what was the hurry to reopen schools for even primary classes when online classes and exams are running smoothly. “We are lucky that we haven’t yet seen Covid cases in schools. Who will be responsible if a child is infected when we send them to school? Online classes are running without any hiccups and both teachers and students are happy with the new norm, as it is safe,” said Mukesh Saxena, the father of a student in class 4||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-mulls-100-strength-in-schools-after-diwali/articleshow/86905187.cms||Ramendra Singh

As mourners in northern Afghanistan buried their dead from an attack on a Shia mosque, a Taliban delegation told US officials in Doha that any weakening of their government could cause “problems for the people”. “We clearly told them that trying to destabilise the government in Afghanistan is good for no one,” Muttaqi told the Afghan state news agency Bakhtar. “Good relations with Afghanistan are good for everyone. Nothing should be done to weaken the existing government in Afghanistan which can lead to problems for the people,” he said. The Taliban are seeking international recognition, as well as assistance to ease economic crisis. A state department official said the US delegation would press the Taliban to ensure terrorists do not create a base for attacks in the country. It would also pressure the new rulers to form an inclusive government and to respect the rights of women and girls, the official said, stressing the meeting did not indicate Washington recognised Taliban rule. “We remain clear that any legitimacy must be earned through the Taliban's own actions.” AFP Taliban rule out US help to contain IS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/dont-destabilise-taliban-government-us-told-in-1st-talks-since-withdrawal/articleshow/86905207.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Plea in high court against Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar over ‘provocative’ speech||CHANDIGARH: A petition has been filed before the Punjab and Haryana high court questioning the continuance of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on the constitutional post of CM even after making a “provocative” speech. The petition also sought a ban on Khattar’s video so that it does not become a weapon in the hands of anti-national forces for creating political and social unrest and largescale violence, which is likely to result as the passions are high on account of the Lakhimpur Kheri massacre. The petitioners in the case, who are farmers from Haryana’s Jind district stated that Khattar’s speech incites communal hatred, sectarian violence, as well as inciting a brother to commit violence against another brother and is “reminiscent of the days of the British Raj when English ruled India by force and used violence to quell lawful protests.” The petitioners have sought directions for registration of FIR under Sections 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC against Manohar Lal Khattar for deliberately issuing the viral video promulgating ‘tit for tat’ on October 3 at the Haryana CM residence during BJP’s Kisan Morcha meeting. According to the petitioners, the statement was made by Khattar close to/immediately in continuation to the Lakhimpur Kheri farmers’ massacre, where the son of a Union minister allegedly ran over innocent protesting farmers. “The farmers’ agitation is the right to protest guaranteed under the constitution and Khattar’s video amounts to crushing the agitation by force so that he is able to please the political bosses sitting in New Delhi. His action shows that he considers him above the law and under the wrong impression that he is a ruling emperor of the state of Haryana. The said speech takes away the constitutional authority vested in Khattar to continue as CM of the state. The main person responsible to uphold the law and order of the state cannot become the main person encouraging the breakdown of law and order, that too by clearly encouraging a political wing, to pick sticks and forcibly crush the ongoing peaceful protest by farmers,” the petition alleged. The petitioners, who are farmers belonging to the Safidon area of Jind, claimed to have been deeply disturbed due to the shameful incident that occurred in Lakhimpur Kheri in UP on October 3. According to them, such a statement was not expected from the CM of the state, especially when on the same day in the morning, a major incident had taken place in Lakhimpur Kheri where the loss of human life had taken place. The petitioners have impleaded the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA), the chief secretary and DGP Haryana, and the CM Manohar Lal Khattar as respondent parties in the state. The petition has been filed in the registry branch of the HC and a diary number has also been allotted. It is expected to come up for hearing next week. CM violated oath:“The speech which has gone viral will ignite passions in the state of Haryana and many other states due to the farmers’ agitation going on and this will cause the fact of adding fuel to fire and the integrity of India. This fact warrants the removal of Manohar Lal Khattar as CM of Haryana, for having made such a public statement which is a gross violation of the oath taken to uphold the Constitution of India. Khattar’s action has rendered him unfit to continue in office as he has violated the basic oath and allegiance to the Constitution,” said the petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/plea-in-high-court-against-haryana-cm-manohar-lal-khattar-over-provocative-speech/articleshow/86905215.cms||Ajay Sura

The discom is getting regular coal supply, though much lesser in quantity than the actual requirement, from Coal India Limited, said officials. Tangedco gets coal from Mahanadi Coalfields Limited and Singareni Collieries Company Limited for its five thermal stations that run with a capacity of 4,320MW. “There won’t be power cuts for now. The discom had a stock of 1.98 lakh tonnes as of Friday night. With the stock at port, that in transit and at power stations, we can generate power for the next 11 days. Tangedco received 55,000 tonnes of coal on Saturday against its requirement of 62,000 tonnes a day,” said a source. While states such as Punjab and Rajasthan have gone for scheduled power cuts, Tangedco is hopeful of maintaining the supply if Coal India Limited continues the coal supply at the same rate and the power demand remains low during monsoon. The discom is also purchasing power through exchange at high rates, ranging from ₹10-17 per unit. Power generation firms that had signed contracts with Tangedco for supply of 3,500MW power on long and medium term basis are struggling to keep their commitment owing to shortage of imported coal. Nevertheless, they are supplying about 2,000MW. The situation may get worse only if the supply gets disrupted in all these stations. “To tide over the crisis, Tangedco is purchasing 15 million units of power at ₹17 per unit,” another source said. In 2020, Centre issued guidelines stating that a stock of 750 lakh tonnes of domestic coal is available to compensate the import of coal and advised the states to purchase domestic coal from Coal India Limited. Incidentally, the Union ministry of coal had allocated Chandrabila coal block in Odisha to Tangedco and the discom also signed a coal block development and production agreement with the ministry of coal to mine 9.32sqkm, including 3.64sqkm in forest area. While the production had to commence by September 30, it did not happen owing to delay in getting clearance from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, for detailed exploration in the forest area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-power-cuts-in-tamil-nadu-for-now-tangedco/articleshow/86905294.cms||Julie Mariappan

The farmers were supposed to have met government representatives on Friday. A large number of farmers, after breaking open the various barricades put up around Manpreet Badal’s residence, reached there and started the siege. Earlier, senior officials of the state government postponed the meeting to October 13 stating that the quantum of compensation to be provided to farmers for loss to cotton crop is yet to be worked out. It is only after getting the estimated amount of compensation, approval could be obtained from the state government for enhancing the compensation beyond the policy decision, and meeting could be held with farmers, stated the official as reason behind postponement of meeting that otherwise was fixed for Saturday. Sources said the revenue department felt loss to crop due to pink bollworm attack in Bathinda and Mansa could be in around 40,000 hectares. As per state government policy, there is a provision of the compensation of Rs12,000 per acre if loss is from 76-100% and farmers are demanding compensation of Rs 60,000 per acre. “We were to lay siege to Manpreet Badal’s residence on Friday, but the district administrative officials kept on holding meetings and assured us of fixing a meeting with higher ranking officials at Chandigarh for Saturday, but in the morning we were told about postponement of meeting as the chief minister is busy in the preparations of his son’s marriage and officials could not take decision on their own so we will have to wait, This was not acceptable to us. The activists now have started protest at the residence of Manpreet Badal,” said BKU Ugrahan vice-president Janda Singh Jethuke and state secretary Shingara Singh Mann. Muktsar deputy commisioner Harpreet Singh Soodan said, “The state government has yet not got the final report of revenue assessment about loss to the crop to exactly know the quantum of the compensation. Though the loss is roughly estimated in around 40,000 hectares, final field survey still not out. The matter pertains to policy decision, so time is needed to work out various modalities. We have been told about meeting to be possible after October 11. We are trying to convince the farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/cotton-compensation-punjab-postpones-talks-at-11th-hour/articleshow/86905268.cms||Neel Kamal

The country is battling one of the planet’s worst economic crises since the 1850s, and has in recent months struggled to import enough fuel oil for its power plants. Erratic power supplies have put hospitals and essential services in crisis mode. The Lebanese increasingly depend on private operators that also struggle to secure supplies. The shortage of diesel and fuel, along with an antiquated infrastructure, has worsened power cuts. Blackouts that used to last for three to six hours could now leave areas with no more than two hours of state power a day. “The power network completely stopped working, and it is unlikely that it will work until next Monday, or for several days,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/lebanon-plunges-into-darkness-after-grid-failure/articleshow/86905292.cms||---

A submission to this effect was made before a division bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan and Justice P T Asha, by the state’s environment secretary Supriya Sahu. Recording the submissions, the bench suggested to the officer that such campaigns, especially through the media, should be done even in the private channels, so that it would reach a large number of the members of the public. “The chief minister could do his bit for the eradication campaign,” the court said. The court then directed the officer to report steps that have been taken in the direction of eradicating plastics, especially after the meeting titled PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation) held by the Prime Minister on February 24. The issue pertains to a review petition moved by the Tamil Nadu-Pondy Plastic Association to review an order passed on December 27, 2018 on a plea moved against ban of single use plastics. When the plea came up for hearing, Supriya Sahu, who appeared in person, said the state had taken around 14 different steps/campaigns to address the issue. “A steering panel has been put in place to monitor the entire campaign for eradication of plastic. We would be able to report considerable progress within three months,” she said. She further added that the state has taken steps to create awareness among the public through visual and audio media to sensitise the public. On December 27, 2018 while dismissing the original plea moved by the association, the court observed that even products exempted under the GO banning single use plastics should also be banned to make the state completely plasticfree. The court also questioned the logic behind banning plastic carry bags alone, while allowing milk and food items to be sold in plastic packs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/plastic-ban-will-show-results-in-3-months-tamil-nadu/articleshow/86905336.cms||---

The online travel aggregator, which took a guesthouse in Sector 51 on lease for operations, is accused of duping its owner of Rs 5 crore by manipulating the booking records. Oyo has refuted the allegation as “an old business disagreement”. “We are already in a formal arbitration process. We are hopeful of coming to a mutually agreeable solution soon. We are absolutely clear that we have been fair and transparent in our dealings and compliance in all manner,” a spokesperson told TOI. The FIR against Oyo was, in fact, registered at the Sector 50 police station on a complaint from Eneskay Hospitality Pvt Ltd having the guesthouse in Mayfield Garden township in Sector 51. As per an agreement with the online travel aggregator, Eneskay was supposed to receive from Oyo group firm Alcott Town Planner Pvt Ltd a part of the online travel aggregator’s revenue from bookings after deduction of commission. However, in its complaint, Eneskay claimed that Oyo started manipulating the booking records and embezzling funds from the sales of rooms, and food & beverages. “They forged account statements and provided different sales figures to us,” the complaint said. Elaborating about the fraud, the complainant alleged that Oyo used to book rooms with Eneskay at a lower price in the name of its three group companies but provided the same to guests at a higher price, thereby profiting from the differential amount. Similar practice was adopted in food bills. Eneskay detected the fraud during random checking. “The property owner was kept in the dark about the day-to-day affair. Oyo also collected GST and service tax from its customers but did not deposit the same,” according to the complaint. Besides, Oyo is also accused of using additional space without the consent of the building owner. “Only 31 rooms were given to OYO for the purpose of sales but we found out that it unauthorisedly used 34 rooms, thus causing financial loss to us,” Eneskay said in the police complaint. Based on the complaint, a case was registered against Oyo Rooms, also known as Oyo Hotels and Homes Pvt Ltd, and its group companies — Alcott Town Planners, Mypreferred Transformation and Hospitality Pvt Ltd and Oravel Stays Pvt Ltd under IPC sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 467 & 468 (forgery).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/oyo-booked-in-rs-rs-5cr-fraud-company-denies-says-an-old-business-disagreement/articleshow/86903252.cms||Bagish Jha

Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said the Centre has promised sufficient supply of coal for the state’s thermal power stations. The assurance came at Bommai’s meeting with Union minister of coal and mines Pralhad Joshi in Delhi. “Currently, we are receiving 10 rakes of coal per day and we have requested 14. The Union minister has directed officials of coal mines to meet our demand,” the CM said. Energy minister V Sunil Kumar said Coal India has assured to send two rakes within next two days. “There is nothing to worry about since we have adequate availability of wind, solar and hydropower in the event of a crisis,’’ Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/coal-shortage-karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai-allays-fears-of-power-crisis/articleshow/86905345.cms||---
---||World||Brazil 2nd nation to hit 6 lakh Covid toll; vaccination offers hope worst is over||RIO DE JANEIRO: Brazil became the second country in the world to pass 600,000 Covid-19 deaths on Friday, a dark milestone for a government that has been sharply criticised for mismanaging the outbreak. President Jair Bolsonaro has drawn the ire of health experts for his failure to implement measures to contain the pandemic. He has railed against lockdowns, aired scepticism about vaccines and refuses to wear a mask. But despite Friday’s tragic mark, there are now signs that infections in Brazil are finally ebbing, as the country ramps up vaccinations after a slow start. More than 70% of Brazilians have got a first dose, compared to 65% in the US, which passed 600,000 deaths in June. “The rejection rate of vaccines is really low,” said Alexandre Naime Barbosa, an epidemiology expert in Sao Paulo. “That’s really important for Brazil to contain the pandemic.” Brazil also appears to have been spared the worst of the Delta variant so far. Deaths are down 80% from their peak of over 3,000 per day in April, and Brazil no longer has one of the world’s highest daily tolls. The health ministry registered 615 new Covid-19 deaths on Friday, taking the total to 600,425 since the pandemic began.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/brazil-2nd-nation-to-hit-6-lakh-covid-toll-vaccination-offers-hope-worst-is-over/articleshow/86905342.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Only 1 access road and that too blocked, Vipul Lavanya RWA writes to DTCP||Gurgaon: The RWA of Vipul Lavanya, a housing society in Sector 81, has written to the department of town and country planning (DTCP) complaining that a developer has constructed three cemented blocks in the middle of their approach road. This is not only causing an obstruction for residents using the road, but also poses a risk of mishaps, they have alleged. A visit to the society showed that the developer, Landmark Ltd, has built a cemented block just outside the society gate, while two others have been built a few metres away, greatly reducing the width of the 24m-wide access road. Some residents are worried that school buses and fire tenders would face difficulties in reaching the society complex due to the narrowed width. According to them, the land on which the road is built was earlier owned by Vipul Ltd, which built the housing society. It sold the land to Landmark Ltd later. Residents alleged that Landmark raised no objections when Vipul started building the road, which connects the society to a revenue road, in 2015. Now, however, it is attempting to realign the road, which will cut off their access to the rest of the city as they have no other link roads, they alleged. Two other access roads were planned but Vipul is yet to build them, they said. The RWA filed complaints with DTCP and police earlier this week. “This road is part of the sanctioned plan and we have spent money from our pockets to get it repaired. We feel helpless and cheated as this is the only access road we have,” Amit Shekhar, the vice-president of Vipul Lavanya RWA, said. A resident, Prashant Rai, said Landmark had built a similar structure on the road in February too. “They later dismantled it. Now, they have constructed it again, making it difficult for large vehicles to reach the society. They have built a block just outside the society, and it may cause a mishap if someone doesn’t pay attention while taking a left turn just after exiting the society,” he said. When approached, a Landmark representative maintained that they did nothing wrong and the blocks have been constructed on their licensed area. “They have built the road through our licensed area. We have built the structures only for demarcation of building plans. The developer (Vipul) has other access roads which need to be constructed for residents, as we can’t allow them to use our land indefinitely for their access,” the representative said. Vipul officials couldn’t be reached for comments despite repeated attempts. Meanwhile, district town planner (enforcement) RS Bhatth said he is aware of the matter and the officials have also visited the site. “I have sought the details about the layout plan and directions will be given after it is examined. If the road is approved as per the sanctioned plan, no illegal construction will be allowed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/only-1-access-road-and-that-too-blocked-vipul-lavanya-rwa-writes-to-dtcp/articleshow/86903335.cms||Akanksha Gupta

In a step towards the beautification of the city, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is planning to hang flower baskets from traffic signals. More common in hilly areas, the feasibility of the project due to the city’s hot and dry weather conditions has already raised eyebrows, even within the Authority. After the proposal was tabled at a recent meeting of the Residents Advisory Council (RAC), GMDA’s joint chief executive officer had stated that the step would be taken by the Urban Environment Division in the matter. At a subsequent meeting, the Authority’s chief executive officer (CEO) Sudhir Rajpal directed officials to expedite the process and take “appropriate steps” to install flower baskets from traffic lights. “We are currently examining the feasibility (of the project) and ways to keep the flowers well maintained,” Rajpal said. Another official told TOI that the development authority was currently identifying the areas where the project would be implemented. “Ideally, GMDA is looking for spots where police personnel or any other officials are deployed so that these flower baskets can be maintained by them on a day-to-day basis. The Authority is considering getting tap connections in such areas to ensure that the flowers can be maintained,” the official said. A section of GMDA officials, however, have expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the plan citing the high temperatures recorded in the city through most of the year. “Measures like these are more effective in hilly areas where the temperature is lower and the weather more conducive. In Gurugram, it is already so hot. And when flower baskets are hung up, they are more likely to dry faster. Maintenance of these flowers will be a problem, and until a proper watering system is devised it (the project) is not practical,” an official said. “When maintaining greenbelts is difficult because of the weather conditions, sustaining flower baskets scattered across a stretch would be much more challenging.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/after-vertical-gardens-under-flyovers-gmda-plans-flower-baskets-at-traffic-signals-in-gurgaon/articleshow/86903332.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Gurgaon||Delhi special cell ASI held in Rs 50L theft, ‘got Rs 10L from gangster’||GURUGRAM: An assistant sub-inspector (ASI) posted with the Delhi police special cell has been arrested in connection with Rs 50-lakh theft in Sector 84, the Gurugram police said on Saturday. ASI Vikash Gulia, the police said, was a “childhood friend” of gangster Vikas Langharpuria, the mastermind in the case, and was offered around Rs 10 lakh from the booty. Inspector Anand Yadav, the in-charge of crime unit 31 of Gurugram police, told TOI that Gulia came under scanner after some criminals, arrested in the robbery case, allegedly named the cop during interrogation. On Friday, the ASI was undergoing a course at the police training centre when he was picked up by the Gurugram police crime unit. “The accused was produced before a local court on Saturday that sent him to two-day police custody,” Yadav said. According to police, around Rs 50 lakh was robbed on August 4 from the Sector 82 maintenance office of a Gurugram One residential project. On August 20, when an employee of the maintenance company went to deposit the cash in the bank, he found Rs 50 lakh missing. After scanning the CCTV camera footage they found that the money was stolen. Subsequently, a complaint was submitted at Khedki Daula police station on August 21 by Alpha Corp Management Service Private Limited, the firm which manages the residential project at Sector 84. Based on the complaint, a case was registered under IPC Section 380 (theft), police said, adding that the Gurugram police crime branch, which was investigating the case, found seven persons, all associated with gangster Vikash Langharpuria, were involved in the theft. Police initially arrested three persons, identified as Dhare, Amit alias Mite, both from Najafgarh in New Delhi, and Abhinav from UP. Around 30 cases are registered against Dhare, 10 cases are against Amit and at least two against Abhinav, police added. During interrogation, the accused reportedly told the police that gangster Vikash was the mastermind and had provided them with all the information about the location and the money. In the disclosure statement, the accused claimed ASI Gulia had received Rs 10 lakh from the booty, while the gangster took around Rs 15 lakh and the remaining Rs 25 lakh was distributed among the criminal who executed the crime, inspector Yadav said. According to the police, Gulia and the gangster belong to the same village in Badli area of Haryana and were “childhood friends”. “He (the ASI) was in constant touch with the gangster,” an investigating officer said, adding that Gulia had joined Delhi Police as a constable in 2010 and he got two out of turn promotions and recently became ASI. On Friday, the Delhi police reportedly initiated disciplinary proceedings against an ASI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/delhi-spl-cell-asi-held-in-rs-rs50l-theft-got-rs-rs10l-from-gangster/articleshow/86903343.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Stagnant water in Sector 102 vacant plots, a health risk, say residents||GURUGRAM: Some residents of Sector 102 have raised concerns about pools of stagnant water in vacant plots in the area. The pools have become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and pose a health hazard to people living in the vicinity, they said. They have demanded anti-larvae drives and fogging in the area. The residents said rainwater and excess water from sewage treatment plants (STPs) has accumulated in vacant plots. The lack of a drainage network and authorities neglecting maintenance of the area has added to the problem, they alleged. “In the absence of adequate civic infrastructure, rainwater has flowed onto several plots for the past couple of weeks. Private tankers also dump treated sewage water here regularly,” said Capt Rakesh Kumar (retd), a resident of Oyster Grande. Some residents alleged that despite several complaints, the authorities concerned are not paying any heed to their problems. Dr Rao Parikshit, a resident of Gurugram Greens, said: “We have been raising the matter on social media and other platforms, but nothing has been done so far.” He added, “With the rising number of dengue, malaria and chikungunya cases, the authorities need to be proactive before an outbreak happens. Regular fogging is required as the chance of spread of vector-borne diseases is high. Over 3,000 families are living here in several housing societies.” When approached, Hariom Attri, the joint commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, said they have already prepared a schedule for a fogging drive across all zones. “I will also ask the official concerned to look into the problem and ensure fogging in the area. One can file a complaint at the helpline 18001801817,” he said. Meanwhile, officials from the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said the transfer of drainage and sewerage networks in the area to them hasn’t been completed yet. “We are already expediting the matter with the authorities concerned,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/stagnant-water-in-vacant-plots-a-health-risk-say-sector-102-residents/articleshow/86903348.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Chennai||After lockdown, people want to declutter emotionally, reclaim normalcy||It was a realisation that dawned slowly but surely on professor and filmmaker Uma Vangal. Being too invested in engaging with people, places, issues, and opinions often left her depleted. The lockdown only brought this into sharp focus, so Uma began decluttering her emotional life. “I began by deleting WhatsApp groups that were becoming a drain on my time — family groups, many friends who send photos and quotes every day, and groups where conversations were toxic,” she says. “The second place was Facebook where I received vitriol from people who disagreed with my apolitical position, tendency to review films honestly, and my views on issues. It took me a couple of months to block or remove friends following an alphabetical order so I was reviewing systematically who stayed and who I bid goodbye to,” says Uma, adding it spilled over into real-life contacts and conversations too. “I began consciously staying away from gatherings, friends or conversations that may be a source of irritation or emotional distress,” she says, adding that she is now happier, calmer, and more relaxed. People have long realised the benefits of leading a minimalist life, and experts like Marie Kondo have helped clients clear out the clutter in their homes. But the pandemic and resultant lockdowns have prompted many to take a deep dive into their inner selves, and practice emotional minimalism, purging their lives of anything that disturbs their mental and emotional balance. Whether it’s cutting down unnecessary emotional engagement with the world, staying away from smartphones, opting out of toxic friendships and relationships, putting dating on the backburner — the focus is on inner calm and satisfaction. Wellness coach Sanjay Chaganti says, after years spent on the road for work, the lockdown and resultant stability brought about a more relaxed mind and, hence, clarity. “I realised my life could be minimalised into four boxes — what energises me (learning and teaching people), what I enjoy doing (being with immediate family, working on my physical and mental wellness, connecting with a few close friends), what my responsibilities are (looking after elderly parents, generating an income) and what are distractions that are really noise that I need to ignore or manage,” he says. “The distractions are very often self-created and external, like getting too worked up about relationships and the way you interact with people.” Having attained that clarity over the last 12 months, he has cut down on emotional clutter. “I have reduced engagements with multiple people at a very basic level, spend less time on FB, and even cut down on time spent with extended family,” says Sanjay. “Last year, there was a family trip outstation that I would have gone on earlier. But I chose to spend the previous day with them and opted out of the trip as I felt it would interrupt my routine. I am making more conscious choices where I want to spend my energies and time.” As a wellness coach, he is also seeing many clients who want to declutter emotionally. “People have realised which relationships are important and want to spend more time on those,” says Sanjay. “People want to be human beings more than human doings.” A few are even choosing to cleanse intimate partner relationships by disengaging from sex. “I have chosen to be celibate for a while now because personally, I found it impossible to disengage from the negative, suffocating, emotionally restrictive trap of relationships when I was still physical. And the boundaries became clearer in other relationships too once this got sorted,” says a 49-year-old mother of two. “Patriarchy conditions you to be that pillar of strength, that friend in need, that selfsacrificing daughter and daughter-inlaw but it’s a relief to not get involved, and offer to save the day every time something goes wrong.” People who practise emotional minimalism are not free from criticism. “Some snarky comments on other people’s feeds or posts about me being ‘sanctimonious or superior’ did surface. I learned to practice ‘abstinence’ from the need to respond to everyone or their views. It was an ultimate form of selfcare,” says Uma. “But most friends and family welcomed my minimalism since I was a calmer person to be around.” Personally also she has benefited, she says. “Life is too short and precious to waste on people who are toxic. My mandala approach to the circles of people I surround myself with has enriched my life and brought peace to my body, mind, and soul. My mantras post decluttering are: smaller the circle, greater the energy; keep negativity at bay, gift yourself peace, block out the negative and bring in the positive. Anyone/anything that vexes, box/block them with trash and exes,” she says. Psychologist Mini Rao says people do need to draw emotional boundaries but often do not know how to do it. “Boundaries have blurred during the pandemic, with people WFH and spending more time online, looking at virtual lives and feeling negative emotions such as jealousy, envy, and insecurity at what they perceive to be real,” she says. “But now people wanting to declutter emotionally are seeking help. I tell them to make a list of priorities — of things and people that are very important, and not so important — and cut off what is not necessary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/after-lockdown-people-want-to-declutter-emotionally-reclaim-normalcy/articleshow/86905431.cms||Priya Menon
---||Chennai||There is renewed interest in retail, dining and travel: Experts from Chennai||Masks on, jabs done, Meera Prem and her gal pals are all set for a trip to Goa. “We haven’t travelled together in two years because of the pandemic,” says the Chennai-based education consultant. “Our last trip before Covid-19 hit was to Goa, so we figured we would get started again with Goa.” Meera says it was the trend of seeing people get back to travelling with a vengeance that spurred her and her friends to plan theirs. “It makes me feel that life is back to normal,” she says. Revenge travel, revenge shopping, revenge dressing (from comfort clothing to couture), and revenge dining, it’s almost a reprisal for 18 months of being locked in. Kumar Rajagopalan calls it the season of “cheer shopping”. “People are tired of sitting indoors. They want to be out there shopping, in a store, interacting with others,” says Rajagopalan, CEO of the Retailers Association of India. The numbers second his statement. “This September, sales at stores across the country were at the same level they were in the same month in 2019. Pan-India store sales are up by more than 30% compared to September 2020,” he says. The restaurant business too is seeing a binge. A recent report by restaurant tech platform Dineout shows luxury dining across India has increased by as much as 120% and fine dining by more than 100%. Hyderabad and Chennai (45%) are the cities seeing maximum business during the lunch hour. “We’re still working from home but that doesn’t stop me from making lunch or dinner dates with friends almost every other day,” says software professional Sangeetha Anand. “Suddenly, there seem to be more restaurants and pubs opening up across the city. We try a new venue every time,” she says. The friends also make it a point to try some new activities on weekends, from yoga lessons to surfing sessions. “It’s like we are making up for lost time,” she says. Chennai-based life coach Puja Puneet says it’s the result of an accumulation of the feeling of isolation and confinement people have felt over the last two years. “Going out and doing something is the easiest way to normalise life again. But I feel it is a better normal because even though it appears that people are binging on travel and food, in a sense people are becoming more conscious about it. For instance, when I go out now, I let it be with people who mean something to me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/there-is-renewed-interest-in-retail-dining-and-travel-experts-from-chennai/articleshow/86905443.cms||Kamini Mathai

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Restaurants, bars allowed to close late during Pujas||KOLKATA: The state government on Saturday issued an order permitting all bars, restaurants and shops to remain open as per pre-pandemic normal hours, that is till 11pm, during the festival days. It has also allowed bars to operate beyond these hours, but they would have to seek a licence for late closure from the excise department . The development comes in response to a plea from the food and beverage industry seeking extension of hours in anticipation of a spike in footfall during the festival. Welcoming the order, restaurant owners said it would give the sector a huge fillip and help them make up a part of the huge losses sustained during the pandemic. While dining was not allowed in restaurants for three months last year, this year it was shut for a month and a half during the second wave. Even thereafter, restaurants were allowed to operate till 8pm, too early for dinner. It was only around July-end that the timing was extended till 10.30pm. ‘Extended hours to help in revival’The industry extends its heartfelt thanks to the government for the gift to the hospitality industry during these trying times. The extended business hours would really help in the revival of the industry,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar said. Debaditya Chaudhury, MD of Chowman, Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2, said, “People usually walk in for dinner after10.30pm. Since the rain is forecast, if we are not able to operate till late hours, we will lose out on business.” Mocambo and Peter Cat have sought a late-closure permission for six days from October 12. “This Puja is going to see a huge turnout in restaurants because pandal-hopping has been restricted. Pandal-hoppers would keep it short and wind up by visiting their favourite restaurant. We expect a crowd till late at night and have sought a 1am closure for six days,” said Mocambo and Peter Cat owner Nitin Kothari. “I plan to stay open till 1am on all four days if the permission comes through,” added Poddar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/west-bengal-restaurants-bars-allowed-to-close-late-during-pujas/articleshow/86905293.cms||---

With interest in engineering going up, experts predict that the number of vacant seats may come down by more than 20,000 this year. As many as 32,037 students who have secured 160 to 174 cut-off marks and paid the fees will take part in the third round, TNEA officials said. There were 40,890 students in the cutoff range for the third round. Of the 31,258 students in the second round, 20,438 students got provisional allotment. Colleges said students gave importance to colleges rather than courses in the second round that helped them fill more seats compared to last year. in the academic general counselling, 30,511 seats filled against 1,35,773 available seats. “Of the eligible 45,227 students for the first two rounds, 67.5% students got the seat allotment, which is 8% higher higher than the previous year,” said career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi. Around 80,000 will be competing for 1,05,262 students in the next two rounds. “Students desire to join engineering courses has gone up. Looking at the current trend, we can expect around 60,000 seats to be vacant at the end of counselling against 84,472 vacant seats last year,” he said. Meanwhile 72 colleges could not fill a single seat at the end of the second round. As many as 440 students from the first round got seat allotments in the second round due to wrong choice order. Though computer science was most preferred, students have selected other courses such as mechanical and Electrical and Electronics Engineering in the top colleges. “During the second round, students gave more importance to the brand of the college rather than the course. Top colleges could not fill more than 80% of their seats in the second round itself,” said R M Kishore, vice-chairman of RMK Engineering College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/interest-in-engineering-back-in-tamil-nadu-experts-predict-20000-less-vacant-seats/articleshow/86905474.cms||---

From October 1 to 9, Bengaluru Urban district recorded 78mm rain as against the normal 61mm, excess of 28%, according to the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) On October 4, the city recorded 66mm of rain, the highest 24-hour rain recorded during the month. While 35 rain gauging stations in the city registered more than 100mm from October 1 to 9, 23 stations recorded 66mm rain in 24 hours on October 4. Nagarabhavi recorded 117 mm, the highest on October 4. With more rain expected over the next two weeks, the city may break all previous records, experts say. During the southwest monsoon (June 1 to September 30), Bengaluru Urban district received 468mm rain as against the normal 471mm. During the southwest monsoon (June 1 to September 30), Bengaluru Urban district received 468mm rain as against the normal 471mm. These figures are regarded as normal because plus or minus 19 is considered normal. In July, the district recorded the highest rainfall of 162 mm as against the normal rainfall of 94 mm. “It’s 72 per cent higher and the highest rainfall for the month since 1961,’’ said Manoj Rajan, commissioner, KSNDMC. While in June, the district recorded excess rain of 20%, the city received 107mm as against the normal 123mm in August, a 13% deficit. CYCLONE IMPACT, CLIMATE CHANGE While KSNMDC and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials have said a cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal have resulted in heavy rain during October, some experts indicated global warming and climate change as influential factors that impacted the rainfall scenario in the country and the state during monsoon 2020. Weather scientist PK Suresha said due to fluctuation in weather patterns due to climate change, intense and heavy downpour has been reported instead of the steady rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-likely-to-see-wettest-oct-in-two-decades/articleshow/86903911.cms||Manu Aiyappa
---||Kochi||More coastal panchayats in Kerala may come under coastal regulation zone-II||KOCHI: With the Kerala state coastal zone management authority (KCZMA) asking the national centre for earth science studies (NCESS) to categorize 154 coastal panchayats as coastal regulation zone (CRZ)-II based on coastal zone management plan (CZMP)-2019, at least 25 coastal panchayats in the district are likely to come under the CRZ-II. At a time when unusual rainfall events and cyclonic storms loom large over Kochi, which is seen vulnerable to climate change, it is seen as a welcome move by the local bodies looking forward to clear applications for permits to construct and reconstruct homes. Officials say that sustainable development would be the key to clearing large projects. KCZMA, which met last month, had requested NCESS to also check the built-up areas in these places while mapping them. The coastal zone authority’s decision was after the state government’s order converting 323 panchayats into urban areas based on the 2011 census. As per the order, 44 panchayats in Ernakulam district will become census towns, which will turn many of the coastal panchayats into CRZ-II. According to the GO, these panchayats will be designated as urban areas for spatial plan formulation and it authorized chief town planner to map the census towns to those grama panchayats which fall wholly or partly within them. Several of the island panchayats like Alangad, Kadamakudy, Pallipuram, Varapuzha, Cheranelloor etc have been struggling for giving permission for construction and reconstruction of dwelling units by residents. “The move will be helpful to local communities. But there is also a concern that once the coastal panchayats come under the CRZ-II category, big constructions in the name of development will come in chasing away residents,” said adv Sherry Thomas, Kerala Latin Catholic association general secretary. When a panchayat becomes a census town, there won’t be any changes in the rentals but with the new CRZ rules 2019, it automatically brings the local body from CRZ-III (meant for panchayats) to CRZ-II (meant for urban areas). The general criteria for a conversion to urban town is that it has a minimum population of 5,000 with density of at least 400 people per sq km and at least 75% engaged in non-agricultural jobs. The present conversion is based on the 2011 census.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/more-coastal-panchayats-in-kerala-may-come-under-coastal-regulation-zone-ii/articleshow/86905347.cms||---

While digging up details from the past it has been observed that the incident did not happen suddenly, but the plot was hatched earlier and was part of the BJP’s plan to terrorise the people and discredit the ongoing farm struggle through violent means, the SKM said. SKM leader Darshan Pal on Saturday said, “Nefarious designs of the BJP started on September 25 when minister of state for home Arun Kumar Mishra use derogatory words for farmers. Haryana CM Manoharlal Khattar takes it forward when ask the party activists to form militias and indulge into tit for tat against farmers. Earlier the Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha acting on the orders of political masters ask policemen to break heads of farmers if they try to break cordons and move ahead. All this results into minister’s son Ashish Mishra crushing farmers to death at Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3”. “This incident has exposed the character of the BJP led Union and Uttar Pradesh government and the BJP itself. It is clear that the BJP has now turned to violence after losing ground in the face of the ongoing farm movement. The SKM has decided that it will respond to this violence through a peaceful and democratic mass-movement,” say SKM leaders. They added that Mishra should be sacked from union council of ministers and arrested on charges of spreading disharmony and conspiracy. “His son and associates, who have been accused of murder, should be immediately arrested, if the Union government has sympathy with farmers or it will be presumed that Narendra Modi-led government is clearly anti-farmer,” the farmer leaders said. Protest will intensify if no action by October 12: The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) is getting ready to strike back if the Centre doesn’t sack Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni by Monday and arrest his son, Ashish Mishra, for the incident in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh, where a BJP car had crushed four farmers and a journalist. SKM bigwigs Rakesh Tikait, Yogendra Yadav, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Darshan Pal, and Hanan Mollah said on Saturday that they will mark October 12 as ‘Shaheed Kisan Diwas’ by holding a memorial service for the five victims of Lakhimpur Kheri near the Tikonia village spot where they were killed. After this, a Shaheed Kisan Yatra will start from Lakhimpur Kheri with the mortal remains of those farmers. A separate urn will go to each district of Uttar Pradesh and every state. The yatras will conclude at a holy or historical place in every district and state on October 24. The farmers will burn the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, and Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar) across the country on Dussehra (October 15). On October 18, they will engineer a 6-hour rail blockade from 10am to 4pm. On October 26, there will be a kisan mahapanchayat in Lucknow to mark 11 months of protests on the borders of Delhi. The farmers want it to be of the Muzzafarnagar scale. Farmer unionist Rakesh Tikait said the SKM had agreed to lift its last blockade on October 4 only to let the farmers be cremated, that too when the government had promised to compensate the affected families with money and jobs, hold a judicial inquiry, and arrest all the accused in a week. Tikait said: “The protests will continue until the repeal of farm laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) for every crop to every farmer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/lakhimpur-kheri-killings-farmers-push-for-arrest-of-accused/articleshow/86905445.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chennai||Chennai, suburbs to get rain, thunderstorms for 2 days: IMD||CHENNAI: A circulation of winds in the upper atmosphere is likely to bring back intense thunderstorms to the city and the suburbs after a brief lull. IMD has forecast thunderstorms with moderate rain over some areas of the city and the suburbs at least for the next two days. Bloggers said the city and many areas of Tamil Nadu have chances of rainfall at least for the next four days. After dark clouds loomed over the city on Saturday evening, the sky opened up. Many areas in and around Nungambakkam, Chepauk, Choolaimedu and Aminjikarai got short intense spells accompanied by thunder. Areas like Ice House received 43mm rain in a matter of 30 minutes. Till 5.30pm, Nungambakkam weather station recorded 10mm and Meenambakkam registered traces of rainfall. For the next 48 hours, IMD has forecast thunderstorms with moderate rainfall over some areas of the city and neighbourhoods while the skies may remain partly cloudy. Maximum and minimum temperatures will be around 34 deg C and 26 deg C. “The rainfall will be due to an upper air circulation (UAC) over the Bay,” an official said. The circulation will support the convergence of opposing winds from the northwest and southeast, which will result in convective activity. While interior parts of Tamil Nadu may receive rainfall during the day, the convergence may shift to coastal areas bringing rainfall in the evening, late nights or early morning. After bringing 9% excess rainfall to the city in the June-September season, October too began with intense spells so far leaving 93.6mm against a normal 51.2mm, which is 83% excess. Tamil Nadu so far has registered 84.5mm this month against a normal 43.3mm leaving 95% excess. “Models show the UAC may develop into a low pressure only after four or five days. Till then there are chances of rainfall in the city. The low pressure is likely to move towards south Odisha – north Andhra Pradesh,” said blogger Pradeep John.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-suburbs-to-get-rain-thunderstorms-for-2-days-imd/articleshow/86905493.cms||---

Using a WhatsApp group, the residents have started what they call nuclear composting — wet waste from each household ends up in small pots or drums that convert it into manure which is later used to cultivate vegetables and greens on terrace gardens. Chitalapakkam is a small local body which generates around five tonnes of wet waste everyday. There are around 13,000 households with a total population of 50,000 people in Chitalapakkam. A senior official said that any effort taken to reduce this is welcome and that more households should be encouraged to do this. The town panchayat cannot afford any modern waste collection or disposal methods and the waste is currently dumped in the vicinity of the lake, creating an ecological mess and trouble for the olfactory senses. The initiative to convert wet waste into manure has turned out to give multiple advantages to the community of around 50 households; not only does it give an activity to the elderly, it has also sent out a message that each person is responsible for disposing their own waste, said Dayanand Krishnan a local resident. “Because of the activity on the WhatsApp group, we recently had a seed sharing programme where residents who have such gardens exchanged seeds of vegetables with each other. Open terraces are being used to create manure as well as grow plants,” Dayanand Krishnan said. Vegetables like lady’s finger, brinjal and chilli have been cultivated on terrace gardens. Residents say if this is followed in all households, the local body will not need to develop micro composting units in parks or other public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/home-composting-makes-terrace-gardens-bloom-in-tns-chitalapakkam/articleshow/86905504.cms||---

Kurz denies wrongdoing and had said that he was willing to keep governing with his coalition partner, the Greens. But the left-wing party has said the investigation makes Kurz unfit to serve chancellor and called on his party to name a successor who was “beyond reproach”. The Greens began talks on Friday with Austria’s three opposition parties, which have all demanded that Kurz resign and plan to submit one or more no-confidence motions against him at a special session of parliament on Tuesday. For a motion to pass, the Greens must support it. “I would therefore like to make way in order to end the stalemate, to prevent chaos and to ensure stability,” Kurz said in a statement to the media. He added that he planned to stay on as party leader and to take over as the leader of its lawmakers in parliament. As party leader, he was proposing foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg to succeed him as chancellor, he said. The Greens have yet to say whether they would accept Schallenberg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/austrias-sebastian-kurz-steps-down-as-chancellor-amid-graft-charges/articleshow/86905498.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Women storm male bastion, to conduct puja, play dhak||KOLKATA: This Durga Puja, a small group of women is sending out a loud message of gender equality by breaking into traditional male bastions. While a quartet will conduct all the rituals at a community puja, the others will play the dhak for the four festival days at another. All of them have been training for months to make sure they do the job perfectly. The Durga Puja at 66 Pally in Kalighat will be entirely conducted by a four-women team this year. The organisers of the 71-year-old puja, known for its innovative themes, believe the four priestesses — Nandini, Ruma, Seymanti and Paulomi — are going to set an example.  The women priests of 66 PallyLed by Nandini, a former Sanskrit professor and stage actor, the group, known as ‘Shubhamastu’, was formed12 years ago and they have already presided over various Hindu ceremonies like weddings, shraddha and grihapravesh across the city. This is the first time they will be conducting a community Durga Puja. “In the past three or four years, puja organisers had been calling us to conduct the rituals. This time, we accepted the proposal for we believe there should not be any gender discrimination in society. A major portion of the honorarium that we receive as priestesses is spent on various social works,” Nandini told TOI. Asked about their preparations, Nandini said, “Apart from rehearsals, we have been studying extensively for precision. A striking feature of our Chandipath is that it combines both shlokas and songs.” Women dhakis at the Rail Vihar housing complex on MahalayaPradyumna Mukherjee, general secretary of the club, said, “Every year, we try to come up with new ideas. Our priest passed away recently and we thought of passing the baton to the four women who have already carved out a niche for themselves as priestesses.” he said. At the Rail Vihar Durga Puja pandal near Ruby Hospital, a group of women will ring in the festive fervour with throbbing beats of the dhak. Sabita, Puja, Pinky and Sumi, who hail from Machhlandapur, 65 km from Kolkata, have been roped in to add rhythm to the rituals at the sprawling housing complex with 400 flats. ‘We’re ready for the challenge’The four women say they were forced to turn dhakis after losing their jobs during the pandemic. According to Samar Singha, who mentored them, the group is as good as their male counterparts, if not better. The theme of the Rail Vihar Durga Puja being women power, the residents’ association handed over the responsibility of organising the puja to an all-women team. Taking charge as the secretary of the puja committee in July, Bulbul Chatterjee decided to search for women dhakis. “My search ended as soon as I approached Nirmal dhaki in Machhlandapur and he readily agreed to send a team of women dhakis from his village. Besides paying them a good remuneration, we’ll provide them with all amenities, including accommodation, during their five-day stay in Kolkata,” Chatterjee said. The women are ready to take up the challenge. “I know we have stepped into a male domain. We will be compared with men at every step. We are ready for this and will leave no stone unturned to give our best during the five-day festival,” Sumi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-women-storm-male-bastion-to-conduct-puja-play-dhak/articleshow/86905500.cms||Sarthak Ganguly
---||Gurgaon||100 to 1,000 a day: Cameras drive up traffic challans in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: More than 1,000 challans were issued each day for traffic rule violations after red light violation detection (RLVD) and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) became operational at 26 locations in the city last month. This, the traffic department officials said, was a 10-fold spike from the average 100 challans issued per day earlier. Installed by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), these hi-tech cameras, placed atop traffic signals, are attached to sensors that can automatically detect a rule violation, capture photographs and send information to the official server. The data is then accessed by traffic cops who issue challans, generated automatically, to defaulting vehicle owners through text messages. According to the traffic department, RLVD cameras were installed at six locations, including Galleria market, Sector 12 chowk, Rajesh Pilot chowk, Wazirabad traffic intersection, Jharsa chowk, and IFFCO metro station. While automatic number plate recognition cameras have been operational at 20 locations -- Signature Chowk underpass, Bristol chowk, Manesar bus stand, Wazirabad traffic intersection, Galleria Market, Rajesh Pilot chowk, Kapashera, Sirhol, Atlas chowk, Hero Honda chowk, and Cyber City among others -- since September. With these cameras monitoring an entire stretch, crossing or intersection round-the-clock, more than 41 challans were issued per hour last month, officials said. “These cameras have been very helpful in monitoring the traffic signal violations and as a result, we have seen 100 per cent increase in the challans. These cameras will not only help in reducing accidents and creating more traffic awareness but will also aid in checking street crimes, such as theft and snatching,” Gurugram traffic police deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Ravinder Singh Tomar said. Future technology upgrades, officials said, will include capabilities such as detection of riders without helmets, tripling and driving on the wrong side of a road. “Currently, the traffic police tower in Sushant Lok 1 and the GMDA’s integrated command and control centre (ICCC) in Sector 44 monitor all camera feeds,” Tomar said, adding that more such cameras will be operational in other parts of the city soon. The traffic police impose a penalty of Rs 5,000 for red light violation and Rs 500 for not installing a High-Security Number Plate (HSRP). The HSRPs are internationally recognised license plates and have features including laser-readable holograms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/100-to-1000-cameras-drive-up-traffic-challans-in-gurgaon/articleshow/86900265.cms||Sagrika Kissu

Sandeep, who is an approver in the NIA case booked in connection with the incident, had received bail in all cases registered against him. His co-accused, Swapna Suresh and Sarith P S are, however, yet to receive bail in the NIA case and would remain in prison. Sandeep, who came out of the prison on Saturday, appeared confident and he responded to media persons. He said that he was relieved and that he stands by whatever he said in court. He had earlier put the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the dock by alleging in a letter sent to the court that ED sleuths had coerced him to implicate chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, two ministers and the son of an influential person in the gold smuggling case. He had said in the letter that ED had told him that they would not oppose his bail petition if he agreed to the conditions they put forward. He also alleged that ED officials tortured him during the custody period and a senior ED officer threatened him that he would face more consequences if he did not obey them. Sandeep later told the media that he has full confidence in NIA. He also clarified that his allegation was only against ED and that he was forced to send the letter to the court after realizing that the case was being politicized. He added that the ED delaying the bail pleas by citing the unavailability of senior lawyers also triggered the letter and that whatever he said in the letter was true. ED sleuths had dismissed the allegations in the letter back then. He claimed anyone could have travelled out of Kerala, when they were on the run, despite the lockdown and that they told a lie that they were transit travellers and were heading towards Maharashtra at the checkpost at T N border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/prime-accused-in-thiruvananthapuram-gold-smuggling-case-released/articleshow/86905551.cms||---

A one-day camp will be set up at the traffic police tower, where the vehicle owner can pay the penalty in person. Owners must produce identification and can make payments via cash, credit or debit cards. Police said the camp is being held to assist vehicle owners in paying their challans without difficulty. According to a plan chalked out by traffic police to make the experience hassle-free, vehicle owners who were challaned between October and November 2020 should arrive between 9am and 10.30am to pay their fines. Those who were penalised between December 2020 and January 2021, should arrive between 10.30am to noon, and so on. The camp will go on till 5pm. Earlier, vehicle owners had to queue up outside the challan branch and wait for hours for their turn. The initiative has been welcomed by vehicle owners. “This is a good initiative. The traffic police should come up with such initiatives from time to time. It will save our time and create awareness among people,” said Arun, a resident of DLF-5. “There are many who have changed their phone number or address and come to know that they have been penalised much later. For such people, this will provide relief,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/khula-durbar-for-challan-payment/articleshow/86900293.cms||Sagrika Kissu

Two others were rescued from under heaps of debris and hospitalized with serious injuries. All the residents—25-30 families live in the sprawling building located on 25 bighas of land—were evacuated to safety. Merely 10 days ago, an elderly woman and her granddaughter had died when their dilapidated house at Ahiritola, situated less than 1.5km from Saturday’s site, had collapsed. A large section of a hanging balcony on the top floor of the four-storey old building on Rabindra Sarani opposite Vishuddhananda Hospital came tumbling down at 5.10 pm following a heavy spell of rain in the area. As the chunks of concrete fell on the bikers below, one died on the spot, while the other succumbed to his injuries in hospital. “We received a call at PTS at 5.16pm and reached in 25 minutes, along with firemen. We removed the debris in 10-12 minutes. The impact of the collapse from such a height was severe. There were fewer people on road due to the rain,” said a police officer. The biker who died on the spot was Rajib Gupta (47), a resident of Dum Dum. “He was riding past the building, when a large portion of the balcony crushed him. By the time he could be rescued by the disaster management group of the Kolkata Police and fire brigade, 35 minutes had passed. He was declared dead at Vishuddhananda Hospital,” said DC (Central) Rupesh Kumar. The other victim, Md Toufiq (20), was a resident of Beniapukur. He was riding a scooter when the concrete slab fell on him. He was first taken to Vishuddhananda and later shifted to Medical College and Hospital, where he died in a few hours. Pradip Das (39) from Nimta and Subhas Hazra (32) from Saora in Goghat, who were walking by, were trapped under the debris. They were rescued and admitted to MCH. A fifth person, a DMG officer said, escaped miraculously with mere scratches. Police, with the help of locals, managed to evacuate five residents, who were trapped inside the building, to safety. A KMC buildings department team reached the spot and helped the other tenants out. While local ward coordinator Reita Chowdhury claimed the building had not been declared insecure, a buildings department official said portions were vulnerable. “KMC engineers will inspect the building on Sunday and decide whether it is fit to live in or should be demolished,” Chowdhury said. The collapse led to a roadblock on Rabindra Sarani as vehicles had to be rerouted on Chaturthi. “It took over two hours to restore some amount of normalcy,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-10-days-on-another-house-collapses-2-bikers-killed/articleshow/86905590.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
