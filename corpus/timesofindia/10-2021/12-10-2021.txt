Diatoms are photosynthesising algae, which are found in almost every water body. If a person is alive while entering the water, the diatoms will enter the lungs when the s/he inhales water in the event of drowning. These diatoms will then travel to various parts of the body through the blood. If a dead person is thrown into the water, s/he cannot breathe, there is no blood circulation and no movement of diatom cells to various organs. “We have collected the water sample of the pond and sent it to the state forensic science laboratory. If diatoms are found in Manish’s body, we will match them with the water sample to ascertain whether his death was caused by drowning,” deputy commissioner of police Uma Shankar Dash said. Though the police did not disclose the findings of the post-mortem report, the doctors, who conducted his autopsy reportedly told the police that Manish did not die by drowning. The Tamando police on Monday sealed a hotel in Patrapada area where Manish had attended a party with his friends on Saturday night. His body was found in the pond, about 3km from the hotel on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/journos-son-did-not-die-by-drowning/articleshow/86948196.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 19 in custody for 30 crore job frauds||BENGALURU: Nineteen people from two gangs were arrested for luring thousands for people across the country with offers of part-time jobs, and allegedly cheating them of over Rs 30 crore. Both gangs had Chinese links. Konanakunte police arrested five people for allegedly siphoning off over Rs 25 crore from thousands of victims. The crimes came to light following a complaint lodged by an individual in March, who said he was cheated of more than Rs 4 lakh by fraudsters. A case was registered in South CEN Crime police station and Harish Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (south), formed a special team in April to investigate. The complainant said he was approached by a person with an offer of a part-time job. His work was to share and like celebrities’ videos and photos on social media. He was offered Rs 20 per like. The complainant was asked to deposit money to secure the job. He had forked out over Rs 4 lakh before it dawned on him that he had been cheated. Sleuths traced the calls to a racket being run by a gang of more than 20 . They managed to nab five of them including Namkha Bhim, 30, of Eijipura and Tengien Yeha, 25, of Himachal Pradesh, both directors of Visro Technologies, a firm funded by a Chinese national. Police found the gang used fake SIMs and had opened eight current accounts to collect money from victims. Police verified more than 200 bank accounts, 110 of which with a total balance of Rs 11 crore have been frozen. People who lost money to the gang have been asked to contact police. In a similar scam, Banashankari police arrested 14 gangsters. Syed Madani had filed a complaint with South CEN Crime police on March 5, stating he had lost Rs 50,000 to cyber crooks. Madani said a person contacted him saying he was from a firm running an application and offered him a part-time job. All he had to do was share videos and photos of celebrities sent to him. He would get Rs 20 for every share. To start earning, he had to deposit Rs 30,000, Rs 50,000 or Rs 80,000 and his earnings would depend on how much he deposits. Syed deposited Rs 50,000 and began sharing photos and videos, but never got paid. Police arrested seven people from Bengaluru, two from Maharashtra, three from Telangana and one each from Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh. Cops got bank accounts with a balance of Rs 5.4 crore frozen and recovered Rs 14 lakh from the fraudsters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/19-in-custody-for-30cr-job-frauds/articleshow/86948727.cms||---

They have instead been asked to dress in traditional attire such as dhoti, gamcha or kurta pyjama. In the first phase, the dress code will be applicable only at two locations — the sanctum sanctorum and bhitara kathain — of the shrine. Subsequently, traditional Indian wear will be made mandatory for servitors everywhere on the sprawling premises of the main temple as well as its 136 subsidiary shrines. A similar traditional dress code will be adopted for the employees of the Jagannath temple administration from November 5. The stakeholders will be consulted before introducing a dress code for the devotees in the future, the temple officials said. “We have observed that there are strict dress codes in different temples across the country. Initially, we will introduce a traditional dress code for the servitors and other temple staff. Later, we may think of a dress code for the devotees,” Krishan Kumar, the chief administrator of the SJTA, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/servitors-cant-wear-casuals-while-offering-prayers-inside-puri-temple/articleshow/86948237.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Hotels and guest houses in prominent tourist places across the state are also seeing a rise in bookings, giving hope of revival of business to traders. “It is a much-needed break. So, without giving a second thought, I booked rooms in a homestay in Konark and started packing my bags. The children are also bored sitting at home without school or outing for a long time owing to the pandemic,” said Romila Mohanty, an IT professional. For the second consecutive year, the state has imposed Covid-19 restrictions on Durga Puja. The puja organisers have restricted the visit of people to pandals to check the virus’s spread. Night curfew has been imposed in the twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar from Monday. “There is no point staying in the city during this period as neither can we visit mandaps nor can we take part in the puja activities. There will be no pandal-hopping nor any get-together with friends. But there are no such restrictions in the rural areas. So, we have decided to attend a village puja this year,” said Rudra Prasad Jena, a government employee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/urbanites-head-to-villages-for-puja/articleshow/86948305.cms||Minati Singha
---||Bengaluru||New Outer Ring Road flyover set for launch||Bengaluru: The new flyover connecting Nagawara and Veeranapalya flyovers on Outer Ring Road (ORR) is an epitome of how a public-private partnership can be an answer to Bengaluru’s infrastructure woes. Notwithstanding delays induced by the pandemic , it has been executed swiftly and is all set for a formal launch.Constructed and funded by Embassy Office Parks, the Rs 180 crore flyover is expected to ease traffic towards Hebbal and benefit motorists using the stretch to reach Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) and those going towards KR Puram. The 900-metre flyover designed in consultation with BBMP and BMRDA is a one-way corridor with three lanes and has an entry lap from the business park side and an exit towards Hebbal. Initially built as a standalon e structure, it was then connected to Nagawara flyover at one end and Veeranapalya flyover at the other end. It is expected to ease traffic on the stretch by up to 70% and reduce travel time by at least 15 minutes for all commuters using it. According to a construction expert with Embassy Office Parks, the flyover was planned in 2018 as traffic to Embassy Manyata Business Park caused a bottleneck. “The stretch is the busiest on ORR and commuters are forced to take a U-turn under the flyover. This was also impacting the traffic flow. Therefore, we decided to step in,” he said.  Motorists, who have been tracking the progress, told TOI: “Usually, the infrastructure projects undertaken by BBMP and other agencies go on nearly for a decade. But this has been readied in less than two-and-a-half years. There are definitely lessons to be learnt from this project.” On completion, the flyover is expected to reduce carbon emissions to the tune of 10,000 metric tonnes per year and also save fuel consumption to the tune of Rs 35 crore per annum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/new-outer-ring-road-flyover-set-for-launch/articleshow/86948925.cms||Petlee Peter

Four families residing in a house built adjoining the wall were evacuated by BBMP after the incident.Revanna NS, the jurisdictional executive engineer, said: “There was no place for the water to flow out for a period of time and eventually, the soil became heavy and the retaining wall collapsed. The house was built adjoining the wall and hence, we evacuated the families.” A police officer said vehicles were moving while the wall collapsed but no one was injured. “It crashed at 3pm and within 10 minutes, BBMP and police officials reached the spot and debris was pushed to the side with the help of an earthmover,” he said. The family that owns the building had earlier approached the then corporator of the area and informed him about a crack in the wall which posed a huge threat. “The wall was fixed after that but due to rain, it reappeared,” Hari Prasad, the owner of the 20-year-old building, said.  “BBMP officials came by after the incident and asked us to evacuate but we didn’t know where to go, we were not offered a shelter to spend the night. We can’t come back to our house,” he said.Of the four houses in that building, one was occupied by Hari Prasad’s family and the rest were rented out. "We have kept sand bags for support near the building. All we can do right now is wait for the rain to stop. No civil works can take place in this weather, hence we can’t tell them when this will be over and when they can come back," executive engineer Revanna said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/retaining-wall-of-rly-bridge-near-okalipuram-jn-collapses/articleshow/86948947.cms||---
---||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan urges world to engage with Taliban||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday once again urged the international community to engage with the Afghan Taliban to avoid the war-ruined country from becoming a fertile ground for terrorist groups like the ISIS (Islamic State for Iraq and Syria). In a wide-ranging interview with the "Middle East Eye", Khan spoke on the current situation in Afghanistan, Kashmir, relations with the US, and allegations against China regarding the treatment of Uighurs. On Afghanistan, the PM warned of the consequences if the international community failed to engage with the Taliban. "There must be hardliners within the group and it can easily go back to the Taliban of 20 years ago. And that would be a disaster," he warned, adding that failure to do so would once again push the country into chaos. "It would become a fertile ground for terrorists like ISIS, which is a worry for all countries in the region," he said. The US, Khan suggested, has to "pull itself together" from the shock it had suffered after the withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan. "I don’t think they have found their feet as yet," he said. He also derided the US policy of conducting drone attacks in its efforts to fight terrorism, calling it the "most insane" method. When asked whether he would allow US bases in Pakistan for action against ISIS, the PM said: "I think they don’t need a base here because we don’t want to be a part of conflict again." About the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), he said Islamabad has been trying to speak to elements within the TTP who can be reconciled "because it’s from a position of strength". He pointed out that the Afghan Taliban had assured Islamabad that they would not let Afghanistan’s soil be used against any country. He alleged that the previous Afghan government had facilitated Indian agencies in carrying out terrorist attacks on Pakistan. On his silence about the treatment of Uighurs in China, PM Khan said he considered "selective pronouncements on human rights" to be immoral. He said Pakistan had spoken to China about the Uighur issue and had been provided with an explanation. "Our relationship with China is such that we have an understanding between us. We will talk to each other, but behind closed doors because that is their nature and culture." He soon changed the topic by asking the two interviewers why there was no criticism of alleged Indian actions in Kashmir or its treatment of Muslims and minorities. "Let the world take notice of that first, then we will talk about other violations of human rights." Khan said India had also drawn on Israel’s illegal and brutal occupation of the Palestinian territories and the impunity the country has enjoyed as a consequence of its alliance with the US, in its own quashing of opposition and criticism of its actions in Kashmir. When asked how volatile the current situation with India was, Khan replied: "If you look at the flash-points, probably the nuclear flashpoint right now in the world is Pakistan-India because nowhere else is there a situation where there are two nuclear-armed countries who have had three wars before they were nuclear-armed." "We have not had a war since then because of the deterrent," he said. Still, he admitted that dealing with the flareup in 2019 in the early months of his premiership had been a nervous and dangerous time: "Once two nuclear-armed countries get into the situation like we did, it can go anywhere," he added. When Khan was asked to speak his mind on the England and Wales Cricket Board’s (ECB’s) decision to pull out of the Pakistan tour, he said: "I think that there is still this feeling in England that they do a great favour to play countries like Pakistan." "One of the reasons is that, obviously, the money," he added. The Pakistan PM said that the BCCI is the richest cricket board in the world, adding that no other country would dare to do to India what England had done to Pakistan. "Money is a big player now for the players, as well as for the cricket boards. The money lies in India, so basically India controls world cricket now. I mean they do, whatever they say goes. No one would dare do that to India because they know that the sums involved, India can sort of produce much more money," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-urges-world-to-engage-with-taliban/articleshow/86949000.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar reinforcing gender roles, must apologise to women, say activists||BENGALURU: Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar said on Monday that his statement on ‘modern Indian women’ was grossly misunderstood and taken out of context as he came under criticism by women’s rights activists and health experts, who called his comments ‘regressive’. At a Nimhans event, the minister had said that he regretted the choices made by Indian women, who “want to stay single. Even if they get married, they don’t want to give birth; they want surrogacy.”  Sudhakar said he wanted to emphasise how the family value system can address current mental health issues.  “It is unfortunate a small part of my 19.5-minute address is taken out of context and thereby losing out on the larger point I was trying to make,” his statement read. Activists and experts demanded apology from him.  Doctors said surrogacy is “a medical, legal option for women” to conceive when they are not able to bear a child on their own. Nimhans professors said the speech came as a shocker for researchers, who have been working on destigmatising mental health issues. Several women’s rights activists, progressive thinkers, gynaecologists and mental health experts in the state have criticised what they called “regressive statements” made by health and medical education minister K Sudhakar on “the choices of modern women” in India. The minister in his speech at a World Mental Health Day event on Sunday had said, “Sorry to say this. Today a lot of modern women in India want to stay single. Even if they get married, they don’t want to give birth, they want surrogacy.” Tara Krishnaswamy, co-founder, Citizens For Bengaluru, who is also a political analyst, said: “What’s shocking is that he is a young man and a doctor. What does he think of women like Akkamahadevi and Andal who chose to remain childless?” Vimala KS, vice-president, All India Democratic women’s Association, Karnataka, said the minister’s speech reinforced the stereotypical notion about women and regressive thinking of the patriarchal mindset. “He must apologise to all women, as nobody can accept what he said,” she said. “There may be a section of people who may not want to get married and not want to deliver a baby. But that’s an individual’s right... His statements are anti-Constitutional. Across the world, there is respect and acceptance for the movement ‘My body My right’. We condemn the perception of women as child-bearing machines,” Vimala said. Terming the minister’s statement “sexist”, Jayanagar MLA Soumya Reddy said it reflected the mindset of the government. “It’s very appalling that the minister is objecting to women’s choices at a time when cases of violence increased during the pandemic. Don’t women have their own choices with their bodies? People have no idea what a woman goes through. Sudhakar needs counselling and people like him must resign,” she said. Activists TOI spoke with regretted that the minister’s statement comes at a time when women are stigmatised for not being able to give birth to a child and that itself is leading to depression and mental health issues. Gynaecologists, meanwhile, have taken exception to the minister’s statement about surrogacy. They say surrogacy is a medical, legal option for women to conceive when they are not able to bear a child on their own. “But as it is an expensive proposition, how many couples battling infertility have chosen surrogacy? Generalising one or two instances of star couples going for surrogacy to all women is just not acceptable. With his statement, he is further adding stigma to the very concept of surrogacy, the couples who go for it and children born through surrogacy,” said a leading gynaecologist. Professors from Nimhans, where Sudhakar made the remarks, said the minister’s speech came as a shocker for researchers who have been working on destigmatising mental health issues. “It’s the reflection of gender roles that we see every day in our OPDs, when women unable to conceive suffer from infertility and depression and finally come to us seeking help. We are fighting against the stereotypical expectations that women end up suffering from. But on World Mental Health Day, this is what we had to hear from the minister, which was awful,” a doctor said. A professor said that the minister’s speech showed the true levels of mental health literacy among the leaders themselves and the urgent need for mental health education for all, while all that another professor could say was, “words matter.” "I could understand and perhaps even forgive an ordinary man for making such a statement, but it is unacceptable that a state’s health minister can state something like this in public. His statement reflects the regressive mindset of the government that sanctions and legitimises gender stereotyping, discrimination and violence. It reinforces the misogynistic stereotype that women are primarily baby-making machines. It also reinforces the stereotypes that a woman who speaks out, who does not marry or decides to not have kids is a "bad" woman. We have worked so hard to establish that marriage and children have to do with women's choice and rights and not that of the State or society. It is neither a crime nor a sin if a woman does not want to get married. Are women only meant to be carriers of your culture or your seed or your lineage? You can’t deprive women of making basic choices that impact their bodies, their minds and their emotions." - Madhu Bhushan, independent women's rights activist and researcher associated with Gamana Mahila Samuha"The minister's statement is not based on any facts and is made to show women in poor light. His statement is a reflection of how women's agency and reproductive rights are barely respected. Women are constantly policed about their bodies and the choices they make. When politicians give voice to the ugliest forms of misogyny, sexism it is especially important to fight back, so that the majority voice of the women is not silenced." - Nisha Gulur, President, Swaraj India Bengaluru Urban District Unit"As men, we are unqualified to speak about this. We do not have a uterus and that alone is a reason for us to not speak on this. For ages, men have spoken, made decisions for women. Especially in our country which has either had women being glorified as gods or second class citizens. We have no business speaking about their body and the choices they make for their life. It is appalling for someone in a position like his to be making such irresponsible statements.  - Ravikiran Rajendran, Actor & Theatre Director “To make such a statement on World Mental Health Day is unlike a Health Minister’s Duty. In today’s day and age, women have the autonomy to make the choices and it is insensitive to continue to view women through such a narrow lens. The comment on women not wanting to be mothers was uncalled for as well. He should have taken a gender sensitivity course before becoming a minister."  - Sreya Vittaldev, a marketing professional "The statement is horrendous, misogynistic and unacceptable. It demonstrates the absolute insensitivity of the person speaking on such a subject as a public servant. We are trying to progress and in the last 70 years, the government of India has made so many laws to protect women and this statement denies women all that progress. It demonstrates the feudal mindset of the person. I think the government must clarify and chastise him for making such a statement. He should tender his apology for saying it." - B T Venkatesh, Former state public prosecutor High court of Karnataka, Human Rights advocate, Founder ReachLawyer“The minister's comments on women reveal the patriarchal assumptions and paternalistic expectations imposed on women and what their role should be. To people who agree with his comments, I would encourage reflection - to examine their own deeply held beliefs and sexism that is limiting their ability to accept that women are free agents able to choose their lives, as they see fit. It is unfortunate that people need to be reminded that women are full human beings with equal rights and freedoms even in 2021." - Sneha Visakha, legal researcher based in BengaluruFrom Twitter T M Krishna, singer, author"And then we wonder why in India rape, sexual harassment and abuse is normalised. Such people should not be allowed to hold public office. Shruti Seth, actor"But men can want to stay single, get married not want to have kids; but how dare a woman to live her life on her own terms??? Modern women are the root of all problems clearly!"

By evening, the operation to smoke out the terrorists had spread beyond the initially targeted hideout in the forested Chamrer area of Surankote to adjoining Bhangai village of Rajouri district. "The operational area is the same. The terrorists moved to the other frontier location to possibly escape being hemmed in by the advancing security forces. Till we last received information (around 9.30pm), the operation was underway," an official said. The Army couldn't immediately confirm if any of the terrorists had been killed. The slain JCO, Naib Subedar Jaswinder Singh, and two of the four soldiers killed in action — Naik Mandeep Singh and sepoy Gajjan Singh — were from Punjab. The other two, sepoys Saraj Singh and Vaisakh H, were from UP and Kerala respectively. Since January, eight Army personnel have died fighting terrorists in Jammu division alone. Three others were killed in ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the Line of Control. The Army had launched the cordon-and-search operation in villages close to Dera Ki Gali in Surankote early on Monday, based on intelligence inputs about four to five terrorists hiding there, Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said. Naib Subedar Jaswinder and four soldiers were critically injured within the first few hours of the operation as the cornered terrorists fired relentlessly to keep the forces at bay. All five died shortly after being moved to a nearby health facility. The Army operation in Jammu comes alongside a crackdown by central agencies on the terror ecosystem in the Valley following a spate of civilian killings, five of them from the Kashmiri Pandit, Sikh and other minority communities. In north Kashmir's Handwara on May 3 last year, two Army officers of the rank of Colonel and Major were killed along with a police sub-inspector and two other personnel in a similar operation to flush out terrorists hiding in a village house there. Over the past nine months, the twin districts of Poonch and Rajouri have seen heightened terrorist activity, leading to several encounters with security forces. On August 6, two Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists were killed in an encounter in Bhangai village of Rajouri. Prior to this, on July 8, two heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists were gunned down as the Army foiled an infiltration bid in the Sunderbani sector of Rajouri. Two soldiers were killed in firing by terrorists in the Dadal area of the same sector. On August 9, a joint team of security forces busted a terrorist hideout at Mendher in Poonch district and seized a cache of arms and ammunition, including AK-47 rifles and China-made pistols and grenades. Ten days later, a JCO and a terrorist were killed in an encounter in the Kangota area of Rajouri's Thanamandi tehsil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jco-4-soldiers-killed-in-poonch-gunfight-with-terrorists/articleshow/86949383.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha hikes starting salaries of contractual employees by 50%||BHUBANESWAR: The state cabinet, led by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, on Monday decided to increase the starting salaries of government’s contractual employees by 50% and reimburse the full cost of their medical treatment bringing puja cheer to 26,000 homes. In a bid to give them dignity, the government also renamed them as initial appointees for their first six years of service, after which they are usually absorbed as full-time employees. The minimum pay for the lowest category of employee (Group ‘D’) will now be Rs 12,100, up from the current Rs 8,070. Those appointed for Group ‘B’ posts will start drawing Rs 25,300 in the first year of appointment instead of the existing Rs 16,880. The move will benefit 26,000 contractual employees from school and college teachers to police sub-inspectors across the government departments. Talking to media persons after the cabinet meeting, law minister Pratap Jena said this will put a burden of Rs 250 crore more on the state exchequer. This apart, the decision to reimburse the cost of medical treatment of the contractual employees will add an additional Rs 10 crore to the government expenses. On their nomenclature, Jena said calling them “initial appointees” will reassure them of their regularisation in the due course of time and boost their morale. The revision will come into force following a government notification in this regard. It will be implemented with restrospective effect. The general administration department will bring out a notification specifying the date of implementation by amending the Group ‘B’ posts (Contractual Appointment) Rules, 2013 and Odisha Group ‘C’ and Group ‘D’ posts (Contractual Appointment) Rules, 2013,” a government official said. Until now, the Group ‘D’ employees were getting Rs 8,070 in the first year, which used to go up to Rs 13,020 by the sixth year. From now on, they will get Rs 12,100 in the first year of service, which will go up to Rs 15,400 in the sixth year. The Group ‘B’ employees, who would start out with Rs 9,300 and get Rs 27,210 in the sixth year, will now draw Rs 25,300 in the first year. It will go up to Rs 31,100 in the sixth year before they can draw the full salaries for the posts for which they are appointed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/state-hikes-starting-salaries-of-contractual-employees-by-50/articleshow/86949419.cms||Ashok Pradhan

"Instead of making an example out of a Union minister’s son accused of killing four farmers, central agencies are after a 23-year-old simply because his surname happens to be Khan. Travesty of justice that Muslims are targeted to satiate the sadistic wishes of BJP’s core vote bank," Mehbooba tweeted. Aryan Khan was caught by the NCB during a drug bust on board a cruise ship off the coast of Mumbai on October 2. He has been denied bail by a local court and lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail till October 13. A Delhi-based lawyer filed a complaint with the Delhi police soon after Mehbooba’s tweet seeking the registration of an FIR against her for allegedly "attempting to create enmity between communities". The complaint alleged that her statement was an "inciting statement that intends to create hatred and unrest among communities".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mehbooba-mufti-bats-for-srks-son-accuses-bjp-of-targeting-muslims-to-gain-votes/articleshow/86949504.cms||M Saleem Pandit

IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar announced through his official Twitter handle that slain Imtiyaz Ahmad Dar carried out the attack in Bandipora last week in which Mohammad Shafi Lone, the president of the local taxi drivers' association at Shahgund in Hajin, was killed. The other TRF terrorist killed by the police in the day's second encounter in Anantnag is still to be identified, the police said. A policeman was injured in the exhange of fire at Khagund Verinag. Four suspects in the killing of Lone, who was one among three Muslim victims in the latest terror attacks targeting civilians, had been arrested in Bandipora on Sunday. Mastermind Imtiyaz was traced to the Gund Jahangir area of Hajin early on Monday, leading to the encounter in which he was shot dead, the police said. "Based on specific information, a team from J&K police was about to enter the hideout of an overground TRF worker when there was firing from inside. Just as we had suspected, Imtiyaz was there," an officer said. The police found a pistol and a hand grenade on the slain terrorist. Late on Monday, a third encounter between terrorists and a joint team of the police, the Army's 34 Rashtriya Rifles and CRPF was reported in the Tulran area of south Kashmir's Shopian district. Around three terrorists were holed up in a hideout till close to 11pm, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/killer-of-jammu-and-kashmir-taxi-driver-among-2-trf-terrorists-shot-dead-in-encounters/articleshow/86949727.cms||M Saleem Pandit

But that hasn’t deterred the spirit of a bunch of Mumbaikars. An enthusiastic group of cyclists is celebrating the festival in their own unique way — on wheels! They’re recreating the fervour with nine-day ‘nav-rides’ throughout the city. And guess what? Each 25-km ride has a special flavour — the cyclists are adhering to the festive colour code by donning special jerseys and T-shirts to go with the nine colours of each day. We caught them in action as they completed a few rides... Colours that bindEmbracing the greenery in styleOver the last few days, if you were out on your early morning walk, you would have caught the whizz of colours of the group as they passed you by. Around 15 riders are pedalling to different locations in the city to spread cheer and joy. Pankit Fariya, an entrepreneur from Ghatkopar, who has co-organised the trails, says, “Our Ghatkopar Cyclists Club has been celebrating most festivals together with our themed rides. For Navratri, we try to imbibe the culture by wearing colours of the nine days during our rides.” They're wearing jerseys and T-shirts as per the special colour code of the dayTheir routes are all chalked out in advance, too. Navin Sridhar, another avid cyclist, says, “I look forward to cycling to various parts of the city wearing jerseys of that particular day’s colour. Sometimes, riders don’t have jerseys of different colours, so they get really creative by wearing a bag or even a scarf of that colour over their jersey. Navratri is low-key in Mumbai due to the pandemic, so this is a nice way to celebrate. Cycling is one of the best ways to maintain social distance and we all enjoy riding a lot, so we feel it is safe and, of course, it’s so much fun meeting each other during this festive season.” ‘People stop to cheer, some ask if this is a race going on’The high-energy ride packs a few elements of garba as they play Gujarati music in-between the ride. Adds Navin, “People stop and cheer. When we halt, we play Gujarati music and everyone is in a great mood. Some look at the coloured jerseys and ask us if this is a race going on.” Financial consultant Aastha Anand hasn’t missed a colour-coded ride since the last three years. She says, “Riding with the cyclist group feels so nice as we haven’t been out as often due to COVID norms. On one hand, it pushes you to step out of your comfort zone — one has to get up early and ride on all the nine days. And, it also encourages others. My husband and I have got a few others in our groups to start cycling, too.” The next few days will see the group do colour-coded rides to Marine Drive, Bandra, Siddhivinayak, Mulund and other spots. And for the cyclists, the seasonal festivities have only just begun. Next on the agenda is a jalebi-fafda ride for Dussehra, where they will do a ride and then halt for traditional Gujarati food.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cyclists-don-the-colours-of-navratri-on-their-nine-day-ride/articleshow/86941099.cms||Ismat Tahseen

They also demanded that the university conduct the pending semester exams online. Students belong to the University Law College, Bhubaneswar; Madhusudan Law College, Cuttack; Capital Law College, Bhubaneswar and The Law College, Cuttack were part of the protest. “Many law schools have either promoted students on the basis of marks from internal exams or conducted online tests. Why does Utkal University have no clarity on the issue?” asked Deepak Kumar Mohanty, a student. He said the university should issue a notification regarding online semester exam for students of first to fourth year. It should issue marksheets by November 30 and conduct classes for the current semesters (third, fifth, seventh and ninth). The students submitted a memorandum to university vice-chancellor Sabita Acharya on this matter. Utkal University PG council chairman Basant Kumar Mallik said they will take a decision in a meeting to be held on Tuesday. “After discussing this in detail, we will take a decision whether examination will be conducted in online or offline mode,” Mallik said. The students had conducted a similar protest on August 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/law-students-ire-at-delay-in-exams/articleshow/86945415.cms||Hemanta Pradhan

The system is likely to move towards the west and the northwest over south Odisha and the north Andhra Pradesh coast as a well-marked low-pressure by Friday, triggering rain, mostly in coastal and adjoining districts for at least three to four days during the Pujas,” the IMD's latest forecast said. It added that there would also be heavy rainfall at some places. The latest forecast, which says that the possible system may not intensify into a cyclonic storm, brought some relief to the residents in the coastal pockets. “The weather system will intensify into a well-marked low-pressure and cause rain in parts of the coastal and adjoining districts between October 15 and 18. However, the intensity of the rainfall will depend upon the movement of the system and its strength,” said H R Biswas, director of the regional IMD centre in the city. He added that there would be light to moderate rainfall at few places on Thursday. The coastal pockets will witness heavy showers on Friday, the prediction said. Biswas said the southwest monsoon on Monday began withdrawing from 15 districts. Conditions are favourable for further withdrawal of the monsoon from some more parts of the state in the next two days, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/low-pressure-on-bay-delayed-by-2-days-imd/articleshow/86956781.cms||Siraj Mohammad

He was 70 and is survived by his wife and daughter. Dhar passed away three weeks after the death of CPM state secretary Goutam Das, also of Covid. Besides, CPM state secretary Jitendra Choudhury, leader of the opposition Manik Sarkar, Politburo and CPM central committee expressed grief over the demise of Bijan Dhar. Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb, deputy chief minister Jishnu Dev Varma, BJP state president Dr Manik Saha, senior BJP leader and MLA Sudip Roy Barman and Trinamool Congress state convener Subal Bhowmik expressed condolences. Dhar had been infected with Covid-19 on September 16 and as his condition deteriorated sharply, he had to be shifted by an air ambulance to Kolkata for treatment three days later. However, his health deteriorated for the last two days and he was shifted to the ICU where he breathed his last, family sources said. Dhar’s mortal remains were brought to Agartala in the evening and taken to his parental home at Badharghat and then to Sonamura from where he had begun his political career. His body will be kept at the CPM office here on Tuesday for the public to pay their respects. His last rites will be performed in the afternoon.

Manipur will go to the polls next year for which canvassing has been stepped up mostly in the valley districts. The fight among the workers of former MLA of the constituency, Th Shyamkumar Singh, and L Sanjoy broke out when a poll meeting of the former and a poll rally of the latter were on. In the melee, five workers of Sanjoy and another worker of Shyamkumar were injured, a source said, adding they were rushed to the nearby government health centres. The injured are said to be out of danger, even as the police have registered a case to ascertain the veracity of the incident. Sanjoy alleged that Shyamkumar’s workers and security escorts fired at the civilians who were also holding a peaceful meeting and a campaign in broad daylight. Condemning the attack on his workers, Sanjoy appealed to chief minister N Biren Singh to look into the matter. He also appealed the people of Andro for a violence-free constituency. On the other hand, Shyamkumar’s workers claimed that their meeting was disrupted by Sanjoy’s workers as a result of which the confrontation broke out. They said the one, who was injured after being attacked by Sanjoy’s workers, is a simple person who does not join any poll activity. He is undergoing treatment in JNIMS hospital here, they added. An election-related violence also triggered at the Singjamei area of Imphal West district between workers NPP and BJP in on Saturday night , leaving many injured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/imphal/6-hurt-as-supporters-of-rival-candidates-clash/articleshow/86946771.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma

A trade advisory was issued on this on Monday. “The trade advisory will apply to all terminals operated by APSEZ and including third party terminals at any APSEZ port, till further notice,” the Adani Group company added. Last month, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Gandhidham, had seized two containers with 38 bags that were misdeclared as ‘semi-processed talc stones’ originating from Afghanistan, which had arrived from Bandar Abbas Port, Iran. The two containers were suspected to be carrying narcotics and were seized. A case was registered by DRI on September 13. The NIA recently took over the investigation of the case relating to the seizure of narcotics from Mundra Port. Besides Mundra, other port terminals operated by APSEZ which handle container cargo include Hazira port in Gujarat in addition to Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh; Kattupalli and Ennore in Tamil Nadu; Dighi Port in Maharashtra and Vizhinjam in Kerala. According to data by the Director General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, 24,483 tonne of imports from Afghanistan and Iran were handled at the Mundra Port from January to December 2020. Sources said that imports from Afghanistan have nearly stopped after its takeover by the Taliban. Similarly, imports from Pakistan too have reduced dramatically after a 200% duty was imposed by the Indian government, said freight forwarders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-mundra-drug-haul-adanis-ban-afghanistan-pakistan-iran/articleshow/86951448.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||India||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: UP cops get remand of minister’s son for 3 days||BAREILLY: UP Police were on Monday granted three days’ remand of Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish, who was arrested five days after being booked for killing four farmers at Banbirpur in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. He was later booked for killing a journalist at the site as well. Police had sought 14 days’ remand to question him. "The identified accused Ashish Mishra, aka Monu, was arrested on October 9 and sent to the district jail. Police requested the court for a 14-day remand to investigate all evidence in the case. The court of the chief judicial magistrate, Lakhimpur Kheri, on October 11 granted three days’ police custody remand beginning on October 12," senior prosecution officer SP Yadav said on Monday evening. A person accused of a crime can be on police remand — where cops can take him to various locations pertinent for investigation, compare notes and question him — while being in judicial custody. Ashish was produced in the court of chief judicial magistrate Chinta Ram in a virtual hearing. The court asked police to conduct a medical examination, ensure Ashish is not under duress and allow his counsel to be present. "A panel of five advocates has been allowed to accompany Ashish as long as he is on remand. The SIT will take remand at 10am on October 12. It will be over at 10am on October 15," Ashish’s counsel Avdhesh Kumar Singh told TOI. Heavy forces were in place around the district jail and the court on Monday, and RAF jawans marched through the streets of Lakhimpur. Protesting farmers, on the basis of whose complaint Ashish was booked, have said he was in one of the vehicles that ran over farmers on the day of the violence. Both Ashish and his father have denied this, maintaining that he was not at Banbirpur at the time of the killings. During the 12-hour questioning at Lakhimpur Kheri crime branch office on Saturday, however, he could not explain where he was between 2.36pm and 4pm, a member of the SIT investigating the violence had told TOI. The violence took place around 3pm. He had been sent to 14-day judicial custody on Sunday and sent to Lakhimpur district jail. Police, then, wanted remand to be able to question him. Farmers have, meanwhile, questioned the delay in investigation. Several aspects of the probe, too, have come under scrutiny. About the five days it took for the arrest, Supreme Court lawyer Shobha Gupta explained that a lot depends on "prima facie evidence". She said, "Usually, police or the investigating team put in their best efforts and even follow from state to state a murder accused, to be arrested immediately. They certainly need prima facie evidence to frame an opinion that the person accused has committed the act. Without even that, it is unsafe to arrest anyone. But it is equally unsafe to allow the culprit to roam free if there is enough prima facie material against them." About the summons issued by the SIT before arrest, Gupta said, "The question of notice does not arise if there is enough material to frame a prima facie opinion that (person) A has committed murder. Section 41 of the CrPC permits direct arrest." She added, "Notice is given under Section 160 of the CrPC, the heading of which clearly says, ‘police officers’ power to require attendance of witnesses’." As for the presence of lawyers during interrogation, she said, "Section 41D, which was inserted with effect from November 1, 2010 in CrPC, requires as a mandate that the arrested person shall be allowed to meet their lawyer during interrogation but not throughout… I think this permits the lawyer to be around and not part of the interrogation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-up-cops-get-remand-of-ministers-son-for-3-days/articleshow/86951726.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: This Durga Puja, pre-booked pandal slots, vax checks & bhog home-delivered||GURUGRAM: Entry to pandals through pre-booked slots, virtual screening of cultural programmes and aartis, smaller idols and packaged bhog delivered through home delivery apps — this Durga Puja will be like no other as the city gears up to strike a balance between conducting rituals traditionally and ensuring that there are no big gatherings that could lead to spread of Covid-19 infection. On Sasthi, the first day of the five-day festival, the Joint Puja Committee (JPC), an umbrella body under whose aegis pandals are put up, said 22 committees were organising Durga Puja across the city this year.  While more relaxations have been allowed this season than 2020 when the pandemic was raging, JPC member Kaushik Bandopadhyay told TOI, celebrations will still remain muted. “At every step, abiding by Covid-19 protocols will be a must. On Dashami (Friday), there will be slots for the immersion of idols. Each puja committee will be allotted a time when four to five members will be allowed to take the idol for immersion at a temporary pond dug up at Sector 56,” Bandopadhyay said. With a third wave of the pandemic not ruled out, most puja organisers will be restricting the number of visitors to the pandals and streaming rituals online. At Bangiya Parishad Gurugram (BPG), popular for organising one of the biggest pandals in Sector 56, devotees from outside have been allowed to offer prayers. “But they have booked slots through a mobile application where they have to declare that they are fully vaccinated and are not running a temperature. We are also drafting in a team, led by a private security agency and our volunteers, to check the vaccination status of all at the entry point. In addition, we have installed an air purifier in the hall,” Partha Dey, BPG president, said. The DLF City Durga Puja and Bengali Cultural Society, which is organising its pandal at Phase 2, have also made entry through pre-booked slots on an application mandatory. But unlike BPG, they will only permit members of the society to physically visit the pandal. While members who are below 45 years of age have to produce partial vaccination or RT-PCR negative result certificates, those above 45 years will have to be fully vaccinated, organisers said. “We are allowing 50 people at a time for darshan. After each batch, 30 minutes will be reserved for sanitisation of the area before the next group is allowed. No food or offerings are allowed, and there will be no food stalls. Bhog will be packed and sent to every member’s home via Zomato,” Bhashkar Mukherjee, DCDP Bengali Cultural Society president, said. At DLF 5 pandal, too, only patrons have been allowed to offer prayers physically. “The puja pandal can be accessed only by patrons this year who have all registered and booked slots in advance,” Chandrima Chatterjee, a volunteer at DLF5 Durga Puja, said. Among the few pandals that have permitted devotees to walk in is Nobo Bongo Cultural Society in Sector 47. But here, too, food stalls and cultural programmes are missing and the idol is shorter at six feet. “Things are closer to normal this year, so we are following all the rituals and allowing residents to visit, but if the crowd within the campus is more than 100, our committee will reserve the right to stop people from entering. We are allowing people to attend the pushpanjali, aarti, and other rituals, but our committee members will ensure that everyone stays only for a limited period of time,” Ipsita Roy, the society president, said. Gurugram Bengali Association, the oldest Durga Puja organisers in the city, meanwhile, has cut celebrations to three days this year instead of the usual five. The idol height has also been restricted to two feet as compared to the usual 10 or 12 feet. The puja will be organized from October 13 to 15 at Gauri Shankar temple in Sector 9A, Angshuman Chakraborti, the association’s general secretary, said. In the newly developed sectors, Tulip Bangiya Parishad has decided to open its doors for all devotees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/this-puja-pre-booked-pandal-slots-vax-checks-bhog-home-delivered/articleshow/86951915.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||World||3 economists get Nobel for work on wages, jobs||STOCKHOLM: A US-based economist won the Nobel prize in economics on Monday for pioneering research that transformed widely held ideas about the labour force, showing how an increase in the minimum wage doesn’t hinder hiring and immigrants do not lower pay for native-born workers. Two others shared the award for creating a way to study these types of societal issues. Canadian-born David Card of the University of California, Berkeley, was awarded half of the prize for his research on how minimum wage, immigration and education affect the labour market. The other half was shared by Joshua Angrist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dutch-born Guido Imbens from Stanford University for their framework for studying issues that can't rely on traditional scientific methods. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the three have “completely reshaped empirical work in the economic sciences.” Together, the three helped rapidly expand the use of “natural experiments,” or studies based on the observation of real-world data. Such research made economics more applicable to everyday life, provided policymakers with actual evidence on the outcomes of policies, and in time spawned a more popular approach to economics epitomised by the blockbuster bestseller “Freakonomics”, by Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt. In a study published in 1993, Card looked at what happened to jobs at fast-food restaurants Burger King, KFC, Wendy's and Roy Rogers when New Jersey raised its minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05, using restaurants in bordering eastern Pennsylvania as the control — or comparison — group. Contrary to previous studies, he and his late research partner Alan Krueger found that an increase in the minimum wage had no effect on the number of employees. Card’s minimum wage research fundamentally altered economists’ views of such policies. As noted by the Economist magazine, in 1992 a survey of the American Economic Association’s members found that 79% agreed that a minimum wage law increased unemployment among younger and lower-skilled workers. Those views were largely based on traditional economic notions of supply and demand: If you raise the price of something, you get less of it. By 2000, however, just 46% of the AEA’s members said minimum wage laws increase unemployment, largely because of Card and Krueger's research. Their findings sparked interest in further research into why a higher minimum wouldn’t reduce employment. One conclusion was that companies are able to pass on the cost of higher wages to customers by raising prices. In other cases, if a company is a major employer in a particular area, it may be able to keep wages particularly low, so that it could afford to pay a higher minimum, when required to do so, without cutting jobs. The higher pay would also attract more applicants, boosting labour supply. “That really surprising evidence on the impact of the minimum wage has shaken up the field at a very fundamental level,” said Arindrajit Dube, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who has duplicated and broadened Card and Krueger’s research. “And so for that reason, and all the following research that their work ignited, this is a richly deserved award.” Krueger would almost certainly have shared in the award, Dube said, but the economics Nobel isn’t awarded posthumously. Card also found that an influx of immigrants into a city doesn’t cost native workers jobs or lower their earnings, though earlier immigrants can be negatively affected. Card studied the labour market in Miami in the wake of Cuba’s sudden decision to let people emigrate in 1980, leading 125,000 people to leave in what became known as the Mariel Boatlift. It resulted in a 7% increase in the city’s workforce. By comparing the evolution of wages and employment in four other cities, Card discovered no negative effects for Miami residents with low levels of education. Follow-up work showed that increased immigration can have a positive impact on income for people born in the country. Angrist and Imbens won their half of the award for working out the methodological issues that allow economists to draw solid conclusions about cause and effect even where they cannot carry out studies according to strict scientific methods. Card’s work on the minimum wage is one of the most well-known natural experiments in economics. The problem with such experiments is that it can sometimes be difficult to isolate cause and effect. For example, if you want to figure out whether an extra year of education will increase a person’s income, you can simply compare the incomes of adults with one more year of schooling to those without. Yet there are many other factors that may determine whether those who got an extra year of schooling are able to make more money. Perhaps they are harder workers or more diligent and would have made more money than those without the extra year even if they did not stay in school. These kinds of issues cause economists and other social science researchers to say “correlation doesn’t prove causation”. Imbens and Angrist, however, figured out ways to isolate the effects of things like an extra year of school. Their methods enabled researchers to draw much clearer conclusions about cause and effect, even if they are unable to control who gets things like extra education, the way scientists in a lab can control their experiments. Card said he thought the voice message that came in at 2am from someone from Sweden was a prank by a school friend, until he saw the number on his phone really was from Sweden. He said he and his co-author Kreuger faced disbelief from other economists about their findings. “At the time, the conclusions were somewhat controversial. Quite a few economists were sceptical of our results,” he said. As for the significance of the research, “the thing that has really influenced the field is the idea of looking for these pivotal events or things that have happened that could potentially inform our theorising and understanding of the world,” he said. He paid tribute to Krueger, saying that “I am sure that if Alan were still with us he would be sharing this prize with me”. “I was just absolutely stunned then to get a telephone call,” Imbens said. “And then I was just absolutely thrilled to hear the news... that I got to share this with Josh Angrist and David Card,” whom he called “both very good friends”. Imbens said Angrist was best man at his wedding. Angrist said, “Of course I'm thrilled. ...It's an honor to get the Nobel Prize and especially to be recognised with my winners, you know, Guido Imbens and Dave Card, who are wonderful scholars and I couldn't be happier.” Krueger, who worked with Card on some of the research that won the Nobel, died in 2019 at age 58. He taught at Princeton for three decades and was chief labor department economist under President Bill Clinton. He served in the treasury department under President Barack Obama, then as Obama’s chairman of the council of economic advisers. The award comes with a gold medal and 10 million Swedish kronor (over $1.14 million). Unlike the other Nobel prizes, the economics award wasn’t established in the will of Alfred Nobel but by the Swedish central bank in his memory in 1968, with the first winner selected a year later. It is the last prize announced each year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/3-economists-get-nobel-for-work-on-wages-jobs/articleshow/86952029.cms||---

The higher price of dollar and oil triggered inflation fears pushing up yields on the 10-year government bond to a high of 6.34% the highest in 18 months. The rupee came under combined pressure as crude oil moved to a seven-year high and the dollar gained against major currencies in global markets on expectations that the US Federal Reserve will taper bond-buybacks to reduce liquidity. Bond yields rose because of fears of higher inflation coupled with RBI’s announcement that there may not be need for additional purchases under its government securities acquisition program. According to a bond dealer the rupee could come under further pressure unless the central bank decided to intervene and sell dollars. With forex reserves of $637 million and strong capital flows, there is no fear of market instability. Dealers however said that the combination of high fuel and forex would cause inflationary pressures to build up and increase pressure on the government to cut taxes on fuel. The rupee opened low in the interbank forex market at 75.11 and rose to a intra-day high of 75.06 and fell to a low of 75.39. The domestic unit finally closed at 75.36. “The movement in rupee is mainly driven by the uptrend in crude and dollar index. Some cooling off in crude prices and sell side RBI intervention may limit the trend but worries about US inflation are still alive and any upswing in inflation numbers this week, will boost expectations of an earlier FOMC rate hike next year after tapering, keeping the USDINR spot afloat,” said an analyst with Emkay Global Financial Services. “This week, we expect the spot to trade in between 74.75-75.50. There lies a strong support around 74.80-74.75, a break of which may push the spot towards 74.50. While, on upside a break of 75.50, may open doors for 75.75,” the analyst added. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank of India expect to be 5.7% in the fourth quarter lower than RBI’s own expectation of 5.8%. They also expect the yield on 10-year government bonds to inch up to 6.4% this year. According to the monetary policy report released by the central bank on Friday, the exchange rate is assumed at Rs 74.3 per US dollar in the baseline as against Rs 72.6 in the April monetary policy report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rupee-drops-below-75-on-rising-crude-oil-bond-yields-surge/articleshow/86952753.cms||---

Contrary to Union power minister Raj Kumar Singh’s claim that there was no power crisis in the country due to coal shortage, NDA ally Nitish Kumar on Monday said there was a problem in supply of sufficient quantity of electricity to the state. In UP, Yogi Adityanath convened a high-level meeting with the UP Power Corporation Limited and officials of various discoms in Lucknow. According to reports, as against a demand of around 18,000MW, the state has been able to wheel in around 14,000MW, forcing unscheduled rostering. Yogi said that the power crisis should be resolved in view of festivals. “Power cuts are causing huge production losses. Industries which require a continuous process, such as steel or plastic, have failed to run due to failure of continued supply by PSPCL,” Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association president Badish Jindal said. The state-run power discom was forced to purchase around 1,500MW of power for Rs 14.46 per unit. On Sunday and Saturday, it had bought at Rs 11.6 and Rs 13 a unit. Kerala has decided not to impose load-shedding in view of online classes. If 300MW can be obtained from outside, the state can go without load shedding till October 19 but will need Rs 2 crore per day. In Patna, Nitish Kumar told media persons, “It is true that there is a problem. It is true that we (Bihar) are not getting whatever electricity is provisioned from the NT-PC and other companies. There are some reasons due to which such a situation has arisen. It’s not only in Bihar, it’s everywhere.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-denies-power-crisis-but-cms-call-emergency-meets/articleshow/86952859.cms||---
---||India||India has never seen such a ‘decisive government’, says PM Narendra Modi||NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: The government’s approach to space reforms is based on four pillars — freedom to the private sector in innovation, the role of government as an enabler, to make youth future-ready, and to see the space sector as a resource for the progress of common man,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday, as he launched the Indian Space Association, (ISpA) a premier industry association of space and satellite companies that aspires to be the voice of the country’s space sector. He also announced the formation of IN-SPACe, which will work as a single-window independent agency for all space-related programmes, facilitate private sector participation and speed up their projects. The virtual launch of ISpA was attended by Union space minister Jitendra Singh, electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnav, Isro chairman K Sivan, IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka, NSA Ajit Doval, CDS General Bipin Rawat, ISpA’s first chairman Jayant Patil, industry leaders like Sunil Mittal and top players from the space industry. Announcing that the government is in the last stages of finalising several space-related policies, the PM said: “During the last seven years, space technology has been converted into a tool of last-mile delivery and leakage-free, transparent governance. He cited examples of use of geotagging in housing units for the poor and roads and infrastructure projects. With advancements made in all aspects of space activity — from satellites to launch vehicles and application to interplanetary missions — India, he said, was among very few countries that has end-to-end capabilities. “We’ve made efficiency a key aspect of our brand. And as we move from information to space era, we need to enhance this efficiency and promote affordability. As a partner, the government will support industry, young innovators and startups. Now, you need to grow,” he added. “Today is the day of a new flight for the space sector. Since independence, the Indian government has been synonymous with the space sector and a lot has been achieved by Indian scientists. However, time now demands that Indian talent — whether it is public or private sector — is not restricted by anything. And, in the 75th year of independence, the opening of the space sector provides a new platform for the private sector,” said Modi. Commending the companies for taking his suggestion in December 2020 and forming ISpA, Modi said that only collective effort can take India to new heights. “India has never seen such a decisive government. The big reforms being introduced in the space sector are indicative of this,” he added. “...This new thinking and mantra are important because it is not the time for linear innovation for India but for an exponential innovation which is only possible when the government stops being the handler and becomes an enabler. This is why we are opening up all sectors which do not need the government to be there,” said Modi. “Our goals through the space sector are for better mapping, imaging and connectivity for all, better speed from shipment to delivery for entrepreneurs, better forecast, safety and security for our farmers and fishermen, better predictions of environment-related activities, enhanced safety for thousands of lakhs of lives. And the same goals will be shared by ISpA,” he said. The ISpA, which is represented by leading home grown and global corporations with advanced capabilities in space and satellite technologies, has L&T, Nelco (Tata Group), OneWeb, Bharti Airtel, Mapmyindia, Walchandnagar Industries and Ananth Technology Ltd among its key founding members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-has-never-seen-such-a-decisive-government-says-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/86952930.cms||Surendra Singh

A final decision is still to be taken. Well-placed sources said the party may accept the resignation that Sidhu tendered a few days ago when he announced on the social media that the state government was going slow on sacrilege and drugs cases which was contrary to the promises it had made before the 2017 elections. The party has not taken kindly to his public resignation and repeated comments which are casting the state government led by the new CM Channi in unflattering light. “The resignation given by Sidhu may be accepted. the party is looking at possible candidates. However, it’s an open issue still,” a source said. If Congress indeed removes Sidhu as Punjab president, it would mark an unexpected culmination of extraordinary turn of events in the state in last few months in which the cricketer-turned politician became the catalyst for tremors that resulted first in his appointment as state chief despite the opposition of then CM Amarinder Singh and a big section of the organisation. It later triggered an overhaul which saw the removal of satrap Amarinder Singh, inauguration of first Dalit chief Minister in the history of the state and a complete rejig of the state cabinet. While Sidhu’s intermittent outbursts are seen as resulting from his peeve at being overlooked for chief ministership following Singh’s removal recently, the maverick politician, however, claims that “it is based on issues and not posts”. If Sidhu leaves the top state party post, all eyes would be on his next step given that he has options outside Congress still. On his part, he wrote in his resignation letter that he would continue to work for the party, and later in a tweet reaffirmed his loyalty to Congress by saying that “will uphold principles of Gandhi Ji & Shastri Ji … Post or No Post, will stand by RahulGandhi & Priyanka Gandhi! Let all negative forces try to defeat me, but with every ounce of positive energy will make Punjab win, Punjabiyat (Universal Brotherhood) win & every Punjabi win”. He has since also lauded Priyanka Gandhi on Twitter for her combative stand on Lakhimpur Kheri violence in UP, and also led a march to Kheri with party MLAs and ministers which created an impact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/navjot-singh-sidhu-outbursts-on-cong-may-accept-his-pcc-resignation/articleshow/86953061.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The announcement came on the heels of the temple administration receiving a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the National Monuments Authority (NMA) for the smooth execution of the project. “The chief minister will perform the ceremonial start of the project, for which we have received the NOC, followed by a bhoomi puja,” temple’s chief administrator Krishan Kumar said, after a meeting with Chhitisa Nijog, a confederation of different associations of servitors of the Jagannath Temple on Monday. A grand event and yajna will be held in the presence of 450 dignitaries, including Puri Shankaracharya Swami Nischalananda Saraswati and Puri king Dibyasingha Deb, near the northern gate of the Jagannath Temple on the occasion. Being implemented at a cost of nearly Rs 800 crore within a 75-metre radius of the temple, the heritage corridor project envisages the development of mutts, a Shree Jagannath reception centre, amenities for devotees and enhanced security for the shrine. The project is a part of the Augmentation of Basic Amenities and Development of Heritage and Architecture (ABADHA) scheme for developing Puri as a world-class heritage city. The government has purchased land from 115 families around the temple to execute the project. At least 512 shops and 24 lodges were evicted for the 75-metre corridor project. Besides, properties of 25 mutts were acquired for the project. The government has, so far, paid Rs 289.34 crore on acquiring land for the purpose. The aim of the project is to provide expansive and unobstructed corridors around the Meghanada Pacheri (outer boundary wall) to give the devotees an opportunity to have a panaromic view of the temple, the Neelchakra and Meghanada Pacheri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/naveen-to-do-bhoomi-puja-of-puri-heritage-corridor-project-on-oct-18/articleshow/86945709.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Last month, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) - Gandhidham had seized two containers containing some 38 bags that were mis-declared as ‘semi-processed talc stones’ originating from Afghanistan, which had arrived from Bandar Abbas Port, Iran. The two containers were suspected to be carrying narcotics and therefore were seized. A case was registered by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on September 13. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) recently took over the investigation of the case relating to the seizure of narcotics from Mundra Port. Besides Mundra, other port terminals operated by APSEZ which handle containerised cargo include Hazira port in Gujarat in addition to Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh; Kattupalli and Ennore in Tamil Nadu; Dighi Port in Maharashtra and Vizhinjam in Kerala. According to data by Director General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, 24,483 tonne of imports from Afghanistan and Iran were handled at the Mundra Port from January to December 2020. Items imported from Afghanistan included fresh fruits, spices, processed fruits and juices, granite, natural stone and ayurvedic and herbal products. Sources however said that imports from Afghanistan have near-stopped after its takeover by Taliban. Similarly, imports from Pakistan too have reduced dramatically after a 200% duty was imposed by the Indian government, said freight forwarders. Imports from Iran include groundnut, fresh fruits and vegetables, processed fruits and juices, cereal preparations, bulk mineral and ores, processed minerals, rubber products, inorganic chemicals, petroleum products, glass and glassware, plastic raw materials, ceramics and allied products, among others. However, EXIM (export-import) trade with Iran and Afghanistan continues. “After such an announcement, most of the cargo can be handled from the Kandla port as well which will not attract significant added costs. However, if the shipments are forwarded through other ports, it may attract added costs,” said a Mundra-based freight forwarder, without willing to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-cargo-from-pak-iranand-af-says-adani-ports/articleshow/86948566.cms||Niyati Parikh

With these three, now all eight municipal corporations of Gujarat including major cities of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar have 90% or more of the population covered with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccination. Cumulatively, 97% of the target population has got the first dose in these cities, which is much higher than the state average of 89%. Even for the second dose, against the state average of 44%, the urban areas account for 52% of the second jab – meaning half of those who have got the first shot also duly got the second shot. Having said this, there are over 83 lakh persons who have taken the first shot, are due for the second shot and have not taken the jab yet. The state immunization department has now focussed their attention on ensuring this population completes their two doses. "For people due for second shots who have not yet come forward, we are collaborating with the municipal corporations and district administration to call them up and guide them to their nearest vaccination booth,” said Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer, In all, Gujarat is second in India among major states with 89% of the population covered with the first shot and 44% with the second. Kerala at the first position has 93% and 43% coverage of first and second shots respectively. Overall, Himachal Pradesh has 100% population covered and Jammu & Kashmir 97% with the first jab, reveal the central government data. Gujarat has cumulatively vaccinated 6.5 crore persons for both first and second doses - joint third with Madhya Pradesh after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. The state has given impetus to maximum coverage of the target population ahead of the festive season to thwart the possible third wave. October has remained a month so far with relatively higher daily cases and four deaths in the first 11 days – one of the highest since July. Dr Jani said that they intend to cover the whole target population among the urban areas soon. “We are conducting camps at various localities, and also reaching out to the people during night hours. All cities have good response to the immunization with cities like Surat and Gandhinagar achieving 100% of the first dose,” he said. City-based medical practitioners said that with the wider coverage of vaccines in cities like Ahmedabad, not only the cases have reduced drastically, but also the severity of the infection which had proved fatal during the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-vaccination-three-guj-cities-cross-100-five-90/articleshow/86948751.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Nagpur||NGO floods cops’ helplines with 200+ pothole plaints||Nagpur: Continuing its drive against potholes, NGO Janmanch has lodged over 200 complaints with various helplines launched by traffic police after being censured by the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court in 2019. The NGO’s move came after lawyers and social workers called on common citizens through TOI reports to come forward and flood these helplines with complaints of potholes in their respective areas with photographs. The NGO had earlier written two letters to the authorities concerned demanding to strictly adhere to HC’s directives of October 16, 2019, in a suo motu writ petition. The lawyers and social workers expressed surprise over the fact that despite Union minister Nitin Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis hailing from the city and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) ruled by BJP under them, the city roads, except cement ones, were in dire straits and reflect lunar surface. They even flayed guardian minister Nitin Raut, animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar for failure to ensure that roads here would remain pothole-free and to bring additional funds from Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for the purpose. Quoting HC’s orders, Janmanch president Rajiv Jagtap said police should immediately forward all complaints to NMC, which should repair potholes within ten days. “If civic officials failed in their task, police should conduct a probe and lodge offences against them in the next three days, as per the court’s stringent directives.” Endorsing the NGO’s stand, lawyer Anil Kumar, who had filed an intervention in the same case, pointed out that both NMC and cops were taking undue advantage of its disposal. “It is their moral responsibility to repair potholes, which have taken several innocent lives so far. I had suggested in my intervention that every road should have signboards where names of contractors and NMC officials from that area should be clearly mentioned along with their contact numbers so that citizens should directly lodge complaints.” Amicus curiae Raheel Mirza told TOI that though contempt cases could not be filed against civic authorities, criminal proceedings could be initiated against them under various provisions of IPC as directed by HC. “If they failed to repair those within a specified period as directed by the court, certainly it amounts to criminal action, as they are putting someone’s life at risk by not attending to the complaint lodged by residents. Citizens should immediately lodge complaints with NMC and NIT and also with various helplines launched by police,” he said. The NGO warned of moving HC with a prayer to initiate contempt action in case the authorities fail to follow the deadlines to repair potholes. “Our activists visited various areas of the city and collected photographs of potholes. They then lodged complaints through WhatsApp number and emails provided by the DCP traffic with photographs and exact locations. We’re expecting the civic officials to act on those as early as possible and within ten days,” Jagtap told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngo-floods-cops-helplines-with-200-pothole-plaints/articleshow/86948539.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat firms’ IPO mop-up to cross Rs 10,000 crore in 2021||AHMEDABAD: Riding on the current initial public offering (IPO) boom, Gujarat-based companies’ mop-up from the public issues—both mainboard and small and medium enterprises (SME) IPOs--is set to cross Rs 10,000 crore-mark in 2021. Gujarati companies have cumulatively raised around Rs 9,406 crore via 10 public issues, including SME IPOs, so far in 2021. Notable among them are Nirma Group’s Nuvoco Vistas Corporation Limited, GR Infraprojects Limited, Anupam Rasayan Limited, Rolex Rings Limited and Heranba Industries Ltd. Five more companies from the state have lined up their issues and filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for the same. While Veeda Clinical Research Limited and Sahajanand Medical Technologies Limited plan to raise Rs Rs 831 crore and Rs 1,500 crore respectively, Adani Wilmar’s IPO size is pegged at Rs 4,500 crore. Most of the public offerings under the pipeline are expected to hit the market before December, say financial sector players, adding that Gujarat’s IPO collection will easily surpass Rs 10,000 crore-mark even if one of these five planned issues hits the market before the end of 2021. With equity indices scaling new peaks and retail investors pumping money in stocks, the rush for public offerings has intensified in 2021. As against this, only one main-board IPO and five SME issues were launched in 2020 from Gujarat, which cumulatively collected Rs 353 crore. The fund mobilization stood at only Rs 224 crore via 17 SME IPOs in 2019 as not a single main-board IPO from the state had hit the market then. “Indian companies, including those from Gujarat, have mopped up a whopping $9.7 billion through IPO in the first nine months of 2021, a record in two decades. Recovery in global markets and bullish domestic investor sentiment can largely be attributed to high enthusiasm, where the retail portion of IPO’s have subscribed multiple times,” said Aasif Hirani, director at Tradebulls Securities. “Cashing on the current investor sentiment, as many as 35 companies from across the country may raise Rs 80,000 crore via IPO during October-December quarter,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-firms-ipo-mop-up-to-cross-rs10k-cr-in-21/articleshow/86948610.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Business||Companies offer childcare with hybrid office||MUMBAI: As hybrid emerges as a prevalent method of returning to work, several organisations are adopting an integrated approach to childcare benefits as well. Additionally, these benefits are being made gender-neutral too. Integrated childcare would include offering the flexibility to employees to opt for a mix of day care centres/creches from anywhere, virtual care support, childminders and nanny support benefits. Pre-pandemic, not many offered the choice to employees in selecting a mix of childcare benefits. However, as employees begin to return to work in a hybrid environment — requiring them to work some days in office and some from home — they would need a mix of such benefits to better manage work as well as childcare. Insights from a recent childcare-parental benefit survey of 54 companies across industries by ProEves show that physical day care continues to be the most prevalent childcare benefit with 85% companies offering it. Post-pandemic, as physical day care centres were not fully operational, virtual care gained popularity. Today, virtual care — which involves childcare in the form of expert-led online camp, pre-school classes — is being adopted by 65% of companies and IT/ITeS & BFSI companies are the leading adopters of such benefits. Online kids’ engagement is being offered by 46%, one-to-one child minders by 43% and nanny care by 13% of the organisations, according to the findings by the childcare benefit provider, which have been shared exclusively with TOI. According to ProEves, near-home day care launch is being planned by 59% companies till December this year, and companies are preparing for this benefit as they finalise the return-to-work plan for employees. Companies are using flexi-childcare benefits as an enabler to attract and retain talent that prefers flexi working, said ProEves. ProEves co-founder Divya Agarwal said, “‘Flexi return’ is the most prevalent return-to-work plan with 72% companies calling employees 2 or 3 days every week. To this effect, integrated childcare support is the go-forward trend being adopted by companies with half implementing it for men and women. Parents can opt for flexible childcare benefits along with flexi-working.” HSBC India, which first introduced childcare benefits such as creches for new mothers, widened the benefit to include all primary caregivers to help them balance work and caregiving in 2020. “During the pandemic, we added options to deepen childcare and allow the flexibility to utilise the benefit meaningfully according to their unique need. Whether day care near the office or home, nanny care or virtual care, an employee can access a suite of resources on our platform and reimburse the expense according to policy. And as we plan to transition to a hybrid way of working, this shift is here to stay,” said HSBC India HR head, Archana Chadha. PepsiCo India has partnered with ProEves to provide varied virtual childcare services which are in tune with changing needs and are free for the employees. PepsiCo India CHRO Pavitra Singh said, “The childcare services were inclusive because they catered to all parents — not limited by gender or age of the child. All the childcare services were available on one platform with curated service options serving for all age group children including parent coaches for new parents, summer camps for younger children, skill camps for older children and child minders for 1:1 attention.” “As a company, we understand the challenges that our employees, especially working parents, have been facing. We are cognizant of the constant support they need to engage children at home while managing workload and household chores,” said Singh. EY Global Delivery Services (EY GDS), which has around 5,500 working parents, offers creche services and other childcare support free of cost to all their employees. The policy is also gender-neutral with parents — both men and women of a child up to the age of five years — having the option to work from home. “When the pandemic hit, we saw working parents being overburdened with managing both work and home, which also included childcare responsibilities. We wanted to enable a support system for them and thus we decided to hire a vendor to provide virtual childcare services to working parents. We have seen the uptake for these services going up from 200 working parents to 1,000,” said Jaya Virwani, who leads diversity & inclusiveness and ethics office at EY GDS. Employees of EY GDS signed up for virtual childcare camps, virtual nannies and assistance for coaching children. “Even as we gradually come back to work, this is going to be an option that working parents can opt for in a hybrid working model. We’re also going to open up our creches as soon as we have more people vaccinated and ready to come to office,” said Virwani. From October, EY GDS employees can return to office. However, it’s optional. PepsiCo India, which hasn’t announced a date yet for opening offices, has said it will adopt a ‘Work that Works’ policy — a hybrid model — which will offer flexibility to its employees. It will kick in once the organisation resumes work from the office depending on the external situation. “As we implement a hybrid work model, childcare benefits would also be integrated with flexibility — it would include creche with subsidised rates across key locations for those who opt to come to work while continuing virtual services at discounted rates,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-offer-childcare-with-hybrid-office/articleshow/86950498.cms||Namrata Singh

The central bank had proposed a three-member committee when it superseded the board of the two finance companies last week. The three members are R Subramaniakumar (former MD & CEO of Indian Overseas Bank), T T Srinivasaraghavan (former MD of Sundaram Finance), and Farokh N Subedar (former CEO & company secretary, Tata Sons).

Both indices hit new all-time highs on Monday fuelled by buying in auto, power and banking stocks. The Nifty rose to a high of 18,042 before closing at 17,946, up 0.3% for the day. The sensex too hit a record intraday high of 60,476 before settling at 60,136, up 77 points or about 0.1% on Monday. The rally was supported by the RBI’s assurance about maintaining adequate liquidity to aid economic recovery in its monetary policy on Friday, positive cues from Asian equity markets and buying by foreign investors, according to market watchers. Auto cos led the rally over expectations of strong sales in the festive season. Maruti Suzuki (4%) was the top gainer among the sensex stocks, while Tata Motors (9%) rallied the most in the broader Nifty. The rally came despite market heavyweight TCS (-6%) being the top drag on both the sensex and the Nifty after posting results that missed market expectations on Friday. Other IT companies also traded weak. The Nifty, which took 28 sessions to rally from 17k to 18k, has risen 28% this year, outperforming several global indices. “The rally has been driven by strong liquidity, healthy corporate earnings & upbeat commentaries, and falling Covid cases leading to opening of the economy. Government policies like PLI schemes, relief for telecom and privatisation of Air India too have been supporting markets,” said Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka. According to Khemka, valuations have turned expensive due to the sharp rally. “Rising energy and commodity prices, disruptions in global supply chains, US Federal Reserve taper talks and the US government debt ceiling are some of the factors that can lead to higher global market volatility,” he said. Market players said stock and sector-specific action is expected to continue amid global uncertainty and elevated valuations . “With most positive news accounted for, prices are left more vulnerable to disappointment in earnings. Investors should remain cautious with stock-specific decisions in the near term,” said Nirav Karkera, head of research at wealth management platform Fisdom.However, market participants said technical indicators continued to show bullish momentum. “Nifty may face resistance near 18,280 with a strong support near 17,920. It is advisable to take buying position on dips,” said Ravi Singh, head of research & VP at brokerage firm Share India. “There is no sign of topping out yet and markets are in the early stage of a bull run, which may take the Nifty to the 21,000 level before witnessing a significant correction,” said Sandeep Matta, founder of investment advisory Tradeit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nifty-vrooms-past-18k-for-1st-time-on-auto-power-stocks-ends-lower/articleshow/86950448.cms||Aseem Gujar

Mayor Sita Sahu, who chaired the meeting, said the garbage collected from households will be dumped at the secondary transfer stations to segregate wet and dry waste before shifting it to the landfill site at Ramachak Bairiya. “It will improve waste collection and transportation of garbage. Presently, there are two such transfer stations, at Gardanibagh and Agamkuan,” she said. The ward councillors also approved the proposal to set up a leachate treatment plant at Ramachak Bairiya site to overcome the problem of seepage during monsoon. Leachate is a black, foul-smelling toxic liquid produced by rotting garbage at landfills and infiltrates down to irreversibly contaminate the groundwater as well. The treatment plant will process such waste and discharge the purified water in Badshahi Payen. The board also approved the rates of waste collection under the solid waste management programme of the PMC. Now, there will be no adjustment of property tax and garbage fee. “Solid waste collection fee can be paid quarterly, half-yearly and yearly. Commercial shops and establishments, which remained closed during the lockdown period, will be exempted from garbage collection fee. We have been decided to give 50% rebate on garbage collection fee to those establishments which do their own processing of wet waste,” Sahu said. A proposal to procure CNG buses and upgrade unorganized parks in the city also got the board’s nod. The amount received under the Centre’s programme for combating air pollution, solid waste management and water supply management by the 15th Finance Commission during the fiscal year 2020-21 will be utilized for both the projects. The civic body has decided to hire an agency to operate and maintain 87 deluxe and other toilets in the PMC area. Altogether 13 proposals were approved during the meeting, including the construction of drainage line in ward number 2, 20 and 22, purchase of cleaning machines such as sweeping machines and mini excavator machines and dustbins for slum areas, and two electric crematorium for dead animals at the landfill site. Municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma and the ward councillors were present at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-civic-body-approves-4-more-garbage-secondary-transfer-stations/articleshow/86946463.cms||Faryal Rumi

Those who remained in the prisons for more than six months will be paid Rs 15,000 per month instead of the existing Rs 10,000,” Nitish said while addressing a gathering at the Gandhi Sangrahalaya here after releasing a book based on the life of Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan. The book – ‘The Dream of Revolution’ – was initially penned by JP’s close associate Bimal Prasad. After Prasad’s death, his daughter Sujata Prasad completed it. Recalling his long association with JP and the student movement of 1974, the CM said the state government had earlier given a corpus of Rs 3 crore to the Mahila Charkha Samiti, Kadamkuan, where JP and his wife Prabhavati ji used to live. “We have now decided to increase the corpus of the Mahila Charkha Samiti so that necessary works can be undertaken to protect the building related to the Loknayak,” the CM said. Nitish added his government had earlier provided a corpus of Rs 2 crore to the Gandhi Sangrahalaya. “We have now decided to give an additional Rs 3 crore to the corpus of Gandhi Sangrahalaya,” he said. Earlier in the morning, the CM visited the Mahila Charkha Samiti at Kadamkuan and paid rich tributes to JP on his birth anniversary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/more-pension-for-jp-senanis/articleshow/86946803.cms||Madan Kumar

The move is aimed at curbing river pollution. At least 62 artificial ponds will be made near the ghats in the district for idol immersion. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said around 1,200 Durga Puja committees and organisers have submitted applications seeking permission for idol immersion. “Licence will be issued to them mentioning time slot and place of immersion. Arrangements are being made for peaceful procession and immersion of idols. Use of DJ and music during procession is banned,” he added. A complete ban has been imposed on the immersion of idols in the Ganga river under the Bihar (Procedure for Immersion of Idol after Pujas) Rules, 2021. The rules have been prepared in compliance with the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and revised guidelines of idol immersion by the Central Pollution Control Board. The DM said, “The objective of making artificial ponds is to keep the rivers clean and maintain the level of water in the rivers. The sub-divisional officers have identified temporary immersion sites in their respective areas. Altogether 62 artificial ponds are being made at Digha Ghat, Manik Chand Talab, Mahendru Ghat, Janardan Ghat, Khajekalan Ghat, Gai Ghat, Pipapul Ghat, Nariyal Ghat, Quila Ghat, Patna Law College Ghat, Kangan Ghat, Bhadra Ghat and Badi Deviji Milan Sthal in Patna municipal area. Some other sites have been chosen in sub-divisional areas.” Singh said the executive officer of the local body concerned would ensure construction of ponds besides making other arrangements by October 14. “The head of the local bodies will monitor the work at ghats and other sites where idol immersion will take place. The local bodies have been asked to ensure cleanliness of the road leading to the immersion sites. SDRF and NDRF teams will be deployed at the ghats to stop any attempt by the Puja organisers to immerse Durga idols in the Ganga,” he added. Sunil Kumar, co-convener of Gorimath Puja Committee, Mithapur, said an application was submitted to the SDO on behalf of the committee seeking permission of idol immersion. “The licence has not been issued yet,” he added. Bablu Sav, general secretary Yuva Ekta Manch Durga Puja Samiti, Rajendra Nagar, said, “We will follow the instruction of the district administration. The idol immersion will take place in the presence of limited people. Only members of the committee will participate in idol immersion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/62-artificial-ponds-to-be-made-for-idol-immersion-in-patna-dist-dm/articleshow/86946348.cms||Faryal Rumi

Hitting out at Zee’s reckless public relations campaign in response to its request for leadership changes at the company, Invesco said their actions are aimed at avoiding true accountability for the governance lapses and shareholder value destruction that the current leadership and board have presided over. “We are calling on Zee shareholders to join us in asking why the founding family, which holds under 4% of the company’s shares, should benefit at the expense of the investors who hold the remaining 96%,” wrote Invesco chief investment officer Justin Leverenz in an open letter to the company’s shareholders. The US fund, which owns nearly 18% in Zee, restated the need to overhaul Zee’s board because of the governance and leadership failures at the company. It added that it would pursue the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) request to hold the board and management accountable and effect necessary change at Zee. After Invesco sought a board reshuffle at Zee, the latter proposed a merger with Sony Pictures Networks, which allows the company’s promoters to hold 20% in the combined entity. “It is concerning that the current terms of the Sony-Zee announcement gift additional 2% to the founding family via a non-compete that seems entirely unjustified, while also providing a pathway for them to raise stake from 4% to 20% via methods that remain wholly opaque.” Invesco further said since the EGM demand, Zee’s management and board have gone to great lengths to deny a basic shareholder right enshrined in Indian law. “A reckless and desperate public relations effort on the part of Zee’s founding family aims to deflect from the issues core to Zee.” It further said, “Zee needs a demarcation between the promoter family and the institution. Its board needs to be strengthened with independent directors who take their jobs seriously, who robustly debate vital decisions and who serve as guardians of all shareholder interests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zees-deal-with-sony-may-enrich-chandras-invesco/articleshow/86950608.cms||Reeba Zachariah

He also issued instructions that UT finance secretary will monthly review budget expenditure of all the departments and review it on quarterly basis. Pal said by till date they have utilised around 50% budget allotted by the Centre to the UT administration, which is quite good. The secretaries have been asked to review budget utilisation of their departments and specially of projects, which are related with the engineering departments, he said. The administration had recently sought Rs 202 crore more under the revised estimate from the central government, in which a sum of Rs 200 crore was asked for the municipal corporation (MC). Chandigarh was allocated Rs 5,186.12 crore against a demand of Rs 5,670 crore in the Union Budget for the financial year of 2021-22. The sum was an increase of only Rs 48.02 crore, a meagre 0.93%, as compared to Rs 5,138.10 crore received for the last financial year of 2020-2021. Out of the total given budget, the Centre had given Rs 4,567.67 crore under revenue and Rs 618.45 crore under capital head, up by Rs 124.31 crore, as it had got Rs 494.14 crore last time. The funds under capital are for development works, while those under revenue largely cater to expenditure of salaries and other recurring expenses. The ministry of finance of the central government had recently lifted the sealing of 20% on the budget. The cut was imposed on two quarters — April to June and July to September — due to the Covid-19 pandemic to restrict the expenditure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/review-expenditure-on-engg-projects-adviser-to-secy/articleshow/86948511.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The government admitted the situation was grim and it might get complicated in the coming weeks. The state had emerged as power surplus after bifurcation thanks to the presence of thermal power plants that could meet the entire demand. However, the situation slipped into crisis since the TDP government’s move to sign power purchase agreements with private solar and wind power players and the subsequent decision of the YSRC government to suspend the PPAs. Sajjala Ramakrisna Reddy, advisor to the state government, appealed to people to get ready to face power cuts due to severe shortage in coal supplies to thermal power stations. “The situation on the power generation front is really serious and we are making every possible effort to bail us out of the crisis. However, it does not appear to be an easy task,” said Sajjala on Monday. Power purchases in the open market have resulted in massive burden on power utilities in the state. Experts say the state government’s decision to depend on open market purchases in view of low prices during off-peak season has led to the crisis with sudden jump in market prices. The AP Transco had reduced power purchases from thermal plants and instead gone for spot purchases from power exchanges citing low costs. The Transco claimed it had saved over Rs 2,300 crore in the last fiscal through such dynamic purchases from the market. However, it resulted in the closure of several plants that could have been a dependable source unlike power exchanges that are facing severe fluctuations. The sudden jump in power prices in the exchanges has forced the Transco to again switch to thermal power stations. However, by the time it set its focus on generation from thermal plants, coal stocks were exhausted. “We can run the plant only when we have stocks for one week,” said Dr N Srikanth, CMD, Transco. He said the Transco has been purchasing nearly 30 to 40 million units of power from open sources at nearly Rs 15 per unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/power-cuts-start-in-rural-ap-urban-areas-may-soon-follow/articleshow/86947476.cms||Samdani MN

The National Medical Council (NMC) is yet to grant permission for the establishment of government medical colleges in Haveri, Chikkaballapur, Yadagir, and Chikkamagalur for the current academic year, despite the fact that the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) results will be released shortly.The main reasons for the delay in NMC granting permission are a lack of infrastructure and a delay in recruiting teaching faculty. People in the Haveri district expected the college to open this year, but they are now disappointed. According to sources, buildings for all four colleges are under construction. College authorities have made temporary arrangements at government buildings. The HIMS has set up classrooms at the government engineering college, and the other three colleges have taken over available buildings to run classes for the first batch.Meanwhile, none of the four colleges have finished the process of recruiting teaching faculty. Interestingly, two colleges are yet to hire directors and other clerical staff. This has significantly reduced the chances of the colleges receiving approval from the NMC to begin classes this year. If the four government medical colleges open this year, the number of medical seats in the state will increase to 600. “We have informed the NMC authorities that we will provide adequate facilities such as classrooms, furniture, and staff quarters. We hope that the NMC will grant permission to start colleges this year,” said Dr Uday Mulagund, special officer for HIMS. “We have made temporary arrangements for infrastructure to begin the academic year,” said Dr Ravishankar, secretary of medical education. “The hiring of teaching faculty is currently underway. We have already published a provisional list of teaching faculty for Chikkaballapur college. Recruitment process in Yadagir and Chikkamagalur colleges is going on. We're are working hard to get the colleges up and running this year,” he added.

With these three, now all eight municipal corporations of Gujarat including major cities of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar have 90% or more of the population covered with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccination. Cumulatively, 97% of the target population has got the first dose in these cities, which is much higher than the state average of 89%. Even for the second dose, against the state average of 44%, the urban areas account for 52% of the second jab – meaning half of those who have got the first shot also duly got the second shot. Having said this, there are over 83 lakh persons who have taken the first shot, are due for the second shot and have not taken the jab yet. The state immunization department has now focussed their attention on ensuring this population completes their two doses. "For people due for second shots who have not yet come forward, we are collaborating with the municipal corporations and district administration to call them up and guide them to their nearest vaccination booth,” said Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer, In all, Gujarat is second in India among major states with 89% of the population covered with the first shot and 44% with the second. Kerala at the first position has 93% and 43% coverage of first and second shots respectively. Overall, Himachal Pradesh has 100% population covered and Jammu & Kashmir 97% with the first jab, reveal the central government data. Gujarat has cumulatively vaccinated 6.5 crore persons for both first and second doses - joint third with Madhya Pradesh after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. The state has given impetus to maximum coverage of the target population ahead of the festive season to thwart the possible third wave. October has remained a month so far with relatively higher daily cases and four deaths in the first 11 days – one of the highest since July. Dr Jani said that they intend to cover the whole target population among the urban areas soon. “We are conducting camps at various localities, and also reaching out to the people during night hours. All cities have good response to the immunization with cities like Surat and Gandhinagar achieving 100% of the first dose,” he said. City-based medical practitioners said that with the wider coverage of vaccines in cities like Ahmedabad, not only the cases have reduced drastically, but also the severity of the infection which had proved fatal during the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covid-vaccination-three-guj-cities-cross-100-five-90/articleshow/86962379.cms||Parth Shastri

Police questioned the deceased woman Shobhana’s husband Tejas about the deaths, but so far no foul play has been found. Tejas works as a salesman at an electronics showroom at a mall on Alembic Road. The house where the mother and child were poisonedPreliminary examination during post-mortem, however, revealed that Shobhana and her daughter Kavya died due to poisoning. The duo was found unconscious when Tejas went to use the bathroom around 2 am. “The girl was sleeping upside down, so the man changed her sleeping position. But when the girl did not make any movement, he became suspicious and tried to wake up his wife up, but she also did not respond,” said assistant commissioner of police Bharat Rathod. Viscera samples of the deceased were sent for further investigationTejas then called his brothers-in-law who live on the lower floor of the same house. Shobhana’s brothers Shailendrasinh and Jitendra and his wife came to check. Jitendra’s wife, who had earlier worked as nurse, checked Shobhana’s pulse and blood pressure. Police said that Shobhana’s pulse rate was very low, so they immediately rushed her and Kavya to a nearby private hospital at Abhilasha Circle. The doctors, however, declared them dead before admission. Hospital authorities later informed police and the mother-daughter duo’s bodies were shifted to SSG Hospital for post-mortem examination. “There were some injury marks on the woman’s neck, but the doctors who did the post-mortem ruled out that she would have died because of strangulation,” said Rathod. Viscera samples of both deceased have been sent for further investigation. “The exact cause of death will be known once the viscera report arrives, but preliminarily it looks that they died of poisoning,” Rathod added. Police are now investigating whether Shobhana consumed the toxic substance and fed her daughter too or whether they were poisoned by someone else. Their family members have demanded that proper investigation of the case is done. “They had gone to the society’s common plot for garba and returned at midnight. My sister and niece wished me ‘good night’ before going upstairs to sleep and at that moment they seemed completely fine,” said Shailendrasinh Bariya, Shobhana’s brother. Tejas, Shobhana and Kavya had been living with Shobhana’s family for the past seven years. The trio had their bedroom on the fourth floor while the other family members used to live on the lower floors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mother-6-yr-old-girlfound-dead-in-house/articleshow/86948670.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Why are Ahmedabad roads still so bad? Gujarat HC asks AMC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday asked the AMC why the city’s roads continue to be in a bad shape even three years after the court’s directions to keep them in good repair. The bench of Justice Ashish Desai and Justice Nirzar Desai asked the AMC to state the details about road repairs and the situation with regard to controlling the cattle nuisance on public streets. “What types of steps are you taking to repair and resurface the roads and how much time will you take for the same?” the court said. “And also make a statement about management of cattle (on the streets).” The court sought a reply by October 22. The HC raised the query in response to a contempt of court application for the improper implementation of an earlier order for the upkeep of roads, smooth traffic movement, adequate parking facilities, and the removal of stray cattle from public streets. The final and detailed directions were issued in 2018. The petitioner’s advocate, Amit Panchal, complained that the civic body did not even bother to submit its bimonthly reports in time and the roads continued to be in a very bad state. This led the judges to question the civic body. “Three years have passed. Why are the roads in a similar situation in Ahmedabad?” the court said. “What do you propose about the road condition? What steps do you take every year before and after the monsoon?” The court also asked why the civic body requires the HC’s directions every year. On potholes and uneven patchwork on the roads, the judges commented that even if one drives a vehicle slowly, one will feel the judders. “There is no repair at all. Within two kilometres of a journey, there are such junctions,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/why-are-abad-roads-still-so-bad-hc-asks-amc/articleshow/86948824.cms||---

Meat traders are procuring animals from neighbouring Odisha to meet the demand as some people practise animal sacrifice during the festival. The price of sheep and goat, weighing between eight to 10 kilos, has gone up to between Rs 10,000 and Rs 12,000 per animal ahead of Dasara. It usually hovers around Rs 8,000 in normal days. During Dasara, the prices are expected to rise up to as much as Rs 15,000 per sheep or goat, depending on demand. The price of roosters has also increased by 30%, with roosters weighing two kilos selling for Rs 1,600 as against the normal price of Rs 1,230. This year, the demand for sheep is higher than that for goat. “We have sold some large sheep weighing 15 to 20 kg for Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000 on Sunday. We are expecting the price to climb further in the coming days,” said B Gopal, a shepherd. Dasara is a festival for foodies in most parts of the region. Animal sacrifice is practised in some places in Visakhapatnam district during the festival. Some vehicle owners and those who run machinery units perform animal (rooster or sheep/goats) sacrifice as a tradition and offer them to the goddess Durga as part of Ayudha puja. Compared to last year, the demand for sheep and goat meat has increased this year as Covid-19 cases have dipped. “We have decided to increase the price of mutton to Rs 900 from the existing Rs 800 per kg from October 15 till October 21 as the demand for meat will be high during Dasara. We are also procuring goats and sheep from Odisha. Price of country chicken will be around Rs 800 per kg during the festival,” said Sk Hussain, a meat trader at Madhurawada in Vizag city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/meat-prices-shoot-up-ahead-of-dasara/articleshow/86947355.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Patna||Doctors blame sedentary lifestyle for arthritis cases||PATNA: Sedentary lifestyle and changes in dietary habits have led to a sharp rise in the prevalence of arthritis in Bihar in recent times. Nearly 40% of the people, including a sizeable number of youths, are suffering from this disease, say leading medical practitioners. The most prevalent form of arthritis, osteoarthritis, has been affecting mostly women. Other common diseases of the joints affecting the elderly and the young alike are gout and rheumatoid arthritis, they say. An orthopaedic surgeon and former president of the Indian Orthopaedic Association (central zone), Dr Uday Krishna Jha, points out that at least one in three people in the state suffers from some type of joint problem. “Cases of total knee replacement in both men and women have increased abnormally in the last few years. The deficiency of calcium and Vitamin D are the main causative factors,” he adds. A gynaecologist, Dr Punam Raman, observes that in most adults, the level of calcium starts declining at the age of 30 and if adequate amounts of calcium along with Vitamin D are not supplemented, the chances of getting affected by arthritis increase. She suggests, “Women should take extra precautions after menopause because a sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits can be harmful.” Dr Satish Kumar of the medicine department at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital feels that a lack of awareness about arthritis among people aggravates the problem. The overuse or misuse of joints may lead to the development of arthritis even at a very young age. He claims that at least 10 people having arthritis seek medical advice from him every day. The former president of the Indian Medical Association, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, also feels that people suffer from arthritis mainly due to adoption of a sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activities. He advises people not to ignore early signs of the disease as diagnosis and treatment can save the joints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/doctors-blame-sedentary-lifestyle-for-arthritis-cases/articleshow/86946560.cms||B K Mishra

Police also recovered 9 cellphones, 3 countrymade pistols, 5 live cartridges, a car and a motorbike from their possession. Biharsharif sadar SDPO Shibli Nomani, who led the police team, said the arrested criminals had kidnapped Biharsharif businessman Brajesh Kumar from Khandakpar locality when he was returning home after closing his shop around 8.30pm on September 27 this year. They had kidnapped the businessman in a car and looted Rs1.5 lakh from him besides transferring Rs90,000 into the bank account of one Rishikesh Raj. They later dropped him from the car.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Fuel price hike weighs on RTC’s stressed revenues||VIJAYAWADA: As fuel prices continue to hit new highs, the financial burden on the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) is mounting. The state-run transport corporation has spent an additional Rs 15 crore in the past week alone, on account of the hike in fuel price. According to sources in the APSRTC, fuel prices have gone up by almost 50% since the last time ticket prices were hiked. The APSRTC increased ticket prices in December 2019, months after the YSRC came to power. The diesel price at the time hovered around Rs 70, while it now stands at Rs 103 in Vijayawada. While the Covid-19 pandemic severely affected revenues, the APSRTC did not feel the pinch of fuel price hike as it was operating limited services. Now, bus operations have returned to normalcy and are being operated at close to 100% capacity. But while bus services have been entirely restored, revenues did not increase along expected lines. Officials are of the opinion that public perception changed with Covid-19, impacting revenues, with more people opting for personal over public transport in fear of contracting the virus. The cash-starved APSRTC had hoped to generate some additional revenue from Dasara demand, but this too is being eaten away by the increase in fuel expenditure. Speaking to TOI, vice-chairman and managing director of APSRTC, Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao said while the continuous rise in fuel prices poses a problem, there is little the corporation can do about it. “We are trying to cope up with the situation by reducing costs and improving efficiency. We cannot increase ticket prices whenever there is a fuel price hike because it is a service that is offered to people. We are managing within our limits without increasing charges,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fuel-price-hike-weighs-on-rtcs-stressed-revenues/articleshow/86947328.cms||Srikanth Aluri

A meeting between Thackeray and Union minister for road transport Nitin Gadkari was held in Mumbai on Monday. Thackeray said permissions related to environment and forests, and pending land acquisition should be obtained faster to complete road projects in a timely manner. Pending highway projects like Mumbai-Goa, Ratnagiri-Kolhapur, Kolhapur-Kagal, Sangli-Solapur, Surat-Nashik-Ahmednagar and Ahmednagar-Solapur-Akkalkot, expressway projects like Vadodara-Mumbai and Pune-Ahmednagar-Aurangabad, and the Ahmednagar Bypass were discussed. A monthly review of these will be taken at the CM's level too. Gadkari suggested appointing retired IAS officers at the division level to ensure that problems which crop up can be sorted out at the earliest. “Since there are multiple road agencies carrying out these works, it was decided that a regular review will be taken by the chief secretary to expedite projects,” said a senior official. A suggestion was made to convert Mumbai-Goa Highway into a cement-concrete road keeping in mind heavy rains in the region. It is difficult to fill bad patches as asphalt gets watched away. Gadkari had written to Thackeray in August complaining about the stalling of road works by local Shiv Sainiks in Washim. Machinery had also been set on fire. Gadkari has asked Thackeray for his assistance to ensure that work is not stalled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cm-meets-gadkari-chief-secy-to-speed-up-road-work-in-mumbai/articleshow/86952475.cms||---

Accordingly, the remaining net transfer of money to be made to AAI is Rs215.32 crore, Jha added. Overall, the cabinet approved 12 proposals, cabinet secretariat department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar said.

Though puja pandals will open for the devotees on Tuesday (Saptami), many people visited these places on Monday to have a glimpse of the colourful lightings and decorations.  At Danapur cantonment, huge puja pandals have come up at a few places. Secretary of Surya Club at Mainpura, Ravi Pratap Singh, said volunteers of the puja committee will strictly ensure that devotees follow the Covid protocol. ‘Prasad’ will be distributed while maintaining social distancing norms, he said. The Nav Yuvak Sangh, Takiapar puja pandal, Macchua Toli and Friends’ Club in Danapur areas have made elaborate arrangements for devotees. But, waterlogging has dampened the puja spirits in Lal Kothi and Sultanpur areas. Khagual town, including the railway colony area, has been spruced up for the puja. Big to medium-sized ‘pandals’ have come up at several places. Over two dozen idols have been installed at important places in the town. Ghanshyam Girls’ School has been organising Durga Puja for the last 91 years as per Bengali culture, said its organisers. Old-timers recall how the school venue has been popular among devotees since the British period. Anglo-Indians enjoyed the puja celebration with equal élan. Medical Colony, Loco Colony, Jairam Bazar, Garikhana and Bari Bazar are the other centres of attraction for devotees in Khagaul. The puja samitis in Phulwarisharif area have decided to strictly adhere to Covid protocol in the pandals. Decorations have been made all along the Phulwari-Khagaul road. Phulwarisharif has been the centre of communal harmony as Hindus and Muslims celebrate it peacefully, said Subhash Narayan, president of Phulwari Durga Asthan Puja Samiti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/puja-pandals-in-khagaul-danapur-attract-people/articleshow/86946273.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Delhi||Corpns denied dues to sanitation staff: AAP||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday claimed that the BJP-led municipal corporations had not fulfilled the promises made to the sanitation workers like regularisation of jobs, medical facilities, etc, due to which there was a possibility of strike by them again in Delhi. The retired employees have not been given retirement benefits, including PF, even after two years, he said. In a press conference, the AAP functionary said that the sanitation workers had been protesting for the past few months. “In the last 5 years, the sanitation workers have had to go on very long strikes. In 2018, the then BJP Delhi president Manoj Tiwari had accepted all their demands and promised that the sanitation workers hired between 1998 and 2003 will be regularised. He had also promised the regularisation of sanitation workers who were hired on compassionate grounds after 2003,” said Bharadwaj. Bharadwaj further added not a single sanitation worker had been hired in the last 15-20 years. “Hiring has only been done on compassionate grounds. They have made this promise of regularisation of workers before every election and during every strike, but they still have not delivered on it,” he claimed. “The number of sanitation workers is already very low in Delhi. A large part of the MCD workers are working for BJP functionaries and municipal officials,” Bharadwaj said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said AAP functionaries were making baseless allegations to malign the municipal corporations. “The north corporation has regularised services of temporary workers who joined service till March 1998. Services records of sanitation workers who joined the north corporation till March 2003 have been verified and they will be regularised very soon,” said Kapoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-denied-dues-to-sanitation-staff-aap/articleshow/86950857.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Suicidal tendency in girls due to early marriage||PATNA: While the celebrating International Day of the Girl Child on Monday, a study shows female adolescents face more suicidal symptoms than males. Early marriage, marital dispute and pressure for dowry have been cited as some of the reasons behind such a situation. Suicide is one of the common causes of deaths for adolescent boys and girls. A study conducted by the Population Council of India with the support of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and David Lucil Packard Foundation in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in 2015-16 and 2018-19 and shared by Unicef showed that the burden of mental health issues was higher among girls than the boys. As per the study, marriage in adolescence, marital violence and dowry increased the likelihood of poor mental health conditions of girls. The data showed that suicide was the fourth common cause of death in adolescent boys between 15 and 19 years, while it was the third most common cause of death among girls in the same age group. A total of 10,433 boys and girls were interviewed during the study in 2015-16 and 8467 in 2018-19. While 4.9% of the unmarried girls faced suicidal symptom in 2015-16, the percentage increased to 11.5% in 2018-19. Similarly, 9.3% of the married girls faced suicidal symptom in 2015-16 and this increased to 14.1% in 2018-19. Among the unmarried boys, in 2015-16, 2.4% experienced suicidal tendencies, which increased to 5.4% in 2018-19. In boys, while employment and education related stress were the reasons, girls suffered from marital physical violence and dowry harassment. While 6% of the boys with symptoms of depressive disorders sought help from the experts, only 2% girls went for advice. Associate professor of psychiatry at NMCH, Dr Santosh Kumar, said pressure from the society is one of the reasons why women do not open about their issues. “Both the sexes have to understand that a girl needs equal share in everything, be it financial or social. Parents, or even the teachers, need to play an important role in listening to the female child or mothers should understand and give equal share to both girl and boy in everything,” said Dr Santosh, further adding that while a female hardly takes help of mental health experts as family thinks it to be stigma, even when they do, it becomes too late. Apart from mental health, more needs to be done on improving menstrual hygiene. Unicef Bihar head Nafisa Binte Shafique shared a data of National Family Health Survey-5 and stated that 58.8% of females in the age group of 15 to 24 years used hygienic methods during the menstrual cycle. However, she appreciated the initiatives like Mukhya Mantri Kanya Utthan Yojana in Bihar, under which every girl from class 6 to 8 receives Rs300 annually for sanitary absorbents. However, she stressed on the need to have more discussions on such issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/suicidal-tendency-in-girls-due-to-early-marriage/articleshow/86946405.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Overall, Himachal Pradesh has 100% population covered and Jammu & Kashmir 97% with the first jab, reveal the central government data. Gujarat has cumulatively vaccinated 6.5 crore persons for both first and second doses - joint third with Madhya Pradesh after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. The state has given impetus to maximum coverage of the target population ahead of the festive season to thwart the possible third wave. October has remained a month so far with relatively higher daily cases and four deaths in the first 11 days – one of the highest since July. Dr Jani said that they intend to cover the whole target population among the urban areas soon. “We are conducting camps at various localities, and also reaching out to the people during night hours. All cities have good response to the immunization with cities like Surat and Gandhinagar achieving 100% of the first dose,” he said. City-based medical practitioners said that with the wider coverage of vaccines in cities like Ahmedabad, not only the cases have reduced drastically, but also the severity of the infection which had proved fatal during the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/covid-vaccination-three-guj-cities-cross-100-five-90/articleshow/86962380.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Surat||Covid vaccination: Three Gujarat cities cross 100%, five 90%||AHMEDABAD: On Monday, Gujarat had three cities namely Surat, Gandhinagar and Junagadh which had 100% or more population covered with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccination. With these three, now all eight municipal corporations of Gujarat including major cities of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar have 90% or more of the population covered with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccination. Cumulatively, 97% of the target population has got the first dose in these cities, which is much higher than the state average of 89%. Even for the second dose, against the state average of 44%, the urban areas account for 52% of the second jab – meaning half of those who have got the first shot also duly got the second shot. Having said this, there are over 83 lakh persons who have taken the first shot, are due for the second shot and have not taken the jab yet. The state immunization department has now focussed their attention on ensuring this population completes their two doses. "For people due for second shots who have not yet come forward, we are collaborating with the municipal corporations and district administration to call them up and guide them to their nearest vaccination booth,” said Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer, In all, Gujarat is second in India among major states with 89% of the population covered with the first shot and 44% with the second.

---||Patna||Congress netas stage protest against L Kheri incident||PATNA: As a part of the Congress’s protest across the country against Lakhimpur Kheri incident, party leaders and workers in Patna also observed ‘maun vrat’ near Income Tax roundabout on Monday. They demanded the resignation of Union minister of state for home, Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son has been arrested in connection with the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. Congress’s Bihar in-charge, Bhakta Charan Das, who participated in the protest, criticized the NDA government for taking no action against Ajay Mishra. While interacting with the media, Das said the way the Centre was supporting Mishra despite his son's alleged involvement in the killings of farmers, proved that the NDA government had turned deaf and dumb. “Since this government cannot see and listen to anything, we have opted for ‘maun vrat’ to awaken it,” said Das. He appreciated the efforts of her party leader Priyanka Gandhi for her struggle and efforts in getting Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish, alias Monu, arrested. State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha also criticized the NDA government for allegedly supporting Ajay Mishra and his son. Several senior party leaders, including Ajit Sharma, Kaukab Qadri, Sameer Kumar Singh, Shyam Sunder Singh Dheeraj, Nikhil Kumar, Subodh Kant Sahay, Chandan Bagchi, Shakeel Ahmad, Prem Chandra Mishra and several party MLAs were present at the protest site. However, BJP’s OBC Morcha national general secretary Nikhil Anand criticized the Congress for unnecessarily raising a hue and cry to divert the attention from political chaos in Punjab and atrocities on Dalits in Rajasthan. “The incident of Lakhimpur is very unfortunate. The SIT, led by a DIG-rank officer, is investigating the case. The accused are booked and all those involved will be punished,” said Anand. Meanwhile, Congress leader Subodh Kant Sahay on Monday accused the NDA government of making undue favour to Amazon in return of bribe. Interacting with the media here, Sahay alleged that the NDA government at the Centre had changed policies for the American company in return of financial favour to the tune of around Rs8,500 crore. Sahay demanded a probe into this matter by a Supreme Court judge. “When Congress had approved 49% foreign direct investment, the BJP leaders used to shout and criticize. Now, they have increased it to 100%. Unemployment has increased and small businessmen and traders are facing the brunt of their policies,” Sahay alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congress-netas-stage-protest-against-l-kheri-incident/articleshow/86946849.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Dehradun||Justice Sanjaya Kumar Mishra takes oath as judge of U'khand HC||Nainital: Justice Sanjaya Kumar Mishra took oath as the judge of the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Monday. He was administered the oath of office by Chief Justice RS Chauhan in presence of HC judges. Justice Mishra is now the senior-most judge at the Uttarakhand HC, second only to the Chief Justice. He was recently transferred from the Orissa HC to Uttarakhand by the Supreme Court collegium. In 1987, he started his practice at the Bolangir district court after attaining a degree in Law from the University of Delhi’s Law Faculty. Later, in 1999, he cracked the recruitment exam for district judge and joined as additional district and sessions judge of Jeypore. Justice Mishra was elevated as a judge of the Orissa HC in October 2009. He served in the capacity for nearly 12 years before being transferred to Uttarakhand HC. The HC bar association also welcomed the new judge. Avtar Singh Rawat, the association’s president, told media persons that the arrival of Justice Mishra will help reduce the pendency of cases in the HC. “We all look forward to learning a lot from the intellect of Justice Mishra and hope that his arrival will help reduce the pendency of cases as well,” he said. With the arrival of Justice Mishra, Uttarakhand HC now has eight judges. However, three positions still remain vacant as the Uttarakhand HC has the sanctioned strength of 11 judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/justice-sanjaya-kumar-mishra-takes-oath-as-judge-of-ukhand-hc/articleshow/86946604.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Patna||‘Dhakis’ an indispensable part of Puja celebrations||PATNA: Even as Durga Puja celebrations in the city are getting modernized with the passage of time, ‘dhakis’ (drum beaters) continue to be a significant part of the festivities. In fact, the unique sound of ‘dhakis’ indicates the arrival of Goddess Durga at the Puja venues, mostly organized by the Bengali community. As soon as the idols are installed, ‘dhakis’ start beating ‘dhaks’ (drums). All this presents a spectacular sight and adds to the religious fervour. Old-timers say ‘dhakis’ have been performing their art right since Durga Puja celebrations started in Patna. And, needless to say, community Durga puja on a large scale was initiated by the Bengali population of the city in the mid-18th century. Today Durga Puja at the Bengali Akhara (Langartoli), Kali Bari (Yarpur), Marufganj (Patna City), Golghar , Boring Road, Bhikhna Pahari, Ramkrishna Mission Ashram (Nala Road), Adalatganj Maidan, and PWD Club (Chajju Bagh) is organized by committees dominated by Bengalis and the ‘dhak’ played. One can’t miss the sound of ‘dhak’ during the evening aarti. Sagar Bhattacharya of Chajju Bagh Sarbojanin Puja Committee says ‘dhakis’ are mostly called from West Bengal during Durga Puja. “As the Puja is being celebrated on a modest scale this year amid the Covid-19 pandemic, only three ‘dhakis’ have been called this time. All other pandals set up by the Bengali community have also hired ‘dhakis’ from the rural parts of Bankura, Bardhaman, Malda, Murshidabad, and Nadia in West Bengal,” he adds. Aryabhatta Knowledge University’s founder vice-chancellor Shambhu Nath Guha claims that ‘dhak’ is played to welcome Goddess Durga. The arrival of the goddess is announced by the priests amid the beating of ‘dhaks’. He continues, “Durga Puja does not assume the festive aura without the maddening beats of the ‘dhak’, the large drum that men hang around their necks and play with two thin sticks to infuse the frenzied rhythm into listeners.” Indologist Prabuddha Biswas says Bari Devi of Marufganj is the oldest surviving Durga Puja of more than 270 years followed by Chhoti Devi of Maharajganj initiated more than 170 years ago. Dalhatta Durga Puja near Purab Darwaza is also more than 150 years old. ‘Dhakis’ have been an indispensable part of the Puja celebrations all along.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dhakis-an-indispensable-part-of-puja-celebrations/articleshow/86946150.cms||B K Mishra

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC wants report on efforts to curb pollution in Narmada river||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has decided to continue with proceedings in the PIL seeking to halt pollution in the Narmada river after the petitioner passed away during the Covid-19 pandemic. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati appointed advocate Premal Joshi as amicus curiae in this case and asked the authorities to furnish details on the type of pollution caused in the river due to the discharge of untreated sewage from 11 cities and towns in Madhya Pradesh and other villages on the river bank in Gujarat. The court has sought to know developments with regard to pollution caused in the river. The petition was filed in 2017 by petitioner-advocate Kirtikumar Bhatt, citing an article in The Times of India highlighting how the Narmada is polluted in MP, where the river flow for nearly 1,100km before entering Gujarat. He demanded legal proceedings against MP and the local authorities who release sewage into Narmada for causing severe pollution, as well as against the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board also for failing to stop the release of untreated sewage into the river. He demanded measures to stop pollution of the river to avoid health hazards in Gujarat. The PIL states that the Narmada travels through 14 districts and 11 major towns are situated on its bank. Almost all these towns do not have sewage treatment plants and they release untreated sewage directly into the river. MP’s pollution control board has also filed cases against 18 municipal bodies located within 10km of the Narmada. The high court sought details from the Centre and the ministry of environment, forest and climate change submitted that certain directions were issued to 66 municipal authorities in metropolitan cities and state capitals to stop discharging untreated water into rivers. The high court was not content with the Centre’s reply and said that there was nothing on record about setting up of sewage treatment plants, their proper utilization and disposal of sewage generated in cities. Since July 2019, there was no development in the case. On Friday, the high court decided to carry the litigation forward and ordered the government to inform it about developments in this matter by October 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-wants-report-on-efforts-to-curb-pollution-in-narmada/articleshow/86950826.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh recommends complete ban on hookah bars on Punjab pattern||CHANDIGARH: The UT administrator’s advisory council committee on health has submitted progress report on banning hookah bars in the city to UT administrator Banwarilal Purohit. The report said, “The administration has recommended the banning of hookah bars in the city on the pattern of Punjab notification. Approval of the ministry of home affairs (MHA) is awaited”. A senior UT official said they are in touch with the MHA and constantly pushing for complete ban on hookah bars on the pattern of Punjab. Recently, the MHA had sought some clarifications from the administration. The TOI has reported that how bars in the city are continuously violating hookah ban orders in the city despite registration of FIRs and three-day sealing orders. In 2019, the administration had sought details like samples collected from these hookah bars in the past and the outcome of those sample testing. Besides, the report was also sought related to building bye-laws of those premises, from where these hookah bars are running in the city. Officials of the health department had submitted before the administration that smoking hookah was damaging the health of young people. Over the years, police and the health department officials have raided many hookah bars in the city together and even seized drugs that were being served to customers. In some cases, the teams found traces of nicotine in the samples of hookah tobacco, a dangerous combination. Punjab order In 2018, the Punjab government had decided to impose a permanent ban on hookah bars in the state instead of issuing temporary orders against them every two months. The proposed amendment was approved by the state assembly in March 2018 and later in November 2018 President Ram Nath Kovind had given assent to a Bill from the Punjab state to check use of tobacco. Punjab was the third state in the country after Gujarat and Maharashtra where hookah bars or lounges were banned through law. The President had given assent to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) (Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2018. The objective of bringing the law is to check the use of tobacco in various forms and prevent diseases caused by the use of tobacco products. UT issuing orders for 60 days In December last year, the UT had decided that violating clubs will be sealed for three days. The orders were issued under disaster management act, 2005. The UT administration and police department had even started lodging FIRs but despite these orders, clubs were seen continuously violating hookah ban orders. In 2021, a total of 16 cases have already been reported where the concerned Sub Divisional Magistrates (SDMs) and local police department sealed bars and cafes for serving hookah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-recommends-complete-ban-on-hookah-bars-on-punjab-pattern/articleshow/86948537.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Kolkata||After Calcutta HC vaccination directive, complexes bring back pushpanjali, sindur khela||KOLKATA: Several housing complexes are reintroducing Puja rituals like, pushpanjali and sindur khela, though they were initially kept out of the list this time, fearing the community activities might help spread the novel coronavirus. While many organizers have allowed the rituals, the participants have been divided into small groups and assigned particular time slots to ensure safety. The Calcutta high court, in an order on October 1, had declared that Durga Puja pandals should be off-limits for visitors. But it modified the order and on October 7, allowed people to enter pandals — including for rituals, like pushpanjali and sindur khela — if they were fully vaccinated against Covid. This order is meant for baroari Pujas. Going by the earlier order, it was decided that housing complex residents would listen to the anjali mantras on the microphones from their homes or follow the priest live on social media pages and offer anjalis at home. This was supposed to be a repeat of last year’s practice, adopted for Covid safety. Residents had also agreed to it and the complexes had planned that only a few designated residents would enter the pandals. But after the HC modified the norm—albeit the directive is for baroari Pujas—many complexes complexes have decided to include residents in the rituals, but after taking permission from the authorities and following safety measures. Most complexes have decided that 15 people will be allowed to enter the pandals at a time for anjali and sindur khela. “We will go on repeating anjali so that all interested residents can take part. We have a sprawling pandal and there will be no question of overcrowding. Some people would want to stay back at home and follow the anjali on the social media page,” said Manoj Gupta, secretary of South City Residency. In some complexes, such as Siddha Pines, coupons bearing time slots are being distributed among residents. “We will have 20 residents per slot. They will not be allowed to bring flowers. All flowers will be sanitised here,” said president Manav Mehra. For sindur khela, only two women will be allowed on stage at a time. The organising committee at Silver Spring is also dividing residents in batches for both anjali and sindur khela, says secretary Indranil Chowdhury. The scene was similar at Upohar Housing Complex. “We will hold several sessions of anjali and sindur khela, following the HC order. We will ensure social distancing during anjali. It will be a tough job for the organisers but has to be done,” said resident Sudeep Ganguly. At Modello High, Kamalgazi, residents have been divided into batches and have been told to bring their own flowers. But they will have to carry the flowers back after anjali is over. sindur khela would be restricted to three families at a time, said co-ordinator Joydeep Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-hc-vax-directive-complexes-bring-back-anjali-sindur-khela/articleshow/86948545.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

While a 40-year-old woman from Ghatlodia was abducted and raped by her online friend in one case, a 20-year-old from Ranip was illegally confined and raped by her husband’s contractor in the other case. In the first complaint filed with Ghatlodia police, the victim, who is a teacher with a private school, had come in contact with Rupesh Patel, 33, from Vastral through Facebook around eight months ago. They shared their phone numbers and began chatting with each other. “Patel asked the woman to enter into a relationship with him, but she refused. Angered by this, he asked her to meet him. She agreed. Patel then abducted her and raped her at a commercial complex in Vastral. He later dropped her near her house,” stated the complaint she filed against Patel. Ghatlodia police arrested Patel and produced him before a local court on Monday. In the second case, the 20-year-old victim said that her husband drove a garbage collection vehicle for AMC. She alleged that his supervisor Ramu Munia with help from his female friend Sumitra Bhabhor, raped her on September 11. She said that Bhabhor, who is her neighbour in Ranip, called her on the morning of September 11 morning and took her to Munia. “When she entered a room in Bhabhor’s house, Munia was waiting for her there. Bhabhor left the room and locked it from the outside. Munia raped her while threatening to fire her husband and kill her child,” the complaint stated. After the incident, she went to her native place in Dahod and fell into depression. After some relatives enquired about her condition, she told them about the rape. Later, she filed a complaint of rape against Munia and Bhabhor.

CBI alleged that the accused entered into a criminal conspiracy to cheat a consortium of banks, including State Bank of India, between 2009-17. The accused convinced banks to enhance their credit facility during the period after manipulating records and defaulted on loan payments. CBI alleged that the accused diverted the loan money through fictitious transactions. CBI collected digital records and other documents for examination during the search. CBI is also investigating some bank officials’ role in the case. TIISL has its registered office at Andheri (E) and its corporate offices at Navi Mumbai, Bengaluru and US.

---||Ahmedabad||AMC to seek details of large liquidated properties||Ahmedabad: Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) revenue department has decided to seek details of large liquidated properties whose municipal taxes are pending. The revenue committee of AMC will approach the official liquidator for a list of such properties and request the liquidator to pay the pending amounts as quickly as possible. “Whenever large firms that have properties such as mill compounds, factories go into liquidation and are sold, the official liquidator has to calculate the due taxes of such properties and pay it to the civic body. We have decided to approach the official liquidator for a list of such properties whose taxes are yet to be paid to the civic body,” said Jainik Vakil, chairman of AMC’s revenue committee. The revenue committee has also suggested that before granting any contracts to any firms, AMC’s various departments should check whether they have any civic taxes due. “We will ask various civic body departments such as administration, engineering, technical, health, AMTS, VS hospital, Municipal School Board, MJ Library, SRFDCL, Janmarg Ltd and others to select only those firms who have paid their taxes. We will also ask these departments to ensure that the firms selected for various works for the civic body pay their past dues,” Vakil said. Vakil said that the revenue department officials have been asked to speed up clearance of various complaints. The department received a total of 5,399 complaints during April 1 to August 8. “Of the total complaints received, only 1,803 complaints are yet to be cleared. The remaining are either cleared or are in various stages of clearance process,” Vakil said. Box Vehicle tax collection rises by 122% Revenue department data showed that the civic body’s vehicle tax collection in the period from April 1 to October 10 this year stood at Rs 60 crore, up Rs 33 crore or 122% from the tax collected last year in the same period. AMC collected Rs 90 crore in the above mentioned period this year, up 16% from the same period last year. The civic body’s total tax collection from April 1 to October 10 stood at Rs 693 crore including Rs 536 crore collected as property tax.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-to-seek-details-of-large-liquidated-properties/articleshow/86950858.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Lack of sufficient Plus One seats: Opposition in Kerala walks out of House||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The opposition protested and walked out of the assembly on Monday, alleging that the government is not serious about thousands of students left without getting a Plus One seat, even after they have scored A-Plus in all subjects. The government’s assurance that it would ensure seats to all students, was not enough to pacify the opposition members. Raising the matter as submission, opposition leader V D Satheesan said that despite raising the matter in the assembly three times, the government is sticking to the same stereotypical answer using some numbers. “More than 10,000 students are left out without any seats for Plus One course even after the completion of the second allotment,” he said. He said that the minister had earlier claimed that 33,119 seats would be vacant in the state. If that was so, how would more than 10,000 students be left out without any seats being allotted to them, he asked. He added that the government’s attitude seems to be that the students should go to private institutions, management seats or open schools. Countering the opposition’s claims, general education minister V Sivankutty said that the opposition has brought the issue with a political motive. “The process relating to the second allotment will be completed only by October 23. The number of seats are surplus if taken on a state-wide basis. However, to address the shortage, the government has asked the officials to take the taluk-wise shortage of seats. Once it is received, the government will see to it that all students get an opportunity for higher studies,” he said. However, the minister said that since the number of students who got A-Plus in all the subjects are high, all of them need not get the subjects of their choice in the school of their preference. Unconvinced by the assurances and demanding that the government should increase the number of batches, the opposition staged a walk out from the assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/plus-one-oppn-walks-out-of-house/articleshow/86948568.cms||---

At least 11 pandals in the city will be under special police protection that will go beyond crowd management and anti-terror drills. These cops will be guarding the costly ornaments adorning the idols of Maa Durga and her children from possible thefts. While the local police will be providing the essential backup support to these teams, officers and men deputed from the armed police, detective department, the STF and the Special Branch will be actually forming these crack teams. Though no one from outside is being allowed near the idol this year after the High Court order, the main challenge for cops is during the many rituals when a lot of people are inside the bigger pandals. While huge pandals like Santosh Mitra Square will have as many as four cops exclusively to protect these ornaments, others like New Garia Cooperative Durgotsav will have two each. At least two of the officers at Santosh Mitra Square and one at Taltala Sarbojonin will be armed with a sub-inspector in-charge of the task. “The force will perform duty round-the-clock in two shifts at the places, dates and time noted against each,” an order from Kolkata Police stated. The police will also lead a huge posse of private security guards - who have been especially hired to protect the idols at these places - and ensure that the surveillance continues 24X7. Lalbazar said the deployment was initiated only after help was sought from Kolkata Police by the organizers and a ground analysis of the requirements. All deployments have been made between Chaturthi and Sasthi. The arrangement will be withdrawn between October 15-17 or after immersions, whichever comes earlier. A joint commissioner said the deployment was completed keeping in mind the history of crowd response to that particular puja in the past few years. “Since we are using two shifts and will need a sufficient number of personnel, we have taken personnel mainly from the armed police and the specialized sections. The divisional teams will be busy with the crowd access controls. These specialists will be reporting directly to the area OC each day. We have drawn up different schedules for different pandals,” he said. Among the bigger organizers who have been provided security within the pandal (besides Santosh Mitra Square) are Ekdalia Evergreen, Ahiritola Sarbojonin, Maddox Square, Badamtala Asar Sangha and Taltala Sarbojonin. “We have our sponsors and we are taking care of the ornaments.

---||Patna||Bihar not getting required amount of electricity: CM||PATNA: Contrary to Union power minister Raj Kumar Singh’s claim that there was no power crisis in the country due to coal shortage, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Monday said the state was not getting whatever electricity is provisioned from the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and that there was a “problem in supply of required quantity of electricity to the state”. Responding to a media query over “power crisis” due to the coal shortage, Nitish said, “It is true there is a problem. It is a reality that we (Bihar) are not getting whatever electricity is provisioned from the NTPC and other power generating companies. There are some reasons due to which such a situation has arisen. It’s not only in Bihar, it’s everywhere.” Nitish said he enquired about the current status of power supply in the state from the energy department officials on Monday. “The officials told me that electricity is not being supplied as per the requirements of the state. They are purchasing electricity at a higher rate from other companies to maintain supply in the state. Despite the crisis, the state’s energy department is prompt in bringing the supply situation to its normal level by purchasing electricity at a higher rate from the companies outside the power purchase agreements.” The CM added Bihar purchased around 570 lakh units of electricity from the power exchange in the last five days at the cost of Rs 90 crore. He said currently 5,500 to 5,600 MW electricity was being made available for the consumers in Bihar after purchasing the same at a higher rate. “We have to spend more money because of the purchase of electricity from the companies outside the power purchase agreements,” Nitish said. Earlier on Sunday, Union power minister had said in New Delhi that there was enough coal for power production in the country. Responding to another query, Nitish said ever since the people of Bihar gave him an opportunity to serve the state, he started working to improve availability of electricity. “In the initial years, many steps were taken to improve the situation in the existing power plants. Later, new power plants were set up. The state government then handed over all its power plants to the NTPC through an agreement. There is no power generating plant under the Bihar government now,” Nitish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-not-getting-required-amount-of-electricity-cm/articleshow/86948587.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Nagpur||After suffering for 5 years, techie gets full mouth rehab||Nagpur: Akash (name changed), a software professional working in Pune, had difficulty in chewing and compromised aesthetics for the last five years. The 35-year-old’s dream of moving to the United States (USA) was put on hold as he suffered from a rare genetic disorder — mobility of teeth due to generalized chronic aggressive periodontitis. The condition, also called pyorrhoea, leads to bacterial infection in gums and jaw bones, resulting in loosening of teeth. Now, five years down the line, Akash sports a broad smile and is all set to fly to USA after a full mouth rehabilitation by oral and maxillofacial surgeon Dr Vipin Dehane. “Covid-induced restrictions and the patient testing positive a day before the dental surgery in September last year again threatened to delay the treatment. Yet, we took the risk and moved ahead with the plan to fix 17 implants on his lower and upper jaws — consisting of 28 zirconia crowned teeth — and succeeded,” said Dr Dehane. In the post-Covid infection phase, healing potential is delayed and chances of dry socket in oral cavity increased. Use of multiple steroids also increases the chances of superinfection due to low immunity. Dehane, who is the director of Apple Dental Clinic and Facial Surgery Unit in Nagpur, said, “For the last five years, the software engineer was getting his dental ailment treated but was not getting any relief. He had a bridge fixed on the maxillary and mandibular teeth but still was unable to chew properly due to mobility in the teeth.” Finally, the techie decided to get artificial teeth with dental implants. Dehane preferred to perform both, removal of mobile teeth and fixing implants in the same surgery. “This saved the patient from fear of hospitalization amid Covid peak, since he had tested positive” he said. The software engineer said, “I was a bit scared about the surgery. I sought several opinions. The first Covid wave was going on. Late September, I got infected and was hospitalized for 15 days. Dr Dehane asked me to wait for the effects of steroids and other medicines to subside. All this while, I was unable to chew. In November first week, he did the first implant.” Subsequently, other implants were also placed. Akash said the healing was good, but he had to wait for six months after implants were fixed to get his mouth examined again. And now in the first week of October, he got his new set of dentition, gifted by Dr Dehane. Akash added, “I am fortunate. It was a long-drawn procedure but I am happy to have my smile back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-suffering-for-5-years-techie-gets-full-mouth-rehab/articleshow/86948701.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Delhi||Open schools for junior kids for 2 days/week: Child panel writes to Delhi LG Anil Baijal||NEW DELHI: Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) chairperson Anurag Kundu has written a letter to LG Anil Baijal requesting him to open schools for nursery to Class VIII for all children for at least two days a week in a staggered manner. He also urged Baijal, who is the chairperson of Delhi Disaster Management Authority, to open anganwadi centres for children at least once a week. Nearly 65 parents had written to DCPCR for the opening of schools. Kundu in his letter suggested that random testing of children and staff should be conducted at schools and anganwadi centres to ensure the infection spread, if any, is immediately identified and contained. Children not attending schools cannot keep themselves safe since the adults are moving and returning home, and Indian Council of Medical Research has recommended the opening of schools, he stated. Claiming that closure of schools can impact social, physical and mental health of children and online education has its limitations, Kundu cited a study by Azim Premji University that more than 80% teachers expressed inability to emotionally connect with children and vice versa. He mentioned another UNICEF study that nearly one-third parents reported that their child’s social and emotional health has deteriorated. He also claimed that the pandemic has caused serious learning losses for children of all grades. Drawing attention to anganwadi centres, Kundu said in the letter, “They were the first institutions to be closed for all the right reasons. However, unfortunately, the routine immunisation of children is perhaps the worst casualty. Nearly 64,000 children less have been fully immunised in 2020-21 compared to 2019-20. This was already nearly 50,000 less compared to data of the registration of children’s births. Growth monitoring of the children has been a compromised function.” He added the closure of anganwadi has become problematic as cognitive development happens only till age of 6 years, therefore, early childhood education becomes more crucial than even secondary schooling. Some parents have demanded that weekly school visits for limited activities should be allowed for all classes up to Class VIII. In their letter to LG, CM and DCPCR, they said, “Schools in Delhi for younger children (up to Class 8) have been closed for over 550 days. Apart from learning loss, extended school closure is causing immense harm to physical and mental health, especially in the early years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/open-schools-for-junior-kids-for-2-days/wk-child-panel-writes-to-lg/articleshow/86950936.cms||---

The decision has been taken in the wake of the online classes going on in the state. Vijayan will convene a high-level meeting on October 19 to review the situation. After the meeting, power minister K Krishnankutty said it has been decided to purchase 300MW power from outside to cover up the shortage. He said if 300MW can be obtained from outside, then the state can go without load shedding till October 19. For purchasing this power, the state will need Rs 2 crore per day. In the meeting, it was decided that the state government would support the KSEB to purchase this power which comes at a higher price. However, the minister said if the power shortage goes above 400MW, then it would create a severe crisis. At present, of the 3,800MW power required for the state, 1,900MW is being received from the central pool. Now shortage is being faced in this pool as we are not getting the 1,900MW from the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-load-shedding-in-state-till-oct-19/articleshow/86948603.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Metro Railway sets up RPF booths, beefs security in Kolkata for Puja days||KOLKATA: Metro Railway has beefed up security for the Puja days with RPF assistance booths, quick response teams and women personnel on board the trains. On Monday, Metro general manager Manoj Joshi reviewed the security arrangements which will be in place from Saptami to Dashami and advised officials to be ready with additional services to meet extra rush during the Puja days. The 32-km North-South Metro, which is Kolkata’s lifeline, will have 204 services running between 10am and 11pm from Saptami to Navami. Last year, Metro ran only 64 trains from 10am till 9pm from Saptami till Dashami. Line 2 or the East-West Metro, which operates 7 kms from Sector V till Phoolbagan, will have 60 services instead of the usual 48 during the Puja days. On Panchami, Metro ran 132 services instead of its usual 120 Sunday services along Line 1. “To ensure passenger safety, several Metro stations will have RPF assistance booths on Puja days,” a Metro spokesperson said. These stations are the ones that register high footfall; RPF personnel will be manning special security booths from 10am to 11pm at Dakshineswar, Dum Dum, Sovabazar-Sutanuti, Central, Jatin Das Park, Kalighat, Rabindra Sarobar and Gitanjali stations. Five quick response teams (QRT) and quite a few disaster management teams will be deployed at different stations to tackle emergency. Women RPF teams will be on board the trains and inside stations for women and children. The teams will especially focus on complaints against eve-teasing. Random train escorting will also be conducted. There will be anti-sabotage checks with sniffer dogs and security gadgets, especially after the state internal security wing has advised higher alertness during the Puja days. TOI had reported about such a missive issued by the state home department on Thursday. On Friday, Metro Railway drew up an elaborate security bandobast for the Puja days. Apart from security, there will be medical booths in Dum Dum, Sovabazar-Sutanuti and Kalighat stations. “Also, technical staff and other personnel have been assigned to provide guidance to commuters, especially to women and children,” the Metro spokesperson said Until 2019, Metro Railway ran services till 4am during the Durga Puja days. Just before Pujas last year, the high court had ordered not to allow crowds near the pandals and Metro Railway dropped the all-night special services between Saptami and Dashami for pandal-hoppers. This year, the Mamata Banerjee government extended Covid-19 curbs till October 30, but lifted the night curfew for the Puja days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-sets-up-rpf-booths-beefs-security-for-puja-days/articleshow/86948661.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Replying to a submission in this regard by MLA M K Muneer, the minister said that once the e-way bill is introduced, it will ensure transparency. He said that if any of the officials are found causing unnecessary trouble to the gold merchants, the government will take strict action against them. Raising the matter, Muneer said that after incidents like gold smuggling came to light, the gold jewellery merchants are seen as if all of them are trading illegally. He said that because of the issues in the GST structure, the traders are facing several difficulties. He said that Kerala is the only state where the cases relating to value-added tax (VAT) dues are still pending in courts. The calculation of the dues, that runs into crores of rupees against many of the traders, are nonjustifiable, he said. The minister said that the government has also introduced a one-time settlement scheme to dispose of the pending cases regarding dues in VAT that prevailed before the introduction of the GST.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-legal-gold-traders-will-be-harassed-balagopal/articleshow/86948647.cms||---

According to police, the incident took place within a span of few seconds after the deceased — Sidharth Hiwrale, a resident of Mathuranagar in Cidco N-6 of New Aurangabad — arrived at the counter of the liquor shop.

This is the second raid on tiger poachers in the last five days. On October 7, a sarpanch and a scooter mechanic were arrested for trading tiger cub’s body parts. Acting on a tip-off, the trap was laid by a team led by ACF Narendra Chandewar near Haladgaon toll booth on Nagpur-Wardha Road. The tiger is said to be killed in Umarda in Yavatmal division in March 2018. The accused have been identified as Prakash Koli (Kamatdev), Prakash Raut (Warud), Sandeep Rangari (Wardha), Ankush Naikwade (Icholi) in Yavatmal district and Vinod Moon (Sawla), Vivek Misal (Anjangaon), and Yogesh Milmile (Warud) from Amravati district. All have been remanded in forest custody till October 14. “We had information that the accused were coming to Nagpur to strike a deal for tiger body parts in an SUV MH-44B-5152. As the vehicle reached the toll booth, we stopped it and during a check tiger canines and whiskers were seized,” said deputy conservator Bharat Singh Hada. “We are also finding out if the accused were involved in poaching the tiger or were just dealing in tiger body parts. During interrogation, these accused said they removed the body parts of the dead tiger. We are not ready to believe it and our team is on a hunt of other accused,” said investigating officials. Wildlife conservationists said Butibori has suddenly emerged on the wildlife trade map in a big way. The recent spate of cases, all involving tiger parts, has a common pattern. “All the tigers were killed far away from Butibori and all seizures were done while in transit where the contraband was being taken to the buyers. Who are these so-called buyers? If it is a big racket then the government should hand over all these cases to CBI to find out who is behind them,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/7-from-amravati-yavatmal-held-trying-to-sell-tiger-body-parts/articleshow/86948792.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The buoy, which had been moored north of Lakshadweep, was one of the 12 buoys deployed by NIOT in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The agency had stopped receiving signals from the buoy from July onwards. Fishermen spotted the buoy near Chettuva on October 5 and near Parappanangadi in Malappuram on October 8 and Velliyamkallu near Kozhikode on October 9. A team of fishermen from Malappuram had posted a video over social media standing atop the drifting buoy recently. Police have traced the fishermen hailing from Tanur who had found the buoy while on a fishing trip. Two NIOT officials are currently in the state to find the buoy. An official said that the buoy was moving northward and was last seen by fishermen off the Kannur coast on Sunday. NIOT officials said that the buoy was moving northward at a speed of one knot, and it was expected to be seen in the coastal waters of Kasaragod on Monday. They have urged the fishermen to bring the buoy to the coast if they spot it in the water and have promised to pay the expenses involved. The buoy has an array of sensors and onboard systems which are used to transmit meteorological data and has helped in tracing the recent Cyclone Tauktae. The floating buoy has a diameter of three metres and was anchored to the seabed in the deep sea at a depth of 4,000 metres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/efforts-on-to-trace-missing-buoy-in-arabian-sea/articleshow/86948809.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Illegal sale of biodiesel on rise across Marathwada||Aurangabad: A spate of incidents regarding illegal sale of biodiesel has surfaced in Aurangabad and parts of Marathwada with such unauthorised sale being attributed by the stakeholders to the rise in diesel prices. Fuel retailers along with the biodiesel suppliers have cautioned that the biodiesel supplied illegally is not the specified B100 quality and can damage vehicle engines. Aqeel Abbas, secretary of local Petroleum Dealers Association (PDA), said a section of transporters engaged in long-distance travelling were more vulnerable to buying biodiesel sold in an unauthorised manner. “Many transporters and public at large do not know that they are purchasing the biodiesel at an unauthorised outlet. While the lower prices of biodiesel attract them, substandard quality could cause potential, irreversible damage to the vehicles,” he said. After breaching the Rs 100-mark on October 5, diesel price on Monday soared to Rs 102.32 per litre in Aurangabad that witnesses levying of 3% of beautification tax on the sale of fuel concerned. Diesel was sold at Rs 101.85 per litre and Rs 101.65 per litre in Parbhani and Nanded, respectively. Padmnabh Ursal, a fuel outlet consultant who used to run a biodiesel pump at Palshi in Aurangabad, said considerable difference in the price of biodiesel when compared to diesel is an indication of adulteration of the former. “The substandard quality of biodiesel is often found being sold in the black market at cheaper rates offering considerable price difference of up to Rs 20 or more when compared to diesel. The biodiesel available at authorized outlets could cost only around Rs 5 to Rs 7 cheaper,” he said. Fuel retailers said used industrial oil and light diesel oil are used for adulteration of pure biodiesel. Amid crackdown against unauthorised sale of biodiesel, Nanded district administration is first from Marathwada to take note of such sale following complaints from fuel retailers. Asking for strict compliance with theBiodiesel (manufacturing, storage, supply, selling) Policy 2021 of the state government, Nanded district administration has warned of action under Essential Commodities Act, 1955, if illegal sale of biodiesel is exposed. In one of the recent actions, Aurangabad police on September 14 detained three people for illegal sale of biodiesel with seizure of 16,000 litre of fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/illegal-sale-of-biodiesel-on-rise-across-marathwada/articleshow/86942411.cms||Prasad Joshi

The ABVP members had a heated argument with cops who stopped a garba event on VNSGU campus. The ABVP members pushed the cops when they asked the student outfit members to ensure that the norms of social distancing are followed during the garba event. The permission to organize the event was granted upto 7 pm but the garba continued after the time limit. Following the arguments, additional police force was called in. A few members of ABVP were detained for obstructing police from performing duty. Student wing members created disturbance when police tried to detain those involved in an argument with cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/abvp-stages-protest-at-police-station/articleshow/86946982.cms||---

During the protest at Azad Maidan, former union finance minister P Chidambaram met the striking workers where he asked about the number of contract workers, the number of buses plying in Goa and the concerns of the workers. The workers held a token-one day hunger strike to press for their demands. “The seventh pay has been implemented for the regularised staff, but the 7th pay arrears are still pending. The services and benefits that the Kadamba workers union has demanded, have not been agreed upon by KTCL,” said All India Trade Union Congress – Goa general secretary Christopher Fonseca. “We show solidarity with you and we wish you well,” said Chidambaram after briefly interacting with Fonseca.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kadamba-workers-go-on-hunger-strike/articleshow/86948802.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Bandh in Vid: Strong response in rural, mixed in urban areas||Nagpur: The Maharashtra bandh called to protest against the Lakhimpur Kheri incident received mixed response in Vidarbha. In some districts, a strong impact was seen in rural areas while shopkeepers in urban areas, who are still reeling from the economic fallout of the pandemic, managed to find a fine balance. Though the bandh call was supported by all constituents of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), Shiv Sena was clearly seen taking the lead. MLC Dushyant Chaturvedi, Sena’s Nagpur sampark pramukh, said, “The bandh was definitely a success and it’s because of support from the people. We witnessed that there was anger among citizens over the Lakhimpur tragedy, hence we did not have to put in extra efforts as the people were with us.” NCP and Congress workers too claimed that the bandh was a “success” in Nagpur. BJP, however, clamied that the band was a failure with almost everything in Nagpur being open. Senior party leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said, “This bandh call has fallen flat on its face, with zero support in Vidarbha. This government does not even have the moral authority to protest in favour of farmers, because they have not done anything for the farmers in our state.” According to the police, around six offences have been registered against the protestors, including those in Hingna, Sitabuldi and Sakkardara. In Wardha, the bandh received a positive response in early part of the day, but by afternoon the shops opened up. In rural areas of the district, the there was a much better response, specifically in Selu tehsil. The Hinganghat Agricultural Produce Market Committee, considered to be the largest market committee in Vidarbha, was closed. Also the market committees at Selu, Wardha, Karanja and Deoli were closed. Farmers also responded well to the bandh. In Chandrapur too, the bandh call received a good response. With rallies of Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP making rounds in the city, there was total bandh in the city till evening. Functioning of emergency services, government offices and banks however remained normal. Apart from couple of incidents of violence, the bandh remained peaceful in the district. A band of Shiv Sena activists moving around to ensure bandh, resorted to violence at a Shiv Bhojan Thali outlet after they found it functioning despite bandh call. They broke the window panes, tables and chairs, while throwing away the meal prepared for poor people. In yet another incident in Ballarpur, a shopkeeper who refused to close down his shop was chased away by angry Congress workers. He was rescued by the cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bandh-in-vid-strong-response-in-rural-mixed-in-urban-areas/articleshow/86948843.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Jaipur||BJP is playing politics on REET exam: Dotasra||Jaipur: It was a day of protest in the city. While the Congress party organised silent protest at Civil Lines Railway crossing seeking the resignation of Union minister Ajay Mishra in the Lakhimpur Kheri farmers death, the BJP Yuva Morcha took out protest over irregularities in REET exam. Many leaders including Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, government chief whip Mahesh Joshi attended the silent fast by Congress. The Congress decided to launch a nationwide campaign demanding the resignation of Ajay Mishra. Congress leaders observed a three-hour silence from 10am to 1pm at the Civil Lines gate. Dotasra later said it is a shame that the Union minister is still in office and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah are maintaining a stoic silence on the issue. Dotasra, while responding to BJP demand for a CBI probe into REET -2021, said the main accused has been arrested and the truth will come out soon. Following the arrest of the mastermind of paper leak in the REET recruitment examination case, education minister Govind Singh Dotasra said that this government will not spare anyone guilty of REET question paper leak. He alleged that BJP is only playing politics on this issue. “Batti Lal has been arrested. Let the inquiry take place, the truth will come out.” Even after the investigation of this entire episode, if anything remains, then the avenues of CBI investigation are open, but the Congress government will not allow the BJP to play with the future of the youth, he said. He said there was complete transparency in the examination. Rajasthan’s arrangements have been appreciated all over the country, but if there is disturbance in any one centre then it is wrong to question the entire examination, he said. Dotasra while taking a dig at BJP chief Satish Poonia said finally Poonia has come out of the office for dharna by BJYM. He said, “SOG is investigating this entire episode. Let there be a complete investigation, let the truth come out, even after that if any doubt remains, then the government is completely sensitive about this issue. But the Congress will not allow the BJP to play politics on this issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-is-playing-politics-on-reet-exam-dotasra/articleshow/86951093.cms||---

Chidambaram also said that Congress has learnt its lessons from the 2017 post poll debacle and does not want to repeat the same situation again. “Whoever wins Goa will win the Parliament election. We won the Goa election in 2007, and in 2009 we won the Parliament election. In 2012 we lost the Goa election and in 2014 we lost the Parliament election.

The two projects will be taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 4 crore for five years, said PBP director HJ Bhandary. Bhandary told TOI, “The park has received two conservation breeding projects this year. While conservation of the Malabar giant squirrel is being taken up for the first time, the Zoo Authority has noticed the success of the captive breeding of king cobras and has again granted permission for conservation captive breeding. In 2010, for the first time in the country, captive breeding of king cobras was undertaken and more than 100 king cobras were bred. While some of the king cobras were sent to zoos across India as part of the animal exchange programme, there were many that were released in the wild.” Currently, the park has about 15 king cobras and three giant squirrels, he said. The Indian giant squirrel, also known as Malabar giant squirrel, is a large species of tree squirrel and is an endangered species. It is the biggest squirrel of India and a Western Ghat species. A population decline due to habitat loss forced the zoo authority to introduce this programme. The authority selects species for breeding based on several factors including what suits the place. Since the giant squirrel is a Western Ghat species, Pilikula was probably selected for the project, an officer said. “Endangered species are selected for breeding projects. Once the breeding is successful and we get sufficient numbers, they are sent to various Indian zoos mostly under the animal exchange programme. Once there are sufficient numbers, a few of them are also released in the wild. Those that have been selected to be released in the wild, will be kept in less human contact,” an officer said. Pilikula has around 1,300 mammals, reptiles and birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/giant-squirrel-breeding-to-be-taken-up-at-pilikula/articleshow/86947360.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Patna||JP anniv: Tej holds march, says none can remove him from RJD||PATNA: Former CM Lalu Prasad’s elder son and Hasanpur MLA Tej Pratap on Monday said no one could remove him from the RJD. Tej, who took out a march to mark Jayaprakash Narayan’s birth anniversary, said, “This march is against corruption, unemployment and poor education system in the state.” He said those trying to lock horns with God’s flute (symbol of his newly floated student wing) and devotee of Lord Krishna would be destroyed. He, however, claimed all was well in Lalu family. Asked about rumours of his rift with younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Tej said, “My fight is against Nitish Kumar, RSS and Bajrang Dal.” In a veiled attack on RJD’s national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari, Tej described the latter as an “RSS agent”. It was Tiwari who had earlier claimed that Tej had disassociated himself from the RJD. During his march, Tej was accompanied by several members of his Chhatra Janshakti Parishad. At JP Golambar, he paid tribute to JP and then walked barefoot to the residence of the late socialist leader in Kadamkuan. Tejashwi’s convoy, which crossed 10, Circular Road residence of his mother Rabri Devi, did not stop there. On Sunday, Rabri had gone to meet Tej but he was not present at the residence. It was, thus, expected that Tej might meet his mother on Monday. However, his convoy headed straight towards Gandhi Maidan. Chhatra Janshakti Parishad state president Prashant Pratap Yadav said the outfit would hold such marches whenever required. “We follow JP’s ideologies and he is like a God to us. Our national president Tej ji has asked us to visit all the districts and sort out the problems being faced by people,” he added. A senior RJD leader said such activities of Tej would not harm the party. “His acts can only cause mental pressure on us. The way he crossed 10, Circular Road bungalow of his mother, it appeared he was teasing the party,” the RJD leader said. Meanwhile, Tejashwi avoided speaking much on the issue but appreciated the march organised by his elder brother. “Such events should be regularly organised,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jp-anniv-tej-holds-march-says-none-can-remove-him-from-rjd/articleshow/86948845.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Rajkot||Bhiloda farmers oppose land acquisition for bullet train project||Palanpur: Hundreds of farmers from at least 15 villages of Bhiloda taluka in Aravalli district are opposing the land acquisition under the bullet train project in their villages. The National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRCL) officials have started land survey for the acquisition of land in Bhiloda taluka. The survey was conducted using drones over the last two days which the farmers are opposing as they fear that they will lose their cultivable land and homes. Harshad Varsat of Waghpur village about 25 km from Bhiloda town said that at least 60 farmers from his villager are set to lose their land in his village. “In all, 730 hectares of land of 15 villages are likely to be acquired for the bullet train. According to the survey, I tend to lose a portion of my agricultural land and home,” Varsat said. He along with other farmers submitted a memorandum to the district collector on Monday. They have demanded that the route of railway track be altered as they would lose their precious cultivable land. Bhiloda MLA Dr Anil Joshiara too has extended support to the protesting farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/bhiloda-farmers-oppose-land-acquisition-for-bullet-train-project/articleshow/86948836.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: T P Chandrashekaran murder convicts getting support from police, says K K Rema||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: MLA K K Rema alleged in the House that the convicts of T P Chandrashekaran murder case are getting all the support from police personnel, including some top officials. She asked the chief minister whether it has come to his notice and whether any action has been taken on this. However, while replying to this, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan did not give a direct reply. Instead, the chief minister said that the Chandrashekaran murder case was probed by the UDF government and the member might be asking about the situation that had prevailed during the probe that took place at the time of the UDF government. Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, who was the then home minister, said the probe was meticulous and that was the reason why all the people who had direct involvement in the murder are behind the bars now. He said even the present chief minister will accept the fact. But the chief minister said that in the guise of a probe the then UDF government had tried several things which he was not ready to divulge now. He said even the then Union minister of state for home was also behind such moves. The chief minister was referring to the alleged move to nab CPM leaders for the conspiracy of the murder.

---||Goa||Congress holds ‘maun vrat’ on Lakhimpur incident||Panaji: Prime Minister Narendra Modi should end his silence on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in Uttar Pradesh where four farmers were run over by a vehicle allegedly driven by minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra’s son, Congress said on Monday. As part of a nationwide Maun Vrat protest, Congress also demanded that Mishra should be sacked immediately and the son booked for the hit-and-run accident. Claiming that the accident and the subsequent response of the government has brought shame and undermined the struggle of the farmers, Congress also demanded that Modi should speak about the ongoing protests by farmers during his next Mann Ki Baat episode. “We demand that the prime minister speaks out, speaks to the country what his Mann Ki Baat is all about. Let him speak to the people of India,” said Congress’ Goa desk-in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao. Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram, state Congress president Girish Chodankar, opposition leader Digambar Kamat, South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha and Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco and others participated in the protest at Azad Maidan. The protest began around 11 am and continued for around an hour during which the leaders maintained silence. Chidambaram maintained his silence and did not speak at the protest. “This vow of silence is to wake up the prime minister, to wake up and hear the voices of the farmer. The prime minister goes to UP but does not say one word about it. Farmers are agitating but he does not speak one word about it,” said Rao.  Congress said that union minister Ajay Mishra’s claim that his son Ashish was not driving the car is an attempt to derail the ongoing investigation and to protect his son. “The government needs to listen to the farmers because this can affect the agricultural produce of the country. This kind of dictatorship is not good for the country,” said Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-holds-maun-vrat-on-lakhimpur-incident/articleshow/86948861.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||40% buses to remain off roads during Puja in Kolkata||KOLKATA: With diesel prices showing no sign of a halt, the public transportation in the city, particularly bus, has assumed a crisis. Even after collecting an enhanced fare (Rs 2 extra per stage), bus operators are struggling to manage a breakthrough. On weekdays, even in the festive period, 40% of buses have remained off the roads in Kolkata. After Puja, the demand-supply gap is expected to widen, forcing passengers to pay much higher to commute to and from workplaces. But even after the ‘unofficial revision’ of fare, buses remain the cheapest mode of travel. The fare was last revised in 2018, when diesel price was Rs 69 per litre. Thereafter, the price dropped. When the lockdown was announced in March 2020, the diesel price was Rs 63.64 a litre. On Monday, the diesel price stood at Rs 96.24 after 11 successive spikes in October alone.  “At this rate, the diesel price is sure to reach a century before Lakshmi Puja. After that, all workplaces will be operational and there will be fewer buses,” said Anirudhha Ghosh, a transport economist. Even the state transport undertakings (STUs) are bleeding and out-shedding of buses has dropped significantly. “We are trying to run more and more electric buses. A majority of our Volvo AC buses was withdrawn from the city routes as they are bigger diesel guzzlers. Even a couple of years ago, we could manage an operating profit. But now that is unthinkable,” said an official of West Bengal Transport Corporation STU that serves the city area. However, as far as ferrying people is concerned, private buses transport the lion’s share of passengers. “If diesel price reaches Rs 100 a litre, there will be less than 10% buses on the roads and would demand a higher fare, at least Rs 5 extra per stage, to sustain mobility. The state must announce a revised fare, otherwise, an average commuter will end up paying three times the fare for travelling the same distance in other transport modes,” said Titu Saha, secretary, City Suburban Bus Services. The weakening of bus services has dangerously led to growth in use of personalised vehicles, like two- and four-wheelers, which only increase congestion and pollution as the city’s limited road space cannot afford such vehicular growth, said a senior transport department officer. The roads get badly choked during the peak hours, even though school campuses are closed at present. Just think how horrible the situation is going to be when schools and colleges reopen,” he said. “We are seriously thinking of CNG as an alternative. The faster it reaches the city, the better it is for public transport,” said a senior bureaucrat. However, GAIL’s CNG pipeline has been stuck at several places in the district because of land issues. “Unless they are resolved on a top-priority basis, the CNG supply will be in gas caskets and will never be commercially sustainable,” said Subhas Datta, who has been fighting a long-drawn legal battle in the NGT to bring CNG to the city faster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/40-buses-to-remain-off-roads-during-puja/articleshow/86948865.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Vadodara||Special probe team for early trial in Heena murder case||Vadodara: The city police on Monday formed a special team to investigate the murder of Heena alias Mehendi Pethani who was killed by her live-in partner Sachin Dixit. The police said that while Dixit has admitted to the crime, they will collect all the evidence swiftly and in a scientific manner to nail the culprit. “A team has been formed to ensure that we can cover all the angles of the case and the investigation completes quickly. We will file a chargesheet in the murder case within a week so that the case goes to trial at the earliest,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. The investigators visited the residence of Dixit in Khodiyarnagar on Monday and also took statements from the neighbours. When asked if they found any weapon in the flat, Bapod police inspector U J Joshi said, “We didn’t find any weapon or any other suspicious object in the house.” Dixit was arrested by the Gandhinagar police on Sunday after he admitted to murdering Heena, who was his live-in partner for the last three years. While Heena’s family was aware of her relationship with Dixit, his family wasn’t aware of it. Heena’s father Mehboob Pethani, who came to SSG Hospital to claim her body on Monday, said that he wants the culprit to get the strictest punishment. Joshi said that doctors conducted Heena’s postmortem and her body was later handed over to Mehboob who stays in Ahmedabad. Dixit has told the police that a fight broke out between him and Heena on October 8 when he told her that he will be visiting his native Uttar Pradesh with his wife. Dixit used to stay with Heena on weekdays and went to Ahmedabad on weekends. She wanted him to quit this dual life and stay with her forever. During the verbal fight, Heena slapped Dixit that enraged him and he strangled her. When she died, he packed her body in a suitcase and kept it in the kitchen. Investigations have revealed that Heena was married earlier and had obtained divorce from her former husband. She met Dixit three years ago in Ahmedabad and got into a relationship with him. The police said that as of now murder motive is clear but they are investigating if there can be any other possible reason. “Dixit is in Gandhinagar police custody. Once we get his custody, we will be able to get more details,” Joshi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/special-probe-team-for-early-trial-in-heena-murder-case/articleshow/86947090.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||For joint families, bond value secret to brand value||Surjaram Meel still remembers the day when his primary school teacher was transferred, and he pedalled a borrowed bicycle 30km to drop him at his new place of posting. He was the youngest of the seven sons of Danaram who reared sheep to feed his large family. Surjaram was a month old when Danaram passed away prematurely at 49, pushing the already poor family deeper into poverty. Given the background, it may look like a miracle today that the brothers and their sons are running businesses that span a chain of hotels, schools, a college, real estate, construction, handicraft, and mining among others. “Yes, miracles do happen to those who believe in hard work, patience, perseverance, honesty, trust, respect for elders and knowledge. These qualities are deeply ingrained in all of our 110 family members,” says Rajaram Meel, whose accounting skills can impress any chartered accountant. After the demise of their father, the responsibilities fell on the shoulders of the eldest brother Dularam to feed so many mouths. His sacrifice to see the family through the difficult times inspired other brothers to toil hard and break out of the grip of poverty. When they opened an automobile shop in Sriganganagar, hopes of a new dawn appeared. Early on, when the brothers were struggling to make ends meet, education was the last thing on their mind. But Surjaram was lucky to fulfill his desire to pursue higher studies as, by the time he was growing up, the family had made some progress financially. After LLB, he landed in Jaipur to try new businesses as the family thought he was educated enough to take up other things. “In Jaipur, I joined an existing surgical cotton factory as a partner but the unit closed after a fire incident. After that I opened an automobile tyre retailing business, again in partnership which also did not work due to the negligence of the partner,” says Surjaram recollecting the earlier days. Family hardship had already ingrained a sturdiness in Surjaram. He took the failures as a challenge while venturing into real estate. “I had the firm family backing when I forayed into realty in partnership with Sardar Surjeet Singh, SP Verma and Bhagirath Poonia. In 1981, we bought 25 bigha land. We paid some amount upfront to General Zorawar Singh and he was kind enough to accept payments from the sale proceeds. Today, most people in the city know what Hanuman Nagar is. But what many may not know is that as an entrepreneur, that was my first success,” says Surjaram. As the business started making profits, the brothers became more aware of their poverty that deprived them of a formal education. In fact, formal education remained unaffordable to many in the region before the Gang canal brought in riches. A tragedy in the family became a trigger for their venture into education. “The untimely death of Motaram bhaisaab (second of the seven) due to business rivalry devastated the family. In 1992, we opened the MRM school in his memory. The school made a name in the region, paving the way for Swami Keshwanand Institute of Technology (SKIT) in Jaipur. In fact, we added more schools under our Gyandan foundation named after our parents,” recalls Rajaram. After the first success in real estate, construction became a major focus area, later expanding into commercial and residential projects like City Centre in 1992 and City Star, City Plaza and Royal Ensign apartments between 2001 and 2002. This opened up an unexpected opportunity for the hotel business. “In the City Plaza, among other facilities, we also built a hotel to sell to investors. We waited for buyers. After getting no response, we decided to run the hotel ourselves. LemonTree Premier is the result of that decision. Today, Royal Ensign Group has four hotels in its fold and more are on the cards.” Rajaram says all the businesses belong to the expanded family and there is only one account. “When you work as a unit, you almost close the scope for failure. Even if there is a failure, which happens sometimes in business, you come out stronger,” explains Rajaram. Today, 13 sons of the seven brothers manage daily operations of close to a dozen verticals of the Royal Ensign group. “We are the inspiration for our sons, and also grandsons waiting in the wings. They have witnessed that joint family business works. And it works in social and family ways as well,” says Rajaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/for-joint-families-bond-value-secret-to-brand-value/articleshow/86952624.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Coimbatore||Industry body urges CM to spur growth||Coimbatore: Members of local chapter of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) met chief minister M K Stalin on Monday and submitted a memorandum on the steps needed in three areas - infrastructure, ease of doing business and environment. They offered support to the government to transform the state into a one trillion-dollar economy.ICCI sought a Samadhan scheme exclusively for entry tax cases as cases as old as 15 years are being reopened and assessed now. The scheme was introduced by the Tamil Nadu government to collect pending tax arrears from commercial businesses in 2016-17. It also sought a one-time settlement scheme for CST and VAT issues. The members requested the CM to drop the proposal to invoke the Goondas Act against those indulging in bill trading and instead suggested use of technology to track bill trading. They sought a software-based single window system clearance for building approval to support the construction industry.On road infrastructure, the members sought conversion of two-lane stretches of Karanampettai – Karur and Kovilpalayam - Bannari into four lanes. They urged him to expedite implementation of eastern bypass road from Narasimhanaickenpalayam on the Mettupalayam Road till Karanampettai on Trichy Road for a full-fledged western bypass road. The state government had recently passed an order on implementation of an outer ring road from Madukkarai on Palakkad Road till Narasimhanaickenpalayam. A full-fledged ring road is essential to decongest the city, the memorandum said.On the industrial front, the members sought speedy implementation of the multi-modal logistics park, besides urging the state government to set up a central university or a university of excellence, a mega textile park and an exclusive IT park in the city.While the master plan of Coimbatore has not been revised since 1994, ICCI stressed on expediting a new master plan and building rules to propel growth.

Suhra Abdul Khader of the IUML who was ousted as the chairperson through a no confidence motion moved by the CPM with the support of SDPI returned to the post once again by bagging 14 votes in the 28-member council. The rival SDPI candidate got only five votes. The rebel Congress candidate Ansalana Pareekkutty also voted for the UDF candidate. It was last month that Khader was ejected from the chairperson post by the LDF with the support of SDPI. Following this, UDF went on a state-wide campaign alleging that the CPM was not averse to joining hands with communal forces for political gains. The campaign had put the LDF on the defensive. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/udf-returns-to-power-in-erattupetta/articleshow/86948910.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: With Congress playing hard to get, Vijai Sardesai hopes for tie-up with Mamata Banerjee||PANAJI: With Congress giving the cold shoulder by refusing to engage in alliance talks, Goa Forward Party (GFP) president Vijai Sardesai appears to be making overtures to other anti-BJP parties. Addressing a meeting in Fatorda, Sardesai spoke about “a new dawn” forged by an alternative to BJP and Congress. With Navratri period on, Sardesai also called upon women to awaken their inner Durga and become “street fighters” though his words may appear vague, poll pundits felt that the former deputy chief minister was hinting at West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Former chief minister and Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro has referred to Banerjee as a “street fighter” on several occasions. “We cannot sit idle forever and waste time because of the inefficiency and indecision of others. To save Goa from complete ruin, we have to act. We Goemkars have to awaken the Durga in each of us,” Sardesai said. The choice of words indicate that the GFP chief may be looking for a tie-up with Trinamool Congress (TMC), which has also promised to bring in a “new dawn” to Goa. TMC has said that it wants to contest the elections alone, but that has not stopped GFP from trying to reach out. “For the last two years, we have been rooting forcefully for a united team Goa to challenge and defeat the corrupt anti-Goan BJP before it destroys Goa completely. Unfortunately, it has fallen on deaf ears with the principal opposition abdicating its duty and responsibility to heed the call or at least come half way to fulfil this strong desire of the people to throw out BJP. It’s a shame,” Sardesai said. The GFP president said that his party’s fundamental objective remains to defeat BJP “at any cost” in the 2022 assembly elections. “We have to become street fighters on every Goan street to achieve that. Narkasur has to be destroyed and we need all the help we can get. This is not the time to think of our careers and personal betterment, but that of the future of Goa,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-congress-playing-hard-to-get-sardesai-hopes-for-tie-up-with-didi/articleshow/86948888.cms||---

---||Goa||Mineral corporation to inspect Goa’s mining lease sites||PANAJI: Representatives from the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL) are likely to arrive in Goa next week to conduct site visits to find out if there is vegetation or habitation in the 77 mining leases. The state government has provided documents pertaining to these 77 leases to MECL. The site inspections will be conducted prior to deciding to quantify the ore lying in these leases. Once the quantity is determined, the leases will be auctioned. The state government had earlier signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with MECL to identify new iron ore mines in the state. A senior official said that MECL will begin exploration at the sites after verifying the documents, and added that they will only visit the leases of which the documentation is cleared. Keeping in mind the delay in the resumption of mining, the state government recently formed a mining corporation to identify new mineral blocks to restart the industry. A senior official said that once MECL finalises the blocks to be auctioned, the leases will be transferred to the mining corporation, and thereafter, they will be auctioned. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018 following the decision of the Supreme Court to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. During the Portuguese period, Goa had 806 mining concessions, and in 1987, after the concessions were abolished and converted into leases, the number had reduced to 595 leases. In 1987-88 and in 2000, 438 leaseholders had applied for first renewal. Subsequently, 413 leaseholders had applied in 2006 for a second renewal. Out of the 595 valid mining leases in Goa, the state government cancelled 252 of those holders who had not applied during the first or second renewal of mining leases in 1987 and 2007. In October 2013, 119 mining leases were cancelled and another 133 in November 2013. Goa has large deposits of iron ore (1,456 million tonnes) as well as significant occurrences of other major minerals like bauxite (55 million tonnes) and manganese ore (34 million tonnes).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mineral-corp-to-inspect-goas-mining-lease-sites/articleshow/86949010.cms||---
---||Kolkata||First-day footfall rises in cinemas despite fewer Bengali Puja releases||KOLKATA: From 12 new Puja releases last year, the number has gone down to five in 2021. But the footfall at theatres on the first day of Puja releases this year has at least doubled from what it was the year before. Exhibitors believe that double vaccination is the primary reason for the surge, along with the strength of good content. Shantanu Roychowdhury, who is the treasurer of Eastern Indian Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA), agreed. “Viewers are vaccinated and have less fear about returning to theatres. The sales of ‘Golondaaj’ at Rupmandir have been very impressive on the opening day,” Roychowdhury said. Satadeep Saha, who co-owns Ajanta and is an executive committee member of the distribution section of EIMPA, described the first day’s collection as “encouraging”. “Good movies will get people to theatres,” he said. Navina registered more than double the footfall in 2021 compared to 2020. Two shows of ‘Dracula Sir’ had released for Puja last year. “On October 21, which is the opening day, there were 287 viewers for the two shows of the film. The other release, ‘Rawkto Rawhoshyo’, had only 32 viewers for one show on its opening day. This Sunday, 788 viewers watched the three shows of Dhruba Banerjee’s ‘Golondaaj’ starring Dev. Viewers are double vaccinated and are open to returning to the cinemas. But we can capitalize on this interest only if we have good content and not otherwise,” said Navin Choukhani of Navina. Basusree’s opening-day sales have comfortably crossed the triple-digit mark. Debjiban Basu of Basusree hasn’t seen these sales figures in the rest of 2021. “The footfall at Basuree last Puja wasn’t flattering. We closed on November 20, only to reopen on December 11, 2020. This year, due to unimpressive footfall, we closed down on April 23 and reopened on August 19 with ‘Bell Bottom’. Before the Pujas, we had shut for renovation. On Sunday, the cumulative opening figures for the two shows of ‘Baazi’ and ‘F.I.R No. 339/07/06’ crossed the triple-digit mark. If one Bengali film clicks, it will be a turnaround for the exhibition industry,” Basu said. Multiplexes, too, are happy with the audience turnout. According to regional director at INOX (East) Amitava Guha Thakurta, the opening collections are better than last year. “Vaccination has definitely helped. Since the state has relaxed the night restrictions for this Puja, we can also have night shows. We couldn’t do that last year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/first-day-footfall-rises-in-cinemas-despite-fewer-bengali-puja-releases/articleshow/86949291.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The government, under the scheme, will spend Rs 2,133.75 crore to establish Community Hiring Centres (CHCs) across the state. These CHCs would be attached to the existing Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs). According to the initial information, the government has proposed to establish 10,750 CHCs in the state. Before these CHCs are established, the government wants to form farmers’ cooperative societies, attached to the RBKs. The government has already established 2,520 CHCs in the state spending Rs 98 crore. These cooperatives would procure the modern agriculture tools which include tractors, cultivators, harvesters, sprayers, and other equipment for cultivation and harvesting. The government would provide 40 per cent subsidy and get 50 per cent cost financed by the banks. The farmers’ cooperatives would have to pay the balance 10 per cent cost of these tools. The sophisticated tools would be placed in the CHCs attached to the RBKs which the farmers could hire paying nominal price. They would address the farmers’ issues and help them in cultivation and harvesting. Besides these 10,750 CHCs, the state government is also planning to have 1,035 CHC clusters in Krishna, Guntur and the two Godavari districts where farming, particularly paddy cultivation, is more. These clusters will have additional equipment at the disposal of the farmers. Each of these CHCs would have mechanised tools worth Rs 1,612 crore in addition to the Rs 20 lakh each provided by the Central government under the Rastriya Krushi Vikas Yojana. The state government also plans to start special training for the unemployed youth in the villages to operate these tools, including harvesters and cultivators. These trained youths would be placed at the disposal of the RBKs and the CHCs to help the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-to-help-farmers-get-mechanised-tools/articleshow/86947092.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Ahmedabad||‘Acted against 116 staffers for poor upkeep of roads’||Ahmedabad: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has informed the Gujarat high court that it had initiated vigilance inquiry against 116 city engineers for inaction and negligence over poor upkeep of city roads after the 2017 monsoon. In a report submitted by the civic body, it was revealed that 87 employees out of 116 under inquiry were penalised with amounts ranging between Rs 10,000 and Rs 35,000. But in most cases, the civic body decided to recover the amounts by the stoppage of three-five increments. The AMC also stated that it had issued chargesheets against 23 employees. This happened after a public interest litigation (PIL) complained about the poor road condition after the monsoon and inadequate parking facilities that led to hindrance in traffic movement and cattle nuisance on public streets. There was uproar in the city over potholes on city roads in 2017. The high court had issued a slew of directions in May 2018 to the government and the civic authorities to deal with the issues. The HC had also ordered the authorities to file action taken reports every two months. But the AMC filed the reports after September 2019. Besides the action taken against its employees for negligence, the AMC submitted details about the creation of new traffic signals and identification of street vendors and issuance of provisional ID cards to them. During the hearing on Monday, the bench of Justice Ashish Desai and Justice Nirzar Desai sought details from the civic body on what measures it is taking to deal with stray cattle menace on public roads. This happened after petitioner’s advocate Amit Panchal raised the issue of the death of a senior citizen due to an accident with a cow last month. Meanwhile, the AMC furnished details about activities undertaken by the Cattle Nuisance Control Department (CNCD) between February 2020 and July 2021. It was submitted that 12,936 stray cattle were impounded and fine of Rs 73 lakh was collected from the cattle owners for letting the cattle stray on public roads. The AMC has also filed 475 FIRs against cattle owners during the same period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/acted-against-116-staffers-for-poor-upkeep-of-roads/articleshow/86948954.cms||---

C Vishnu, a journalist with a cooperative banking periodical, set off on his cycle from his home in Palakkad on a solo ride to Delhi where he hopes to tell members of Parliament that he is unhappy with the fuel prices. He arrived in Goa on Monday and spoke to a few reporters about his pedalling expedition. “Everywhere I go, people welcome me. People are very pleasant and they accept my act because they face the same problem,” he said. Vishnu’s adventure in the saddle began on September 25 and he hopes to be in Delhi by the first week of November. The long, 700-km ride to Goa has done little to dim the smile on his face or sap his energy, and Vishnu has no problems answering questions and posing for pictures with curious bystanders. “The roads are nice, but the stretch from Margao to Panaji was bad,” he said. He cycles about 80-100km per day, restricting the rides to early morning and evenings. From Goa, he will cycle to Maharashtra, then Gujarat, and hopes to continue cycling till he reaches the national capital. While he has been riding solo, another Keralite based in Goa plans to join him on the expedition. An avid footballer, Vishnu claims that though he is in great shape, he began cycling just two months before he set off. He is the general secretary of the Palakkad district youth Congress wing and for him, the ride is as much an act of defiance as it is a political statement. “I like cycling. I decided to show my protest against this government — which is very cruelly increasing petrol prices — and also its handling of the farmers’ issues,” said Vishnu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kerala-man-cycles-to-delhi-in-protest-of-rising-fuel-prices/articleshow/86948919.cms||---

The protesters demanded a CBI inquiry into the alleged paper leak case and resignation of education minister Govind Singh Dotasra from the post. A large number of workers led by the state president of the BJYM, Himanshu Sharma, participated in the demonstration at Bais Godam circle here. They tried to move to the Civil Lines crossing where the Congress was holding a silent protest seeking the removal of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra whose son is accused of mowing down four protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri in UP. The police had a hard time in controlling them. “There should be a CBI inquiry. The agitation will continue till the investigation is ordered. BJYM has decided to reach out to 2.5 lakh unemployed youth to raise awareness and create a big movement and today it is beginning of it,” said party’s state president Satish Poonia. He demanded that the government should sack the education minister. State president of the BJYM, Himanshu Sharma said that there should be a fair investigation in the matter and this investigation should be done by the CBI. The examination should stand as cancelled and be held afresh, he demanded. The Rajasthan government has suspended an RAS, two RPS officers, 13 personnel of the education department and three policemen in connection with the case.

---||Ahmedabad||Architectural landmark’s end ahead||Ahmedabad: An 84-year-old bungalow listed by the AMC as a heritage structure is to be run over by the civic body’s own road department. The road-widening drive of the AMC threatens the bungalow, near Madalpur underpass, which is considered an architectural landmark in the city. It was designed by one of the pioneers of the Art Deco movement in India, Claude Batley. Art Deco represents ‘new architecture’. The building will be chopped from two sides and then halved. The only option the building’s owner has is to wipe it out of existence. Recently, the AMC issued a notice for road widening of Madalpur underpass road. This has put the owners of the bungalow in a fix as restoration activity is currently underway at Shodhan House. It figures on the AMC’s own list of protected heritage buildings. The AMC’s zonal road department is widening an existing 18m road to 36m. Unfortunately, the department did not bother to see how the road will rip right through the drawing room of the bungalow, only leaving behind 2.5 rooms of the total 7. Batley’s Shodhan House currently belongs to Harsh Navnitlal Shodhan. It’s worth mentioning here that another house of a member of the Shodhan family is designed by the master architect Le Corbusier. The third, a joint family house which lay at Panchavati, was sold off and later demolished to pave the way for an apartment complex. “Batley’s Shodhan House was put on the AMC’s heritage list in 2016 as stated in the deputy municipal commissioner’s letter to the owner on April 17, 2018,” said architect Riyaz Tayyibji. “There has been no change in its Grade 3 status. The house is almost in its original state, interestingly only being painted twice in its 84 years. It is in a good conserved state after some minor retrofitting.” Tayyibji added that Batley had designed the Town Hall, Vijali Ghar (Electricity House) at Lal Darwaza, and MJ Library in Ahmedabad. These were examples of the Indian architectural fraternity embracing modernism with design that was both international in outlook and contemporaneous in sensibility. Batley’s ‘new architecture’ which took roots nearly two decades before Indian independence, proved that modernism was gaining ground among the Indian middle-class. Functionalism formed the core of Batley’s architectural philosophy. Who is Claude Batley? From 1921 to 1923, Claude Batley was the president of the Indian Institute of Architects. He was an English architect and teacher. In the early part of the twentieth century, he was a key figure in the development of modern architecture in India. The Bombay Gymkhana (1917), Lincoln House (1933), Wankaner House, Breach Candy; Bombay Central Station (1930); Dariya Mahal, Maharaja of Kutch’s home (1930); South Court (1936); and the residence of Jinnah are only a few of his notable works. In 1914, he was a visiting lecturer at JJ School of Art. In 1923, he became its principal. He held the position for 20 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/architectural-landmarks-end-ahead/articleshow/86948960.cms||Paul John

The cops at highly-sensitive Katezhari police post in Dhanora taluka in north Gadchiroli have converted a room on their premises into a mini movie theatre that can accommodate 40 viewers. The hall can also be used as a meeting room. The village and its adjoining stretches are covered with forested landscapes considered as Maoist bastion. SP Ankit Goyal, who had inaugurated the innovative concept, said the facility is based on a home theatre set up. “This is a pilot project which we want to replicate at other posts, especially in the remote ones,” said Goyal adding the theatre can offer the local population a window to the developed world. “This facility would be a means of entertainment for the police personnel and their families at the post. Villagers also frequent the police post for some or the other works. They too can enjoy the movies,” said the SP. The cops have also opened a creche in the adjacent room and a reading room with a small library to start with. “Many students find it difficult to study at home or there are disturbances and distractions. They can come here and study,” he said. Senior police officials feel working in remote posts leaves one under immense stress, especially if there is a heightened threat perception. Entertainment allows one to unwind and get mentally rejuvenated, said an official. Police had earlier helped Katezhari residents by facilitating them with benefits of government schemes working as coordinators. In 2019, the police had helped the water-scarce village get potable water at doorsteps by erecting two overhead tanks. Earlier, considered a Naxal stronghold, police have already started gaining ground here with social approach which included the latest creation of the mini cinema hall, reading room and the creche.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadchiroli-cops-develop-mini-movie-hall-to-spread-joy-in-maoist-hit-land/articleshow/86948958.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Aurangabad||Marathwada could be top choice for load-shedding||Aurangabad: While the menace of load-shedding may arise if the current coal-crisis in thermal power plants aggravates further, Marathwada may become the first to face such planned power cuts. As per directives of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), regions having higher transmission and distribution losses arising due to power thefts among other reasons and those having poor recovery of power dues are considered on priority basis for load-shedding. With Marathwada having dubious distinction on both the counts, the region could be the top choice of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) for load-shedding if power availability scenario worsens. MSEDCL deputy chief public relations officer Sunil Jadhav on Monday said eight districts in Marathwada have recovery dues worth Rs 15,122.6 crore. “The dues include Rs 3,870.52 crore to be paid by residential, commercial and industrial consumers along with arrears towards public water schemes and street-light systems of the local self-governing bodies. The remaining dues are pending with agricultural pumps of the farmers, ” he said. Marathwada is notorious for power-thefts with the state power utility detecting as many as 29,952 such cases of illegal drawing of power during a special drive carried out during February this year. The unauthorised drawing of power involves use of metal hooks to fetch power directly from overhead cables and tampering of electricity meters among other illegal practices. As per official release, 13 units of various thermal power plants supplying power to MSEDCL were affected till Sunday due to shortage of coal, cutting power supply of 3,330 MW. MSEDCL chief public relations officer Anil Kamble said efforts are being made to provide power supply from hydropower and other sources along with immediate procurement to fill the shortfall. “The MSEDCL is making all possible efforts to prevent load shedding in the state and has appealed the consumers to use electricity sparingly from 6 am to 10 am and from 6 pm to 10 pm to balance the demand and supply, as power shortage is likely to increase due to coal shortage,” he said. To avoid the load shedding of electricity, three phase electricity is being supplied on agricultural connections for eight hours in a circular manner as per MERC order, MSEDCL authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marathwada-could-be-top-choice-for-load-shedding/articleshow/86944724.cms||Prasad Joshi

The Monserrate family’s impromptu tree plantation drive was an attempt to pre-empt a tree plantation drive by AAP functionary Cecille Rodrigues. The revenue minister claimed that she was “disturbed to hear about the destruction of trees” along the Caranzalem-Miramar road just in front of a beach-facing five-star resort. “No permission of any kind was given to carry out these illegal activities. I have issued an order to block vehicular access to this area immediately and started the process of planting trees,” she said. Her son Rohit said that the CCP had not given any permission to the resort or any other entity to create a path and fell the trees. AAP questioned why the government had not filed an FIR against the contractor and those responsible for the environmental destruction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/monserrate-familymoves-to-plant-trees-pre-empt-aap-bid/articleshow/86948959.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Three months ago, the Vadodara rural police had filed a similar complaint of murder against one of their own. The then SOG PI Ajay Desai was booked by the Karjan police and arrested for murdering his live-in partner Sweety Desai. Desai had been living with Sweety for several years in Karjan and they had a two-year-old kid. Dixit too was in a relationship with Heena alias Mehandi Pethani for a few years and they have one-year-old baby boy Shivansh. Desai was married to another woman. The police said that Dixit too is married and his wife stays in Ahmedabad. He met Heena in Ahmedabad and got into a relationship with her. Dixit used to stay with Heena in Vadodara and visited his wife, who stays in Ahmedabad, on weekends. Same was the case with Desai, he stayed with Sweety in Karjan and visited his wife in Ahmedabad once in a few days. Both Heena and Sweety were previously married and had divorced their husband. Desai’s neighbours in Karjan thought that he was married to Sweety. Dixit and Heena’s neighbours in the Bapod area of the city too assumed they were a married couple. Desai decided to kill Sweety as she used to force him to stay with her and often pressured him to divorce his wife and marry her. After a heated argument over the same issue, he smothered her to death when she was sleeping. Dixit too had a clash with Heena after he told her about his plans to visit Uttar Pradesh with his wife. Heena asked him leave his wife that enraged him. In the heat of the moment, he strangled her to death on October 8. While Desai dumped Sweety’s body in Bharuch and set it on fire, Dixit packed Heena’s body in a suitcase and left it in their flat. The only contrast is that while Heena’s murder case was cracked in three days, it took the police one-and-half month to solve the Sweety murder case and arrest Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/live-ins-gone-wrong-2-crimes-same-plot/articleshow/86947107.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Chandigarh||Navjot Singh Sidhu’s outbursts continue, Congress may accept his resignation as Punjab unit chief||NEW DELHI: Congress may replace its Punjab unit president Navjot Sidhu in the wake of his continuing differences with colleagues including chief minister Charanjit Channi. A final decision is still to be taken. Well-placed sources said the party may accept the resignation that Sidhu tendered a few days ago when he announced on the social media that the state government was going slow on sacrilege and drugs cases which was contrary to the promises it had made before the 2017 elections. The party has not taken kindly to his public resignation and repeated comments which are casting the state government led by the new CM Channi in unflattering light. “The resignation given by Sidhu may be accepted. the party is looking at possible candidates. However, it’s an open issue still,” a source said. If Congress indeed removes Sidhu as Punjab president, it would mark an unexpected culmination of extraordinary turn of events in the state in last few months in which the cricketer-turned politician became the catalyst for tremors that resulted first in his appointment as state chief despite the opposition of then CM Amarinder Singh and a big section of the organisation. It later triggered an overhaul which saw the removal of satrap Amarinder Singh, inauguration of first Dalit chief minister in the history of the state and a complete rejig of the state cabinet. While Sidhu’s intermittent outbursts are seen as resulting from his peeve at being overlooked for chief ministership following Singh’s removal recently, the maverick politician, however, claims that “it is based on issues and not posts”. If Sidhu leaves the top state party post, all eyes would be on his next step given that he has options outside Congress still. On his part, he wrote in his resignation letter that he would continue to work for the party, and later in a tweet reaffirmed his loyalty to Congress by saying that “will uphold principles of Gandhi Ji & Shastri Ji … Post or No Post, will stand by RahulGandhi & Priyanka Gandhi! Let all negative forces try to defeat me, but with every ounce of positive energy will make Punjab win, Punjabiyat (Universal Brotherhood) win & every Punjabi win”. He has since also lauded Priyanka Gandhi on Twitter for her combative stand on Lakhimpur Kheri violence in UP, and also led a march to Kheri with party MLAs and ministers which created an impact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-may-accept-sidhus-resignation-as-punjab-unit-chief/articleshow/86951192.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

---||Vadodara||Woman, daughter poisoned: Cops||Vadodara: Barely has the dust settled around the sensatiional murder of a live-in partner by her paramour, a 36-year-old woman and her six-year-old daughter were found dead under suspicious circumstances at their house on New Sama Road on Monday. Police questioned the deceased woman Shobhana’s husband Tejas about the deaths, but so far, no foul play has been found. Tejas works as a salesman at an electronics showroom at a mall on Alembic Road. Preliminary examination during post-mortem, however, revealed that Shobhana and her daughter Kavya died due to poisoning. The duo was found unconscious when Tejas went to use bathroom around 2 am. “The girl was sleeping upside down, so the man changed her sleeping position. But when the girl did not make any movement, he became suspicious and tried to wake up his wife up, but she also did not respond,” said assistant commissioner of police Bharat Rathod. Tejas then called his brothers-in-law who lives on the lower floor of the same house. Shobhana’s brothers Shailendrasinh and Jitendra and his wife came to check. Jitendra’s wife, who had earlier worked as nurse, checked Shobhana’s pulse and blood pressure. Police said that Shobhana’s pulse rate was very low, so they immediately rushed her and Kavya to a nearby private hospital at Abhilasha Circle. The doctors, however, declared them dead before admission. Hospital authorities later informed police and the mother-daughter duo’s bodies were shifted to SSG Hospital for post-mortem examination. “There were some injury marks on the woman’s neck, but the doctors who did the post-mortem ruled out that she would have died because of strangulation,” said Rathod. Viscera samples of both deceased have been sent for further investigation. “The exact cause of death will be known once the viscera report arrives, but preliminarily it looks that they died of poisoning,” Rathod added. Police are now investigating whether Shobhana consumed the toxic substance and fed her daughter too or whether they were poisoned by someone else. Their family members have demanded that proper investigation of the case is done. “They had gone to the society’s common plot for garba and returned at midnight. My sister and niece wished me ‘good night’ before going upstairs to sleep and at that moment they seemed completely fine,” said Shailendrasinh Bariya, Shobhana’s brother. Tejas, Shobhana and Kavya had been living with Shobhana’s family for the past seven years. The trio had their bedroom on the fourth floor while the other family members used to live on the lower floors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-daughter-poisoned-cops/articleshow/86949030.cms||---

This caused hassles for many commuters who were found waiting for the buses. Though autorickshaws and cabs were available, many people said the high fares did not allow them to use such modes of transportation. The official added that bus services resumed after 12:30pm. “I waited for over two hours for a bus. I finally had to hire an autorickshaw for Rs300 from Swargate from Kondhwa. I had to agree, as I was getting late for work. The PMPML should have informed commuters earlier that the buses won’t ply,” said Prithak Jadhav, a daily commuter. The supply of fruits and vegetables was affected because of the bandh. Madhukant Garad, chief administrator of Market Yard, Gultekdi, said, “Vegetable, fruit, and grocery sections of Market Yard were closed. The flower market was functioning. The market will function normally from Tuesday.” The bandh call had moderate effects in different parts of the city. In Kondhwa, many shops, including groceries, remain shut until the afternoon hours. In Kothrud and Bavdhan areas, most of the shops remained open. A two-wheeler garage owner from Bavdhan, who did not wish to be named said, “We have been suffering losses for the past two years due to the Covid pandemic. We cannot afford to close the garage for a day now,” he said. Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) supporters staged protest marches at various places in the city. A joint rally was held by leaders of Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena near Pune station. Pradip Deshnukh, NCP leader, said the bandh was called in support of farmers fighting for their rights for the past many months. Police said the bandh was peaceful. “No law and order problems were reported. Owners of shops and business establishments observed the bandh in a peaceful way from morning to 3pm under heavy police bandobast,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI. Joint commissioner of Pune police Ravindra Shisve said no incident of stone pelting and forcible closure of shops was reported. Deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Bhagyashree Navtakke said, “The bandh received 70-80 per cent response from the traders. A ‘rasta roko’ agitation was held at Loni Kalbhor. Bandh supporters took out rallies in the Swargate and Laxmi Road areas and localities under the jurisdiction of the Alankar police. Similar rallies were taken out in Kothrud, Uttamnagar and Hadapsar and from Sant Kabir Chowk to Alka Talkies Chowk.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-buses-stay-off-roads-till-afternoon-commuters-suffer/articleshow/86949086.cms||---

Experts are finding unusual number of patients rushing to the hospitals after the pandemic situation eased in the last one month. “Arthralgia is one of the most common symptoms that occur in patients with Covid-19. About 15% of patients present with arthralgia at some point. Covid-19 is largely attacking the musculoskeletal system (muscles and joints) in its infective and post infective stages causing inflammatory arthritis,” said noted rheumatologist Dr Manukonda Muralikrishna. He, however, said the musculoskeletal manifestations in Covid-19 patients could be treated successfully with low-dose glucocorticoids and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The debilitating effects of arthritis-related diseases, which are more than 200 in number, are little known and their impact, however, is largely and silently experienced. Experts noted that many people go undiagnosed as people try to cope with symptoms that are often overlooked and frequently misdiagnosed. “The outbreak of Covid-19 in two successive spells has made several thousands of people suffer silently with the arthritis complications as either patients’ were worried visiting hospitals or doctors were not available to provide treatment. This resulted in increasing severity and manifestation to new complications by the time Covid positive cases came down,” said Dr Muralikrishna. A large part of the population suffers in silence because they do not want to reveal the disease is impacting their quality of work. “An inability to work adversely impacts self-confidence of the individual causing more complications,” said another expert. There is urgent need to create awareness on the latest research outcomes that help treat rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) as effective drugs and strategies are available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/arthritis-complications-see-rise-after-let-up-in-pandemic/articleshow/86947181.cms||Samdani MN

The bogus doctors are those who practice without appropriate degree and registrations under several acts, especially Bombay Nursing Act. Between March to September this year, three bogus doctors each have been caught from Radhanagari, Bhudargad and Karvir talukas. “Those working with such doctors and pharmacists dispensing medicines over the prescription given by these doctors will also be booked and legal action will be taken against them,” he said. Rekhawar has asked block development officers and local police to assist health authorities to carry out the action. Many times, authorities have found that the bogus doctors do not run clinics, instead they visit doorsteps to treat patients. Rekhawar has also appealed to citizens to provide information of such doctors to local health authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/employees-working-with-bogus-docs-to-face-action-rekhawar/articleshow/86944886.cms||---

The measure was taken up keeping in mind that the vaccination drive might slow down during the festivity. Even as the state health department will keep all its vaccination sites attached with medical colleges and other hospitals open during Durga Puja except on Ashtami, officials said the turnout is expected to be very low during the festival. The drive was ramped up to make up for this speed breaker in drive during Durga Puja. Even as Kolkata already has got into a festive mood, the health department on Monday activated close to 2,287 vaccination sites in the government sector along with 244 private ones to achieve a respectable vaccination target. Till 6 pm, Bengal was inching towards 5 lakh doses for the day. “People, particularly in the city, are already in Puja mood. We expect a very low turnout during the festival that is why we tried to cover as much as people possible before the festival starts,” said a senior health official. On Monday morning, Bengal had 30 lakh doses in its stock. The state got fresh supply of 8 lakh doses in the evening. More supply of vials is expected during the Durga Puja as well. “This month, we have already administered 70 lakh jabs out which around 50 lakhs have been achieved in the past seven days. No doubt the inoculation drive will lose speed during the festivity, hence, we jacked up the drive ahead of the festival,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer. In fact, on Saturday (October 9), the state recorded the highest doses administered in a day with around 13.5 lakh jabs. Altogether, Bengal had dispensed over 6.5 crore doses since the beginning of the drive. Of them, over 4.7 crore jabs are second dose. The state has an eligible adult population of about 7 crore. Hence, close to 67% of the eligible population has got at least one dose. In Kolkata, only 322 jab sites operated on Monday of which 215 were government-run CVCs. A total of close to 74 lakh doses have been administered in Kolkata as on Monday of which 47.2 lakh are first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-fears-slow-vax-drive-in-puja-gives-50l-doses-in-a-wk/articleshow/86949157.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The suspects were produced before a city court which remanded them in police custody till October 13. The police are investigating if they have committed any other offences in Nashik or the adjoining places. Initial investigation has revealed that one of the four suspects has 11 criminal cases registered against him in Gujarat. At around 10.45 am on Sunday, a 65-year-old woman was walking towards her residence in the Makhmalabad road area after dropping her grandson at a tuition class , when she was robbed of her gold chain by an unidentified burglar. The police said the criminal came from a blue hatchback, walked towards the elderly woman and snatched the gold chain from behind. Later, he rushed towards the car and escaped the scene. Police sub-inspector Ram Ghorpade, who was patrolling in the same area, rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. He noticed that there was a CCTV on the fourth floor of the building, close to where the incident occurred. After checking the footage, Ghopade spotted the same car passing from the main road at some distance from the building. After passing on the information to the other police personnel, Ghorpade and police inspector Ashok Sakhare also began chasing the car and intercepted it near Rukmini wedding hall and nabbed the four criminals. The police recovered the gold chain worth Rs one lakh, which was allegedly snatched by the suspects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-4-arrested-in-chain-robbery-case/articleshow/86944917.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The dispute involved a man from Vadodara, and his wife has been living with their minor son in Sikkim. The couple is before the high court challenging two orders by family courts, one is an order of divorce whereas the other is regarding the minor son’s custody.

The authority is expected to submit the final report to the state government for its approval in the next few days. The urban development authority received about 16,000 objections/complaints against its draft master plan. A majority of the objections were related to the master plan roads proposed in the newly emerging urban centres like Bhogapuram and surrounding mandals and the suburbs on the north side of Vizag. For instance, nearly 500 complaints pertained to a single master plan road in Bhogapuram. Similarly, another proposed master plan road in Kapuluppada received complaints from 350 people. The state government had constituted an expert technical committee to review and make suggestions on objections/suggestions received on these plans. The committee convened several meetings with the VMRDA officials in the last few weeks and expressed their views. The VMRDA, on its part, formed 13 teams for field-level verification of these objections. Speaking to ToI, metropolitan commissioner K. Venkata Ramana Reddy, said the VMRDA will soon submit the final report to the state government. “Consequent on the approval of or changes in the plan, the state government will issue a gazette notification on the final master plan. Majority of the complaints pertaining to the master plan roads have been rectified. The existing roads will be realigned to construct the master plan roads,” said Ramana Reddy. While the master plan acts as a sectoral plan covering zoning, industrial development plans, etc., the perspective plan is a strategic plan providing sector-wise goals, policies, strategies, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vmrda-finalising-master-plan-2041-soon-to-submit-it-for-govts-approval/articleshow/86947234.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Aurangabad||Citing pandemic losses, many traders stay open in Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Many traders in Aurangabad chose to keep their businesses open on Monday — when a bandh had been called by the MVA — citing heavy losses incurred due to the Covid-related curbs earlier. Earlier, local Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP leaders visited prominent city markets and other areas with an appeal for closure of shops to condemn the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh. In response to the appeal, many shopkeepers downed their shutters for a brief period, but later started functioning normally by noon barring exceptions in some areas. Ajay Shah, the Aurangabad-based senior state vice-president of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said, the trader community was against taking part in the bandh as the festive season, which invites brisk business, is going on. “The Covid outbreak has already wreaked havoc on the local economy over the past one and half years. The commercial establishments were among the worst-hit. The business community cannot afford further losses, that too during the festive season,” Shah said. Both MSRTC and public transport buses were operational as usual, the authorities concerned said. Several schools and junior colleges were also functional for stipulated classes. By evening, Shiv Sena and BJP leaders came out with contradictory claims on the success of the bandh. Sena MLC Ambadas Danve said: “The bandh evoked a good response in Aurangabad. There is a public outcry against the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri and against the Centre, and the same was reflected in the bandh.” BJP MLA Atul Save said the MVA bandh had fizzled out. “The bandh call was a tactic to divert attention from large-scale corruption by MVA government, which has invited actions from the ED and IT department among other authorities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/citing-pandemic-losses-many-traders-stay-open-in-aurangabad/articleshow/86947223.cms||---

Mokariya, who is currently in judicial custody, has sought bail on the grounds that he had no role to play in committing the alleged rape and he has been wrongly dragged in the case by police. Mokariya has also stated in his bail application that he is ready to abide by any conditions of the court if allowed bail. His plea will be taken up for hearing on Tuesday and the investigating officer is likely to submit an affidavit opposing the bail application. Mokariya was arrested before Bhatt, former trustee of Pavagadh temple, was nabbed from Junagadh. Police have accused Mokariya of helping Bhatt in fleeing away after the rape case was registered against the latter and chartered accountant Ashok Jain by a law student. He has also been accused of giving Rs 75,000 cash to Bhatt before he escaped from the city. During investigation, it had also come to light that the alleged rape-survivor had stayed in a hotel near railway station, where Mokariya was a partner, during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/md-of-courier-firm-seeks-bail/articleshow/86947254.cms||---

---||Nashik||Some shops observe bandh; buses & trains ply as usual||Nashik: The day-long bandh called by the Maha Vikas Agadhi (MVA) evoked a mixed response in Nashik. While all shops and commercial establishments in the heart of the city — like in the Main Road, Shalimar, Nashik Road etc. — remained closed, in places like Gangapur Road, Cidco, Satpur, they stayed open. In some parts of the city, although the owners of some shopkeepers had opened their businesses in the morning, they downed the shutters after the bandh supporters came and demanded that the outlets be closed. Operations of city and MSRTC buses remained unhindered. The movement of vehicles on the Mumbai-Nashik and Pune-Nashik highways also remained unaffected. Nashik Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd officials said that the entire fleet of 94 buses was on the city roads since morning to ferry passengers to various destinations. MSRTC officials too added that there were no disruptions in the bus services to and from Nashik. “Even the footfall of passengers was good,” added the officials. Autorickshaws were also seen plying on the city roads. According to the Bhusawal railway division officials’, the movement of long-distance and intercity trains in the division remained unaffected. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, however, said that the bandh was a success in Nashik and people supported the stir. “The bandh passed off peacefully. The stir was essential to drive home the point that lives of farmers are precious and they cannot be exploited,” said Bhujbal. City police commissioner Deepak Pandey said that there were no untoward incidents anywhere in the city during the bandh. The NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress took out rallies on foot in the morning and raised slogans against the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh. In rural Nashik, in talukas like Kalwan, the shops remained closed in the morning. In talukas like Trimbakeshwar, there was no significant impact of the bandh. Nashik rural police had deployed personnel in all the talukas to prevent untoward incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/some-shops-observe-bandh-buses-trains-ply-as-usual/articleshow/86947250.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Bros in arms: Mangala Group’s Agarwals find the key in kinship||It seems poverty is not such a bad thing if it can take one even closer to the margins of what the Agarwal family of Mangala Ispat (Jaipur) Ltd has achieved. Born into a poor family near a village in Neem ka Thana, earning livelihood was a priority rather than education for the four brothers. At 17, Kailash Chand Agarwal left for Assam with a known person to work in a police canteen. Sitaram, the next in line, too left for J&K to do a job at a military camp for a monthly salary of Rs 200. Afterwards, the other two, Rajkumar and Satyanarayan joined the eldest brother in Assam. From jobs to running canteens on contracts, they found their way up through hard work and collective will. With good food and hospitality, the brothers won the hearts of young trainees who would later become senior officials. “If you are good at heart and sincere to what you do, there is no dearth of kind people. That’s how we created relationships in a place that was not our home land,” says Kailash Chand Agarwal, 72, who is respected as a father figure in the family. Soon, they started supplying dry ration to the police department and later won government contracts for civil construction works. As the business activities expanded, including an auto spare parts shop, Sitaram who was running military canteens in J&K too shifted to join the family business in Assam. But coming back to their birthplace was always an urge. When former Rajasthan CM Bhairon Singh Shekhawat visited Assam, he promised the state’s businessmen all support if they relocate. “We came to Jaipur in search of opportunities. Since we were into construction, the absence of steel mills caught our attention. We took a piece of land in the VKI area and set up the first mill in 1995,” says Sitaram. Afterwards, one factory led to another. As the the children grew up, they joined the business. Sitaram says the eight sons of the four brothers are engaged in various leadership roles in the family’s five factories. “Kailash bhaisahab and I have retired from active business. Along with our two brothers, our children are managing the operations and expansions,” elaborates Sitaram. As to expansion, Sitaram says that so far they have grown within the business adding new verticals but now there is a thought of entering new areas like construction and animal feed. “Our children want to diversify. The steel business is facing headwinds even for a big company like us which has 175 dealerships and makes a turnover of around Rs 800-1,000 crore,” says Sitaram. The family still operates under a joint account. “There is value in joint family business that one cannot find in any other model,” adds Sitaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bros-in-arms-mangala-groups-agarwals-find-the-key-in-kinship/articleshow/86952646.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The city had reported around 70,000 cases during the first wave, while the city registered over 1.5 lakh cases during the second wave. The number of active cases had increased to 6,200 cases in September last year while Nashik had recorded 28,000 active cases in April this year amid the second wave. Now the active cases have been reduced to 250.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-plans-gis-mapping-analysis-of-covid-hotspots/articleshow/86944982.cms||Tushar Pawar

LCB sleuths said that the driver of the truck Mahendra Singh Shekhawat and the cleaner Kamlesh Kumar Sharma were bringing the liquor-laden truck from Surat.

The arrested duo told police that the liquor stock was sent by a man named Ishwar, who is also a native of Rajasthan but currently lives in Goa. To fox the RTO and police, they were carrying forged documents and invoices of a pharma company. But since the LCB had specific information, they checked the container and found 3,996 liquor bottles packed in 333 boxes. A case of prohibition and forgery was registered against Shekhawat, Sharma, Ishwar and the unidentified truck handler at Karjan police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/imfl-worth-rs-16-lakh-seized-near-vadodara/articleshow/86947321.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Sena workers blocked the highway at the Tawade hotel entrance; NCP workers blocked it at Kagal; while the Congress workers blocked the road at Ambap Phata. The police took the protestors into custody once the highway started getting choked. The protestors raised slogans against BJP and held placards demanding the resignation of minister Ajay Kumar Mishra. Vijay Devane, district Sena president said, “The cruel act of the minister’s son should have invited strict action. The PM should have fired the minister. It is shameful that the BJP-led governments at the Centre and UP are defending the culprits.” Most shops and vegetable mandis across Kolhapur, except essential shops, were shut. The industries and the public transport services were shut too. At the Solapur APMC, which is controlled by the BJP leaders, there was no announcement on if the market would be closed on Monday.

However, the Solapur city observed strict bandh.

In the biggest rally after the demise of his father Ajit Chaudhary at Budhana in Muzaffarnagar on Monday, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Chaudhary unveiled the party’s election manifesto drafted with the help of 59,000 village pradhans across Uttar Pradesh. Addressing the “Ashirwad” rally, Chaudhary promised employment, better price for agricultural produce and setting up funds for various development projects in UP. Having been trounced in UP polls in 2017 and general elections in 2014 and 2019, the upcoming UP elections is a test for Chaudhary as a leader in ensuring that RLD makes a comeback in the assembly polls in UP due next year. In the 2017 assembly elections, the party had to settle for just one seat in Baghpat's Chaprauli. He announced that a corpus of Rs 2,500 would be set up if the RLD was voted to power. “We will release 2.500 crore funds in multiple ways. One part of the fund will be set aside for self-employment, another for installing cold storages for agricultural produce and one for agricultural startups,” Chaudhary told the gathering He added funds would be allotted for the disabled and those hailing from SC-ST community “so that they can stand on their own feet”. The RLD chief also promised a high court bench in Meerut, a long pending demand of the people in west UP. Later, speaking with mediapersons, Chaudhary explained that the RLD manifesto is based on public opinion. It is still in the process of gathering the feedback from village pradhans on the “real issues farmers face” to make the manifesto. After addressing the rally in Muzaffarnagar, Jayant headed for Amroha, where he addressed a public gathering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/rld-launches-poll-campaign-in-muzaffarnagar-unveils-peoples-manifesto/articleshow/86947284.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: RTE admissions in private schools to begin on October 24||JAIPUR: After a gap of six months, the process for Right to Education (RTE) is all set to begin from October 24 in which parents from lower income economic background will be able to send their children to private schools. Unlike last year, the Directorate of School Education, Bikaner, has reduced the number of schools that parents can opt for while filling up RTE forms. Earlier, 15 schools at a time could be selected. The reason for the purpose is to let parents opt for schools in their periphery. RTE deputy director Chandra Kiran said, “Parents are supposed to opt for schools in their physical periphery. However, they opt for schools in faraway places in their first preference instead of nearby schools. This way, they are usually discarded as their children will never get admissions in such schools as per rules and lose the chance in their neighborhood schools as well. Hence, this year they can opt for only five schools.” Free admission will be given to students in the age group of five years to seven years. Parents, whose maximum income is Rs 2.5 lakh or lower, will be able to apply in RTE portal. Private schools for a long time have been protesting against the non-payment of RTE amount by the state government. They even threatened that no student will be given admission this year unless their due amount is paid, but finally agree to go ahead with this process. Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar said, “The state government has started payment of our due amount. We have decided to give admissions in RTE. It is expected to help students.” Results of the lottery will be announced on October 27 and students will be able to get selected through online process between November 19 and 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rte-admissions-to-begin-on-oct-24-after-a-gap-of-6-months/articleshow/86951335.cms||---

The daily average business transactions at these mandis are to the tune of around Rs 40 crore, including Rs 5 crore at Lasalgaon alone. Officials at the Lasalgaon APMC said there was no onion auction on Monday. Only a small amount of vegetables was auctioned in Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon mandi. The farmers and traders had approached the APMC management to keep the mandis shut due to the bandh, the APMC officials added. Lasalgaon APMC is one of the major wholesale mandis in the country. Around 20,000 quintals of onions are auctioned here, as well as in its other two sub-markets – Vinchur and Niphad. “Some farmers and traders had urged us to keep the market closed in view of the bandh on Monday. Accordingly, we had already declared that there will be no auction of onions. Hence, auction of around 20,000 quintal onion could not be held at Pimpalgaon and its sub-markets too,” said APMC officials.

S K Jain, president of the Shikshan Prasarak Mandali that runs S P College, said, “We are getting a lot of calls from students and parents enquiring about hostel accommodation. We are cleaning and sanitising it, and then we will start the online admission process for hostels.

A university official who did not wish to be named, said, “Till the time, there is an order from the directorate of higher education regarding reopening of colleges and hostels, we will not reopen anything for the students.

The Pune institution, in collaboration with Marathe, will launch a book on this new concept for students learning music online. Marathe’s new system eliminates the need for custom keyboards. Students can type and document compositions using it even as their guru sings or plays an instrument online or even offline. “Many teachers, who don’t have material already printed, spend hours writing notations of compositions, taking pictures and sharing these with their students. Special fonts and software are needed to digitise notations,” Marathe said. He felt the need to have a system that makes it easier to write, check and follow swarlipi. “In the traditional Paluskar system, for an instrumental music composition, a multi-line system is used where the first row contains swaras, the second row matras and the third taal indicators. The new system has everything in one line. It uses some symbols from Paluskar lipi and introduces new symbols available on keyboards for easier typing on digital devices,” said Marathe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-musicians-innovation-helps-hindustani-classical-e-learning/articleshow/86949301.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The issue has been taken up with the railway board after continuous follow up by local MLA Dileep Bankar and passengers who travel daily between Niphad and Nashik. “The height of a platform at a railway station depends upon the number of trains stopping there and passengers using the services. There has been a demand for increasing the height of the station for some time and the same has now been presented to the railway board,” an official from the Bhusawal divisional railway manager’s office said. The official also pointed out that the work could be taken up only if the board sanctioned it in the annual budget. The height of the platform on the track towards Bhusawal is very low and it has been proposed to increase it to middle level or to 455 mm, while the platform on the rail track towards Mumbai is also being considered to be increased. “The number of passengers travelling by train is increasing, but passenger amenities have not increased in the corresponding manner. The train hardly stops for two minutes. In that short time the passengers have to board and deboard. Passengers also have luggage with them. It is a tedious process and hence we have been demanding to increase the height of the platforms,” Bankar said. The passengers have also been demanding the rise in the platform given the fact that three intercity and four other trains stop at the station. Rahul Aher, who works in a private company, said the current situation is dangerous during rains as the people slip and fall down. “It takes time to move the injured passengers to safety and to find time to board the train,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhusawal-divn-for-increasing-height-of-two-rly-platforms/articleshow/86945066.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Asked why he was not using the parking lot, he said, “Parking number II full.” Airport director Santosh Dhoke had told TOI that all attempts were being made to finish the multilevel project by the end of this year. “We will inspect the road to assess why people are parking vehicles there and take corrective measures. We plan to declare the road a no halting zone,” senior inspector Ajit Lakade of the Airport traffic police said.

---||Kochi||Opposition slams Kerala government for delay in port work||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Vizhinjam international container terminal project that has overrun its declared time of completion by almost two years came in for heavy criticism from the opposition in the assembly on Monday, while the government struggled to defend itself and the Adani Ports. Ports minister Ahammad Devarkovil said that while the work has progressed in all other areas like the construction of berths, dredging etc, it is the construction of 3,100-m long breakwater that has been delayed. He said that only 810-m breakwater has been completed. The minister added that the company has cited Ockhi, floods and Covid-19 and unavailability of rock as the reasons for not being able to complete the project within the stipulated time. He said that no quarry without a 200-m buffer zone can function in the state as per the court order and because of this restriction, the government has contacted ports minister of Tamil Nadu for ensuring availability of rock. Devarkovil said that till now, 13 lakh tonnes of rock have been used and 18 lakh tonnes are available for construction. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said that the government was talking about contacting the TN minister more than one-and-a-half years after the date meant for completion of the port. He said that the company was claiming that it would complete the project in 2023, which is a delay of four years from the actual date meant for completion, and the government is justifying it. “As much as 75 lakh tonnes of rock are required for the construction. Only one-fifth of this could be used till now ,” he said. He demanded that the government should recover for the losses from the company, which comes to Rs 12 lakh per day. He added that the Rs 475 crore that has been sanctioned for the rehabilitation, resettlement and other developmental works for the families that are affected by the project should be released immediately. Kovalam MLA M Vincent, who sought leave for adjournment motion in the matter, said that the project had all favourable factors, including natural depth that will reduce the efforts and expenses of dredging, proximity to international shipping route and Kovalam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/oppn-slams-govt-for-delay-in-port-work/articleshow/86947388.cms||---

Several police teams crackdown on brewery units set up at isolated spots and seized the liquor stock. Though these brewery spots existed for quite some time, the cops for the first time used drones to get their exact locations.About 10 such country-made liquor breweries were destroyed by the crime branch teams in Bhaliyapura, Vadsar, Bil, Koyal and Ranoli. “The gangs that brew country-made liquor choose isolated spots and many of them are not even accessible by two-wheelers. We had information about such breweries but by the time the cops reached there, the accused used to flee with all the stock,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime). “So, we decided to deploy drones that captured photos of the breweries over the last two days. On Monday, our teams reached all the spots and seized hundreds of litres of country-made liquor,” Jadeja told TOI. All the breweries that were destroyed were in the ravines of Vishwamitri River. The police said that the gangs operating these breweries are well-versed with the route and usually they brew liquor at night.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-use-drones-to-spot-liquor-breweries/articleshow/86947440.cms||---

Shankar fell on the road and died a few hours later at a government hospital in Aligarh on Sunday night. The next morning, Bulandshahr police issued a statement claiming that Shankar was a tuberculosis patient and died of heart attack. But the Aligarh Medical College, where Shankar breathed his last, mentioned a “blunt injury” on his chest. Medical superintendent of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College in Aligarh, Haris Manzoor Khan, told TOI that prima facie cause of the death was “blunt trauma leading to injuries in the chest.” However, when asked about the exact nature of injuries, Khan said, “Post-mortem report will reveal further.” The alleged incident took place in Chauredha village of Bulandshahr’s Chattari region. Shankar also recorded a video on his mobile phone before his death. Barely able to speak, he just said, “I want medicine. Police have hit me.” The clip has been widely shared on social media platforms. Meanwhile, two policemen, a sub-inspector and a constable, were placed under suspension for the alleged attack. No FIR has been filed in the case so far. When asked about the doctors’ observation, senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Bulandshahr, Santosh Singh, told TOI, “We are following the rule of law in the entire case. The family has not filed any complaint as it is ‘satisfied with the police proceedings’. There was no injury on the body. But internal injury cannot be ruled out, saying anything with certainty without the post-mortem report would be a bit premature. We have already suspended two policemen in this regard.” Shankar is survived by three children and wife, who refuted the SSP’s claim. The wife, Mehati, said, “My husband was thrashed to death. I have three children, what will I do now.” She can barely read and write and other family members of Shankar too are poor and mostly unlettered. Station house officer (SHO) of Chattari police station, Rahul Chaudhary, said, “A religious fair is going on at Chauredha village. Because of the crowd, parking arrangements have been made on the outskirts of the village. This man, Gauri Shankar, was ferrying people. And as you know, policemen generally try to streamline traffic in such areas. During that process, Shankar felt some problem. He had already been a patient of tuberculosis and also faced heart-related issues. He was immediately rushed to the Aligarh hospital where he died in the early hours of Monday, because of a heart attack. A probe is on. Sub-inspector RD Sharma and constable Ravinder Singh have been suspended."

Addressing RSS volunteers, Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said there was a need to refine family values so that India can once again become a “vishwaguru”. “Families need to teach their children the values to take pride in one’s religion as a way to stop conversion of Hindus,” he said. “How do conversions happen? How do Hindu girls and boys convert to other religions for selfish reasons, for marriage? Those who are doing it are wrong. We need to teach them these values at our home,” he said.

The move comes after district collector Suraj Mandhare held a meeting with the railway administration on issues related to subways in Nashik district after a 33-year-old-woman was run over by Mumbai-bound Maharashtra Express on Sunday at 5.45 am while she was crossing the railway track. “There are eight newly constructed subways in the district and we reviewed all of them. There was major issue with the one in Nandgaon due to which the railway administration has said they would carry out corrective measures,” Mandhare said. The alleged mishap occurred as the woman chose to cross the tracks instead of taking the waterlogged subway. The railway authorities, however, claimed that there was only 6 inch water in the subway. “We have decided to place a Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel at the spot who would keep a watch on people crossing the tracks. The administration has also decided to introduce a buzzer like the one placed at manned gates. “The buzzer will be sounded every time a train is arriving to discourage people from stepping over the tracks,” a railway official said. Besides, the railway administration and Nandgaon municipal council have decided to block the opening near Lendi Nala to the subway as this was leading to the entry of water into the subway. This entry will now be blocked by putting soil immediately and then taking up relevant steps to block the entry of the water. The railways has also put in several pumps to drain out the water from the subway so that it remained opened at maximum times for the traffic, the authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rlys-deploys-rpf-at-accident-spot-in-nandgaon/articleshow/86945162.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Release of water starts as Panshet & Varasgaon full||PUNE: The state irrigation department has initiated water discharge from Panshet and Varasgaon dams after their catchments received spells good of rain in the past two days. Both dams are full and water has been released into power generation plans and flows into Khadakwasla. Water release from Khadakwasla is on hold for now as officials said that they would begin discharge if stock climbs above 85%. Khadakwasla received over 50mm rainfall in the 24 hours ending Monday morning. The damn was 70% full on Monday. “The catchments are receiving fairly good spells. We are checking if these spells are leading to an increase in water levels. Water will have to be discharged if there is a significant inflow of water. The discharge, however, will go up gradually to avoid unnecessary release. We have asked the staff deployed at the dams to keep a constant watch on water levels and rainfall activity,” an official from the state irrigation department said. On Monday, the collective stock in the four reservoirs in Khadakwasla circle was 28.57 TMC (98%) with three dams at 100%. Panshet and Varasgaon reservoirs so far have received over 2,000mm of rainfall, while Temghar has recorded 3,000mm rain since June. Rainfall in Khadakwasla increased to 685mm on Monday. Popat Shelar, deputy engineer with the irrigation department, said the water will initialy be released from Khadakwasla in Mutha canal. Similar discharge will begin into the Mutha if the water inflow into the dam goes up, he said. Meanwhile, the irrigation department on Monday also released water from Bhama Askhed dam, which is the fifth water source for Pune. Water discharge was initiated following good spells of rain. Stock in the dam has already reached to its full capacity of 7.67 TMC. Khadakwasla, Panshet, Varasgaon and Temghar are the other four that supply Pune. Ujani initiates discharge at 40,000 cusecThe irrigation department on Monday increased water release from Ujani dam to 40,000 cusec after the reservoir continued to receive water from various dams. The dam was filled to capacity last week. Ujani is largest dam in the Bhima basin in terms of storage capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/release-of-water-starts-as-panshet-varasgaon-full/articleshow/86949418.cms||Sarang Dastane

A city-based trader, Rajeev Agarwal, was allegedly waylaid by four bike-borne men while he was on the way home.

Over 180 cases have been registered in three months against those throwing garbage along the ghat, and fines worth Rs 1.75 lakh have been collected. Teams of sweepers who are keeping the road clean are also conducting daily checks. The staff said their daily monitoring starts early in the morning and continues till 2 am. The ghat had turned into an garbage dumping spot for citizens. Huge heaps of trash were visible on both sides of the stretch, posing a risk. PMC health supervisor Prashant Nigade said, “All the garbage dumped here earlier was not cleared for months. It was removed in the last three months, ever since villages along the ghat were merged into PMC limits. We are ensuring continuous efforts to keept the ghat section clean. Our teams are working even after midnight. We circulate information about action taken on our social media groups to keep all the staffers in the loop.” In addition to daily cleaning, PMC has also conducted meetings with local residents of areas like Mangdewadi and Jambhulwadi, appealing to them to not throw garbage in the ghats, and instead hand it all over to the official garbage collecting vans. Officials said these meetings were crucial, because it was observed that a large quantum of waste dumped in the ghat section was coming from these villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/24x7-vigil-at-katraj-ghat-to-curb-trash-dumping/articleshow/86949413.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Lucknow||‘Regular exercise can prevent arthritis, reduce medication’||LUCKNOW: Exercise can not only prevent arthritis, but also reduce doses of medicines for those already suffering from its complications, said doctors associated with Arthritis Foundation of Lucknow (AFoL). They were addressing a press conference on the eve of World Arthritis Day on Monday. AFoL announced that on Tuesday it will organise various events including yoga, zumba, cyclothon, and vintage car rally to raise awareness among people about arthritis. Yoga and zumba will be held in Janeshwar Mishra Park while the car rally and cyclothon will be flagged off by LDA vice-chairman Akshay Tripathi from Health City Hospital. “Patients who do regular exercise have to take fewer medicines than those who don’t. Exercise makes muscles strong and keeps body joints healthy, thus, reducing the impact of arthritis,” said AFoL secretary Dr Sandeep Kapoor. Its president Dr Sandeep Garg said that exercise should be done as prescribed by a doctor or physiotherapist. “Patients often exercise for long durations at once. Instead, they should exercise for a few times a day for short durations. Continuous exercise in one go might affect joints adversely,” he added. “Since exercise keeps weight in control, joints have to bear lesser weight and chances of arthritis reduce in people who exercise regularly,” he said. Pain, difficulty in movement and stiffness in joints are common factors among arthritis patients. Often, patients face loss in grip and are unable to pick up items during their daily lives and seek help from other family members. People should consult an expert at the earliest to ensure the disease progression is restricted, said doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/regular-exercise-can-prevent-arthritis-reduce-medication/articleshow/86951470.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Damage done to brain in kids due to B12 deficiency can be reversed: Study||Jaipur: A two-year-old Barmer boy was brought to JK Lon Hospital here with complaints of tremors, anaemia, skin pigmentation and developmental delay or regression. He did not look like other children of his age. When doctors clinically examined him and conducted certain tests, they suspected him to be a case of Infantile Tremor Syndrome (ITS), which is caused by nutritional deficiency of B-12 vitamin. For confirmatory tests, octors conducted an MRI of his brain and was found to be a case of ITS. The two-year-old boy is not the only case reported at the hospital, but over 50 such cases of children are getting treatment at JK Lon Hospital every month. Pediatricians said ITS could be prevented. “We have conducted a study on children with ITS and we have found some encouraging results of nutritional rehabilitation which suggest that supplementing the mother with vitamin B12 during pregnancy or fortifying complementary feeds with vitamin B12 may be considered because the vitamin seems to be the etiological factor in ITS as per studies,” Dr Dhan Raj Bagri, assistant professor, JK Lon Hospital. The study further shows that 96% of children with ITS were from vegetarian families. The children were presented with pallor, changed hair colour and dark pigmentation of skin. Dr Bagri said, “Unlike in cerebral palsy, brain atrophy in ITS is not permanent, it can be reversed in the ITS.” The children are given B12 supplements in injectable form for three days and followed by oral B12 supplements for three months. When the doctors conduct MRI of a two-year-old boy after three months of treatment, they found encouraging results as the cerebral atrophy had vanished. According to gynecologists, they keep monitoring health of pregnant women and check the nutritional deficiencies by conducting certain tests. “Whenever a pregnant woman comes to the hospital, we get certain tests done to find out if she has any nutritional deficiency. We find deficiency of iron and also some cases of B12 deficiencies are also reported,they are provided with the treatment accordingly,” said Dr Shalini Rathore of Mahila Chikitsalaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/damage-done-to-brain-in-kids-due-to-b12-deficiency-can-be-reversed-study/articleshow/86951519.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: All roads lead to pandals with the arrival of Goddess Durga||LUCKNOW: Amid reverberations of conch shells and sounds of dhaks, Goddess Durga was welcomed at different pandals in the city early on Monday morning. With Shashti marking the beginning of Durga Puja, the city marked a colourful first day of the auspicious festival. At the 107-year-old Bengali Club, women danced as Ma Durga finally arrived home, while the kids showered flowers on the deities. After the idol of the goddess was installed, the ritual of Bodhan (consecration) and ‘pran pratishtan’ was performed. A devotee at the pandal told that unveiling of the face of the idol is the most important ritual of Shashti. Later in the evening, the goddess was adorned with her 10 weapons as part of the ‘astra’ ritual. The idol and beautifully decorated yellow-hued pandal at Jankipuram, the Sahara State’s Durga Puja pandal caught the eyes of many. Women clad in traditional Bengali sarees and men in dhoti-kurta walked down the road under bright thematic lights to pay their obeisance to the warrior goddess. At the 49th year celebration of Trans-Gomti Durga Puja and Dussehra Committee, the simple theme of rural India added an attractive look to the festivities. To pay homage to its committee members who died of Covid, Bondhu Mahal has set up a homage corner in the pandal. “I’ve been visiting the puja pandals ever since I can remember. This was the only time when my father used to come home early from office and each day we used to visit two pandals. We lost him during the second wave of the pandemic. It feels strangely different coming without him here, but we wanted to pray for his soul,” said Anushree Pal, a devotee. “It was during the festival that my father and father-in-law met and decided to become matchmakers for my husband and I. We shifted to Ravindrapalli after our marriage 33 years ago and every year we come here to seek blessings of Durga Ma for betterment of our family,” said Aparna Bhattacharya. Tanushree Banerjee, who visited Indiranagar pandal, said, “I have been coming here since I was a child. Today, my three-year old son is hopping around as I did in my childhood.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/all-roads-lead-to-pandals-with-the-arrival-of-goddess-durga/articleshow/86951548.cms||Aditi Singh

Two accused, including a minor, have been apprehended in the case. The PCR received a call at 6.53pm regarding the stabbing of ASI Suresh Kumar. “The incident took place when Kumar was returning to his house in Begampur village from Tis Hazari,” an officer said. Kumar was off duty and in plainclothes. While he was waiting for a bus at Pushpanjali, he spotted a person stealing the rearview mirror of an Audi car. He started following the thief, who boarded an autorickshaw that was parked at a distance. “Kumar tried to stop the auto by holding onto the steel rails fixed at the top of the vehicle,” said DCP (Outer) Parvinder Singh. While the auto driver started the vehicle, his associate, who had stolen the rearview mirror, attacked the policeman with a knife and injured him on his hands. “Kumar gave up the chase after about 1km and the accused fled the spot,” the officer said. Later, the ASI was admitted to a hospital where he received 50-55 stitches for the knife gashes on his hand. Analysis of CCTV footage showed the autorickshaw moving towards Mukarba Chowk. The owner of the vehicle was found to be a resident of Bhajanpura. Police traced the owner, who said that on the day of the incident his 17-year-old son had taken the vehicle. “When the boy was apprehended, he informed us that his associate Inderjeet (24), a resident of Bhajanpura, was also involved in the crime,” the officer said. Later, Inderjeet was arrested.

The 17-year-old girl lost her vision and collapsed near her home on Wednesday. After three painful days, she died in a hospital on Friday. The father of the girl, a fruit vendor, had filed a police complaint against unknown persons on Wednesday. Since then, police were trying to connect the dots of the case, where the victim’s kin had no doubts on anyone. The girl was dropped off near her home in an e-rickshaw. “We questioned the e-rickshaw driver, tracked the girl’s phone calls, scanned CCTV footage available in various intersections from where the rickshaw passed and even from around her college as girl’s father had told us that he had dropped her to college on Wednesday morning,” said SP city, Vineet Bhatnagar. Police found the clue about the accused, Sooraj, from the CCTV. He could be seen meeting the girl at the gate of her college. When he was arrested, the accused told police that he was having an affair with the girl. “The girl was known to this man and wanted to marry him. To get rid of her, he tricked her and took her to the hotel room. He then pretended to drink poison. To save him, the girl snatched the bottle of poison and drank it herself. He then took an e-rickshaw and left her outside her own house before fleeing from the spot,” said a policeman involved in the investigation. According to police, Soraj remained in contact with the girl’s parents all this while.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/class-xii-girl-poisoned-by-boyfriend-who-wanted-to-get-rid-of-her/articleshow/86947470.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Pune||Pune: Scaled down for second year in a row, caution marks start of Durga Puja||PUNE: Durga Puja began in the city on Monday with festivities and the associated events being scaled down for the second consecutive year because of the pandemic. Organizers and devotees celebrating the autumnal festival modified their plans by opting for online streaming of the puja, parcel delivery of “bhog” (traditional food offered to the deity) and streamlined “darshan” in adherence with the Covid rules. Anup Dutta, general secretary of Pune Kali Bari, said Durga Puja celebrations were inaugurated by their temple priest on Sunday. “A limited number of visitors are being allowed to enter the temple at a time, do darshan, sit for five-ten minutes and leave so the next batch can enter. We are allowing 25-30 people per batch of visitors,” said Dutta. The Pune Kali Bari’s temple, located near Khadki Railway Station, has been decorated as a replica of the Jor Bangla temple in Bishnupur, West Bengal. “The decoration is eco-friendly, made of terracotta, like the original 17th Century temple. We have also got Govindbhog rice and spices from Kolkata for the bhog, which will be given as a parcel for those who have done an online booking,” said Dutta. Congress Bhavan will remain devoid of celebrations this year too, as the Bangiya Sankriti Samsad has shifted its festivities to another location. “We have made a makeshift stage on our premises in Bhoslenagar and installed the idols of Durga and her four children. Only members will be invited for the event,” said Madhumita Ghosh, Bangiya Sankriti Samsad’s vice-president (cultural). “Though the puja and sandya aarti will be done at Bhosle Nagar, it will be broadcast online as well as on YouTube. We will also be broadcasting cultural performances by children and adults such as dances recitals, programme by theatre artistes, audio plays and so on,” said Ghosh. The Bangiya Sankriti Samsad will give packed “bhog” to members. Since the regular pandals are not having any events this year, there has been a huge demand for “bhog”, which is being catered to by home chefs. Banalata Sen, co-founder of Breaking Basmati caterers, said she has seen a 100% surge in orders compared to last year from Bengali as well as non-Bengali communities. “We have tweaked the ‘bhog’ menu to bring some change and not to make it repetitive. Though essential items such as the ‘khichudi’ (medley of rice, lentils and vegetables), ‘begun bhaja’ (fried brinjal), ‘chutney’ and such remain the same, we have added ‘channa bhappa’ (steamed home-made cottage cheese), which has become a hit with our patrons,” added Sen. Tanmoy Chakraborty, founder of Pune Bengalis, has cancelled pandal-hopping plans as not many events are happening around the city. “I am collecting all the information about where Durga Puja events are happenin and if ‘bhog’ will be available there,” said Chakraborty. Citizens also plan on heading to Bengali restaurants as they might miss out visiting food stalls that are usually set up at pandals. Kharadi resident Monalisa Sen, “There are ishes such as fish chops, cutlets, luchi aloo-dum and Kolkata biryanl. But to have some festive feeling, our family will go for dinner to a Bengali restaurant nearby which serves such favourites.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/scaled-down-for-2nd-year-in-a-row-caution-marks-start-of-durga-puja/articleshow/86949476.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune ZP, said, “We have prepared a draft of the project ‘Namami Chandra-Bhaga’, under which five STPs would be created on the river bank. Our team has taken samples of the river water at various locations to carry out an analysis. The total cost of the STPs is Rs30 crore.” The STPs will come up at Koregaon Bhima, Perne in Haveli, Rahu and Mandavgun Pharata in Shirur and Daund tehsils, respectively, and Bhigwan in Indapur tehsil. “We have asked people to give suggestions on the project, before sending the proposal to the state government for budgetary sanction,” said a senior ZP official. A senior official from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, said, “Industrial effluents and sewage from housing societies are released in the allied rivers of the Bhima. So, the STPs on these rivers are necessary.” The state government plans to make Bhima river pollution-free. The river resembles the shape of the moon in the town and devotees come to take a ‘holy dip’ in the river before going for the darshan of Lord Vitthal and Rukmini at Pandharpur temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-zp-to-set-up-5-stps-along-bhima-river-project-to-cost-rs-30cr/articleshow/86949467.cms||Sandip Dighe

The professor, Rajan Shinde, was heading the English department of Maulana Azad College for close to two decades. He had earlier served with Navkhanda women’s college for a few years. Citing forensic analysis, police suspect that the murder was committed between 1.30am and 2.30am. Police commissioner Nikhil Gupta and deputy police commissioner Deepak Girhe also went to the bungalow and spent five hours there. The autopsy report has revealed deep slits on Shinde’s neck and wrists apart from several vertical cuts on his forehead. “The gashes on the wrists were so deep that even his bones were cut, causing profuse bleeding,” said a medical authority from the Government Medical College and Hospital here. Shinde’s 17-year-old son Rohit, who is currently pursuing law from the National Law University in Mumbai, told police that he was the first to see his father lying in a pool of blood. He said he immediately drove to the nearby MIT hospital to fetch an ambulance. However, he rammed into another car while on the way, injuring a person. He was caught by passersby who let him off after he told them about his father. When the ambulance came to the house, the driver refused to take Shinde’s body saying it would amount to tampering with evidence at the crime scene, Rohit said. Rohit and his sister Chaitali (20) informed the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-prof-found-brutally-murdered-at-home/articleshow/86945274.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Delhi||Sharp spike in farm fire episodes as peak pollution season nears||NEW DELHI: An increasing number of harvest stubble fires are being observed in the neighbouring states, with reports of around 240 in northern India on Sunday. Track the pollution level in your cityTill date, however, the pollutants from such fires are a negligible component of Delhi’s impure air. Experts said that because of local winds that are lifting dust, the proportion of coarser particles is higher than that of respirable carbon in the city air. Gufran Beig, who founded the Union earth ministry’s forecasting body System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, or SAFAR, informed TOI, “Though the number of farm fires have started rising in the neighbourhood of Delhi, the contribution of stubble burning to the city’s air is less than 5% with only a nominal increase recorded in the PM2.5 level. Due to high local winds and dust lifting, the lead pollutant is PM10 rather than PM2.5.” Beig also warned, “After the monsoon fully withdraws from the country, the stagnant weather conditions will begin to impact the air quality in Delhi. So, if the harvest stubble burning increases, it may impact the city’s air quality severely this time.” Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) on Monday was 166, which falls in the ‘moderate’ category according to Central Pollution Control Board. In its bulletin for the day, SAFAR similarly said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the moderate category with PM10 as the main pollutant. Due to very dry conditions, local dust gets re-suspended in the air, leading to high PM10 readings. The anticyclonic condition over north-west India helps in meso-scale transport of dust from the desert region. This condition is leading to moderate AQI in Delhi and will continue to be so for the next three days.” Satellite imagery shows the daily count of farm fires going up to over 200 in the neighbouring states. L S Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “Between September 1 and October 10, Punjab and Haryana, respectively, recorded 846 and 362 farm fires. But the daily fire count in Punjab and Haryana combined is slightly below 250 at the moment.” Kurinji added, “We are now in the second week of October, only two weeks away from the peak stubble burning window (late October to early November). During this time, the fire count is expected to rise to 3,000-4,000 daily. This additional emission load from regional sources, combined with local sources and unfavourable meteorological conditions, will cause a deterioration in the air quality over the Indo-Gangetic plain. Deeper emission cuts across sectors are critical to keeping pollution levels in check."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sharp-spike-in-farm-fire-episodes-as-peak-pollution-season-nears/articleshow/86951610.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Delhi||Delhi: Gangster shot dead in Rohini shootout fallout||NEW DELHI: In what seems to be the first retaliation to the killing of gangster Jitender Gogi at a Rohini court on September 24, a criminal was shot dead in Rohini on Monday evening. The deceased was identified as Deepak alias Radhe, a henchman of jailed gangster Sandeep Dhillu, who is a confidant of incarcerated gangsters Neeraj Bawana and Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuriya. Tajpuriya is believed to have orchestrated Gogi's killing in the Rohini court, where two of his shooters were also killed in firing by Delhi Police personnel. According to police, Deepak was intercepted by gunmen in Rohini's Sector 15-16 market and they opened fire from close range, possibly using 7.65mm pistols late on Monday evening. The shooters fled on a bike while Deepak lay in a pool of blood. The police control room was informed and the cops rushed Deepak, who was accused by name in five previous criminal cases, to the hospital. He was already dead by the time they reached the hospital. An FIR was registered in KN Katju Marg police station. Reacting to the incident, a senior police officer said, “As of now, we are not certain about this being the result of a gang war. Investigation has been taken up and efforts are being made to nab the shooting with a number of teams in their pursuit.” Deepak was last arrested along with gangster Sandeep Dhillu in 2019, a year after he had escaped from custody. On February 19, 2018, Dhillu was brought to Maulana Azad Dental Hospital for treatment from prison. He managed to flee from the cops after his associates, among them Deepak, threw chilli powder at the policemen and then opening fire at them. Dhillu had been running an extortion racket from inside the jail with help from associates like Deepak, Paramjeet, Radhey and Naresh. They used to collect the extortion money from businessmen of Delhi and Haryana. While on the run, Dhillu joined hands with Bawana and Tajpuriya and started working for them. In February this year, the Crime Branch arrested one Sultan, a member of Dhillu’s gang, who disclosed that he and others had killed a member of the Gogi gang. Dhillu's men had waylaid Kulbir on the Karala-Khanjawala Road when he was travelling in his Thar jeep and pumped more than a dozen bullets into him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gangster-shot-in-rohini-shootout-fallout/articleshow/86951625.cms||---

---||Agra||Coal shortage: Long power cuts in western UP during festive season||AGRA: Several villages in western Uttar Pradesh are reeling under frequent power cuts for the past four days during the ongoing festive season. In Agra region for instance, more than 300 villages are getting only 10 to 15 hours of electricity a day. Residents say this has come at the worst possible time since demand had started to pick up following a dismal business outlook in the past few months due to the pandemic. In particular, those involved in Agra's shoe and 'petha' manufacturing units, and Firozabad's bangle and glass factories are worst-hit since the power shortage has affected their businesses. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said that the power crisis should be resolved in view of festivals. "In such times, uninterrupted power supply at night is essential," the CM said. Presiding over a review meeting in the aftermath of the power crisis following a shortage in coal stock, the CM asked the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) chairman M Devraj to assess the coal availability in all power plants and take necessary steps to mitigate the crisis. According to sources, as against a demand of around 18,000 MW, the state is able to get only around 14,000 MW supply, forcing unscheduled rostering in various district headquarters and villages. To meet the shortage, UPPCL is buying extra power on an emergency basis, sources said. A senior UPPCL official, who wished not to be named, said, “As per the government roster, rural and semi-urban areas are supposed to get power supply for 18 hours, but we are managing 12 hours as of now due to reduced availability of electricity in the state.” Expressing concern over the looming crisis, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad (power consumer council) chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma said, “The coal shortage is adversely affecting the power supply in the state. Production has reduced by 4500 MW. Hariduaganj and Parichha thermal plants have run out of coal stock while Obra and Anpa plants are left with stock sufficient for only two-three days. The state's eight private thermal plants are left with stock for about five days." Verma added, “With the power shortage, the per unit electricity rates are now shooting up to as high as Rs 20 on the exchange. The Centre needs to fix the maximum per unit price of electricity that the energy exchanges sold to the states. Energy exchanges are trying to take advantage of the crisis by selling power at higher rates." "The state government should make efforts to increase hydroelectric power production and immediately declare a relief package for the power corporation to manage power supply amid the coal crisis", he further said. President of Agra Vyapar Mandal TN Agarwal said, "In industrial areas, factories are unable to function following long power cuts during the day. Agra district falls under the eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone and the use of generators is prohibited, which is adding to our problems." Meanwhile, Amit Kishore, managing director, Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (DVVNL), which is responsible for power supply in 21 districts in west UP, said, “For now, there is no crisis-like situation due to the coal shortage. The state has ordered the purchase of electricity from all available sources, including the energy exchange, to meet its power demand. All the required actions are being taken as per the roster plan. We are working to improve the situation in the rural areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/coal-shortage-long-power-cuts-in-western-up-during-festive-season-businesses-affected/articleshow/86947482.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Delhi||Court summons BJP’s Vijender Gupta in defamation case filed by Delhi minister Kailash Gahlot||NEW DELHI: A court on Monday summoned BJP legislator Vijender Gupta on a criminal defamation complaint filed by Delhi cabinet minister Kailash Gahlot, saying that prima facie he had committed the offence of defamation. Gahlot has filed the criminal defamation complaint against the MLA for allegedly making “false”, “scandalous” and “defamatory” allegations against him in connection with procurement of 1,000 low-floor buses by Delhi Transport Corporation. “The court is of the considered view on the basis of oral submission, document placed and proved on record in pre-summoning evidence by the complainant and the deposition of complainant witnesses that accused Vijender Gupta has prima facie committed the offences punishable under sections 499 (defamation)/500 (punishment for defamation)/501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory) of IPC,” additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey said. The court summoned Gupta to appear before it on November 16. It also perused the tweets and Facebook posts allegedly published by Gupta. The court noted that one of the complainant witnesses had deposed that the defamatory publication allegedly damaged and tarnished Gahlot’s image among the public. Another complainant witness has said that from the newspaper and social media publications, he came in the notice regarding the alleged defamatory allegation and was disturbed and pained upon reading them, the court added. The minister has alleged that “Gupta tarnished his reputation and was involved in making reckless, unfounded, malicious, scandalous, mala fide, mischievous, libellous, spiteful and defamatory allegations against him for political mileage”. According to the complaint, Gupta has been continuously making allegations of corruption since March 8, 2021 with “a deliberate intention and ill-will to tarnish the reputation of the complainant in the eyes of right-thinking people”. The accused has used the social media platforms irresponsibly and in a destructive manner to malign and target the reputation of the complainant, it claimed. As per the complaint, the effort of Delhi government and the complainant was to bring transparency and accountability to the process of procurement and maintenance of buses for trouble-free performance and availability of sufficient number of buses at any given point of time. It claimed that the purchase of 1,000 buses for the benefit of Delhiites did not go well with Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-summons-bjps-gupta-in-defamation-case-filed-by-gahlot/articleshow/86951577.cms||Usha Das

The petitioner C Ravi joined as a grade II police constable in 1998 and was working in Ramanathapuram district. A charge-memo was issued to him in 2003, as he availed leave without informing the higher officials. After an inquiry, a punishment of stoppage of increment for a period of two years was imposed on Ravi. Similarly, punishment of postponement of increment for three years with cumulative effect was imposed on the petitioner as he failed to report to bandobust duty for Mandaikadu Bhagavathy Amman temple festival in Kanyakumari district in 2012. Challenging both the orders, the petitioner filed two petitions in 2016.Justice S S Sundar observed that the contention of the petitioner’s counsel is that he had valid reasons for his absence as he was suffering from illness. This shows that even now, the petitioner is under the impression that he did not commit any offence or misconduct.The judge observed that the petitioner in 2003 and 2012, had withdrawn himself from duty under the pretext of physical ailments. The petitioner did not participate in the inquiry on both the occasions and no attempt was made by him to produce any material to justify his unauthorised absence.Observing that the court is unable to find any irregularity or illegality in the punishment, the judge refused to interfere with the order and dismissed the petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-cops-pleas-challenging-punishment/articleshow/86951627.cms||Kaushik Kannan

One who commits such an offence would do anything against the society for money,” judicial magistrate K Karthik observed while pronouncing the judgment. The judge said that the accused M Karthi had used modern technology by forging an advocate identity card, order copy of the Dindigul principal district court and cheated money from the couple by showing them that their son was acquitted from a murder case. This case is yet another classic example for how modern electronic technology should not be used, the court said. The court sentenced Karthi to undergo imprisonment for offence under IPC sections 466, 468, 471 and 420 . The accused has to undergo all imprisonments consecutively. The case of the prosecution is that complainant Umaiyan, a retired teacher and his wife have two children including a son Sivanath. Karthi’s brother Sivan and Umaiyan’s son were named as fifth and fourth accused respectively in a murder case which was registered by the Dindigul North police on September 21, 2015. Karthi, who introduced himself as an advocate went to Umaiyan’s house and assured that his brother and Sivanath would be acquitted. Karthi also said that he would ask for fees whenever required. Believing this, Umaiyan had paid a total Rs 43.08 lakh to Karthi in several instalments from 2015 to 2017. On January 5,2021, Karthi went to his house and gave him a copy of a court order stating that both Sivanath and Sivan were acquitted. When Umaiyan showed the order to other known advocates, he learnt that Karthi was not an advocate and the order was fake with a forged signature of the principal district judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/court-convicts-man-for-faking-order-calls-it-digital-terrorism/articleshow/86951620.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Environment minister Gopal Rai said the process was started from Fatehpur Jat village in Narela assembly constituency. “Pollution in Delhi increases during the winter season and its sources include dust, vehicles, garbage burning and biomass. However, the most crucial problem is stubble burning. The smoke of burnt stubble starts from Punjab and Haryana and reaches Delhi. To curb this issue, we started spraying the bio-decomposer solution on farmlands in Delhi last year and the results were appreciable. The decomposed stubble got converted into compost and enriched the soil,” said Rai. Last year, Delhi government had received applications from farmers for spraying the bio-decomposer solution on 2,000 acres. However, this year applications have come for spraying the solution on about 4,000 acres. “The farmers who haven’t applied yet will be issued a contact number to avail of this service free of cost. Farmers can register themselves on 96438 44287 and we will send a team to visit the farms and help them with the process,” said the minister. Rai said, “It is important to know that the problems caused by stubble burning cannot be solved without combined efforts of all stakeholders. The smoke from stubble burning has started to come to Delhi’s airspace. If we don’t pay attention now, the air will become heavily polluted. I appeal to the farmers to utilise the bio-decomposer solution, plough the field with a rotavator and amply irrigate the farmlands so that the stubble can melt and get converted into compost.” The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) had asked Delhi government to get a third-party audit done. “In its audit report, the central government agency praised the performance of the bio-decomposer solution. We submitted the reports to CAQM and also approached the Union environment minister and governments of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab for using the solution in their states,” Rai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-kickstarts-spraying-of-bio-decomposer-in-fields/articleshow/86951631.cms||---

Teachers have been asked to identify family members of students, studying from Classes I to VII, who need to get vaccinated yet. The schools, which functioned as domiciliary care centres and Covid first-line treatment centres, have been asked to sanitize the premises in two days with the support of fire force. Eighty-five schools hosted Covid patients or those who required quarantine facilities in Ernakulam. It has also been decided to speed up the vaccination drive for around 470 remaining teaching and non-teaching staff in schools. Around 2,67,000 students are studying from Classes I to X in Ernakulam. “Of these, around 2,30,000 are in Classes I to VII. Class teachers of these students have been asked to identify family members who have not received both doses of vaccine against Covid-19,” said an official associated with the education department. There are 994 schools in Ernakulam which are under general education department. The report on schools, which are ready to reopen next month, will be submitted to the government on October 25. Meanwhile, CBSE schools’ association office-bearers said they are not going to start transportation of students when the schools reopen next month. They cite operational difficulty due to the Covid protocol, in transporting students in school buses. Parents should arrange transportation facility for students, who are willing to attend offline classes. The schools will continue with online classes for those who want to continue with it. Though all CBSE schools will reopen on November 1, some expressed unwillingness to start offline classes for students in lower grades in the beginning. “Fifty per cent of students are willing to attend offline class in some schools while it is 20-25% in other schools. But the number of students who want to join their friends in schools will increase once the classes resume. However, the schools are not in a position to start transportation facility for students as the conditions stipulated by the government, to a larger extent, are impossible to be implemented. If the government allows two students in a seat in the school bus, we will be able to operate school buses,” said CBSE school managements’ association president T P M Ibrahim Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kin-of-students-to-get-vaccine-priority/articleshow/86947496.cms||T C Sreemol

The first MRF of rural Karnataka has been operating since August this year at Nitte gram panchayat (GP) limits in Karkala. The first facility is collecting nearly 2.5 tonnes of dry waste everyday, said Sharath Kumar, project coordinator of Saahas Zero Waste Management Pvt Ltd, which has facilitated the project. He said the work on three more projects are in progress. In Ballari and Ramnagar, the construction works are in progress, while in Dakshina Kannada, land-levelling work at Yedapadavu is being taken up. The government plans to set up about 100 such projects across the state in the next three years, he said. At Karkala, the pilot project is being managed by Mangala Resource Management Pvt Ltd. The government had sanctioned nearly Rs 2.5 crore for the project that was also supported financially by the local bodies. It has the capacity to manage nearly 10 tonnes of dry waste per day. They collect dry waste from about 75,000 households and 6,000 small commercial establishments in 42 GPs. At the facility, where more than 30 people have been employed, dry waste is being sorted under 30 categories, baled and dispatched to authorised destinations. The facility, set up on 1acre land, collects waste from about seven GPs everyday through a seven tonne capacity truck. A miyawaki forest has also been developed and borewell recharge is being taken up. Recently, ZP CEO Naveen Bhat dispatched non-recyclable plastic materials, commonly known as multi-layered plastic (MLP), to a cement kiln for co-processing with support from Hindustan Unilever Ltd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/karnataka-to-get-three-more-material-recovery-units/articleshow/86947276.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: GRMB decides to take over Peddavagu||HYDERABAD: Succumbing to pressure from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and also issues involved in operational and maintenance of projects, Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) has decided to take over irrigation projects notified by the Centre in a phased manner. To begin with, Peddavagu in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district on Godavari river, which is a common project for the two Telugu states, will be taken over by GRMB. GRMB chairman J Chandrashekhar Iyer on Monday held a meeting with irrigation officials of both Telangana and AP at Jal Soudha on implementation of the gazette notification, issued on July 15 by the Union ministry of jal shakti, from October 14. Though over a dozen projects were listed in the notification, there is only one common project for both Telangana and AP. The meeting was attended by Telangana special chief secretary, irrigation, Rajat Kumar and AP secretary, water resources, J Shyamal Rao along with officials. Peddavagu irrigates about 13,000 acres in Andhra Pradesh and 2,600 acres in Telangana. The head regulator and reservoir of the project are in Telangana. “As of now, the decision has been taken on handing over Peddavagu on Godavari. Technically, there is no word ‘taking over’ of projects from the states, it is ‘handing over’ of the projects to the Boards. Once GRMB gives final proposal, it will be placed before chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for approval,” special chief secretary Rajat Kumar told TOI. During the transition phase, since GRMB did not have staff, Telangana irrigation staff would be deputed for operation and maintenance of the project, Rajat Kumar said. Official sources said for the maintenance of the project, Telangana would bear 15% of the cost, while the AP government the rest, 85%, as AP has more ayacut than Telangana. Though there was such an agreement earlier, the AP government did not release it share, irrigation officials said. The AP irrigation officials have reportedly raised the issue of lower riparian states’ rights as the AP is at the tail end of the river and asked to bring some projects in Maharashtra on Godavari under the purview of the Board. The sources said the meeting also discussed about the seed money, ₹200 crore each, sought from both the states. Though they have agreed to send the proposal to their respective finance departments, the officials asked detailed requisition where the Board wants to spend that amount. “The government cannot release the amount just based on a letter. There will be audit problems in future and some issues like who will give utilization certificate for the funds need to be clarified,” Rajat Kumar said. Krishna River Management Board meeting with representatives of both the states would be held on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/grmb-decides-to-take-over-peddavagu/articleshow/86949750.cms||Koride Mahesh

The condition of roads dug up for underground drainage, drinking water supply and other works has gone from bad to worse during the rain, he said. “The condition of roads in the core city and areas added to the corporation in 2011 is worse. In the northern part of the corporation, there are places in the 15 wards where even mud roads have not been laid for years. Those roads have been dug up for underground drainage and not laid. Residents have been told that they will be re-laid only after drinking water pipeline works are completed,” he added. Venkatesan told TOI that he sought Rs 50 crore for relaying roads in core city areas according to road transport ministry standards and the remaining Rs 10 crore to temporarily fix bad roads in added areas. He pointed out that expediting road works is also important in improving air quality in the city. Venkatesan said that the city will get its next instalment of grant under the 15th finance commission only if the air quality improves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/allot-rs-60-crore-to-relay-city-roads-madurai-mp-tells-cm/articleshow/86951652.cms||---

The certificate is crucial for securing trade licences for operating shops and commercial establishments in the cantonment limits. “We have undertaken a drive to ensure that all such establishments have valid trade licences,” said Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, PCB. Rohit Ranpise, chief fire officer, PCB, said, “Our teams have been visiting establishments to check the electric supply arrangements and circuits. Open wiring connection causes most short circuit incidents. During inspection, we focus on this aspect and suggest measures.”  “At many places, we have recommended to the owners to change the old lines to prevent a tragedy like a short-circuit in future,” Ranpise said. Besides, the team members also check whether the establishments have enough space for emergency exit. “We have told medium-size shops to have extinguishers for use during emergencies,” said another official. Some shopkeepers said that they run their facilities on rent and their owners do not pay heed to this aspect. “In this case, we will not be able to make a change to the original arrangement unless the owner allows us to do so. The cantonment authorities should look into this,” said a bakery owner. Darshan Chawla, founder secretary, Clover centre shopping complex, said, “Some shops at the centre are just 100 to 150 square feet in size. So, they find it difficult to get done their fire audit done. The board needs to pay heed to this aspect, too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcb-starts-issuing-fire-audit-documents-to-shops/articleshow/86949573.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Hyderabad||A day after loss, Prakash Raj quits MAA||Hyderabad: A visibly hurt Prakash Raj, who lost to Manchu Vishnu for the president’s post in the Movie Artistes Association (MAA) elections, resigned from the association. He announced on Monday that he was severing ties with MAA and giving up the primary membership of the association. “It is a matter of self-respect for me. The issue of local and non-local has been highlighted to show that I was a non-local. Should it be considered as my parents’ fault for not being Telugu,” he asked. Actor Naga Babu, brother of Chiranjeevi, who supported Prakash Raj in the elections, also announced that he was quitting from MAA. When pointed out that technically only a MAA member was allowed to act in Telugu films produced here, Prakash Raj retorted: “Will they also choose to cut my bond with producers, directors and the audience. Let them do what they want to do. I am deeply hurt at me being described as a ‘non-Telugu’ and showing my place in the Telugu film industry that I should not occupy a post in MAA.” A national award winning actor, Prakash Raj angrily said: “I will not work or be part of an association which has such an ideology.” He, however, made it clear that he would not refuse to act in Telugu films, if roles came his way even if he was not part of MAA. Elections to the MAA were held on Sunday and Manchu Vishnu won against Prakash Raj. The campaign mainly focused on Prakash Raj being a ‘non-Telugu’. “They have shown that a non-Telugu can become a member but cannot desire to win in the . They have also spoken about changing the by-laws not to allow a non-Telugu contest the polls. I have understood this clearly,” he said. Prakash Raj said he was not taking a hasty decision in quitting MAA. “I have understood the mindset,” he said. He hoped Manchu Vishnu will lead MAA well and fulfil all his promises. Bandi’s tukde tukde jibe slammed Prakash Raj also referred to a statement by BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar appreciating movie artistes for not electing the ‘tukde tukde’ gang. “This is their mentality of describing me. I have remained in politics despite all the criticism that came my way even after I lost in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. But in so far as MAA is concerned, I cannot be part of an organisation that has clearly shown that it does not want me,” he said. With his campaign to get Prakash Raj elected as president of MAA not giving the expected result, Naga Babu said he was also quitting MAA. “I do not wish to continue in the association that has raked up the local/non-local issue during the elections. My resignation will be sent to the association in 48 hours,” he said. He explained that he had made a conscious decision and was not influenced by anyone to quit MAA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/a-day-after-loss-prakash-raj-quits-maa/articleshow/86950139.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Lucknow||VIP launches poll campaign, to hold rallies in eastern UP from October 17||LUCKNOW: The Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has sounded its poll bugle with Nishad Chetna rallies in the state. Launching its campaign from Agra on Saturday, the party held a rally in Sultanpur on Monday. From October 17-31, VIP plans to organise public meetings in east UP districts, which have sizeable population of Nishads. Addressing a meeting, party president and Bihar minister Mukesh Sahni said Nishads should not be a yaachak (seeker or petitioner) but a partner in governance and must “wield power.” The demands raised by the party include reservation for Nishads, Kewats, Binds, Kashyaps and other communities who live and thrive along rivers. “If they can get reservation in West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi, why not in UP,” Sahni asked. Nishad Party, which is supporting the BJP government in the state, is already in the fray and fighting for reservation for the community in UP. Addressing Nishad Chetna rally on Saturday, Sahni said “some selfish Nishad leaders are working for the benefit of their families”. The party, which came into existence in 2018, will test political waters for the first time in UP in the 2022 assembly elections. In Bihar, VIP is a part of the government and has four MLAs. The party plans to set up a robust organizational structure in the state by December. “Out of 403 seats in UP, 169 have sizeable population of Nishad, Kewat, Bind and Kashyaps,” national spokesperson of the party, Dev Jyoti, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vip-launches-poll-campaign-to-hold-rallies-in-eastern-up-from-october-17/articleshow/86951680.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Delhi||22-year-old arrested for murdering blind man after argument||NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly killing a blind man following an argument over a petty issue in Sultanpuri. Police said the accused had attacked the visually impaired man with a stone, causing fatal injuries on his forehead. The blind man has been identified as Radhe Shyam, who lived at a pan shop that he used to run near the Sultanpuri bus terminal. Police received a call on October 6 about the attack in northwest Delhi. A team reached the spot and took the man to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital where he was admitted for treatment. “The man had sustained critical injuries on the right side of his forehead and died during treatment. His body was shifted for postmortem and a case of murder was registered,” said a senior officer. Police found that the deceased was attacked with a blunt object. “Initial questioning of witnesses revealed that a man had gotten into an altercation with Radhe Shyam during which the accused attacked him using a stone,” the officer said. “Our team checked numerous CCTV camera footage, developed local intelligence and questioned local criminals and drug addicts to identify the culprit. The suspect was finally identified as Imran alias Ashu, a 22-year-old resident of Aman Vihar,” he added. Imran told police that he worked as a carpenter at a local furniture shop. “Around 9.30pm on October 6, he was near the bus terminal. Imran said as he was crossing the spot, he fell on the road after colliding with Radhe Shyam. An angry Imran hurled abuses at him and at a blind woman who was also present near the spot,” the officer said. When both objected to his abuses, Imran allegedly got more angry and picked up a stone and threw it at the blind man. It hit him on the forehead, claimed the officer. As Radhe Shyam collapsed on the road, Imran fled, he added. Police have found that Imran had no previous criminal record.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/22-year-old-arrested-for-murdering-blind-man-after-argument/articleshow/86951675.cms||---

They said it was strange to put a ban on Chhath Puja celebrations when markets, shops and cinema halls and even swimming pools in Delhi were open. “Lakhs of people living in Delhi belong to the Purvanchali community and celebrate Chhath with great fervour, gaiety and faith. Arvind Kejriwal does not like this,” said Gupta. Tiwari said that the AAP government should allow celebration of Chhath Puja in public places with strict Covid protocols but should not ban the festival, which is connected with the sentiments of the people. “The WHO says the coronavirus enters through eyes, nose and mouth whereas in Chhath Puja, devotees just wade into knee-deep water and do not take bath. There is no chance of coronavirus spread when people celebrate the festival in riverbanks, ponds, etc,” said Tiwari. AAP said the health and lives of people were most important for them. “We feel sad that BJP is playing dirty politics over it. It has no concern for the lives of the people,” the party added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-to-organise-protest-outside-kejriwals-house-over-chhath-ban/articleshow/86951672.cms||---

He was speaking after inaugurating the registration department’s first grievance redressal camp in the state at the integrated complex of the department at Rajakambeeram on Monday.Moorthy said such grievance redressal camps of the department would be organised in all districts on Mondays from 10am to 1pm. The petitions received from the people would be disposed of by officials within a week. Asked about the role of the department in preventing temple land from being encroached, Moorthy explained that steps are being taken by HR & CE department to identify and retrieve such land. The details of the land parcels are sent to the registration department. A mechanism has been put in place at sub-registrar offices to ensure that survey numbers of the retrieved land parcels are not registered by anyone in future.Moorthy said rowdyism in any manner will not be tolerated. “The state government or the chief minister or ministers are not shielding any rowdy element in any manner. The police department has been functioning independently and is working to curb it. Action will be taken against anyone who is in the wrong no matter who,” he added.The minister’s comment comes in the wake of former minister Sellur K Raju meeting with the city police commissioner and submitting a petition saying that murders, robberies and chain snatching incidents were on the rise and urging him to take appropriate measures to tackle it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/new-system-has-helped-curb-fraudulent-registrations-min/articleshow/86951633.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Vax gender gap improves but Maharashtra, Delhi, many others lag||MUMBAI: The gender gap in Covid vaccination has disappeared in 11 Indian states, but it is sharp in most others, including those with a higher human development index such as Maharashtra, Delhi and Goa. A chart drawn up on the basis of gender parity index —a socioeconomic index developed by Unesco to measure gender equity in education— shows India’s GPI is 0.98 (the ideal ratio would be 1). “This index was 0.906 on June 27,” said Dr Sachin Pandey, a Gandhinagar-based professor who maintains the data for his website, https://covidtikaherokuapp.com. The states with best GPI at the moment are Andhra Pradesh (1.164), Assam (1.016), Karnataka (0.1012) and West Bengal (1.008). In research terms, a GPI between 0.97 and 1.03 indicates parity between genders.  The national capital, Delhi, is at 0.836 while Goa is a bit better at 0.857.  In Maharashtra, where special only-women’s day drives are held in its capital Mumbai, the GPI is 0.913. The gap in sheer numbers in Maharashtra is 4.78 crore shots to men versus 4.06 crore to women. For Dr Vibhuti Patel, professor from Tata Institute of Social Sciences, while the all-India figures look decent, “there are regional variations” that need to be addressed. “The vaccination drive has gaps on the lines of class, cases and gender,” she said. “Even in cities, lower middle classes or even the deprived classes have ensured that their men get vaccinated even if it means paying money. The mindset that men and boys are more important and should get vaccinated before girls and women is evident,” she said. In this backdrop, can India achieve the perfect index of 1? Pandey said that while the all-India GPI improved over the past four months, it is unlikely to reach the perfect score of 1. He gives two reasons: Migration and the fear among pregnant women to get vaccinated. Metro cities such as Delhi and Mumbai are likely to have a low GPI. “This could be because though migrants rushed back with their families to their homes during the first wave, they returned to metro cities alone. They got vaccinated in cities while the wives got vaccinated in their home state. This could explain why states such as Bihar and Odisha have a higher ratio of 1.089 and 0.977, respectively,” he said. And, while 4% to 5% of the female population would be pregnant at any given time, only 1.5 lakh women have taken the vaccine so far in the country. “A gap of 0.2 to 0.3 will thus show up due to pregnant women’s reluctance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vax-gender-gap-improves-but-maharashtra-delhi-many-others-lag/articleshow/86949581.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Kochi||Cops seize 31kg of ganja sent from Andhra via courier||Kochi: Drug cartels seem to have found a fresh and innovative way to smuggle in ganja into the district, as Ernakulam Rural police on Monday seized nearly 31kg of ganja which was sent to Perumbavoor from Andhra Pradesh through a courier service. Police arrested two persons in connection with the seizure when they turned up at the office of the courier agency at Kunnuvazhy in Perumbavoor to collect the parcel. The arrested persons were identified as Muhammed Muneer, 27, of Kothamangalam and Arshad Pathanaayath, 35, of MES College Road, Marambally. Earlier, excise and central agencies had found that courier services were being used by drug runners to smuggle in synthetic drugs. However, seizure of such a huge quantity of ganja from a courier parcel is unheard of. Rural police said a specific information received by district police chief (Ernakulam Rural) SP K Karthick led to the seizure. Police said the parcel has come from Andhra Pradesh and an investigation was on to find the sender. According to police, the contraband was smuggled in with the intention of distributing it to other parts of the district and state. Officers said the parcel came in three packages and each had the contraband stashed in it in small packets. Rural police said a special team, including district anti-narcotic special action task force (Dansaf) and Perumbavoor police, was formed to conduct the investigation. The team which made the seizure included narcotic cell DSP Zakkariya Mathew, Perumbavoor inspector Ranjith Raj and personnel of Dansaf. “We have launched a comprehensive probe to find if the accused had received similar couriers in the past. Possibility of more accused being involved would also be checked,” said SP Karthick. Rural police had recently made huge ganja seizures, including a 105kg seizure from Angamaly and 35kg seizure from Aavoli. Ganja came from Andhra Pradesh in these two cases as well. Investigation is ongoing in these two cases. In July, a Thrissur native was arrested by police from Kochi for allegedly procuring 18g of MDMA via courier service. As many as 700 LSD stamps, also brought in via courier service, were seized from a gang in Kochi in March by the City police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cops-seize-31kg-of-ganja-sent-from-andhra-via-courier/articleshow/86947519.cms||---
---||Madurai||Upgrade POS machines for 4G link: PDS staff to govt||Madurai: Public distribution system (PDS) employees have urged the Tamil Nadu government to upgrade the point of sale (POS) machines at more than 33,500 PDS outlets, which support only 2G connectivity, to 4G. In a petition, members of Tamil Nadu Government Fair Price Shop Employees Association said the existing POS machines were distributed in June 2016 to be used with smart cards given to PDS cardholders. Since they only have 2G SIM cards and machines, it is taking time to read the PDS cards, it said.“Fair price shop workers in the state have petitioned their respective joint registrar of cooperative societies in this regard,” said association state vice-president D Chelladurai after petitioning the joint registrar in Madurai. This is resulting in more waiting time for the public. Many are forced to return home empty-handed resulting in arguments with PDS personnel, “as consumers often assume that they are trying to steal their quota by making them wait,” he said.The POS machines function when sales personnel use their mobile phone hotspots, but they have to spend out of their pockets for it. The association also said that nearly half the 2,500 cooperative societies in the state running the PDS outlets have not revised their salaries in accordance with the GO issued on February 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/upgrade-pos-machines-for-4g-link-pds-staff-to-govt/articleshow/86951658.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Compensate all farmers for losses in a week: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Stepping up its farmer outreach ahead of the UP polls, the BJP on Monday said that it will duly compensate all farmers whose crops are damaged due to rains. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath gave these directions after reviewing crop compensation assessment in a high-level meeting. According to a state government spokesperson, the Chief minister has asked officials to assess the damage caused to agricultural crops due to floods and excessive rains and also immediately compensate the farmers whose houses have been damaged. He stressed that the process should be completed in one week. Instructions should be given to official teams involved in the assessment process that not a single eligible farmer should be deprived of the compensation. “The government will compensate for the loss of all types of agricultural produce. The revenue and agriculture departments have been asked to complete the work on top priority in coordination with each other,” the CM said. Meanwhile, the BJP on Monday decided to organise `Kisan Chaupals' in all 56,000 gram panchayats between October 15 and 30. According to state BJP Kisan Morcha president Kameshwar Singh, the chaupals will be attended by party MPs, MLAs and Uttar Pradesh ministers who will apprise famers about various government schemes launched for their welfare. It has been decided that the Morcha will organise Kisan Chaupals in all 98 organisational districts on October 15. The exercise will subsequently be taken up in 403 assemblies of the state and at 27 thousand `Shakti Kendras' comprising five to six booths. The move gains significance for the BJP which finds itself in a dilemma following the arrest of Ashish, son of junior home minister Ajay Mishra, in connection with the Lakhimpur violence. Some senior BJP leaders, including party MP Varun Gandhi, had upped the ante over the incident. The BJP is also facing the heat in west UP as farmers are up in arms against the new farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/compensate-all-farmers-for-losses-in-a-wk/articleshow/86951725.cms||---

Inaugurating the plant worth over Rs 98 lakh with 280 litres per minute (lpm) capacity at the Melur GH, the minister said that it is being ensured that there is no oxygen shortage in Madurai. “We are ensuring all preparations in government hospitals in case of a third wave of Covid-19. In Madurai district especially, we have seen that through prompt measures during the second wave, Covid-19 was brought under control. We have been making efforts to ensure setting up PSA oxygen generator plants at all government hospitals with the help of sponsors,” said Moorthy.Only recently, two plants were inaugurated at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) and the minister highlighted that the hospital has more than enough supply of oxygen. GRH now has a total of six functional oxygen generation plants, including the recently-inaugurated two plants at the super specialty block (SSB) and two more at newborn care (CEmONC) block which have a total capacity of 1500 lpm and two at trauma care centre (TCC) block with a total capacity of 700 lpm. Another plant is also functional at the government hospital for thoracic medicine at Thoppur. One more plant is planned at the GRH and Thoppur GH. PSA oxygen generator plants are a source of medical grade oxygen which will suck air, remove moisture and segregate nitrogen from oxygen and supply oxygen to patients through large cylinders. For every plant with 1000 lpm capacity, supply of oxygen for at least 200 beds can be ensured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurais-3-taluk-hosps-too-get-oxygen-plants/articleshow/86951719.cms||---

By evening, lakhs hit the streets. The crowd count on Monday surpassed Sunday’s high. But cops did not feel the challenge, thanks to the crowd splitting and moving in different directions across the city. The rush of shoppers finally lessened after a two-week high at Gariahat and New Market. However, traffic movement was slow along Rashbehari Avenue, Chetla Central Road, DH Road, BK Pal Avenue and CR Avenue — all transit points for big-budget Pujas. Some of the traditional powerhouses — like Md Ali Park and College Square — witnessed a moderate crowd. Most revellers were more interested in visiting Chaltabagan and Chorbagan. Up north, however, Kumartuli-Ahiritola turned out to be among the largest draws, followed closely by the cluster of Sikdarbagan-Nabin Pally-Nalin Sarkar Street. A similar trend was witnessed down south. Behala's three big draws s Barisha Club, Natun Dal and SB Park — drew a considerable local crowd. The Jodhpur Park-Selimpur-Babubagan area witnessed a massive rise in footfall, similar to ones at Bosepukur Sitalamandir in Kasba and Naktala Udayan Sangha. This helped cops to keep Ekdalia Evergreen-Hindusthan Park zone within control. "We increased the crossover loop at Gariahat crossing to Basanti Devi College. This stopped people from crossing over randomly and also ensuring they visit the big-budget pandals on both sides of the road. A similar policy was adopted for the Tridhara-Samajsebi block. We have provided a clamp to every officer. Any car trying to park on Rashbehari Avenue was clamped and kept at the spot so as to deter others from trying to park their cars," said an officer. However, it was the Sreebhumi pandal that continued to hog the limelight. Traffic management was better on VIP Road compared to the last two days but even then, the overall traffic movement was slow on the stretch, forcing Bidhannagar cops to operate both-way traffic along the Kolkata-bound flank of VIP Road and Kolkata Police to re-issue their advisory, asking airport-bound flyers to take a detour via New Town. But even as the traffic management improved, there was no stopping the sea of revellers whose numbers kept swelling with every passing hour since Monday afternoon, with a number of revellers roaming around with their masks down, happily taking selfies or just chatting with friends and caring least about the impending Covid third wave. Residents living in the area — especially seniors and those living with kids — had a harrowing time with the sea of crowd in front of their homes. All lanes and bylanes leading to Sreebhumi Sporting were choked. "Entering and leaving our homes has become the biggest challenge. My entire family had avoided Covid all this while. I don't think we can anymore," said a young professional who stays in the same lane where the pandal is located. Kolkata Police officers said they did everything to ensure that traffic was not unduly hit. While BK Pal Avenue saw both-way movement till late into the evening, Bidhan Sarani towards Hatibagan though was closed to traffic from Shyambazar five-point crossing . In the south, traffic movement was slow on Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road towards Rashbehari crossing and near Gariahat crossing in the morning itself. Cops had tweaked certain plans to keep the maximum number of senior officers on road for the big challenge in the evening — managing the last-day office crowd with revellers. "The DCs were not put in charge of most Puja complexes, leaving it to the ACPs. Each DC was asked to be stationed at a police station or on the road and monitor a specific area," said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shashthi-pandal-hopper-count-tops-panchami-high/articleshow/86949596.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Aged 2, 4 and 6 years respectively, Aradhya, Anshika and Manavi were playing near the house of their neighbour when the wall fell on them in Mohammadi town of the district. Aradhya and Manavi were pulled out dead from the debris while Anshika was alive, trying to catch her breath. Rajesh Kumar Yadav, police outstation in-charge, told TOI, “We immediately rushed to the spot and carried out the rescue work in Islamnagar locality. Two girls were declared dead at a hospital. Anshika was referred to Shahjahanpur district hospital, but she too could not survive.” The tragedy struck the family of two brothers, Jagatpal Rathore and Pramod Kumar, who didn't know whom to blame. Jagatpal, the father of the eldest girl Manavi, said, “I was not at the house when it all happened. It had rained a day ago. My neighbour’s wall was quite old and collapsed on our daughters. Locals had carried out the rescue work immediately but it was too late. We are in extreme shock as we have lost three daughters during Navratras.” Pramod, the father of Anshika and Aradhya, refused to speak. District officials said they will complete the formalities and ensure that the family gets compensation under state disaster relief funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-minor-girls-killed-in-wall-collapse-in-lakhimpur-kheri/articleshow/86947582.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The duo was brought to Yavatmal and handed over to the Awadootwadi police where a cheating case was registered after complaints from victims who alleged that money was transferred to other accounts without their knowledge. SP Dilip Patil Bhujbal had set up a special squad. Money was transferred from the SBI ATM at the local Sai Satyajyot Mangal Karyalaya on September 15 and a day later from the Anglo Hindi High School ATM. The cyber cell used its expertise and found that the culprits had installed internal cloner gadgets in the ATMs and transfered the money by using a duplicate ATM made with the help of a cloner. After their mobile tower was ascertained, the team reached Bihar. The accused were identified as Mukheshkumar Anil Singh and Sudhirkumar Nirmal Pande, both residents of Gaya. They were arrested and cash, an internal ATM scanner, a hand ATM scanner, a duplicate ATM scanner, 15 ATM cards collectively worth Rs.1,28,450 was seized. During preliminary interrogation, the duo confessed to have committed similar crimes in Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand. Further investigation is being carried out by the Awadootwadi police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/yavatmal-cops-unearth-atm-scam-mystery-arrest-two-from-bihar/articleshow/86949621.cms||---

The physiotherapy students said that they have also been working as much as other residents (MD/MS) ever since the pandemic started. These students from Nair and Sion Hospitals have been on a strike for almost a week in support of their various demands. “We, too, missed our academics for better patient care. Like other medical faculties, we have also been endangering our lives and that of our family members for the past 17 months, and without any acknowledgement. It is demoralising for our profession,” said a student. The students have demanded that the Covid allowance be continued for them even after January 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-physiotherapy-pg-students-protest-denial-of-incentives/articleshow/86949629.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maha Rail violates Wildlife Act for Itwari-Nagbhid gauge conversion||Nagpur: In blatant violation of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, the Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation (MRIDC) has started construction of concrete structures for Itwari-Nagbhid broad gauge without any mitigation plan in the functional tiger corridor between Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary (UKPWS) and Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). After a scientific study based on radio-collaring, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) had submitted a report to the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) on mitigation measures to be taken. However, due to cost constraints, MRIDC is reluctant to undertake these mitigation measures.SBWL member Kunan Hate said, “We will raise the issue in the 17th state wildlife board (SBWL) meeting on Tuesday, which will be chaired by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray. Gauge conversion work in vital tiger corridors without any clearance is against the CM’s vision. He has always batted for wildlife conservation.” Earlier, Thackeray had outrightly rejected the gauge conversion work of Khandwa-Akot railway line passing through the core area of Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), and created a series of conservation reserves and sanctuaries for the long-term conservation of wildlife.Hate said, “In the 16th meeting of SBWL when the issue of gauge conversion of Itwari–Nagbhid railway came up for discussion, the CM had categorically said, ‘First check if this project is actually needed, and if needed, make it elevated to safeguard critical tiger corridors to Tadoba landscape.’”It has come to notice that MRIDC, which is executing the project, has started civil works in the tiger corridor and ecologically sensitive areas without taking any wildlife clearance. As reported earlier by TOI, MRIDC had felled trees along the railway line near Umred-Paoni-Karhandla with permission from Umred forest range officer (RFO). While this matter is yet to be settled, MRIDC transported some timber as well.Instead of following due procedure, MRIDC has taken up civil works like vehicle underpasses/overpasses in the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) and more importantly, in the critical tiger corridors connecting TATR with Umred-Karhandla and Navegaon-Nagzira.As per rules, whenever any developmental project comes up in a protected area, tiger reserve or the corridors, it requires wildlife clearance from SBWL and the national board for wildlife (NBWL).Sources told TOI that MRIDC has not even submitted any proposal to SBWL. Before submission of the proposal, the forest department asked WII, Dehradun, to prepare a mitigation plan, which was submitted with the forest department. But the WII mitigation plan is not acceptable to the user agency. Instead, the agency has submitted its own plan without having any wildlife expertise.Owing to these differences, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) recently constituted a five-member committee of experts. The panel, which includes PCCF, National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and WII representatives, and deputy inspector general (wildlife) conducted a site visit on October 8 and 9. During the field visit, this irregularity came to the fore.PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye said, “MRIDC had started some work in corridor area last year and our field officers had asked them to stop the work till they get formal clearance. Despite that, the work continued. I will seek the factual report from the field officers.”Limaye added, “We have clearly told the user agency that we will go by the mitigation measures WII has suggested, because this is a vital tiger corridor and human-tiger conflict-prone area. After clearance by NBWL, the user agency can take up the work in corridor area with recommended mitigation measures.” MRIDC chief project manager Vikas Datta said, “It is too early to comment. The picture will be clear only once the MoEFCC committee submits its report.” On WII’s recommended mitigation measures, Datta said, “Length of some mitigation structures includes existing structures. We feel this length should be reduced from the suggested structures. We have constructed some structures but these don’t fall in the tiger corridor.”Hate said MRIDC mitigation measures are too small and useless for wild animals. The new route is apparently quite a raised route from the ground which can further block the free mobility along the corridor, forcing the wildlife to divert towards human habitations and adding to the conflict.“MRIDC never planned mitigation measures and did not make any financial provision for such additional works. Even though there is no clarity on clearances, why has MRIDC gone ahead with the works?” asked Hate.A similar mistake was made by the public works department (PWD) in the Tadoba landscape — it widened roads without any mitigation structures — but NGT took suo motu note of TOI’s reports, due to which it is now constructing underpasses suggested by WII.Another SBWL member Bandu Dhotre said, “The Chandrapur-Brahmapuri-Umred landscape through which this 104km railway line passes is one of the hotspots of human-tiger conflict. Once gauge conversion is done, frequency of trains will be increased, threatening wildlife. Hence, the project should not be allowed without WII-recommended mitigation measures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-rail-violates-wildlife-act-for-itwari-nagbhid-gauge-conversion/articleshow/86949608.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The accused driver, who is critical with head injuries, has been arrested. The man who died on the spot has been identified as 30-year-old Nawal Kumar Yadav who lived near Yamuna Bank Depot. Police said Yadav had boarded his friend’s rickshaw to go to his shop when the accident took place around 11am. A Hyundai Verna car, being driven by Manoj Sharma, who was coming from Noida to Delhi, rammed a rickshaw and a tempo. “Yadav was sitting on the passenger’s seat on the rickshaw. The rickshaw puller, Sanjeev Yadav (40), sustained severe head injuries as both the tempo and the car had hit him. He is critical,” said an officer. The tempo turned turtle after the car hit it and rammed into a footpath. Its driver, Rampreet Das, is stable, the officer added. Police said all injured had to be pulled out of the damaged vehicles. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Priyanka Kashyap said Sharma was allegedly speeding. “A case of rash driving and causing death due to negligence has been registered.” The incident led to long traffic snarls in the adjoining areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1-dead-3-injured-as-speeding-car-rams-2-vehicles/articleshow/86951723.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

An inquiry commission has been appointed by the DCE to probe into the allegations and college principal Mathew George would go on leave until the inquiry is completed. The students belonging to SFI launched a protest on Monday seeking action against the principal alleging that the attempt to remove the wood happened with the consent of the principal. Students staged a dharna at the principal’s office during the governing council meeting on Monday. Following this the DCE intervened and launched a probe. “The commission headed by an additional director will begin the probe on Tuesday itself. The students demanded that the principal must be placed under suspension to ensure a transparent inquiry but it was not approved by the DCE as there is no clarity about his involvement. So he has been asked to go on leave till the inquiry is completed,”said a source. The students on Sunday evening thwarted the attempt to remove a truckload of wood from trees which were cut down on the campus alleging that it was not authorized. They stopped a group of four people who came to shift the wood, which have been lying on the campus for a long time, after being suspicious about it. SFI unit president at the college Rajeev K said that the workers said that they came to remove the wood as per the directive of the principal. “The principal is the custodian of the campus and without his knowledge no such action will happen. A detailed probe must be held and responsible persons must be held accountable. We will not stop the protest until that,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/probe-on-into-bid-to-remove-wooden-logs/articleshow/86947573.cms||---

A group of ex-servicemen recently approached the PMC and demanded implementation of the scheme at the earliest. Nearly 20,000 properties would receive tax waiver once the scheme is rolled out. The civic administration claimed that procedural formalities for the same were underway. As per the state government proposal in November 2020, ex-servicemen have been given tax waiver under a special scheme known as Balasaheb Thackeray Sainik Sanman Yojana. It also covers properties owned by war widows. “ All major municipal corporations have already implemented this scheme except the PMC,” said Yogesh Chithade, an ex-serviceman. “Some of the tax, which the PMC collects, goes to the state government. If we have to give total tax discount as per the general bodyproposal, we will have to complete a few procedural formalities.

---||Bareilly||Had handed over man cops say is absconding in Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Farmer leaders||BAREILLY: Three men, farmer leaders say, were handed over to the police on the day of the Banbirpur killings in Lakhimpur Kheri. One of them is now among three police say they are looking for and will question. On Sunday, police said they are on the trail of three men after the arrest of Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish. The first is Ankit Das, who owns one of the cars in the convoy that ran farmers over. Another is Sumit Jaiswal, who had filed the FIR against farmers and was in a purported video from that day seen stepping out of a car in the convoy. The third is Shekhar Bharti. And he, farmer leaders said, had been taken away by the police that day. “We don’t know why the police are not producing all the people farmers handed over to them,” prominent farmer leader Jasbir Singh Virk, president of Bhartiya Sikh Sangathan, told TOI. “One of them, who had said the minister had sent him, died in their custody (Shyam Sundar, a BJP worker) and we don’t know what happened to Shekhar.” The third person handed over to cops, according to farmers, was Lovekush Rana, arrested last Thursday. Two videos shared widely, farmers said, are proof that Shekhar had been nabbed. In one, purportedly at Banbirpur on the day of the violence, a man is being questioned by farmers. “I am Shekhar Bharti, from Lucknow. I was sitting in the car. I was not driving,” he answers when asked by a protesting farmer who he was and what he was doing there. The man, surrounded by farmers, can’t be seen in the video. In another, he is asked by a cop what he was doing there. “I was in the backseat. The car sped ahead, crushing people. The vehicle Thar (which ran over farmers) was with bhaiya,” he tells the cop. It was not clear who “bhaiya” was. The man in both videos, farmer leaders said, was Shekhar Bharti. “We had handed Shekhar over to the police. How is he absconding now?” asked Jaimal Dhillon, a farmer who was present at Banbirpur when the cop, later identified as circle officer Sanjay Nath Tiwari, was questioning the man they saw was Shekhar Bharti. When TOI asked circle officer Tiwari if it was indeed him in the video questioning Shekhar, he said, “Yes, but this information is part of the investigation. I can’t share anything further. Certain things about the investigation can’t be shared until it’s all complete.” ADG (Lucknow zone) SN Sabat told TOI that the SIT alone could comment on where Shekhar is. SIT members declined to talk about the whereabouts of Shekhar and Ankit Das. A retired IPS officer from UP told TOI, “Sometimes, an accused is not officially arrested immediately or the police have to produce them in court within 24 hours and seek remand. Sometimes, remand is not granted and the investigation remains pending."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/had-handed-over-man-cops-say-is-absconding-farmer-leaders/articleshow/86947628.cms||---

The service will provide passengers assistants who will guide them right from the parking area to the boarding gate helping them in check-in formalities, baggage handling, conducting Covid tests, and speeding up security and emigration procedures. The main target customers are the elderly, pregnant and child passengers as well those travelling in the business class. The segment has been fast-growing and the service is available in all major airports around the world. Cial is also offering customized group packages and special rates for corporate events, wedding guests, film crew and vacation groups. Though the project was launched in April, it did not receive much attention due to the lockdown and the dip in the number of passengers. With the aviation industry witnessing a revival, the programme has been revamped and re-launched. P S Jayan, public relations & corporate communications manager, Cial, said though the facility was envisaged by Cial, the operations have been outsourced to Speedwing Air Services, which has rebranded the service as “Primefly Greet and Meet”. “There are three packages each in international and domestic sectors----basic porter service, seamless check-in and check-out, baggage handling, and completion of all formalities up to the boarding gate. Right now it is available for departing and arriving passengers in the domestic sector and departing passengers in international sector. Soon, it will be made available to arriving international passengers too,” Jayan said. Shaji John, business and marketing head, Speedwing Primefly, said the service is opted by many passengers both in domestic as well international sectors. Under the basic porter service, which costs Rs 300 per trolley, a customer can avail the service of one porter. Under the check-in/checkout service, a dedicated executive will assist the passenger from arrivals to checkout area (in case of arrival) or from parking area to check-in. A porter with one trolley for up to three pieces of baggage will assist with baggage handling and customs formalities. Under the feel safe service, besides all services under check-in / checkout, passengers will get assistance to clear emigration, customs, Covid test, and security check points with permissible priority queues. “Many people who are not frequent fliers are confused at the airport about the various procedures and these facilities will help them. It is most helpful for the differently-abled, pregnant women, elderly, kids travelling alone, etc. Many people, whose parents are going on visit visas abroad, are opting for it and the customers will be updated on their status via WhatsApp. Daily around 50 customers are opting for it and the numbers are picking up. The service can be booked either at the kiosk at the airport or via online,” John said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/meet-and-greet-facilities-revamped-at-cochin-airport/articleshow/86947619.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

---||Mumbai||Amitabh Bachchan scraps advertisement contract with pan masala brand||MUMBAI: On the occasion of his 79th birthday on Monday, actor Amitabh Bachchan announced on social media that he had terminated his contract with a pan masala brand just days after its commercial was aired. It is learnt that a national anti-tobacco organisation, supported by doctors from the cancer hub Tata Memorial Hospital, had reached out to the actor to ask him to stop promoting pan masala as it is carcinogenic. “Mr Bachchan is the true hero for cancelling the endorsement,” said Tata Memorial Centre professor and oral cancer surgeon Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, who is part of the NGO Voice of Tobacco Victims. On Monday, Bachchan’s blog carried a statement from his office that said, “...A few days after the commercial was aired, Mr Bachchan contacted the brand and stepped out of it last week.” It further said that when Bachchan became associated with the brand, he wasn’t aware that it fell under the category of surrogate advertising. The money received for the promotion too has been returned, it added. Bachchan added his reaction, saying, “Some decisions were needed to be made and they have been made and done ... am no longer their ambassador.” Earlier, during social media interactions, Bachchan had responded to a query by stating he agreed to the assignment because “I get paid,” as do people working in the industry. “We pointed out to him that gutka and pan masala have been banned in 11 states, including Maharashtra. So, in a way, one is promoting poison by associating with it,” said Dr Chaturvedi. He further said the NGO had reached out to many actors who endorse pan masala or elachis that are used as surrogate advertisements for gutka. “Tobacco cannot be advertised, but there are many products -- such as clothes label, stationery, bottled water or soft drinks and even food items -- made by tobacco companies to promote their brand,” said the doctor. When gutka was banned, sale of pouches of pan masala and smokeless tobacco went up. People bought them separately and mixed them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-big-b-scraps-ad-contract-with-pan-masala-brand/articleshow/86949662.cms||---

Central Pollution Control Board has already identified three hotspots in the EDMC areas. The civic body launched a special drive on Sunday, before the beginning of the peak season, to cover all such spots on a regular basis and take necessary measures to mitigate dust pollution. A senior EDMC official said the three hotspots — Anand Vihar, Mandoli Industrial Area and Vivek Vihar — are on the priority list where regular sprinkling, night survey, challaning and other steps were being taken with the help of 64 teams against burning of biomass and plastic waste and construction and demolition waste, dumping etc. “These teams are taking action at other places too. We also have 40 sprinklers that are used continuously in identified markets, industrial, commercial and other public areas,” said the official. The corporation has also asked officials to identify prominent roads, industrial and commercial areas, especially near borders, and submit action-taken reports. Eight mechanical road sweepers are working in intervals for road sweeping in east Delhi. “We are intensifying the exercise every day,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-tells-officials-to-identify-more-dust-pollution-hotspots/articleshow/86951755.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Municipal corporations add hospital beds as dengue stings more people||NEW DELHI: Taking note of the increasing cases of dengue in the city, the municipal corporations have reserved around 200 beds in major hospitals for treatment of patients diagnosed with vector-borne diseases. The latest report released by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Monday highlighted 139 new dengue cases last week, taking the total number to 480. The number is higher than the corresponding period of the past two years. In 2020, there were 316 cases and 467 in 2019. “We are taking steps to ensure that treatment and testing is accessible to all suspected or infected patients,” said a civic official. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has designated 145 beds at Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals. The number of beds will be increased if the need arises. “We have appointed nodal officers and set up coordination committees for management of services related with cases of vector-borne diseases. All fever cases are being screened for such diseases to minimise the chances of delay in treatment. Screening units have been provided with medicines, diagnostic kits, drips and fluids in sufficient quantities,” said a north corporation official. East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has made a 40-bed dengue ward at Swami Dayanand Hospital. “Till now, 47 cases of dengue and 15 of malaria have been confirmed in our area. On Monday, 40 patients were admitted with dengue-like symptoms. After testing, 18 cases were confirmed,” said an EDMC official. A facility for platelet transfusion has also been started for patients with low count or dysfunction. “We have an Apheresis machine that can help increase platelets by 20,000-30,000. This facility is far better than transfusion through random donors, which can increase chances of infection,” said a senior doctor at Swami Dayanand Hospital. In east Delhi, testing facilities are available at Swami Dayanand, Veer Savarkar, GTB and Chhota Bazar Civil hospitals. To increase the workforce for awareness and fogging in high-risk areas, the public health department has asked for assistance from 78 drivers who no longer lift garbage as the job has been given to a private concessionaire. “We are focusing on border areas as states like UP have reported many cases,” said an official. SDMC is in the process of developing dengue wards at its 18 blood testing centres, including Tilak Nagar and Lajpat Nagar colony hospitals, polyclinics at Ghumanhera, Tughlaqabad, Jangpura and Bijwasan, and maternity homes. “We have distributed 11,000 kits for testing dengue and chikungunya to all health centres. They are also doing platelet testing and giving immediate treatment to infected people in OPDs,” said an SDMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-add-hospital-beds-as-dengue-stings-more-people/articleshow/86951754.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Lucknow||Ensure uninterrupted power supply in night hours: UP CM Yogi Adityanath to officials||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday directed the officials to ensure uninterrupted power supply between 6pm and 7am to both urban and rural areas. Presiding over a review meeting in the aftermath of the power crisis following shortage in coal stock, the CM asked the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) chairman M Devraj to assess the coal availability in all power plants and take necessary steps to mitigate the crisis. According to reports, as against a demand of around 18,000 Mw, the state is able to wheel in around 14,000 Mw, forcing unscheduled rostering in various district headquarters and villages. To meet the shortage of electricity, the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) is buying extra power on an emergency basis, sources said. He said that the power crisis should be resolved in view of festivals. “In such times uninterrupted power supply at night is essential,” he observed at the meeting which was convened at his official residence. The CM also reviewed the electricity system in the state through video-conferencing. All divisional commissioners, DMs, senior officers of the police and power department participated in the meeting. Yogi further underscored that every consumer wants to pay the electricity bill hence they should not be troubled by erroneous electricity bills. He directed the officials to take strict action, including lodging of FIRs, against the billing agencies who were found callous and not working as per the agreement. The CM sought implementation of a one-time settlement scheme (OTS) in relation to electricity bills soon. He said that the faulty transformers should be replaced within 48 hours in rural areas and 24 hours in urban areas as per the prescribed arrangements. The quality of the replaced transformer should also be checked. Yogi said that immediate action should be taken regarding the subsidy given to farmers. Tubewell connections should be provided in a time-bound manner. "Any farmer who has paid in connection with the connection of the tubewell, should be provided with the electricity connection immediately," he said. The CM also pitched for resolving the cases pertaining to irregularities in the electricity bills of the beneficiaries of other schemes including Saubhagya Yojana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ensure-uninterrupted-power-supply-in-night-hours-yogi-to-officials/articleshow/86951764.cms||Pankaj Shah

With rallies of Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP making rounds in the city, there was total bandh here till evening. Functioning of emergency services, government offices and banks, however, remained normal. Barring stray incidents of violence, the bandh remained peaceful in the district. A band of Shiv Sena activists, moving around to ensure bandh, resorted to violence at Shiv Bhojan Thali outlet after they found it functioning. They broke the window panes, tables and chairs, while throwing away the meal prepared for the poor. In yet another incident in Ballarpur, a shopkeeper who refused to close down his shop was chased away by angry Congress workers. He was saved by the cops. Responding to the bandh call, senior Congress leaders including MP Balu Dhanorkar, former MP Naresh Puglia, NCP district president Rajendra Vaidya, Shiv Sena district chief Sandeep Girhe stepped out ensuring total bandh in the city. While Puglia staged sit-in at Gandhi Square, his supporters led by youth leader Rahul Puglia, Karan Puglia, Vidarbha Kisan Majdoor Congress district president Gajanan Gawande ensured that the city remains closed. MP Balu Dhanorkar and Sena district chief Sandeep Girhe took out separate bike rallies in city to ensure bandh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mva-partners-ensure-total-bandh-in-chanda/articleshow/86964999.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Delhi||Delhi: 32 subcategories to ensure more realistic valuation of properties||NEW DELHI: In order to address the value of property more realistically, Delhi government will create 32-odd subcategories under the existing eight categories of properties designated as A to H that determine circle rates. The circle rate for all the existing categories was last revised in 2014, and a re-evaluation exercise was going on to revise the circle rates to better capture the change in the value of the properties due to infrastructure development, commercial activities in nearby areas, better public transport facilities, etc. The state government’s evaluation committee has recommended the creation of 4-5 subcategories for each of the current categories. At present, the categorisation is broad and encompasses large areas. There is also a huge difference in the circle rates between succeeding categories. For example, in the A category, the rate is Rs 7,74,000 per square metre, while that for B category is Rs 2,45,520 per square metre. The formation of subcategories will make the rates more realistic and more correlated to the prevailing market value. The committee has submitted its report on the recommended revision of the circle rates to the government’s revenue department, which will review it and take a decision. It is probable that the rates will go up by 25%. Properties in A category, such as Greater Kailash, Vasant Kunj and New Friends Colony, are the costliest while those in the H category, such as Kalyanpuri and Nand Nagri, attract the lowest circle rates. Circle rates are the minimum values of lands and properties below which a property cannot be registered. The circle rates also determine the stamp duty and property registration charges that accrue to the state government. Explaining the need for the subcategories, a revenue official said that the market rates of properties even within a given category was found to be varying widely due to new factors like infrastructure development, proximity to Delhi Metro network and overall commercial development. The official elaborated, “For example, even within the lowest H category, it is not uncommon to find some areas having far a higher property value than even one in the higher G category because a new metro station has come up nearby or the traffic congestion has reduced due to the construction of a flyover.” Another official said that the recommendations of the evaluation committee would be reviewed at the ministerial level and then be forwarded to the cabinet for approval. After it is cleared, the recommendations will be sent to the lieutenant governor for consideration and approval. After the LG’s approval, a notification will be published and the new circles rates will be implemented. Since the Aam Aadmi Party took power, the circle rates have never been revised and this will be the first act of its kind for the current government. While the revision will likely make property owners happy, the government can also expect higher stamp duty revenues. The state government periodically revises circle rates for properties, and most such exercises usually raise the land rates. A re-evaluation exercise may increase the rates uniformly across the categories or by varying percentages for each different category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/32-subcategories-to-ensure-more-realistic-valuation-of-properties/articleshow/86949690.cms||AlokKNMishra

Police said the trio decamped with a digital video recorder (DVR) installed in the kiosk as a part of the CCTV surveillance system. CCTV footage collected from nearby establishments showed at least three men stepping out of the SUV in front of the ATM kiosk. They tied the rope’s one end with the four-wheeler and the other with the cash dispenser. The trio then dragged it out of the kiosk using the power of the SUV. Later, they loaded the cash dispenser in the vehicle and drove away. The finance company’s area manager, Anil Bhau Shinde, who lodged a complaint related to the theft, told TOI, “I am not authorised to speak to the media.” Inspector Vinod Ghuge of the Daund police said, “We collected and studied CCTV footage from other commercial establishments located near the ATM kiosk. In the footage, the suspects can be seen arriving at the spot in the SUV and going about with the task of tying the rope around the cash dispenser unit and dragging it out.” “We then contacted the finance company officials and their area manager (Shinde) lodged a complaint. We have registered a case of theft and investigating it. The kiosk was unmanned. The focus of the CCTV cameras installed there were not focused on the cash dispenser or on the entrance door,” said Ghuge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cash-dispenser-containing-rs-6l-dragged-out-using-suv-rope/articleshow/86949710.cms||---

---||Kochi||BVoc courses find many takers||Kochi: Many colleges in the city are promoting Bachelor of Vocation (BVoc) degree courses along with the traditional degree courses in arts, science and humanities as the demand for such courses has increased for its merit of making students more employable. BVoc courses are University Grants Commission (UGC)-approved three-year undergraduate courses aimed at providing skill-based training for a candidate to have the relevant skills relating to a particular profession. The number of applications to these courses has increased in most colleges which have started such courses over the past few years. The UGC had launched a scheme in February 2014 for skills development-based higher education as part of college/university education, leading to (BVoc) degree that incorporates specific job roles. The curriculum is mapped with the job role descriptions as per National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) which ensures that graduates have the skills that are valued at every level as per the requirements of the market. It opens multiple doors not just after the completion of the programme but also during the course. At the end of three years the student will be awarded a BVoc degree. At the end of the second year, they will be awarded advanced diploma and after first year, they will be awarded a skill certificate. So even if the students drop out during the courses, they will have a certificate unlike conventional courses. In Ernakulam, St Albert’s College offers the highest number of BVoc courses. There are 12 BVoc courses which include commercial aquaculture, fitness management, fish post harvest technology and management, journalism and mass communication, sports nutrition and physiotherapy, renewable energy, logistics management, software development, etc. Besides, there are two master of vocation (MVoc) courses. “Over 80% seats were filled so far. The courses are yet to get popularity and we are promoting it through various ways to make students aware about the benefits,” said Fr Jolly, admission coordinator at St Albert’s College. St Paul’s College, Kalamassery, offers BVoc banking and financial services, and BVoc tourism and hospitality management. St Teresa’s College has been offering BVoc courses for the past five years — BVoc food processing technology and BVoc software development. Sacred Heart College, Thevara, has received the approval of BVoc courses in four subjects — rubber technology and polymer science, pharmaceutical modelling, aquaculture, animation and graphic design. However, the admissions to these courses are yet to start.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bvoc-courses-find-many-takers/articleshow/86947645.cms||---
---||Delhi||Father gets custody of children, Delhi court says their welfare priority||NEW DELHI: In a rare order, a Delhi court has granted interim custody of two minor children — 4.5 years old and 18 months old — to the father, while noting that the mother has a right to choose her private life, but not at the cost of the welfare of her children. The mother had left her matrimonial home in October 2020 with both her children. The move came when the father filed an application seeking custody, claiming that his wife’s alleged illicit relationship with her lover was affecting the children adversely. The court said it was evident from the record that she stayed in Goa for three days with her lover, leaving behind both the children with a maid. “It is the choice respondent/mother has herself made and this unethical conduct of the mother would hamper the balanced and healthy growth of the children. The children require their due share of attention and affection from parents, which respondent/mother has not been giving,” Principal Judge Anju Bajaj Chandna said in the order. The court further said although the character of the mother might not be relevant in deciding the custody issues, priorities and preferences of parents invariably affect the proper growth of the children. “The respondent/mother has not been conducting herself in the complete interest of her children and prefers her own enjoyment, which adversely reflects on her parenting,” the judge stated. It observed that parenting was all about inculcating good values in children and to support and lead them to the path of success. Parents need to understand the physical and emotional state of the child and his capabilities and continue to acknowledge and address his sensibilities, the court observed. “Children with involved and caring parents always have better educational outcome. The studies have found that an active and nurturing style of parenting is associated with better verbal skills, intellectual functioning and academic achievements among adolescents. Children do not remain untouched by the relational turmoil of their parents. In the present matter, both the children are in their formative years and they need undivided time, attention, care and love from their parents,” it added. The father, through his counsel Prabhjit Jauhar, had claimed that the mother went to Goa with her paramour for four days to enjoy her alleged adulterous lifestyle, leaving the infant alone with a maid. The mother, through her counsel Kamini Jaiswal, contented that the petitioner through his application was attempting to re-agitate the issue of custody on the basis of false allegations of having a paramour. She had argued that she took help from the person as she was in need and wanted to leave her matrimonial home in order to escape from the alleged torture meted out to her by her husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/father-gets-custody-of-children-court-says-their-welfare-priority/articleshow/86949746.cms||Usha Das
---||Lucknow||Shift in UP poll pitch: Mayawati’s promise on Kashi, Ayodhya and Mathura; Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s Durga chant||LUCKNOW: As Uttar Pradesh is heading for a high-voltage election, one can see prominently visible symbols of Hindutva in the campaign pitch of prominent non-BJP parties. Has the success that the Hindutva card has brought to the BJP in UP, first during the Ram temple movement and then after the ascendance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has compelled the opposition parties to tread the same path in the run-up to the 2022 assembly elections? Political analysts answer in affirmative. So, while the BSP chief Mayawati 'promised' at her first election rally in Lucknow on Saturday that she won't stop the development works launched in Ayodhya, Varanasi and Mathura, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi laced her speech at the launch of her campaign in Varanasi with Durga Saptshati. Even SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is scheduled to launch his Vijay Yatra on Tuesday from the banks of the Ganga in Kanpur. Earlier, addressing a public gathering in Saharanpur, Akhilesh referred to holy book Gita. He also had been on the temple run for the past few months, visiting Kamadgiri Temple in Chitrakoot, Vimalnath Temple at Farrukhabad and Buddha Temple at Shravasti to name a few. The Aam Admi Party, which is entering the UP assembly poll fray for the first time also began its campaign from Ayodhya. Political observers say that while Congress started having a brush with soft Hindutva since Gujarat’s assembly polls in 2017 and continued in subsequent elections, what came as a surprise was BSP supremo Mayawati’s statement that works undertaken by the BJP government in Ayodhya, Mathura and Varanasi would continue unhindered if BSP formed the government. While former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi was on the temple run during Gujarat elections and later during Lok Sabha elections of 2019, Priyanka, too, started Congress election campaign by visiting temples in Varanasi before her speech on Sunday. With a tilak and sandalwood paste on her forehead and a Rudraksh bead necklace and sacred thread tied on her right hand, she began her address at the Kisan Nyay Rally in Varanasi on Sunday by reciting a verse from Durga Saptashati as she said she was on fast. She even chanted 'Jai Mata Di' before beginning her speech. On Priyanka’s new avatar, AICC secretary Rajesh Tiwari, who conducted the Kisan Nyay Rally in Varanasi, said that what BJP had been doing was a propaganda, while Congress leaders, including former prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, have been visiting temples and other religious places. SP leader Juhie Singh said for BJP, offering prayers was always for camera while with her party it has been a routine affair. "Our party never brought offerings at temple in public domain unlike the BJP leaders. SP leaders have always been visiting temples," she said. While the BJP has always gone full throttle on its Hindutva plank, pledging grand Lord Ram Temple at Ayodhya in every election manifesto, BSP chief Mayawati’s shift with the mention of Mathura, Varanasi and Ayodhya in her speech is something what has left the political pundits thinking. “The development work underway in Mathura, Ayodhya and Varanasi under BJP government will continue unhindered if the BSP forms the government,” she had said. BSP’s shift in strategy actually was visible with its general secretary Satish Mishra addressing a series of prabuddh sammelans. While before his address at all the religious places, Mishra offered prayers at the temples there and went on to praise Hindu gods and goddesses during his speeches. Mishra even promised a Grand Lord Ram Temple once his party came to power, a promise that BSP chief Mayawati also hinted at. When asked about this shift, Satish Mishra said that BJP has probably forgotten what work Mayawati-led government did between 2007 and 2012. Be it beautification of ghats at Saryu, or sewer lines at Vrindavan were all done by BSP government. Hindutva is not the copyright of BJP. Deputy CM Keshav Maurya, when asked abut the change in opposition’s strategy, said that they should join the BJP and the party would later think about their future. When asked whether 'Hindutva was the copyright of the BJP', Maurya said that it was not so but one can see that how these Opposition leaders are changing colour just like chameleon after seeing the people’s mandate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shift-in-up-poll-pitch-mayas-promise-on-kashi-ayodhya-and-mathura-priyankas-durga-chant/articleshow/86951799.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Such an environment will be conducive for students and research scholars who could involve their guides also in the project as mentors,” said Sam Thomas, director, Centre for Innovation, Technology Transfer and Industrial Collaboration (CITTIC), Cusat. CITTIC, which was set up in 2016-17 as a 4,000 sq ft TBI with a grant of Rs 1 crore from the state government, has 50 startups mainly run by Cusat students and alumni. A fabrication laboratory (FabLab) sponsored by Kerala Startup Mission has been set up in the TBI which will provide the students easy access to digital fabrication technologies. A FabLab is a technical prototyping platform for innovation and invention which aims at providing stimulus for local entrepreneurship and serves as a platform for learning and innovation. “We have been getting requests from professionals in specialized sectors like electronics, marine science, polymer, biotechnology and ship technology for incubation support from Cusat so that they can make the best use of our faculty and research facilities. Cusat has incubated 93 startup companies in the past three years providing employment support for over 300 youngsters,” Thomas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cusat-to-open-new-biz-incubator/articleshow/86947654.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After practicals, now some junior colleges to restart classes||MUMBAI: While some junior colleges in the city opened their campuses to hold science practicals for HSC students this past week, a few now plan to hold in-person lectures too. Commuting concerns, though, have kept most students away from campuses. Not many parents are giving consent for sending their unvaccinated children who are also not eligible for commute by local trains, say principals. Many want the state government to relax the norms for train travel, at least for students. St Xavier’s College, which conducted practicals for science students last week, will be calling its Arts (HSC) students for lectures from Tuesday. “Around 50% have given consent and we are hoping the numbers will go up in the coming weeks. Most students, though, are complaining about train travel. We have students coming from suburbs as far as Kalyan and Vasai. They have no option but to travel without ticket as they are denied tickets at the counter. They are very keen on returning to the campus. Outstation students, in fact, are upset they were not given enough time to return and make some arrangements for accommodation in the city,” said Hasnain Naqvi, junior college vice-principal. Minu Madlani, principal, KPB Hinduja College, said they did not get consent from a majority of parents. “Many have cited their concerns about commuting. Our college is near the station, so most of our students staying in far-off suburbs travel by train. Also, almost 80% syllabus was already over, we will see if things improve post Diwali.” KC College has been conducting practical sessions in the hybrid mode since last week. This week they plan to call small groups of HSC students for tutorials. “Students who are facing problems in understanding concepts or those facing difficulties online will be called this week. Parents have given consent but are reluctant due to travelling constraints and fear of Covid,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal, KC College, and vice-chancellor, HSNC University. “Our science practicals are being conducted in small batches of 20 students each. We are also taking a headcount on total vaccinated students in our degree college, to keep the data ready,” said Krutika Desai, in-charge principal, Mithibai College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-practicals-now-some-jr-colleges-to-restart-classes/articleshow/86949784.cms||Yogita Rao

The police accused the 34-year-old driver of the tourist van, identified as Alex Prabu of Woraiyur, of causing the accident by speeding. Blood and urine samples were collected from the driver to ascertain whether he was under the influence of alcohol. Police sources said that a family of 21 people from E Pudur in Trichy city had hired a tourist van to visit a temple in Thanthonimalai in Karur district. On Monday morning around 6 am, as the van was approaching Mukkombu on Karur NH, Prabu tried overtaking a cargo carrier by speeding. However, a TNSTC bus was coming from the opposite direction. The van crashed into the side portion of the cargo carrier before ramming into the TNSTC bus. Due to the high speed, the van further rammed into an electric pole and overturned. All the 21 commuters in the van sustained injuries. Seven heavily injured were hospitalized and their conditions were stable. Others were treated as outpatients. Commuters in the TNSTC bus and the driver of the cargo carrier escaped without injuries. Jeeyapuram police said that Ganesan and Veerapnadi, residents of Mukkombu, rushed the injured to hospitals on a mini-load carrier. “The road is already accident-prone. It was fault of the tourist van driver, we have booked a case against him under three IPC sections,” an investigating official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/21-travelling-in-tourist-van-injured-in-accident-on-trichy-karur-nh/articleshow/86949755.cms||---

The urban local body has utilised the service of the National Informatics Centre (NIC) to send the invites. “Senior residents had brought the text message to the vaccination centre, this shows the reach. We will constantly update the status of people delaying the second dose to include in the bulk SMS alerts,” said Dr Mohamed Hakkim, urban vaccination coordinator. NIC sources said that the bulk SMS was done for free by using the government e-mail ID of the district collector. The text message has a 1,000 word limit and can be sent in different batches. “Next time, we will plan to send the alerts in Tamil,” an official source said. NIC had also utilised the bulk texting service for voter awareness, the official added. The health department’s data stated that around 1.85 lakh people in the district including 72,304 in Trichy corporation limits have completed or are about to complete the waiting period for the second dose of Covaxin (30 days) and Covishield (85 days). In Trichy city, some of the residents have overshot it by 30-60 days. Besides the lax attitude, officials said that some who had taken Covishield have genuinely forgotten their due date since the first dose was taken around three months ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-sends-2nd-dose-alerts-via-bulk-text-messages/articleshow/86949736.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Delhi||Way ahead: RC with QR code, chipless driving licence in Delhi||NEW DELHI: From “faceless” services, the Delhi government’s transport department has moved towards “chip-less” driving licences and will soon go for QR code-based registration certificates. The department has been taking different steps to make transport-related transactions simpler and completely hassle-free for the public. It has started issuing QR code-based driving licences, which will pave the way for similar vehicle registration certificates from vehicle dealerships. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary-cum-transport commissioner, said the department had moved from chip-based smart cards to QR code-based driving licences as the chip was an option to store information, which could be done with QR code, too, but in a much simpler fashion. “The chip gets smudged and it requires a card reader and the information that got stored was not being used that much. Also, writing on the chip requires a certain kind of software,” Kundra said. “Printing QR code is like normal printing on a plastic card. It is easier, faster and the same job gets done,” he said, adding that it would work as simply as one can “read” QR code-based menus in a restaurant. Kundra said that ultimately, it would help in the printing of registration certificates at the dealer’s end. He said the biggest bottleneck in enabling that system was the chip as it was difficult to provide the software at so many locations. The option on writing on the chip was available only at 12 locations where the office of Motor Licensing Officer was. A newer and simpler technology is needed to provide similar facilities at around 100 locations. “This is simpler, better and easier to read with any mobile handheld device, including the phone” he said, adding that the provision to allow QR codes had become a part of Central Motor Vehicle Rules, but wasn’t implemented in Delhi till recently. In an order earlier this year, the department had appointed “self-registration” dealers as special registering authority under Delhi Motor Vehicle Rules 1993 to issue temporary registration of new non-transport (personal) vehicles sold from their outlets. The QR code will also store the information about the licence holder’s blood group and if he or she is willing to donate organs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/way-ahead-rc-with-qr-code-chipless-dl/articleshow/86949720.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The district collector, Rajesh Deshmukh, has asked the health authorities to take the assistance of private vaccination staffers to achieve the target. The five-lakh doses will cover the beneficiaries yet to get their first dose on priority and those due for the second dose. Ayush Prasad, the Pune ZP CEO, said, “We are planning to vaccinate at least two lakh beneficiaries on Tuesday and the instructions have been passed on to the respective gram panchayats and block officers.” Many experts are wary of the five-lakh single-day target. Almost 90% of the target population had taken the first jab. “Those not vaccinated until now do not want to get their shot at all,” said a ZP official, adding that a maximum of two lakh doses might be administered in Tuesday’s drive. Rajesh Patil, the PCMC chief, said, “Many of our beneficiaries are vaccinated and the response to the first jab is dwindling. The number of those due for the second dose is low. The upcoming drives may not see the desired response.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/5-lakh-shots-target-today-in-district/articleshow/86949753.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Thousands have started gathering in Lakhimpur Kheri for the Akhand Paath Bhog ritual at Banbirpur where, less than a kilometre from the site of the killings, they will meet after the prayer ceremony. A 25-acre farmland has been cleared out for Tuesday’s protest meeting. On Monday, president of Bhartiya Sikh Sangathan Jasbir Singh Virk was overseeing preparations for what they plan as a massive gathering. “Arrangements are in place to host one lakh farmers,” he told TOI. By evening, thousands from Bhartiya Kisan Union and Sikh Kisan Morcha had started arriving in Lakhimpur Kheri. The farmers had initially been asked to assemble at Kaudiyala Gurdwara but “to avoid controversies at a religious site,” the venue was moved. Only the prayer meet will be at the gurdwara now. “Prayers will be offered for my brother as well,” said Pawan, brother of journalist Raman Kashyap who had also died that day. Farmer leaders had earlier said Kashyap, too, would be counted among “martyrs” of the farmers’ movement. After the protest meeting, farmers will hold an Asthi Kalash Yatra, marching with the ashes of the four farmers to “wherever the families want to immerse them.” As the numbers swelled, heavy security was deployed at Kheri. ADG (Lucknow zone) SN Sabat, IG (Lucknow) Laxmi Singh and Lucknow commissioner Ranjan Kumar, along with 7 other IPS officers, are overseeing the law and order arrangements. “We have had meetings with Sikh leaders and requested them to stage the protest at gurdwaras of their areas instead of marching towards Kheri because it could create a law and order problem. Many have accepted our request … As of now, most farmers who have turned up in the district are from Uttarakhand. We are keeping an eye on the numbers,” said a senior official from the administration. Farmer leaders said they are prepared for the pushback. “It seems the state may stop farmers from getting here. We had given time to the state to take action against the minister and his son,” Virk said. “But the minister has not been sacked. He had threatened farmers protesting against the farm laws before hundreds of people. The video went viral. A jeep registered in his name killed farmers. But nothing has been done. We will plan our further action after the Akhand Paath Bhog.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/thousands-start-gathering-for-4-farmers-final-rites-in-kheri/articleshow/86947651.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Forest officer held for taking Rs 5.3 lakh bribe to clear a file||MUMBAI: A senior-level forest officer from Thane was caught allegedly while accepting a bribe on Monday. Officials of the Mumbai Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) said they had nabbed assistant conservator of forests (ACF) Baliram Tukaram Kolekar (57), a class-I officer. Kolekar was accepting f Rs 5.30 lakh from his junior officer to clear his file for grant, officials said, adding that they found Rs 12 lakhfrom a cupboard in Kolekar’s office. A search of his office was going on until late Monday evening. The complainant in the case is a class II-rank officer working in the forest department who alleged that he was to get a grant for his services, but Kolekar had told him that he would have to share a 5%cut of the grant with a district planning officer besides paying Rs 92,000 to Kolekar. The complainant approached the ACB and lodged a complaint. Assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil said that after the demand for bribe was verified, the ACB laid a trap on Monday and arrested Kolekar. He has been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act. This is the third such trap laid by the Mumbai ACB in recent times. In July, the ACB had arrested a deputy superintendent of police and his assistant police constable for allegedly demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 2 crore. In May, the chief executive officer of the state-owned Aarey Dairy had been arrested by the ACB for allegedly seeking and accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000 from a slumdweller at Aarey Colony. His assistant, Arvind Tiwari, was arrested allegedly while accepting the bribe. The complainant had sought permission to repair his house before monsoon. Any repair at Aarey needs sanction from the office of the chief executive officer. Sources said such traps are by set up by different units of the ACB because many a time complainants make requests to rope in officials of a different unit other the local one so that the nabbing operation is successful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-forest-officer-held-for-taking-rs-5-3-lakh-bribe-to-clear-a-file/articleshow/86949849.cms||Ahmed Ali

Smita Zagade, deputy commissioner of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), told TOI that many unassessed properties were yet to be brought under the civic tax ambit and if the citizens registered such properties, it would save the civic body a lot of time. Zagade said the civic body was also going to go ahead with the third-party survey of the residential, commercial and industrial properties in the coming days to identify the new and unassessed properties. “One can get information on the property tax of the unassessed properties on the PCMC website. After the registration, the application will land with the respective ward officer, who will be able to assess the property and accordingly give the rectified tax amount,” she said, adding that the tax rebate would be given for the ongoing year only. She said in the civic body’s earlier survey this year, the tax department had identified few unassessed properties on the campuses of some of the big companies, which owed huge tax amounts. The department got to know there were many other companies, which had similar unassessed properties. Hence, the special third-party survey was the need of the hour, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/5-discount-on-general-tax-for-self-registration-of-properties/articleshow/86949798.cms||---

Though the date of takeover is yet to be officially announced, it is most likely to happen on Thursday (Mahanavami day). The company had started trial runs, including managing the amenities such as lounge, movements of trolleys and parking of vehicles, a few weeks ago. There are also efforts to reopen the duty-free shop that has been lying closed for the past three years owing to alleged fraudulent activities by the former management. It was on January 19 this year that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had signed a concession agreement with the Adani Group for operations, management and development of the international airport here after winning the bid for running the airport for the next 50 years. Developing the infrastructure of the airport within the available land and bringing new flight services to the airport will be the two main immediate goals of the Adani Trivandrum International Airport Ltd (ATIAL) after the takeover. As per the agreement entered, key operations related to customs, immigration, air traffic management, security, communications and navigation surveillance will continue to be managed by AAI. The state government, after failing to win the bid for running the airport, had approached the Kerala high court against the takeover, but the petition was rejected by the court. Following this, the government has moved the Supreme Court with the same petition. The airports authority employees’ union has also submitted a petition in this regard before the Supreme Court. A few days ago, the leaders of the employees’ union met the chief minister seeking the government intervention to stay the takeover as their appeals are pending before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/adani-group-likely-to-take-over-airport-ops-this-week/articleshow/86947684.cms||---

A team of forest department seized the digging equipment from PWD for carrying out the work in violation of an order of NGT.A forest official said, “After we received a complaint in this matter, we inspected the site on Saturday and found that digging was done within one metre radius of trees. A notice was sent to PWD on Monday for damaging four trees under Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994. The matter will be heard on October 20.” PWD officials were unavailable for comments.Verhaen Khanna, New Delhi Nature Society founder, said, “When I visited the spot on October 4, I saw the agency had dug up on two sides of four trees and damaged their roots. However, on the second visit to the site on October 9, I saw that PWD dug up on all four sides of the trees.” He added the damage to a tree’s roots can severely affect its health and life.NGT had directed all public authorities in 2013 to deconcretise areas around trees and no construction activity would be allowed to take place within one metre radius of the trunk of trees.In another matter related to damaging of trees, HC had observed that “let due caution be exercised by the PWD apropos the all its ongoing civil works and due cautionary measures be initiated for all future projects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/forest-depts-notice-to-pwd-for-damaging-four-trees-in-cr-park/articleshow/86949766.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Union minister’s son in police remand for 3 days||BAREILLY: UP Police were on Monday granted three days’ remand for Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish, who was arrested five days after being booked for killing four farmers at Banbirpur in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. He was later booked for killing a journalist at the site as well. The police had sought 14 days’ remand to question him. “The identified accused Ashish Mishra aka Monu was arrested on October 9 and sent to the district jail. Police requested the court for a 14-day remand to investigate all evidence in the case. The court of the chief judicial magistrate, Lakhimpur Kheri, on October 11 granted three days’ police custody remand beginning on October 12,” senior prosecution officer SP Yadav said on Monday evening. A person accused of a crime can be on police remand -- where cops can take him to various locations pertinent for investigation, compare notes and question him -- while being in judicial custody. Ashish was produced in the court of chief judicial magistrate Chinta Ram in a virtual hearing. The court asked the police to conduct a medical examination, ensure Ashish is not under duress and allow his counsel to be present. “A panel of five advocates has been allowed to accompany Ashish as long as he is on remand. The SIT will take remand at 10am on October 12. It will be over at 10am on October 15,” Ashish’s counsel Avdhesh Kumar Singh told TOI. Heavy forces were in place around the district jail and the court on Monday, and RAF jawans marched through the streets of Lakhimpur. Protesting farmers, on the basis of whose complaint Ashish was booked, have said he was in one of the vehicles that ran over farmers on the day of the violence. Both Ashish and his father have denied this, maintaining that he was not at Banbirpur at the time of the killings. During the 12-hour questioning at Lakhimpur Kheri crime branch office on Saturday, however, he could not explain where he was between 2.36pm and 4pm, a member of the SIT investigating the violence had told TOI. The violence took place around 3pm. He had been sent to 14-day judicial custody on Sunday and sent to Lakhimpur district jail. Police, then, wanted remand to be able to question him. Farmers have, meanwhile, questioned the delay in investigation. Several aspects of the probe, too, have come under scrutiny. About the five days it took for the arrest, Supreme Court lawyer Shobha Gupta explained that a lot depends on “prima facie evidence”. She said, “Usually, the police or the investigating team put in their best efforts and even follow from state to state a murder accused, to be arrested immediately. They certainly need prima facie evidence to frame an opinion that the person accused has committed the act. Without even that, it is unsafe to arrest anyone. But it is equally unsafe to allow the culprit to roam free if there is enough prima facie material against them.” About the summons issued by the SIT before arrest, Gupta said, “The question of notice does not arise if there is enough material to frame a prima facie opinion that (person) A has committed murder. Section 41 of the CrPC permits direct arrest.” She added, “Notice is given under Section 160 of the CrPC, the heading of which clearly says, ‘police officers’ power to require attendance of witnesses’.” As for the presence of lawyers during interrogation, she said, “Section 41D, which was inserted with effect from November 1, 2010 in CrPC, requires as a mandate that the arrested person shall be allowed to meet their lawyer during interrogation but not throughout … I think this permits the lawyer to be around and not part of the interrogation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/union-mins-son-in-police-remand-for-3-days/articleshow/86947672.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Lucknow||IIT-Kanpur study lauds Uttar Pradesh’s Covid-19 control model||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh’s model of Covid-19 control has drawn praise in a study conducted by IIT-Kanpur. Released by chief minister Yogi Adityanath at a function in Lucknow on Monday, the detailed study has noted that sustained, organised and coordinated efforts controlled Covid-19 spread in the most populous state. Conducted by Prof Manindra Agarwal and his team, the study throws light on the steps taken by the state government to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis during the reverse migration of over 40 lakh migrant workers. It also praises the Yogi government for providing employment to these migrant workers. The UP Covid model included ensuring livelihood, sustaning economy, augmenting healthcare and preventing spread. The study notes that UP's stringent audit saved 30MT oxygen per day during peak crisis. UP was the first state to airlift empty O2 tankers with IAF help to reduce turn-around time, it adds. The report also highlights that the state government arranged free bus services for returning workers and ambulance services for sick ones. It also stressed that MNREGS was used for job creation and local self-governing bodies utilised worker database for employment cards.Upholding the findings, Yogi said: “Despite facing numerous challenges such as a huge population, lack of resources and reverse migration of workers, UP’s pandemic response is serving as a ‘model’ for various states and even countries.” Expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his guidance and support throughout the pandemic, the CM said, “Had the health and medical infrastructure not been expanded under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, the country would not have been able to fight the pandemic in the way it has.” Underlining UP’s progress in terms of availability of medical resources, the CM stated that UP continued to work in the direction amid the pandemic. “From getting the first batch of Covid-19 tests conducted at NIV Pune in 2020 to crossing the milestone of conducting 8 crore tests today in UP, the state is moving towards becoming self-reliant in every way,” Yogi said. Launching a scathing attack at the Opposition for allegedly perpetrating negative politics amid crises, the CM said, “In sharp contrast to other states that continued to depend on the Centre for supply of medical oxygen, UP worked on war-footing to ensure oxygen in abundance. As a result, over 500 oxygen producing plants have been set up across the state at various medical institutions.” He also added that UP is the only state to have administered over 38 lakh vaccine doses in a single day. “Overall, 11.5 crore people have the protective shield of the vaccine. The drive is on to vaccinate the entire eligible adult population,” the CM added. Member of NITI Aayog and of the Union government’s core team for Covid-19 response Dr VK Paul also praised the state. Claiming that there could have been more than 70,000 cases per day in UP during the second wave, which was prevented, he said: “Due to the proactive measures implemented by the state government, the spread was controlled in the densely populated state of 24 crore people. The state has demonstrated strong leadership, effective governance, and commitment throughout this pandemic, and led by example.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/iit-k-study-lauds-ups-covid-19-control-model/articleshow/86951862.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Stating that the programme aims to provide students with a “non-judgmental helping hand”, Kejriwal said, “We want these children to get a guiding light. Someone with whom they can talk to without having inhibitions.” By registering on the Delhi government’s app, people across the country can become mentors to the students. Appealing to people across the country to join the programme as mentors, Kejriwal further said, “Desh ke Mentor will be able to properly guide and counsel the children. I appeal to the people of the country to join this initiative and help build this country. If one child becomes a better citizen, it will be because of your guidance; then you have contributed greatly to the cause of nation building.” The CM also added that the initiative will help overcome societal divides. “People will start seeing beyond the fault lines of caste and creed. They won’t see the religion of the person they are talking to. All these walls that have divided our society will completely fall down and unite the country. I am sure this programme will be a huge success and hope that it can be picked up throughout the country and every child in the country can get a mentor of their own,” Kejriwal said. Stating that the number of students in Delhi government schools has increased from 16 lakh to over 18 lakh, Kejriwal said that over two lakh students have shifted from private schools to government schools. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said, “We need a mentor at every point in our lives but it is needed a bit more during school time. During this time, there is a lot of pressure on the children and to reduce this pressure it is necessary to have a mentor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/desh-ka-mentor-scheme-launched-cm-says-it-will-provide-kids-guiding-light/articleshow/86951932.cms||---

---||Delhi||Working to find a way out of power crisis: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday that the power situation in the country was critical and Delhi government was making every effort alongside the central government to ensure that the capital did not face an electricity emergency. “Several chief ministers have written to the central government about the critical power position across the country,” Kejriwal told reporters, adding that all stakeholders were trying to remedy the situation. Earlier in the day, Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain said that even though the peak power demand was much lower than in September, electricity was being bought at rates as high as Rs 17-20 per unit. Normally, discoms buy electricity at Rs 5.5-6 per unit as part of long-term arrangements. “Delhi government has the major of its power purchase agreements with NTPC (formerly known as National Thermal Power Corporation Limited), but the company has cut its power production at its various plants by half,” said Jain. “No power plant should have coal stock of less than 15 days. Right now, most of the plants have coal for just 2-3 days of operations. All NTPC plants are working at 50-55% capacity. The central government should explain why despite this, other power plants are still facing a coal crunch across the county.” Jain said that according to the power purchase agreement, NTPC has to provide complete power supply 85% of the time every year and the remaining 15% of the time, it can drop supply to 55%. “But this cannot be done for all the plants at the same time,” Jain explained. He said that NTPC usually provided around 4,000 MW of electricity to Delhi, but at the moment it was unable to supply even half of the contracted amount. NTPC didn’t respond when asked for comments by TOI. “The prevailing demand for electricity in Delhi is low. At one time, the power demand was more than 7,300 MW, but this has come down to 4,562 MW at present. Even when the demand is so low, we are ending up buying electricity at rates from Rs 17 to Rs 20,” said Jain. Jain said the power crisis in the whole country was a matter of concern. The Centre claims there is no crisis, Jain argued, then why did the Uttar Pradesh chief minister write to the central government about power cuts? He also reasoned that only when the central government accepted the fact of the coal paucity as an urgent problem could everyone start working on a solution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/working-to-find-a-way-out-of-power-crisis-cm/articleshow/86949863.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Dehradun||U’khand minister, son join Cong ahead of state polls||Dehradun: Uttarakhand transport minister Yashpal Arya along with his son Sanjiv, an MLA from Nainital, joined Congress in the presence of senior party members in Delhi on Monday, a decision insiders said was prompted partly by the farmers’ protests in Terai belt — a stronghold of the Aryas. After joining the party, Arya, a prominent Dalit face in the Kumaon region, said, “It is an important day in my life as I have returned to the party from where I started my political journey. It has been a 40-year association with the Congress and it feels like I am back home.” Arya had quit Congress in 2017 to join the BJP prior to the assembly elections. While Arya and Sanjiv tendered their resignations as MLAs to speaker Prem Chand Agrawal, Arya’s resignation as transport minister was sent to governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd). Reacting to the development, Dhami said that Arya had quit as personal interests had become more important to him than the country. “In BJP, it is the country first and then the party. Personal interests hold no meaning. It looks like personal interests became more important for Yashpal.” A six-time MLA, Arya has served as a cabinet minister in the Vijay Bahuguna and Harish Rawat governments from 2012 to 2017. During the ND Tiwari government, he served as the state assembly speaker from March 15, 2002 to March 11, 2007. “I do not have any expectations, I will work for the party and follow the instructions given to me,” said Arya, who was also the Uttarakhand Congress chief between 2007 and 2014. The father-son duo joined the Congress in the presence of the party’s general secretary K C Venugpopal, former Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat and Uttarakhand Congress in-charge Devender Yadav. Congress state in-charge Devendra Yadav said, “We welcome both Yashpal and his son Sanjiv into the party fold. Both are dedicated to the cause of the people and their presence will strengthen the party in the entire state. They were feeling suffocated in the BJP and therefore took the decision to make a ghar vapsi.” Earlier two Independent MLAs – Pritam Singh Panwar and Ram Singh Kaida – and Congress MLA Rajkumar had joined the BJP. Poll analysts said Arya decided to join Congress since farmers’ protests have created an anti-BJP sentiment in the Terai region which is his stronghold. Speculations of Arya joining the Congress had gathered steam after Dhami recently visited his Dehradun residence for a “breakfast meeting”. According to political analyst Udit Ghildiyal, “Harish Rawat had also recently said that like in Punjab, he would one day like to see a Dalit CM in Uttarakhand. It is a very big statement and only Yashpal Arya has that stature in the state.” Ghildiyal added that farmers in Udham Singh Nagar district constitute a large voterbase and the “Lakhimpur Kheri incident has made things extremely awkward for leaders of the ruling party”. Arya won his first assembly election from Khatima constituency in 1989 and retained it in the 1993 Uttar Pradesh state polls (Uttarakhand was a part of UP then). In 2002 and 2007, Arya emerged victorious from Mukteshwar constituency. In 2012, he shifted to Bajpur constituency, which he won as part of Congress and five years later emerged victorious on a BJP ticket. Arya was successful in convincing the BJP to give ticket to his son Sanjiv to contest elections on Nainital (SC) seat which the latter won.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-minister-son-join-cong-ahead-of-state-polls/articleshow/86943503.cms||Kautilya Singh

District siddha medical officer (DSMO) Dr S Kamaraj said nilavembu kudineer is a concoction of nine herbals – nilavembu, vilamichai ver, vetti ver, dry ginger, pepper, sandal, koraikizhangu, peipudal and parpadagam. Claiming that its consumption will cure viral fever, he said the ingredients will regulate the secretion of enzymes and bring down the body temperature, thus maintaining the hydration at the right level. He said its general intake is thrice a day for five to seven days for fever patients, on the advice of a physician. The department also prescribes papaya leaf juice to increase white blood cells and platelets which come down during dengue. The advice comes in the wake of regular incidences of dengue in Trichy district. A senior official of public health department said the district has recorded around 120 cases since January with sporadic cases in urban and rural areas. Thuvakudi north area witnessed four to five cases of dengue at a time recently. Health department officials visited the spot and domestic breeding checkers checked and cleared water stored in the houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/nilavembu-kudineer-can-keep-off-dengue-siddha-dept/articleshow/86949831.cms||---

Police said the accident occurred when the driver tried to dodge stray cattle on the road and ended up ramming the vehicle into the pedestrian platform. Traffic police said the MUV driven by a Perambalur-based man was nearing the bus stand locality on College Road around 3.30 am. The road being vacant, the driver was speeding when stray cattle suddenly crossed the road while approaching St Joseph’s college entrance. He swerved the vehicle towards the left, crashing into the pedestrian platform and a two-wheeler parked nearby. The car also rammed a small tree and advertisement poles before coming to halt. “Fortunately, there were no pedestrians and none was injured. Stray cattle menace is increasing in the city. We will insist Trichy corporation evolve a solution for this,” an investigating officer said. Police said non-fatal accidents caused by stray animals are occurring daily. The car almost plunged into the basement of a commercial complex nearby. A case has been registered and investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/stray-cattle-blamed-as-car-rams-platform/articleshow/86949855.cms||---
---||India||After 5 decades, Haryana rescinds order banning staff from RSS, Jamaat activities||CHANDIGARH: Over five decades after Haryana restricted the state government employees from participating in the activities of the RSS, the Manohar Lal Khattar government on Monday withdrew the diktat that was issued in 1967. The government withdrew the relevant portion of the January 11, 1967, notification which prohibited the staff from taking part in activities of the Sangh and Jamaat-e-Islami. The order released by the chief secretary’s office said that the prohibition was withdrawn as it is “no longer required”. The 1967 order had said that the government held the activities of the RSS and Jamaat-e-Islami to be of such a nature that participation in them by the government employees would attract action under the service rules. Monday’s orders were issued in the notification for implementation of the Haryana Civil Services (Government Employees Conduct) Rules, 2016 which bans the participation of employees in politics and elections. As per the new rules, “no government employee shall be a member of, or be otherwise associated with, any political party or any organisation, which takes part in politics”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-5-decades-haryana-rescinds-order-banning-staff-from-rss-jamaat-activities/articleshow/86954180.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Monorail frequency to go from 20 minutes to 5 as 10 new trains ordered||MUMBAI: Monorail commuters can expect to get a faster and more comfortable service as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has placed orders for 10 rakes under the Make In India programme. Delivery will begin from January 2023 onwards. The monorail currently operates with seven rakes, of which two are kept on stand-by, and services are at a frequency of 20 minutes. MMRDA announced that Indian firm Medha Servo Drives Ltd will supply 10 rakes of four cars each for the 20-km Chembur to Jacob Circle corridor.  “With the introduction of 10 more rakes, a headway of five minutes can be achieved. With this headway, there will be a substantial increase in ridership and revenue. Delivery will be over by January 2024,” said metropolitan commissioner SVR Srinivas.  MMRDA said the new rakes will be spacious and have better safety features. Medha Servo will have to design the rake before starting supply.  The weight of each currently operational coach is 13.5 ton. Coaches in the new rakes will be lighter, decreasing load on the guideway and piers, and also faster. The carrying capacity of the coaches will increase too, but the actual number will be known only after the design is approved. A source said, “As against the current capacity of 568 passengers per train, the new coaches will have at least 10% more capacity.”  MMRDA said the cost of maintenance will be lower compared to previous trains due to the Make in India programme. “Spare parts will be easily available in the near future for maintenance purposes. Also, new bogies will be made of stainless steel, just like the Metro,” said an official.  MMRDA had appointed the Larsen & Toubro and Scomi Engineering (LTSE) consortium as contractors for the monorail project in 2008. The system has been plagued with problems as Scomi could not provide adequate rakes, thus hampering the project. The consortium was not able to meet terms of contract and has provided only 10 rolling stock units against a provision of 15 as per the contract. Out of the 10, the contractor cannibalised two (thus making them useless) and one was gutted in a fire in November 2017.  In December 2018, MMRDA terminated the contractor “for failure to perform and fulfil contractual obligations”. MMRDA took over operations of the entire corridor in March 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-monorail-frequency-to-go-from-20-mins-to-5-as-10-new-trains-ordered/articleshow/86949986.cms||Manthank Mehta

Bhadohi and Chandauli were separated from Varanasi in 1994 and 1997, respectively. The PWD will execute these projects at a cost of Rs 273 crores and Rs 416 crores, respectively. Talking to TOI on Monday, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “The two projects of converting two-lane Varanasi-Gopiganj road via Bhadohi into four-lane with a budget of Rs 273.12 crores and Mohansarai-Chakia crossing road in Chandauli district via Varanasi (Cantonment) railway station and DDU Nagar (Mughalsarai) into six-lane road with an investment of Rs 416 crores, have been approved by the state government and will be executed by PWD.” As per the estimate of PWD, total cost of the Varanasi-Bhadohi road four-lane conversion has been estimated as Rs 273.12 crores, including Rs 162.93 crores for road construction, Rs 100.08 crores for land acquisition, Rs 2.37 crores for tree cutting, Rs 6.22 crores on shifting of poles and transformers and Rs 1.50 crore on shifting of religious structures. “The existing 32-km Varanasi-Gopiganj road via Bhadohi has been connected with ring-road phase-II,” said the commissioner adding, consignments of carpets for export go to airports and seaports of Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi via Varanasi. Apart from this, traffic of passenger vehicles is also very heavy on this two-lane road. The four-lane conversion of this road will ease traffic on this road, which has many densely populated areas along it. The Mohansarai-Varanasi (Cantt) railway station-DDU Nagar-Chakia crossing road six-lane will be a project of Rs 416.88 crores, including Rs 308.49 crores on road construction, Rs 66.37 crores on land acquisition, Rs 10.48 crores on tree cutting and re-plantation, Rs 2.34 crores on water line shifting, Rs 27.68 crores on electric poles and transformers shifting and Rs 1.50 crores on religious structure shifting. The Mohansarai-Chakia crossing road via Varanasi railway station and DDU Nagar, is also known as old-GT Road. He said that there is a very heavy load on this 54.885 km road, which is linked with BHU, DLW, Sarnath, Chandauli, Azamgarh, Ghazipur and other highways at different points. Traffic jams are faced on this road for almost 24 hours. More problems are faced during Shrawan months when traffic is diverted in view of Kanwariya movement, he said adding, arrival of service lanes with six-lane roads on this route will not only end all these problems, but also solve the problem of waterlogging during the rainy season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/two-lane-roads-linking-kashi-to-bhadohi-chandauli-to-be-widened/articleshow/86949913.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Chandigarh||HC to examine if Haryana employees selected in 2003 entitled to old pension scheme||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court would now examine whether an employee is entitled to seniority and pensionary benefits from the date of joining or from the date when other such employees, who were selected through the same selection process, had joined service. Justice Arun Monga issued a notice to the Haryana government and has sought its response on the issue. He had taken cognizance of a petition filed by some drivers of the Haryana Roadways department, who had sought seniority and benefits of the old pension scheme on the ground that they were selected prior to the closure of the old pension scheme. However, they were allowed to join their duties after a gap of five years. The petitioners, Jagtar Singh and Others, have been working in Sonipat, Palwal, and Faridabad depots of the state’s roadways department. According to the petitioners, the Haryana government had decided to recruit 500 drivers in 2003. Tentative vacancies for the post of drivers in Faridabad depot were shown to be 40. Out of these, 20 posts were of the general category. The selection list was published on July 30, 2003. In this list, the petitioners were selected for the post of driver. Some of the candidates were permitted to join on the posts on December 12, 2003, from the general category and some were permitted to join in December 2004. However, the petitioners, who were also selected as a part of the same process, were permitted to join the department in 2008 only after the intervention of the HC. The petitioners had approached the transport department with a request that they had been selected after an advertisement issued in April 2003 along with the similarly situated persons, who were permitted to join the service immediately on their selection. Those who joined prior to the petitioners have been given benefits from 2003 but the petitioners were given the benefits from 2008. The counsel for the petitioners, advocate Rajender Singh Malik argued that the petitioners were entitled to seniority from the same advertisement when they were selected but the seniority in the service to the petitioners has been awarded from the date of joining instead of the date of selection along with other similar-situated persons, who were selected under the same advertisement and under the same process. “Seniority has to be assigned on the basis of the ranking given by the selection board and not on the basis of joining reports. Seniority fixed on the basis of joining reports is illegal,” Malik argued, citing some Supreme Court judgments. The counsel sought the directions for quashing the order dated August 23 through which their claim regarding grant of ante-date seniority along with consequential benefits-- pensionary benefits under the old scheme. Directions have also been sought for benefits under the old pension scheme by giving the petitioners deemed appointment from the date of joining of similarly situated persons by giving the notional benefits from the period December 12, 2003 to June 17, 2008, along with consequential benefits. After hearing the plea, the HC has issued notice to the principal secretary, department of transport, Haryana and the director of the state’s transport department seeking their replies on the issue by February 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-to-examine-if-hry-employees-selected-in-2003-but-appointed-in-2008-are-entitled-to-old-pension-scheme/articleshow/86949866.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Amit Shah holds meet, officials say coal stocks up in 2 days||NEW DELHI: Coal inventories at power stations have reportedly started rising on the back of improved dispatch. This was noted at a meeting held by Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday with power minister Raj Kumar Singh, coal minister Pralhad Joshi and top officials of the two ministries to take stock of the fuel supply situation for electricity generation, sources told TOI. The stocks of coal grew at the power plants by 48,000 tonnes and 25,000 tonnes on October 9 and 10, respectively, as more consignments were dispatched from the Coal India’s mines as monsoon subsided in coal-bearing states. While the numbers may not appear significant, they indicate improvement in the situation as mining and loading operations picked up pace after dewatering of mines that were inundated due to rain towards September-end. Dhanbad in Jharkhand, which is the production area of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, received 300mm of rainfall for three days from September 30. Shah’s meeting came in the backdrop of blackout concerns raised over the weekend by Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd CEO Ganesh Srinivasan and Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain, citing coal shortage at the power plants feeding the national capital. Nearly half of the non-pithead domestic coal-fired plants were running low on fuel, but generation was reportedly not threatened as inventories were being replenished daily. The situation was aggravated by a 30% reduction in generation by imported coal-fired plants under PPAs due to high international coal prices, while domestic coal-based power supply went up nearly 24% in the first half. Imported coal-based power plants have generated about 25.6 billion units against a programme of 45.7 billion units. It was also noted that power was available from NTPC’s Dadri station, but the capital’s discoms didn’t source it as they wanted to exit PPAs after their 25-year validity ended citing high tariffs of Rs 5-6 per unit against Rs 3-4 on the exchanges earlier. However, the rates have reportedly risen to Rs 12-13 per unit in recent times as demand grew on uptick in economic activities and dip in coal supply. This prompted some private power producers to back down some of their capacities as they did not maintain stipulated inventories to avoid carrying costs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shah-holds-meet-officials-say-coal-stocks-up-in-2-days/articleshow/86949904.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Weekly positivity rate of Himachal Pradesh above national average, more than Punjab & Haryana||CHANDIGARH: While Covid-19 appears to show signs of waning in Punjab and Haryana, in neighbouring Himachal Pradesh a large number of people continue to get infected, pushing the weekly tests positive rate in the hill state above the national average. In the last week, 2.2% of samples tested have been found positive for the virus in the hill state whereas the national positivity rate was recorded at 1.5%. Positivity rate refers to the percentage of people who are Covid-19 positive out of the total tested. What is more concerning is that the positivity rate of Himachal is higher than that of many states with a substantially higher count of active cases, despite the increased vaccination rate. The weekly positivity rate of Maharashtra, one of the worst-hit states in the country, was 1.8% while 1.5% of total samples tested in Andhra Pradesh in one week tested positive, 1% in Tamil Nadu and 0.4% in Karnataka. The weekly positivity rate in Punjab and Haryana was recorded at 0.1%. Not only that, on October 10, Himachal had the highest number of 1,345 active cases in the region while 273 people infected with the virus in Haryana and 234 in Punjab are yet to recover. The daily heavy case count of the state has pushed the R-value – rate at which Covid-19 or any other infection spreads -- to 1.02, which is higher than the national average of 0.91. The infection rate in Punjab (0.97)and Haryana (0.90) has been recorded below the crucial threshold of 1. The state health experts attributed the high positivity rate to a steep rise in the influx of tourists in the state. Besides that, the state is also witnessing elected related activities in Mandi parliamentary constituency and three other assembly constituencies As per the projections done by Cambridge Judge Business School and National Institute of Economic and Social Research, working with Health Systems Transformation Platform in India for the next two weeks, the current trend will continue with state projected to report daily fresh cases in three figures. The state is expected to report around 150 cases by October 24. Steps being taken: MininsterState health minister Rajiv Saiza said the cases have increased whenever people have let their guard down. He said that all necessary steps are being taken to contain the spread of the virus. "Health and other allied departments are capable of delivering and the success of the vaccination drive is proof of their capabilities," said Saiza. Himachal has so far outperformed all the states by emerging as a leader in vaccinating its eligible population. As per data, the state managed to fully vaccinate about 42% of the population out of every 100 and provided at least one dose to about 82% out of 100, which is the highest in the country. The national average of the fully vaccinated population stands at about 18% and partially inoculated at 50%. In comparison, Haryana has so far managed to fully immunise 23 out of 100 while the figure of the fully vaccinated population in Punjab stands at 18 out of 100.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/weekly-positivity-rate-of-hp-above-national-avg-more-than-pb-hry/articleshow/86949931.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Shimla||Covid-19: Weekly positivity rate of Himachal Pradesh above national average, more than Punjab & Haryana||CHANDIGARH: While Covid-19 appears to show signs of waning in Punjab and Haryana, in neighbouring Himachal Pradesh a large number of people continue to get infected, pushing the weekly tests positive rate in the hill state above the national average. In the last week, 2.2% of samples tested have been found positive for the virus in the hill state whereas the national positivity rate was recorded at 1.5%. Positivity rate refers to the percentage of people who are Covid-19 positive out of the total tested. What is more concerning is that the positivity rate of Himachal is higher than that of many states with a substantially higher count of active cases, despite the increased vaccination rate. The weekly positivity rate of Maharashtra, one of the worst-hit states in the country, was 1.8% while 1.5% of total samples tested in Andhra Pradesh in one week tested positive, 1% in Tamil Nadu and 0.4% in Karnataka. The weekly positivity rate in Punjab and Haryana was recorded at 0.1%. Not only that, on October 10, Himachal had the highest number of 1,345 active cases in the region while 273 people infected with the virus in Haryana and 234 in Punjab are yet to recover.

This has overburdened many, especially farmers from Tiruvarur who don’t get adequate fertilizers such as urea and potash as well as water for irrigation. They have appealed to the state government to provide crop loans through district cooperative banks without any delay failing which they will have to discontinue the cultivation. G Sundaramoorthy, district secretary of CPM, said that earlier the respective primary agriculture credit cooperative society received applications from the farmers and sanctioned crop loan after duly processing them. With RBI transferring all powers to district central cooperative banks, there is an inordinate delay in processing loans. “Recent instances have revealed that several farmers could not avail of crop loans as they are unable to clear the queries raised by the central cooperative banks. In the case of primary agriculture societies, farmers have the opportunity to meet and interact with the society officials and staff,”, he stated. The state government should find an alternate solution to make the process easier so that all farmers can avail of loans without delay, he added. On chemical fertilizers, he said there was an acute shortage of urea and potash in Tiruvarur. This encouraged private players to fix exorbitant prices in the open market. Though officials clarified that they have sufficient stock of fertilizers, the reality was different, Sundaramoorthy alleged. District collectors should take necessary steps to supply fertilizers for samba cultivation, he said. Meanwhile, Tiruvarur district collector P Gayathri has formed district-level and block-level committees to monitor the sale of fertilizers. In a statement, she said that committees have been formed to monitor the sale of fertilizers by private agencies and cooperative credit societies. Farmers can complain with the committee if they find any irregularities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-ready-for-samba-run-into-crop-loan-wall/articleshow/86949917.cms||---
---||Delhi||Entrepreneurial dreams coming true at this govt school in Delhi, one stitch at a time||NEW DELHI: From fabricating wallets, bags and folders from discarded cloth to stitching gowns and buying raw materials for decorative candles, wall hangings and bulbs and then selling the items created, students of Sarvodyaya Kanya Vidyalaya in West Vinod Nagar are going the distance to realise their entrepreneurial dreams. Several other students of this Delhi government institution in east Delhi are also exploring their options in handicrafts with the aim of involving housewives and providing them with a source of income. The “entrepreneurship mindset curriculum”, introduced in the school, is pushing senior school students to explore their business acumen and generate revenue and employment. Class XI student Muskan Patel was led to think of more reasonably priced wooden trays and boxes when she saw how expensive they were. “I plan to buy the items at wholesale prices, redecorate them, package them attractively and sell them at affordable prices,” said Patel. “The market is full of goods which are expensive and we want to provide an alternative.” Arzoo, also a Class XI student, has taken the curriculum as a step to a future opportunity. “We will buy raw materials and sell finished products at the cheapest prices possible,” the youngster said. “Most people have jobs, but there have to be those who create and provide the jobs. If we can start our own businesses, we will achieve this. Through the entrepreneurship curriculum, we are being prepared for the future and for the profit that will be ours.” Like Patel, Laxmi Khanayat and her team members in the Royal Craft group plan to channel their creativity into producing inexpensive decor pieces. “We intend to sell the items that we create at reasonable prices. Depending on the need, we will be able to even customise the products,” said Khanayat. “Through the entrepreneurship curriculum, Delhi government wants us to know that we cannot remain unemployed after completing our education and has set us on to realising our dreams.” Nandini Kumari, who is inclined towards art and embroidery, is working towards recreating the paintings on clothing. “I want to add colour to people’s lives through my products,” she says earnestly. “I can even frame my paintings and sell them. I have also experimented with mask making.” The “Sartorial Squad” comprising a group of Class XII students has already made gowns and shirts. Anamta Naaz, who leads the team, said, “Our group’s theme is stitching. While two of us do the stitching work, the others acquire the raw materials. We will work on the designs and styles that people want and deliver clothing items to them at reasonable prices.” The school is now planning to hold an in-house exhibition on November 2 to showcase these products and thus motivate the youngsters. Under the entrepreneurship mindset curriculum, Delhi government provides Rs 2,000 as seed money that students use to grow their business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/entrepreneurial-dreams-coming-true-at-this-govt-school-one-stitch-at-a-time/articleshow/86949928.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

While party leaders remained tightlipped, sources said that BJP national chief JP Nadda chaired a closed-door meeting with Singh and Bansal to discuss the likely political fallout of the incident even as a belligerent opposition continued to demand the sacking of junior Union home minister Ajay Mishra Teni whose son Ashish has been arrested for his alleged involvement in mowing down four farmers in Kheri on October 3. The meeting, convened at the party headquarters on 11 Ashoka Road in Delhi, was also attended by Union education minister and UP election incharge Dharmendra Pradhan, BJP vice-president and UP organisation in charge Radha Mohan Singh and deputy CM Keshav Maurya. BJP sources said the party is concerned amid the opposition’s aggressive stance to corner it over the Lakhimpur incident. BJP sources said the party is concerned amid the opposition’s aggressive stance to corner it over the Lakhimpur incident.Analysts said the BJP finds itself in a quandary given Teni’s Brahmin credentials which got underlined with his induction in the Union cabinet in July. Sources said that the party is cautious and weighing all options before taking any decision on Teni’s fate as it could antagonise upper caste voters who have traditionally voted for the BJP. Opposition parties, specially BSP and SP, are trying to woo Brahmins in a bid to stop the return of BJP to office after 2022 elections. BJP think tank, sources said, does not want to give opposition any further room to unleash its salvos at the party and dent its electoral prospects in the assembly polls. The state BJP leadership is said to have discussed the feedback gathered from the MLAs during the region wise meetings held at CM Yogi Adityanath’s official residence in the past three days. Sources said party MPs, MLAs and district level functionaries had voiced public concerns visa-vis facilities and administrative functioning. The process of screening the sitting MLAs based on their performance in the past 4.5 years of BJP rule also figured prominently in the meetings. Sources said “a good number” of MLAs are on the radar of the party leadership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-bjp-leaders-in-delhi-to-discuss-poll-readiness-under-lakhimpur-shadow/articleshow/86951906.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Youngest patient undergoes knee replacement surgery in Rajkot||RAJKOT: Though she was just 22 years old, Vinju Vanda felt like an old woman. As a child, she had developed pain in her left knee, which forced her to limp around. As years passed, the pain got so excruciating that she begged the doctors to cut off her leg. Today, the smile on her face testifies to the relief she finally experienced from undergoing a total knee replacement surgery. And she is probably the youngest patient not just in India but also the entire world to have undergone this operation. Doctors from Rajkot, who operated on her three months ago, assessed all parameters medically to finally declare the surgery a success. Dr Umang Shihora, an orthopaedic, said, “About 98% patients who require knee replacement have varus deformity (inward angulation). Vanda had valgus deformity (outward angulation) and she was quite young. When she first approached me one and a half years ago, I hesitated as I did not want to put her life at risk. However, she stayed adamant and we performed the surgery, which lasted two and a half hours. “We looked through medical records and journals from across the globe, and realized she was the youngest person to undergo knee replacement. Before her, the youngest patient was a 25-year-old from Uttar Pradesh.” Clinical investigation revealed that Vanda, who hails from Roghada village of Kutiyana taluka, had injured her knee when she was six or seven years of age. “Since they belong to a small village, the injury was probably neglected. This damaged the structure that gives stability to joints and resulted in muscles wasting away,” said Dr Shihora. Vanda, a graduate in English literature, is currently pursuing her BEd. She has four siblings and her father is a cattle-breeder. “I began limping at the age of 10. My family took me to a doctor in Upleta who advised us to undergo surgery after I turned 18. When we approached doctors after I became an adult, they refused to operate on me due to my young age. I went through unbearable pain. The month before the operation, I was bed-ridden. I asked the doctors to amputate my leg. I was ready to do anything to get rid of this suffering,” she said. Her plea prompted the doctors to operate on her. “We waited three months before declaring the operation a success as clinical follow-up is important. We check parameters including how much pain remains and movement of joints. She is free of pain now. However, she will have to undergo physiotherapy and treatment to strengthen her muscles,” Dr Shihora added. Dr S R Rao, a senior orthopaedic surgeon from Rajkot, said, “Generally, doctors do not prefer to perform knee replacement surgery for younger patients as the replaced knee lasts for 20-25 years and then the patient has to undergo another replacement surgery.” Watch Gujarat: 22-yr-old woman, probably youngest patient in India, undergoes knee replacement surgery in Rajkot||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/youngest-patient-undergoes-knee-replacement-surgery/articleshow/86945736.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath used to resolve issues of people every morning and most of the people present there belonged to Muslim community and even now during Janta Darshan in Gorakhnath temple, the same scene could be seen,” said principal, MP PG College at Jungle Dhoorsar, Dr Pradeep Rao.

Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) has prepared a detailed project report (DPR) to develop a promenade, a paved public walk with many tourism attractions, on the waterfront near the Nethravati riverbank. MSCL general manager Arun Prabha told TOI that a special purpose vehicle has been planned to take up the proposed 2.1km promenade project at an estimated cost of Rs 19 crore. “The Area Based Development (ABD) under the Mangaluru Smart City Mission has a 5.1km of waterfront starting from Nethravati road bridge. The proposed promenade will be developed between the bridge and Bolar on a pilot basis. A biodiversity park with walkways and bridges allowing visitors to have a walkthrough experience has been proposed under the project. People can go through the entire biodiversity park and small convention centres have also been proposed. A DPR has been prepared and a tender process will commence within a week,” he said. The MSCL has reserved Rs 194 crore for the waterfront project to be taken up in a phased manner. “Many other proposals to be included under the waterfront project, including water metro, open theatre and a cultural centre, that are in different stages of DPR preparation,” he added. Elected representatives have been stressing on the waterfront development for the coastal city for many years.

---||Goa||Goa withdraws ‘eminent’ list that had CM Pramod Sawant but not Dayanand Bandodkar||PANAJI: The state government was left red-faced and forced to backtrack after it was roundly criticised for publishing a list of eminent leaders that had CM Pramod Sawant in it, but omitted the names of Goa’s first CM Dayanand Bandodkar and India’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru. “The circular stands withdrawn with immediate effect,” said director, department of information and publicity, Dipak Bandekar. On Thursday, the government issued a circular stating that the government has approved photographs of national leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, President Ram Nath Kovind, PM Narendra Modi and Sawant, for official use by all government departments, corporations, and autonomous bodies, including local bodies. The opposition hit back, noting that the state government mentioned neither Bandodkar nor Nehru in the list. “Goa’s first CM Bandodkar is considered ‘yugpurush of Goa’ by the people of Goa,” said senior MGP functionary Ramkrishna Dhavalikar. “But Goa’s present CM considers himself more eminent than him... I strongly condemn the decision taken by the CM and demand that he rolls back the notification and includes Bandodkar’s name.” Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai too slammed the government. “The @BJP4Goa govt continues to erase #Goan & national history by not allowing govt offices to display portraits of #Goa’s first CM Bandodkar & India’s first PM Nehru. This decision is a dangerous attempt to alter history & we urge the @GovtofGoa not to undermine public sentiment!” he tweeted.

Moreover, the same was in connection to create awareness regarding our great leaders in view of the ongoing ‘Azadi ka amrut mahotsav’, (and) CM Sawant has been taking all the necessary efforts to make the events namely ‘Goa@60’ & ‘Azadi ka amrut mahotsav’ successful,” the CMO said. The office further said that the CM “is aware of Goa’s rich political legacy left behind by Bandodkar, and draws inspiration from the same. However, the same leaders who had opposed the statue of Bandodkar in the secretariat complex are now trying to shed crocodile tears. It is noteworthy that the BJPled government has immortalised Bandodkar by naming its most popular scheme in his honour (Dayanand samajik suraksha yojana).” Sawant’s office also said that some political parties are creating a hype around this issue for settling petty scores. “They have only used Bandodkar for their publicity, but have ignored his vision and have not done anything constructive in his fond memory,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-withdraws-eminent-list-that-had-sawant-but-not-bandodkar/articleshow/86950040.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Gang of Bangladesh: They wield walkie-talkie and use trains to flee||LUCKNOW: A gang of Bangladeshi youths, all in their early 20s, striking at will across states, executing dacoities with precision and escaping by trains soon after to evade arrests, was finally busted by Lucknow Police after a brief encounter in the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. The 11 gang members used to enter India through the porous India-Bangladesh border and travelled to different states though trains and used walkie-talkie handsets to communicate with each other while committing dacoities. Lucknow Police commissioner Dhruva Kant Thakur said the gang was planning to execute a dacoity when a police patrol spotted it near Malhaur railway station. “Around 1.45am, a patrol team spotted some men wielding guns along railway tracks in Malhaur, Gomtinagar, and asked them to stop. But they began running and on being chased opened fire. When police retaliated, two miscreants were hit in the exchange of fire and fell on the ground and one was nabbed while the others escaped,” said Deputy Commissioner of police, East Zone, Sanjiv Suman. The three were identified as Sheikh Rubail, 26, Alam, 27, and Rabiul, 23, all natives of Bagerhat district in Bangladesh. During questioning, they confessed that they were specially trained in Bangladesh for a month before they came to strike in India. The accused were trained in jumping over 15-foot high compound walls effortlessly, cutting grilles with hack-saw blades, cut pliers, and opening doorknobs by using thin screwdrivers. They also carried countrymade pistols to counter any sudden threat and communicated only in Bangla, said officials. “They were trained by one Hamza, who lives in Bangladesh, and collects 30% of the booty of each robbery. A manhunt has been launched to arrest the eight accused who escaped,” they added. During questioning, the three confessed to their involvement in two dacoities in Vibhutikhand and Chinhat in the state capital and three dacoities in Rohaniya police station area of Varanasi. They also confessed to have committed robberies in Dehradun, Bengaluru, Katni, Bhubaneswar, and Anand Vihar in Delhi and are wanted in cases registered in different states, including UP, the officials said. “After committing some dacoities, the gang used to flee to Bangladesh, hence could not be nabbed,” said Thakur. They were involved in the dacoity in Kathauta Jheel area on October 6, 2020, and then in Chinhat on December 23 last year, the CP added. “They also attempted a dacoity in the city on the night of October 7 and 8 in Gomtinagar and had struck earlier in Maal police station area on September 15. We had intensified patrolling to nab them and succeeded,” he said. DCP Suman said the gang entered India via 24 Parganas district of West Bengal and then took a random train to any city. “After committing crime, they took a train to flee to some other state where they sold the looted ornaments and deposited the money in the accounts of their acquaintances,” said Suman. Police said the gang consists of a huge number of Bangladeshis, some of whom always remain stationed in different states at a time. “They were handled by Hamza, who is the gang leader,” the DCP said. The dacoits used to hold the family members hostage and hit them with iron rods before committing dacoity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gang-of-bangladesh-they-wield-walkie-talkie-and-use-trains-to-flee/articleshow/86951965.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The court dismissed the plea saying fixing of cutoffs was a matter of the university’s admission policy and matters of academic policy were best left to the university. The court was hearing a petition by a DU aspirant seeking a “scaling mechanism” for marks scored by students from different boards in order to provide a level playing field. “To me, it is entirely a matter of policy. How do we say what should be fixed as a cutoff ? How do we say so-and-so board marks have been higher and so-and-so have been lower?... I don’t think a court can get into this based on some kind of reverse engineering,” Justice Prateek Jalan observed. The plea argued that in spite of securing over 98% in Class XII, she was unable to score admission in her preferred course and college. “Take the cookie as it crumbles. We have to accept that. There is no reason to feel disheartened... You will get admission. There are great colleges and universities all over India,” the judge told the petitioner student. On its part, DU stated that the university cannot assess “which board has been liberal” as part of its admission process. “If more students (of a certain board) score more marks, being a central university, we can’t deprive them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-rejects-plea-alleging-disproportionate-entry-to-du-from-kerala-board/articleshow/86951960.cms||---

Mangaluru city police had arrested two youths, belonging to a right-wing organisation for reportedly stopping a car and questioning people travelling in it. Karnataka Congress @INC Karnataka has tweeted that the MLA stood in support of those who assaulted women. “Why did BJP MLA Umanath Kotian barge into the police station and pick the immoral policing accused? BJP has been engaged in atrocities against women and later protecting the accused. @BSBommai needs to answer for this law-and-order collapse and the act of BJP MLA,” @INCKarnataka tweeted. Two men and a woman belonging to one faith were reportedly travelling with two other women of another faith. It is learnt that the families knew each other, and the two women had asked for a lift. The police, who reached the spot and took control of the situation and have registered a case under IPC sections 354 (assault or criminal force on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 153(a) (promoting enmity between different groups), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (Criminal intimidation). Samhithraj, 36, and Sandeep Poojary, 34 were arrested in the case. One of them is allegedly a rowdy sheeter. When contacted, the MLA said it was Moodbidri police who stopped the car and took those who were travelling in it to the police station. “The accused got bail at 9pm. Is it wrong as a people’s representative to pick my organisation’s workers from the police station after they are out on bail?” the MLA asked. However, the District Congress Committee in Dakshina Kannada has not reacted to the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/bjp-mla-helping-those-accused-of-moral-policing-congress/articleshow/86947347.cms||---

From today till Dussehra, these Kali Temples would be the hub of community bonding in Bhopal. Bhog or community feast, one of the most awaited affairsat Pujo, is being served at almost all the Kali baaris this time, unlike last year. Obviously, mood is upbeat. “Last year was gloomy for all of us because we couldn’t step out due to strict Covid restrictions. This year, we have already made plans for each day - Maha Saptami, Maha Ashtami and Maha Navami - and booked bhogs at different Kali baaris,” said Sukesha Chatterjee, an educationist. Mandals are going all out to ensure that festivities remain Covid safe. From complete sanitisation, to sourcing fresh vegetables and checking the temperature of those who make and pack the bhog, we are taking all the precautions,” said the founder of Kolar Kali Bari, Niloy Ghosh, adding, “This time, we have increased the size of packed thali and quantity of bhog, which will include mishti, payesh, khichuri, chaatni, etc for nominal amount.” Oldest Kali baari in the city at TT Nagar, will also serve grand packed bhog to devotees. “Cooks from Kolkata have come to prepare prasad, so each day there will be different torkari and sweet at the pandal. In view of Covid caution, we have done away with dhunuchi nach, sindoor khela etc,” said general secretary of TT Nagar Bengali Association, Salil Chatterjee. Devotees will also get to enjoy some popular Bengali delicacies, including Calcutta rolls, biryani, fish fry, fried chicken, fish curry at pujo pandal this time, said president of Arera Colony Kali Bari, Dr Shubhashish Banerjee.  “From sanitiser to social distancing at pandal spread in a large area and packed bhog, all the protocols are being followed. Our youngsters have prepared a small entertainment programme including Rabindra sangeet, baul gaan, lok geeti for small audience,” said Dr Banerjee||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhog-bhakti-baul-gaan-at-kali-baaris/articleshow/86950063.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
---||Nagpur||From six months to just a few days, CBSE teachers to receive honorarium through digital mode||Nagpur: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) continues to build on its IT infrastructure with the latest initiative being the Integrated Payment System (IPS). This digital mode of payment will now ensure that teachers who contribute their time and skill for board exams (evaluation, moderation etc) will recieve their honorarium within a couple of days, rather than the average six months’ time frame earlier. While the payment system may not only be restricted to board exam honorarium, it is definitely one of the features which will make the maximum impact due to the number of teachers involved. CBSE’s IT team led by Antriksh Johri has literally been on a spree of introducing tech-enabled processes in the system. Right from using artificial intelligence for affiliation, to creating an IT framework for the 2021 board exam evaluation, to introducing the revolutionary blockchain technology for document verification, Johri’s push for integrating technology has clearly put the central board way ahead of the ‘competition’. The newly-developed system has digitally transformed a previously manual and time-consuming system into an efficient one that is devoid of human error. Prior to the development and implementation of the IPS, payments made to various functionaries would undergo a long and time-consuming process due to the manual nature of the system. Being a national education body, the responsibility of conducting public examinations for schools affiliated to CBSE and various other competitive examinations such as CTET, recruitment tests etc. lies with the board. Close to 10 lakh faculty members, including principals and teachers, offer their services for the smooth conduct of examinations. Similarly, around 10,000 principals/educational administrators are also appointed for the inspections of schools for affiliation/upgradation. All functionaries involved in examination or affiliation-related duties would be paid an honorarium and TA/DA for their services after they manually raised a bill to the concerned authority. The payment process would earlier take close to 6 months to complete. This was because the process would pass through several manual checks by the officials. For exam duties, after such checks, the CBSE would then distribute the money to the centre superintendents, who would further disburse the payments to the various functionaries. For affiliation duties, CBSE would make payment to principals/educational administrators after such manual checks. This led to several steps and involved a large number of individuals in the payment system. The introduction of a normative payment system through IPS allows for automatic calculations which eradicate the need for human intervention. After the submission of inspection reports in case of inspection duties and duty compilation certificate in case of exam duties or other such supporting documents, IPS allows for direct bank transfers of honorarium and TA/DA to the intended payee. This has been achieved through software integration with the bank payment gateway. The system relies on self-declaration/certification and has considerably improved the ease of undertaking such transactions. The IPS also allows for automatic validation checks which not only reduces the time taken to complete the payment process, but also reduces the possibility of committing false transactions and non-genuine disbursements. The features of the newly developed IPS are in consonance with the principles of Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) and Ease of Living (EoL), and has been implemented successfully for Affiliation Inspection Payment, Board and CTET Examination duty payments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/from-six-months-to-just-a-few-days-cbse-teachers-to-receive-honorarium-through-digital-mode/articleshow/86966469.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Goa||Most schools in Goa to conduct Class XI, XII exams after Dussehra||PANAJI: Instructions from the directorate of education (DoE) permitting offline exams for Class XI and XII students have brought relief to higher secondary schools across the state. Most of the schools have scheduled their tests after Dussehra on Friday. The exams will be held either from October 16 or 18 in a majority of institutes. School heads said that physical exams will help carry out more accurate assessment of students, as they have no means to conduct proctored exams which enable monitoring students in the online mode. Walter Cabral, president of the Principals’ Forum, said that offline exams reduce scope for cheating and helps do justice to subjects with practical components. “Most higher secondary schools will start conducting the offline exams from Monday,” said Cabral. “We should support the government in this move as for vocational courses, it is not possible in programmes like nursing and hotel management to assess students without practicals. Also, last year, the public exams, this year the Goa Common Entrance Test, the test for Class XI entry, etc, have already been held in the offline mode, and schools have sufficient experience in conducting exams in the physical mode.” In his school, St Andrew’s Higher Secondary School, Vaddem, Vasco, less than 50% students will be seated in the class as a precaution against Covid-19, he said. “Our class capacity is 60, but only 20 students will be accommodated at a time, with a lone student sitting on each bench,” said Cabral. Asha Naik, principal, Government Higher Secondary School, Sakhali, said that they will conduct offline exams in two batches each day. “We will not have more than 15 students in one class. The one hour gap between two sessions will enable us to carry out sanitisation,” said Naik. Schools had prepared to conduct the exams from October 11, but they were later postponed awaiting the DoE circular, which only came at the fag end of last week. “We will conduct exams in the offline mode from October 18,” said Damodar Mardolkar of Vidya Prabodhini Higher Secondary School, Porvorim. A few schools said that due to difficulties in conducting classes in the online mode, like in remote areas of Bicholim, they have already begun holding offline classes to help students. Instructions from the government only permit exams for Class XI and XII to be held offline as of now. “We have started classes for Class X and XII students with support from parents. We are seeing almost 80% attendance and plan to start offline classes soon,” managing committee chairman of a Bicholim school said.

---||Nagpur||Move to amend FCA another onslaught on forests: Greens||Nagpur: The Central government’s move to amend the Forest (Conservation) Act (FCA), 1980, has come in for sharp criticism and greens fear it is an attempt to give leeway to stalled road widening and railway projects which are proving to be detrimental for forest and wildlife. The FCA was promulgated on October 25, 1980, to check further deforestation of reserved forests and for use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The Centre has sought comments and suggestions from the states and all concerned on a series of changes the MoEFCC wants to make in FCA. It includes freeing private forest from the clutches of FCA. It also plans to exempt FCA for forest along the right of ways (RoWs) if the user agency is in possession of RoW prior to 1980. Normally, agencies need forest clearance if they want to construct rail lines or roads. Since the activity is a non-forestry use of forest land, these require prior approval of the Central government. Now, an exemption up to 0.05 hectares for each such accesses may be allowed to user agencies. Citing the climate change crisis facing us today, environmentalist Debi Goenka said that the MoEFCC should be doing its utmost to protect and enhance our forest cover. “Instead, the draft amendments are yet another attempt to blatantly dilute the protection that our forests have enjoyed since 1980,” said Goenka. Goenka further said that some of the amendments proposed seem to suggest that even the orders of the Supreme Court are not to be respected. “It is high time the MoEFCC starts doing its job to protect our forests and biodiversity instead of facilitating its destruction. It is also high time that we incorporate climate change in our decision-making process, instead of paying lip service at international forums,” said Goenka. Presently, as per the Supreme Court, all areas which are recorded as ‘forest’ in any government record, irrespective of ownership, recognition and classification, need FCA clearance. However, now private forests will be out of the FCA ambit. “This is a good move. Why should a private forest landowner suffer for FCA clearance and pay NPV for his own property? The move to bring deemed forest out of FCA is also welcome. But there is still no clarity on FCA to forest land in wildlife corridors. Such areas should not get clearance without mitigation measures,” said Suresh Chopne, president, Green Planet Society. Chopne opposed the proposed move to give free run to exploration in forest areas “if extended reach drilling (ERD) technologies are used”. “Putting safaris and zoos out of FCA ambit is also not a welcome step,” said Chopne. Satpuda Foundation president Kishor Rithe said the MoEFCC has already brought forest permission mechanism by giving powers to clear 40 hectares forest lands to regional committees. “Diluting it further will prove to be disastrous. Landholding agencies (Rail, NHAI, PWD, etc) will now not be required to take approval under FCA as well as pay stipulated levies, compensatory afforestation, etc for use of such land. The ministry is considering now exempting such lands acquired before October 25, 1980, from the purview of the FCA,” he said. Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel feared the move will open floodgates for development without any mitigation steps for tigers. This will also lead to the clearing of the railway line through Melghat and road development in Tadoba and other tiger reserve landscapes. The definition of forest given in the proposed amendment of FCA has been diluted. “As per above forest definition, there is hardly 5% or even less virgin forest canopy left in India. The amendment will promote forest destructive activities like FRA, PESA, commercial plantations and encroachments. It will strengthen miners, industrialists, railways, infrastructure, dam developers. The amendment will remove land compensation for loss of forest land,” said Patel. Conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar said, “The proposed amendments are an onslaught on FCA. When it has mentioned that total forest and tree cover in the country is merely 24%, much below the standard, there will be no chance of increasing it any more with the amended FCA. All the provisions are in favour of non-forest activities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/move-to-amend-fca-another-onslaught-on-forests-greens/articleshow/86950051.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Surat||Surat: To spite brother, man throws nephews off terrace||SURAT: Wanting to exact revenge on his elder brother, a 22-year-old man pushed his two nephews — one 13-year-old and other 11-year-old — from the third-floor terrace of an industrial unit in Pandesara on Sunday evening. The two boys survived the fall as they landed in bushes and partially muddy surface. One of the victims suffered a hip fracture while the other escaped with minor injuries on the face. The accused Nagendra Gautam, a native of Uttar Pradesh, is absconding and has switched off his mobile phone. Police booked Gautam on Monday, following a complaint filed by his elder brother Jayprakash for alleged attempt to kill the two boys. Police suspect that Gautam targeted his elder brother’s sons as the entire family was against his relationship with a girl. Gautam had eloped with the minor girl and brought her to Surat. On coming to know about the incident, Jayprakash had informed the girl’s father about her location after which her family arrived in the city and took her back. After pushing the two boys off the terrace, Gautam met Jayprakash before absconding. Police suspect that Gautam must have planned to leave the city and a search has been initiated in that direction. So far, investigation has revealed that Jayprakash, a machine operator in a textile unit in Unity Estate, lives on the third floor of the unit with his wife and two sons. His wife is currently at their native place in Khagalrampur of Pratapgadh district in UP. Four days ago Gautam came to stay with Jayprakash and the two boys. “Gautam had told his brother that he has no work and wants to return to UP in a few days,” said a police officer. On Sunday evening when Jayprakash went to check machines in the unit while the boys were cooking in their room on the terrace. Gautam first called the elder brother outside and pushed him off the terrace. Later he called the younger brother and pushed him too. “After a few minutes the elder brother regained consciousness and he walked into the unit. His face was covered with blood due to injuries and he informed his father what happened to him,” said police. Later they searched for the younger brother who too was found in the bushes. “Gautam is unemployed and spends his time hanging out with antisocial elements” a police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/to-spite-brother-man-throws-nephews-off-terrace/articleshow/86945859.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Vaccination, natural immunity causing fewer severe Covid hospitalisations, says expert||PANAJI: The super-specialty block of Goa Medical College (GMC) now sees around 4-5 Covid-19 admissions a day, and although patients having multiple comorbidities do show up in a critical state, such cases are few, said officials. Administrator of GMC’s super-specialty block, Dr Uday Kakodkar, attributes the few severe cases to the fact that a large number of people have been vaccinated, as well as herd immunity. “The antibodies developed in the body act as a soldier against the virus,” he said. “While vaccination does not stop the virus from entering a body, it does reduce the severity of the infection. The effect of vaccination, as well so many people developing antibodies due to natural infection, have contributed to bringing down the harshness of the virus.” The state government, however, doesn’t release official figures and data on vaccinated individuals getting severely ill from Covid or dying from it. Since last month, state Covid fatalities have ranged between one and three on most days, with zero deaths on some days. While daily admissions have declined, GMC’s highest single-day admissions were 123 cases, during the peak of the second wave. The superspecialty block currently has around 65 Covid patients undergoing treatment. Some Covid patients are treated at the South Goa district hospital, another government-run Covid facility, while a few get treated at private hospitals. Over the past month, Covid-19 admissions per day range from ten to 15. The average stay of Covid patients is around ten days. He said that as per guidelines, patients not having complications and comorbidities get discharged after ten days. “If a patient has been able to maintain an oxygen saturation level without oxygen therapy, he is discharged upon recovery. So, the average stay of a Covid patient is ten days,” he said. However, hospital stay could be extended by a few days more for those who develop severe complications due to their comorbidities. “Suppose: If a patient has a kidney problem and is under dialysis, it is likely that he may need to stay in hospital longer. Patients having other infections other than coronavirus too would need longer hospitalisation, maybe for a month,” he said. The administrator of GMC’s super-specialty block said that the lengthiest stay has been around three months; four such patients were discharged from GMC, the state’s largest government-run Covid hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vax-natural-immunity-seeing-fewer-severe-covid-hospitalisations/articleshow/86950099.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Lucknow||Every Uttar Pradesh district will get a medical college, says CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Having promised to extend health benefits to those below the poverty line ahead of the 2022 elections, chief minister Yogi Adityanath issued Ayushman Bharat cards to Antyodaya card holders in Lucknow on Monday. The CM had earlier set targets for all district administrations to identify beneficiaries under various welfare schemes and link them at the earliest. On Monday, as the government extended the Ayushman Bharat health cover to 1 lakh beneficiaries, he promised that before the end of his tenure, there would be one medical college sanctioned for all 75 districts of the state. “Despite having the highest population in the country and 40 lakh migrant workers who returned to the state during the pandemic, UP arrested the spread of the pandemic through sustained, organised and coordinated efforts, coupled with micro planning and alertness,” Yogi said, adding that the state was serving as a model for others in controlling the spread of the coronavirus like it had earlier managed to prevent Japanese Encephalitis deaths in eastern UP. Highlighting the efforts made by the government to expand healthcare facilities in the state, Yogi said that between 1947 and 2016, only 15 medical colleges were set up in UP while work on 49 medical colleges was underway. On the completion of his government’s five years in power, each district will have a medical college, the CM said.“From 1947 to 2000, there was only one AIIMS. Between 2000 and 2004, then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee started work on six AIIMS. Currently, work is taking place on 22 AIIMS,” the CM said. The Ayushman health insurance cards will be distributed to over 40 lakh Antyodaya ration card holder families across districts over the next few days. Under the scheme, over 1.30 crore people will be provided with a health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year. Dr VK Paul, member of the Centre’s core team for Covid-19 pandemic response, praised the UP government for its work on the pandemic. “There could have been more than 70,000 cases per day in UP during the second wave, but due to the proactive measures implemented by the state government, the spread was controlled in the densely populated state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-up-dist-will-get-a-medical-college-says-yogi/articleshow/86952024.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Delhi||Students’ body to hold dharna today against ‘police action’||New Delhi: A day after women student activists from All India Students’ Association (AISA) alleged that they were manhandled and beaten up by police personnel during a protest, the students’ body and other organisations decided on Tuesday to hold a dharna in front of the Delhi Police headquarters at 2pm on Wednesday to condemn the act. Police officials have denied manhandling any woman activist and said a case has been registered for violating Covid-19 safety norms. Senior officials claimed the activists, who were protesting following the violence against farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, were trying to march to the Union home minister’s residence when they were detained and later let off. A student activist who allegedly faced the assault claimed the cops had kicked them in their private parts. “I have been part of several protests, but the behaviour of the police personnel on Monday was brutal. Something like this happened for the first time with me,” she said. As the media and other people were present on the road, police “did not hit us there, but instead pulled us inside a bus and kicked us. They said they wanted to teach us our aukat and kept hitting us. My friend who was with me was also manhandled in the same manner”, she alleged. The activist said she didn’t know what to do, so she called a friend and wept on the phone in pain. They were taken to Mandir Marg police station and let off after around six hours, the AISA activist added. The cops, many protesters alleged, threatened them of an FIR, so they decided to leave the police station without getting a medical done. Some of the activists were new and needed medical help, they added. A senior police officer told TOI that there was no permission for the protest and the cops had to push them into the bus as they refused to move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-body-to-hold-dharna-today-against-police-action/articleshow/86977589.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Global chip shortage hits car bookings in Pune||PUNE: The global shortage of semiconductor chips has affected car dealers in the city during the festive season, with delivery delays pushing up booking cancellations by 30%. Shailesh Bhandari, Pune’s regional director of FADA (Federation of Automobile Associations) and director of BU Bhandari Auto, said cars brands were facing a problem due to the shortage. “The maximum waiting period once a car is booked is three months. Due to the chip shortage, this waiting period has gone up leading to cancellations during the festive season. For every 100 bookings, dealers are looking at 30% cancellations. The problem persists despite high demand and is a cause for concern,” Bhandari told TOI. The effects of this were felt on registrations at the regional transport offices (RTOs). While 5,035 cars were registered at the Pune RTO in August, it dropped to 3,948 in September — a 22% decline. At the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO, August had 3,093 registrations, while September saw 2,411 registrations — also a 22% drop. Another car dealer said they were trying to convince the buyers against cancellation. “Two of my customers had booked the latest SUV early in July and I had assured them that they will get the delivery by Dasara. However, I am doubtful now,” the dealer said. Amar Sheth, FADA state chairman, said that it was unlikely that the issue would be resolved soon. “For certain models, the waiting period has gone up by six to nine months resulting in cancellations and no fresh bookings. Dealers are not able to commit to delivery, causing customers to back off,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/global-chip-shortage-hits-city-car-bookings/articleshow/86950170.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Delhi||Over 75k PUC certificates issued in Delhi this weekend as stiff fine fuels anxiety||NEW DELHI: This weekend saw over 75,000 pollution under control certificates (PUCC) being issued in the national capital. Such a massive number, sources said, is due to regular notices being issued by the transport department of late, alerting vehicle owners about shelling out Rs 10,000 if they are found without a valid PUCC. With the winter season approaching, the department has been trying to ensure since last month that polluting vehicles remain off the road in Delhi. It has been issuing regular public notices to create awareness about the need to get pollution check done, apart from reaching out to the vehicle owners with expired PUCCs. Sources said nearly 1,000 PUC centres had been catering to around total 10,000 vehicles daily this month, but this weekend saw a massive spike with more than 75,000 PUCC being issued in two days. “The department’s enforcement teams are also on the job and one special commissioner is just tracking how many vehicles are being checked every day,” an official said. “Every day, around 150 cars are being challaned for either being visibly polluting or for not having valid PUCC. The numbers are on the lower side because the continuous messaging has resulted in people being careful,” he said. “Environment experts say vehicular pollution is one of the major sources of air pollution. Through public notices, we have given ample time to vehicle owners to get a valid PUCC,” he said. “A large number of vehicles on Delhi’s roads are also Bharat Stage IV-compliant and required to get a pollution check done only once a year, unlike older vehicles that need a PUCC every three months.” The department carries out special drives during the winter months. “Extensive drives are likely to begin in some time and apart from targeting all areas, there will be separate and focused drives at the pollution hotspots,” the official said. Last year, at least one team each was deployed permanently during special drives at the pollution hotspots identified by Delhi Pollution Control Committee, including Anand Vihar, RK Puram, Jahangirpuri, Vivek Vihar and Mayapuri. While the validity of motor vehicle documents like driving licence and other permits have been extended till November 30, 2021, the transport department hasn’t made an exception in case of PUCC, keeping in mind Delhi’s fight against air pollution. “Vehicle owners should not be under the impression that they would be spared,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-75k-puc-certificates-issued-this-weekend-as-stiff-fine-fuels-anxiety/articleshow/86952060.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Shashthi pandal-hopper count tops Panchami high||KOLKATA: The city woke up to the beats of dhaak with ‘Bodhan’ on Monday, heralding the start of five-day festivities. By evening, lakhs hit the streets. The crowd count on Monday surpassed Sunday’s high. But cops did not feel the challenge, thanks to the crowd splitting and moving in different directions across the city. The rush of shoppers finally lessened after a two-week high at Gariahat and New Market. However, traffic movement was slow along Rashbehari Avenue, Chetla Central Road, DH Road, BK Pal Avenue and CR Avenue — all transit points for big-budget Pujas. Some of the traditional powerhouses — like Md Ali Park and College Square — witnessed a moderate crowd. Most revellers were more interested in visiting Chaltabagan and Chorbagan. Up north, however, Kumartuli-Ahiritola turned out to be among the largest draws, followed closely by the cluster of Sikdarbagan-Nabin Pally-Nalin Sarkar Street. A similar trend was witnessed down south. Behala's three big draws s Barisha Club, Natun Dal and SB Park — drew a considerable local crowd. The Jodhpur Park-Selimpur-Babubagan area witnessed a massive rise in footfall, similar to ones at Bosepukur Sitalamandir in Kasba and Naktala Udayan Sangha. This helped cops to keep Ekdalia Evergreen-Hindusthan Park zone within control.  "We increased the crossover loop at Gariahat crossing to Basanti Devi College. This stopped people from crossing over randomly and also ensuring they visit the big-budget pandals on both sides of the road. A similar policy was adopted for the Tridhara-Samajsebi block. We have provided a clamp to every officer. Any car trying to park on Rashbehari Avenue was clamped and kept at the spot so as to deter others from trying to park their cars," said an officer. However, it was the Sreebhumi pandal that continued to hog the limelight. Traffic management was better on VIP Road compared to the last two days but even then, the overall traffic movement was slow on the stretch, forcing Bidhannagar cops to operate both-way traffic along the Kolkata-bound flank of VIP Road and Kolkata Police to re-issue their advisory, asking airport-bound flyers to take a detour via New Town. But even as the traffic management improved, there was no stopping the sea of revellers whose numbers kept swelling with every passing hour since Monday afternoon, with a number of revellers roaming around with their masks down, happily taking selfies or just chatting with friends and caring least about the impending Covid third wave. Residents living in the area — especially seniors and those living with kids — had a harrowing time with the sea of crowd in front of their homes. All lanes and bylanes leading to Sreebhumi Sporting were choked. "Entering and leaving our homes has become the biggest challenge. My entire family had avoided Covid all this while. I don't think we can anymore," said a young professional who stays in the same lane where the pandal is located. Kolkata Police officers said they did everything to ensure that traffic was not unduly hit. While BK Pal Avenue saw both-way movement till late into the evening, Bidhan Sarani towards Hatibagan though was closed to traffic from Shyambazar five-point crossing .  In the south, traffic movement was slow on Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road towards Rashbehari crossing and near Gariahat crossing in the morning itself. Cops had tweaked certain plans to keep the maximum number of senior officers on road for the big challenge in the evening — managing the last-day office crowd with revellers. "The DCs were not put in charge of most Puja complexes, leaving it to the ACPs. Each DC was asked to be stationed at a police station or on the road and monitor a specific area," said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shashthi-pandal-hopper-count-tops-panchami-high/articleshow/86947931.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Nagpur||Coal stock in Genco’s 7 power plants almost burned out||Nagpur: Mahagenco, the state government run power generation company, is facing a shortage of 35,000 tonne coal on a daily basis. The company gets supplies from the Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), Southeastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), Mahanadi Coalfields Limited and Singreni Coalfields Limited (SCL). According to data shared by Mahagenco, as on Sunday the coal stock at seven of its power plants is not enough to last for even two days. Stock below four days is tagged as super critical level. The data for stock availability on Monday will be known on Tuesday. WCL, which is the Nagpur-based subsidiary of Coal India Limited (CIL), provides more than 80% of the supply to Mahagenco. The supply as on October 10 stand at 4.84 tonne. This is 20% less than the fixed quantity till this period of the month. WCL sources said that amid the crisis even the railway rakes have to be judiciously allotted. In such times the priority goes to the organization which is prompt in payment. Sources said Mahagenco, which takes nearly 50% of coal produced by WCL, is also the highest defaulter. The state government company owes as much as Rs2,200 crore to WCL. The dues includes earlier payments. In such times, it is not in the top priority. Availability of rakes is also an issue, said sources. Mahagenco officials also accepted that there are payment issues. This is because of delayed realization from MSEDCL, the distribution arm, which in turn is dogged by defaults by consumers. This is also affecting the supply on a partial basis, said sources. Mahagenco sources said that here there are not much payment issues with other subsidiaries of CIL. Amid the crisis, there have been conflicting versions from WCL and Mahagenco over coal supply figures. TOI contacted officials in both the organizations. Those at WCL maintain that the mining PSU has supplied more coal than the annual contracted quality (ACQ). On the other hand, Mahagenco says WCL has only supplied up to only 64% of the contracted quantity till September. According to figures sourced from WCL, Mahagenco is supposed to get 22.4 million tonne (MT) as per the ACQ arrived at under the fuel supply agreement (FSA). On pro rata basis, by September it was supposed to get 10.5 MT, but Mahgenco has taken over 11.04 MT. Sources from Mahagenco had a different story. Their version is that WCL is supposed to supply over 23 MT throughout the year. On pro rata basis it should have at least got 16 MT, but has got 10.2 MT, said the sources. There are two modes of supply by WCL or other subsidiaries to Mahagenco. Under FSA, WCL is mandated to provide the quantity agreed upon. There is another system called bridge linkage. This is like a stop-gap arrangement under which Mahagenco will be getting coal till its own captive mines planned at Chhattisgarh begin. Even as a certain quantity is fixed under this mode, there is no obligation and WCL supplies only to the best of its ability. The Mahagenco officials said it is supposed to get 10.3MT in the year, and on pro rata basis it should have got 4.8 MT till September but has received 3 MT. In WCL, TOI was informed that 8.3 MT is the total quota, on pro rata basis Mahageno should have got 3 MT and has lifted 1.97 MT. The shortfall is due to a number of technical reasons like choice of mine and availability of transport, said sources. Mahagenco has also stopped importing coals since 2019, after the central government’s guidelines that there is enough domestic coal and need not be imported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coal-stock-in-gencos-7-power-plants-almost-burned-out/articleshow/86949878.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Goa||Goa may ask ecommerce companies to electrify fleet in 3 years||PANAJI: The state government is likely to mandate companies that engage in ecommerce and food delivery to migrate to electric vehicles, and also request them to electrify their fleet faster, over the next two or three years. This will happen in a phased manner, with 25% of the fleet in the first year, 50% in the second year and 100% by the third year. This was announced at a webinar held on the draft Goa electric mobility promotion policy on Monday. The municipal corporations deployed for solid waste management and garbage collection may also be roped in in this module. A subsidy will be given to two, three and four-wheelers, wherein all vehicles falling within the category will be covered. The draft policy was released in July, following which suggestions and objections were invited from the public. Besides a few people, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Goa, sent suggestions to the government, which were shared during the webinar. Another suggestion that is being adopted is that of the settlement of customer-related issues, which has been given a window of 90 days. This will be reduced to 30 days, after suggestions from citizens. For consumer benefit and rapid adoption of EVs, the government may even ask stakeholders to arrange free test drives with the objective to inform consumers about the technology and its advantages. Embracing this policy will change the face of vehicular operations in Goa, as the state takes a successful step towards clean energy. Besides public transport, private vehicle owners will also be able to bid goodbye to their fossil fuel-operated two- and four-wheelers, and adopt electric vehicles. The Goa government intends to convert buses in the state to electric vehicles in a bid to cut down on carbon emissions. In addition to this, the draft policy also intends to convert 50% of Goa’s ferryboats to electric by 2025. Start-ups and investment in the field of electric mobility and associated sectors are likely to be involved, besides which service units and battery repair and maintenance stations are likely to come up. The state hopes to create 10,000 jobs in the sector by 2025 as a result. More charging stations are likely to come up across the state based on the vehicle density of each area, as per a suggestion made at the webinar. The electric charger operator will be able to accept payments through multiple modes such as cash, card, mobile wallet and UPI. Based on the suggestions offered at the webinar by the attendees, the policy will be forwarded to the finance department for approval, and further steps will be taken up for its implementation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-may-ask-e-comm-cos-to-electrify-fleet-in-3-years/articleshow/86950175.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: At Dadar, free valet parking for festive shoppers||MUMBAI: Ahead of Dussehra & Diwali, the Dadar Vyapari Sangh and BMC will jointly provide free valet parking at the civic-run Kohinoor Public Parking Lot near Sena Bhavan at Shivaji Park for shoppers. The plan is to provide a free valet service for three hours at the BMC-run parking lot for which the traders body will pay. The parking lot can accommodate 1,100 vehicles. After three hours, motorists will have to pay the parking charges if they continue to leave their vehicles at the facility. The BMC said that the model will be rolled out on a pilot basis where uniformed assistants will be placed at various spots from Sena Bhavan to NC Kelkar Marg and Senapati Bapat Marg to provide the valet service. The Vyapari Sangh said that they are willing to pay the charges to avoid any multiplication of vehicles on roads thereby leading to traffic congestion on the already crowded market. Sunil Shah, president of Dadar Vyapari Sangh said, “While BMC has set up a large public parking facility, it motorists are unable to benefit from it. Shoppers say it is located in another corner and so they get their driver who remains in the car. It adds to traffic congestion. So, we proposed a solution.” Assistant commissioner of G-North ward, Kiran Dighavkar, said they are positively looking at starting the service and experimenting something for the first time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-at-dadar-free-valet-parking-for-festive-shoppers/articleshow/86952063.cms||Richa Pinto

In Vidarbha, response to the bandh call was mixed in urban areas and strong in rural areas, while in Nashik all 18 mandis were shut, and the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP blocked movement of traffic along the Pune-Bengaluru national highway at several spots. In parts of Pune, though shop-owners had opened outlets in the morning, they downed shutters after bandh supporters arrived at the spot and demanded a shutdown. All 18 mandis across Nashik district, including the country’s largest onion mandi at Lasalgaon, remained shut. Daily average transactions at these mandis are to the tune of Rs 40 crore. In some districts of Vidarbha, shopkeepers in urban areas, still reeling from the fallout of the pandemic, carried on their business. Sena was clearly seen taking the lead in enforcing the bandh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-bandh-enforced-in-pune-nashik/articleshow/86950166.cms||---

Police said that 18-year-old Shahista Sheikh, her mother, 42-year-old Noor Jahan Noor Mohmmad Sheikh, and grandmother, 63-year-old Jenambanu Kasam Khan Pathan, consumed poisonous substance early in the morning. The cops said that the preliminary investigation suggested that that the three took the extreme step as they were facing a severe financial crisis. Both Noor Jahan and Jenambanu were widows. The three were residents of Shankar Tekari in Jamnagar city and were staying with their relatives in Bhanvad. They were earning livelihood by working as domestic maids. “The incident occurred on Morning in the Gayatrinagar area of Bhanvad town. The three were staying with their relatives in Bhanvad. They might have consumed poisonous substances around 5am on Monday,” H J Chaudhary, deputy superintendent of police, Devbhumi Dwarka, told TOI. “By the time their relatives came to know about the incident, it was too late. The relatives first called 108 emergency ambulance and later informed police but by then the three were already dead.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Disregarding Covid norms, over 1 lakh throng Karla temple||PUNE: About 1.5 lakh people visited the Ekvira Devi Temple at Karla near Lonavla, about 60km from here, between 5am and 5pm this Sunday, throwing all Covid norms like social distancing to the wind, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials told TOI on Monday. The ASI is now planning to hold talks with district authorities to restrict the number of visitors at monuments which see overcrowding. “The visit on Sunday was part of religious tourism. There were hardly a few visitors to the Karla caves as most people headed to the Ekvira Devi Temple. We estimate that nearly 1.5 lakh people visited the temple on Sunday. A majority of them were not wearing masks and the rush was heavy. Social distancing was non-existent,” a senior ASI official said. The official suggested that police vigil be increased at such locations during the festive days. “Nearly 100 police personnel were deployed at the caves’ premises on Sunday to manage the crowds, but all efforts fell flat. The situation was horrible and it is not known yet how much of it may have contributed to the spread of Covid,” he said. The official said the Karla caves site has a relatively smaller area with limited open space. Therefore, the district authorities should issue a notification on capping the number of people visiting such spots during festivals. Another ASI official said people who visited the temple site on Sunday were there to pay homage to the goddess because of the Navaratra festival. “The temple premises, right from the temple gate till the parking, was packed with people. The crowds persisted for almost 12 hours on Sunday, and started thinning only after 5pm,” he said. Only 600 tickets were sold for a visit to the Karla caves on Sunday, while thousands of others entered the premises without tickets, another official said. “There was also no space at the ticket counter due to the those thronging the spot,” he observed. When contacted, Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI, “My appeal is that we all must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. If such instances are repeated, the district authorities may have to cap the number of tourists at such sites.” BG Yelikar, conservation assistant, ASI’s Raigad circle, said: “All monuments in Raigad have opened, including ticketed monuments like Janjira, Alibaug and Raigad forts. The Janjira fort booking counter was started this Saturday. There was waist-high grass on the fort premises, which we recently cleared for tourist safety.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/disregarding-covid-norms-over-1l-throng-karla-temple/articleshow/86950181.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: BJP slams ‘dhongi’ MVA, demands relief for farmers||MUMBAI: Terming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government a dhongi (impostor), opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said it is yet to extend aid to its farmers devastated by floods and heavy rain. “Ever since this government came to power in the state, 2,000 farmers have died by suicide. All announcements of help and aid have not been followed by any action on the ground. Half the guardian ministers forget the chief minister and deputy chief minister are yet to visit the flood-devastated districts,” Fadnavis said. The BJP leader pointed out that in the past, Bombay high court has called bandhs illegal and even fined Shiv Sena. “The HC must initiate action against the government for calling this bandh.” Calling the MVA a “bandh Sarkar” and Monday’s shutdown a state-sponsored terror foisted on the people with the misuse of police machinery, sales tax and GST officials, Fadnavis said: “The MVA has no moral authority to impose the bandh as it is the same government that had fired bullets on farmers in Maval in Pune district protesting for water. Lakhimpur is a serious incident. The bandh is politically motivated.”  Fadnavis said the bandh did not have the people’s support as was evidenced by the presence of 10 agitators on Eastern Express Highway forcing people to shut down while police stood by. “If the MVA is genuinely concerned about farmers, it should announce an aid package for them before the day’s end.” State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said people are already harassed by t”he pandemic-induced lockdown and restrictions. “The people’s anger will reflect in every forthcoming elections,” he said. BJP MLA from Bandra (W) Ashish Shelar said reports from various districts show that farmers did not back the bandh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-slams-dhongi-mva-demands-relief-for-farmers/articleshow/86950209.cms||---

Before kick-starting the poll campaign, Akhilesh called on party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav to seek his blessing. Sources said Akhilesh met Mulayam at his Delhi residence where the veteran politician gave some tips on how to go about the yatra. The meeting ended with Akhilesh touching Mulayam’s feet and the latter giving him his blessing and wishing him success in the elections. The party released a 17-second video of how the meeting ended. Akhilesh took to Twitter to describe his Samajwadi Vijay Yatra as the beginning of the party’s resolve to ensure “22s mein bicycle” (bicycle being party’s election symbol). The party is focussing on the catch line “Badon ka haath, yuva ka saath” (Blessings of seniors and support of the youth) as the mantra for victory in 2022 assembly polls. The former UP CM will embark on a customised bus which has a huge photograph of Akhilesh on one side while that of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Azam Khan on the other. Party sources said Akhilesh would continue with the Vijay Yatra on his motorised ‘Samajwadi rath’ in phases, covering the entire state. In between the Vijay yatra phases, he would stay put at Lucknow to see senior leaders from different parties joining SP in the days to come. The SP chief’s rath reached Kanpur on Monday. Akhilesh will leave for Kanpur on Tuesday morning and get on the rath at 10 am. The first leg of the yatra will end on October 13 in Hamirpur. “After starting from the Ganga bridge, the yatra will take the Naubasta route to reach Neyveli Lignite Power station in Ghatampur to head for Hamirpur by Tuesday evening. The next morning, the yatra will start at 9:30 am from Hamirpur to reach Kalpi in Jaulan and end at Mati in Kanpur Dehat,” said SP chief spokesperson and senior leader Rajendra Chaudhary. Rath yatras were an important part of the party’s campaign in 2001 when Samajwadi Party was voted to power in 2002. After the 2011 Yatra, not only SP was voted to power but Akhilesh was sworn in as the chief minister in 2012. “This Yatra which is beginning in 2021 will end with SP coming to power in 2022,” Chaudhary said. He said though a minute to minute schedule has been drafted, it was highly unlikely to adhere to the time table as SP leaders have planned grand ‘welcome’ at around dozens of locations along the route in Kanpur City, Kanpur Dehat, Hamirpur and Jalaun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-to-launch-campaign-for-up-polls-today-with-vijay-yatra/articleshow/86952075.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: SSC exam papers reduced to 6; 30% syllabus excluded||HYDERABAD: For the second consecutive year, the Telangana school education department has reduced the number of question papers for SSC public examinations — 11 to six — for the academic year 2021-22. Not just this, the department has also decided to exclude 30% of the syllabus from the exam, which was originally implemented in 2020-21 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. As per the pattern, students appearing for the SSC exams in 2021-22 will have to appear for only one paper for each subject. For the benefit of the students at large, the department has also included Urdu as a second language. With this, students can appear for Telugu, Hindi or Urdu as a second language. There will be no change in the marks allotted to the subjects as the exam will be held for 600 marks (100 marks for each subject) – 480 marks for board exams and 120 marks for internal exams. Apart from reducing the number of papers, the state has also increased the duration of the examination. Instead of 2 hours 45 minutes, students, this year, will get 3 hours 15 minutes to finish their exam. Apart from this, the department has also decided to follow the syllabus that was prescribed in the academic year 2020-21 for the current academic year. Last year, the syllabus was partially converted into projects — exams to which were not conducted. Even this year, only 70% of theory lessons — or core concepts — that they need to study will be considered for the board exams. The remaining 30% will involve practical activities, which will not be part of any assessment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ssc-exam-papers-reduced-to-6-30-syllabus-excluded/articleshow/86948015.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court notices to NMC, Kaloji University on MBBS first year exam pattern||HYDERABAD: Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili of the high court has issued notices to the Union health ministry, the National Medical Commission, the Kaloji Health University and the state health department asking them to explain their stand on a petition filed by Kaitha Geethika and 30 other fellow MBBS students who challenged the examination pattern set by Kaloji University for first year and instant examinations. Contending that they were conducted contrary to the manner that was prescribed in the Regulations on Graduate Medical Education (Amendment) Act, 2019, these students were seeking directions to the authorities to conduct a fresh supplementary examination for them this time in tune with the prescribed format. According to their counsel Unnam Muralidhar Rao, the question paper set by the university was a complete mismatch to the guidelines framed by the National Medical Commission (NMC). Scores of students failed in the main examination and also in the instant examination because the format was entirely different from the mode of training they received, the counsel added. He explained to the court that the Medical Council of India (the predecessor of NMC) had introduced competencybased under graduate curriculum (CBA) and brought in the 2019 statutory regulations for the new assessment method. The recent annual and the instant examination pertaining to MBBS first year were done contrary to this assessment mode and hence a huge number of students failed in their first year examinations and were detained. When students all over the country were failing in huge numbers, the central and state authorities must take corrective steps, he said. He also sought a direction to the university and medical colleges to allow the failed students to attend second year classes. The judge sought counters from authorities and medical colleges in which the petitioners were pursuing MBBS. The judge also asked G Pujitha, counsel for NMC, to ascertain their views and posted the case to October 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-notices-to-nmc-kaloji-on-mbbs-first-year-exam-pattern/articleshow/86948012.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Earlier CBI had arrested Deshmukh’s lawyer Anand Daga and CBI sub-inspector Abhishek Tiwari, who was associated with the probe at initial stage, in the case. It was alleged that Tiwari had passed the PE related documents and information to Daga in return for money. Recently a purported CBI report giving Deshmukh a clean chit during the initial stage of preliminary enquiry (PE) where Deshmukh was accused of corruption, was circulated in the media. The CBI registered a separate case related to the leakage of the report against its officials and Daga, for attempting to subvert the ongoing investigation against Deshmukh. The CBI officials had then told TOI that the FIR registered against Deshmukh was based on the final findings of PE, which mentioned that a cognizable case had been made out and had subsequently registered a corruption case against Deshmukh.

Urging people not to lower their guard during the festive season, authorities said that a third wave was unlikely unless a strong new variant emerged and people became complacent. “While currently there is no threat of a third wave as the number of susceptible people is low, we have intensified vaccination. The delta strain has weakened, but it is not yet time to lower our guard. Only days back a 17-year-old girl died due to Covid-19. The pandemic is not yet over. We need to take all precautions and be very careful till the end of the festive season. But if we are able to avoid a third wave for three months, the virus will then turn endemic,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, claimed. In case the virus turns endemic, like Swine flu and scores of other such viruses, cases will keep coming now and then, but the strain will be much weaker and not cause extensive cases or deaths, officials said. Cautioning people against flouting Covid-19 norms, authorities pointed out that many people were seen without the mandatory masks and social distancing. People must strictly follow norms till end of December, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-will-turn-endemic-if-no-third-wave-in-next-3-mths/articleshow/86948025.cms||---

State Congress president Nana Patole, Mumbai party Congress chief Bhai Jagtap and state NCP president Jayant Patil condemned the BJP for opposing the Maharashtra bandh. “Prima facie, it appears that BJP is endorsing the killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri...We are not indulging in petty politics, we are condemning the killing of farmers by the son of a Union cabinet member,” they said. After an hour-long silent protest at Raj Bhavan, Patole said the entire state, including the trading community, observed the bandh called by the MVA partners—Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP. Patole was joined by cabinet memb-ers Ashok Chavan, Aslam Sh-aikh and Balasaheb Thorat. Patole said following an agitation by Congress leaders Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, the UP government had no option but to arrest Ashish. Sla-mming opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis for opposing the bandh, he said: “Fadnavis has no moral right to speak on farmers’ plight. It was owing to the anti-farmer policy of the BJP, particularly Modi, that farmers are passing through this critical condition.” NCP minister Nawab Malik too condemned BJP and MNS for opposing the bandh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dismiss-union-min-mishra-cong-ncp/articleshow/86950329.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Prominent costume supplier, Rajesh Chaurasia, who has been providing costumes, jewellery, ancient weapons like sword, bow-arrow, javelin and stage decoration material to over 50 Ramleela committees across the state, told TOI, “ After a gap of two years, we received orders from different Ramleela committees across the state and brought special dresses for different characters from Mathura, Ghaziabad and Mumbai”. "This year, a special black-coloured 'dhoti' with golden border was brought from Mathura for demon king Ravan at Patharchatti Ramleela committee. We have also received orders from trans-Ganga and trans -Yamuna based Ramleela committees as well," he added. He further added that costume designers and decorators found themselves in a catch 22 situation till last month as they waited for the state governments guidelines regarding staging of Ramleela's. However, when state government granted permission to stage the show with the strict adherence of Covid-19 protocol, they found little time to cope up with the orders. Meanwhile, the designers were also in constant touch with the Ramleela organisers and were hopeful that it will be organised this year. "Two months ago we were a little sceptical on how would we arrange materials and meet the requirements if Ramleela is allowed to be staged. It was early to predict the state governments decision then. However, by the grace of God, we have been able to supply materials to all the committees," said another supplier. Costume designers and decorators, however, claimed “We used to take orders for Ramleela costumes and other materials from different Ramleela committees three-four months prior to the beginning of Ramleela's. But this year, we planned strategically and arranged old and new materials as per the demands”. Over three dozen small and big Ramleela committees organize their shows ahead of Dussehra across the city. The Ramleela's organised by Patharchatti Ramleela committee and Katra Ramleela committee are the most famous among the audiences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/smiles-back-as-ramleela-begins-after-2-years/articleshow/86950309.cms||Kapil Dixit

---||Nagpur||Sr residents miss Covid allowance due to ‘technical reasons’||Nagpur: Hours after the state government announced acknowledgement allowance for every resident doctor who worked during the Covid pandemic, a large section of residents learnt that they have been disqualified for ‘technical reasons’. Over 1,500 senior resident doctors who worked during the first wave have missed the special allowance of Rs 1.21 lakh as their residency period technically ended before the announcement. The government has included all resident doctors – right from senior and junior for this allowance. But doctors who got admitted in 2018 and worked during the first wave and now cleared their PG course are not going to get any benefit. They have written to CM Uddhav Thackeray regarding this injustice. They are now waiting for a meeting with Thackeray. Technically, the government resolution issued on October 6 states that the acknowledgement allowance is for both junior and senior residents. The batch of doctors, which is technically not residents now, will remain deprived. “The technical fault is keeping the Covid warriors deprived of their just right,” said Dr Satish Tandale. “Covid was new and the threat was more when we worked hard without any hesitation during the first wave. We lost our academics, our exams were postponed and the period of our residency was extended. It’s unfortunate that we are not getting any benefit of the government’s allowance,” he added. A senior doctor in Nagpur GMCH, who is also in the same league, said doctors in Nagpur GMCH are hopeful of getting the allowance. “The GMCH has not relieved us from the residency till now. We are working as residents though we have cleared the examination. We are also getting salaries. This qualifies us for the allowance too. But it needs to come officially,” said the doctor. Doctors from Mumbai’s KEM and Nair Hospital have already raised their voice against this injustice while the doctors in other parts of the state are also joining in. Officials of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) said that they are with the seniors as they deserve the allowance. “This has been a common practice that the batch that fights for a cause like stipend revision and allowance hardly gets any benefit of the outcome,” said a senior member. YOU PASSED, SO NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT * 2018 batch of resident doctors worked hard during the first and second wave * They cleared residency period in 2021, exams too are over * As they are no more into residency, they are not eligible for allowance * 1500+ such doctors, who deserve this acknowledgement, deprived of allowance * They have written to CM Thackeray, plan to meet him soon||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sr-residents-miss-covid-allowance-due-to-technical-reasons/articleshow/86948076.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Despite several complaints to Telangana State Waqf board no action has been initiated against land grabbers who encroached upon Jiyaguda graveyard.

He has now deleted the post and halted the process of trying to sell the flat. The complainant, Govardhan Deshmukh (36), who has been on a house hunt, came across the post on a Facebook group on October 4. Deshmukh happens to be the president of an NGO, Marathi Ekikaran Samiti. The post mentioned the intended sale of a 1BHK flat on the third floor of Sector 7, Shantinagar. The post carried a note saying: “Only Gujarati, Jain, Marwadi communities are allowed in that building.” Deshmukh called on the numbers mentioned in the post. “I began my conversation in Marathi. The flat owner who identified himself as Rahul Dedhia said he will not sell the flat to any other communities,” said Deshmukh. Dedhia, he said, spoke in Marathi. Deshmukh filed a complaint with Naya Nagar police, who booked Dedhia under Indian Penal Code Section 153 (A) for promoting enmity between groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence and language. A woman family member who shared the post has been booked too. Inspector Jitendra Vankoti said the flat owner has been served a notice that he would have to appear before Thane court when the chargesheet is filed. Dedhia could not be contacted for comment. Satnamsingh Rasgotra, president, Thane Cooperative Advocates Association, said housing society bylaws are against any discrimination. Dedhia told cops the decision to sell to specific communities was taken by his housing society, which denied issuing any such order. Housing consultant Bharat Khiroya said a society’s NOC is not needed for sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-booked-for-post-on-flat-sale-to-specific-communities/articleshow/86950381.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Mumbai||Mumbai Port Trust to rope in arborists to check on health of 3,000 trees||MUMBAI: Even as the BMC is sitting on its plan for carrying out a city-wide scientific risk basement of trees through an arborist, the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) will soon appoint an agency to risk assess trees on its estate.  The port trust has invited applications from arboriculture specialists/consultants to carry out scientific risk assessment of around 3,000 trees within its jurisdiction. TimesViewRising incidents of uprooting of trees show that trimming is a very important exercise. Not only must people not get injured because of falling trees and branches, the pruning itself must be proper and must not be hacking in the garb of trimming. Following the Mumbai Port Trust’s decision to appoint an agency to scientifically survey trees, the BMC must appoint an agency to survey trees across Mumbai. An arborist or horticulturist has to be present on the site before every trimming exercise.“There are many trees in MbPT operational areas, residential areas/ estate which are visually found to be in not in good condition and need to be surveyed by experts for ascertaining their condition for taking further necessary action. Accordingly, MbPT has proposed to appoint an arboriculture consultant for risk assessment of trees in MbPT estate,” said a port trust official. “Preliminary survey revealed that there are around 3,000 trees in the entire MbPT estate. About 50% of the 3,000 trees shall be diagnosed every year,” the official added. The contract will be for two years. After engaging arborist Vaibhav Raje to carry out the city’s first scientific survey of trees in D ward— it covers Tardeo, Girgaum, Malabar Hill and Altamont Road—in June, the BMC was to carry out the exercise in other wards too. As part of the scientific risk assessment of trees, a detailed survey is carried out using high-end equipment, like the resistograph. The survey takes around two weeks per ward and covers 100-150 trees in each ward. However, the plan has not taken off yet. In June, BJP MLA from Bandra (W) Ashish Shelar had asked BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal to survey trees across Mumbai, including H-West ward too. “I reiterate the need for appointing tree arborists for all 24 BMC wards of Mumbai to study all trees and take steps for their upkeep,” Shelar said in a letter to Chahal. “The recent step of granting tree heritage status to 50-year-old trees itself requires a detailed study of all trees in the city and will remain on paper unless implemented. I am sad that once again the proposal for tree arborist and tree heritage status has not been approved and it is shocking that the BMC plans to implement this only for D and G-South wards only...” “I demand that a tree arborist survey for all trees be immediately commissioned ...If the same is not possible, then all 24 wards should be merged into G South ward to benefit from this pilot project...” Shelar added. G-South ward covers areas in Worli, Lower Parel, Prabhadevi and Mahalaxmi. BMC officials said the plan for a city-wide risk assessment of trees was being processed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mbpt-to-rope-in-arborists-to-check-on-health-of-3k-trees/articleshow/86952267.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots: Cops fined Rs 5,000 for failing to supply chargesheet to accused||NEW DELHI: A city court has imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on Delhi Police, which would be deducted from the salary of the erring officer, for failing to comply with its orders of providing the chargesheet to the accused in two northeast Delhi riots cases. The fine of Rs 5,000 from each of the cases would have to be deposited in Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said it was repeatedly brought to the notice of senior police officers, up to the rank of DCP, joint commissioner and commissioner of Delhi Police, that investigating officers and SHOs were not complying with the court’s directions, leading to “unnecessary delay” in trial/committal of cases. “They are not even inspecting the file before the next date of hearing to ensure that all directions of the court are complied with in time. They have failed to mend their ways,” said the court in similar orders passed in both the cases. The judge said, “This court is not oblivious to the fact that the burden of the aforesaid cost shall ultimately fall on the public exchequer. Hence, I deem it appropriate to direct the commissioner of police to order an inquiry to fix the responsibility for imposition of the aforesaid cost and to order deduction of the same from the salary of the officer found responsible for non-compliance of the directions.” In one case, the court noted that the adjournment was necessitated due to non-compliance of its order dated January 11, 2021. In the other matter, perusal of the records revealed that the supplementary chargesheet was filed on June 21. By the order dated August 5, the IO was directed to supply the copy to the accused before August 20 against proper acknowledgment. “It is submitted by the counsel that the accused has not yet received the copy of the supplementary chargesheet. The IO has failed to produce the acknowledgment regarding supply of a copy of the supplementary chargesheet to the accused in terms of the order dated August 5,” said the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-riots-cops-fined-rs-5k-for-failing-to-supply-chargesheet-to-accused/articleshow/86950509.cms||Usha Das

---||Dehradun||Conversion for marriage wrong, Hindus failed to teach kids value of religion: Mohan Bhagwat||NAINITAL: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that people converting for marriage were committing a “wrong” for “selfish reasons” and that it was happening because Hindu families had “failed to teach children the value of one’s religion and tradition”. Addressing RSS volunteers during an event, Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said there was a need to refine family values so that India can once again become a “vishwaguru”. “Families need to teach their children the values to take pride in one’s religion and traditions as a way to stop conversion of Hindus,” said the RSS head, who was on a three-day visit to Haldwani. “How do conversions happen? How do Hindu girls and boys convert to other religions for selfish reasons, for marriage? Those who are doing it are wrong. We need to teach them these values at our home,” he said. Bhagwat added that families need to answer questions about religion raised by kids and not get confused by these queries. “Respond to any inquiries that arise. Do not be confused. We must educate ourselves to prepare our children,” he said. The RSS chief's comments on conversions came even as several BJP-ruled states have rolled out anti-conversion laws. Uttarakhand, which already has an anti-conversion law since 2018, had also decided last month to propose stricter provisions in the law so that “love jihad cases can be effectively tackled.” Meanwhile, talking about the virtues of the Indian family system, Bhagwat rued that most of the programmes had little participation from women. “The RSS was created to organise Hindus. However, whenever we organise programmes, most of them are attended by males,” he said. An RSS functionary said Bhagwat asked workers to read and learn about Indian culture and heritage and inform people about it. “He asked us to go for swadeshi and also warned against consumption of drugs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/conversion-for-marriage-wrong-hindus-failed-to-teach-kids-value-of-religion-bhagwat/articleshow/86946225.cms||Prashant Jha

The casting work of the pre-cast structures for the underground tunnels in the newly built casting yard for UG section-1 at HBTU premises, also commenced. This marked the start of the work on leg two of phase one. In leg one of phase one, metro train will run on nine kilometre stretch between IIT and Motijheel, the work of which is nearing completion on this stretch. Managing Director, UPMRC, Kumar Keshav on Monday inaugurated the marked four km stretch between Chunniganj to Nayaganj under Corridor-1 (IIT to Naubasta). Bhumi Pujan was performed at Naveen market location. Several empolyees of UPMRC were present at the spot. Four UG metro stations are to be constructed under this section (between Chunniganj and Nayaganj). Senior officials of Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation and Contractors Gulemak- Sam India were also present during the occasion. While on the nine kilometre stretch, metro will run on elevated stations, between Chunniganj and Nayaganj (four kilometre stretch), metro will run underground. Thus, metro stations will be constructed underground. The first diaphragm wall of the proposed Naveen Market metro station was lowered to a depth of about 22 meters by means of advanced cranes. The diaphragm wall can be understood as the boundary of a metro station. Before the construction of the underground metro station, this wall is constructed as a security enclosure around it. The D-wall is made up of small rectangular panels measuring around 5 meters in length and around 800 millimeters (mm) in width. Approx one hundred such panels are used to prepare the D-wall of a UG metro station, 105 panels will be used in the construction of Naveen Market Metro station. For underground section-I, a special casting yard has been set up at the HBTU premises, where rings will be cast for the underground tunnel. Kumar Keshav also inaugurated the casting process of the first ring through machine. This ring will be made up of six small segments, having a total diameter of about 6 meters. The ring casted in this yard will support the tunnel during tunnelling work by Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). Expressing happiness and satisfaction on this occasion, UPMRC MD, Kumar Keshav said, “Kanpur Metro is moving towards a new chapter with the commencement of the construction work at the Naveen Market. It is my firm belief that our team will be able to work with the same pace and dedication which they showed during the construction of the ‘Priority Corridor’ (between IIT and Motijheel) and will be able to execute construction work of this section in the defined time frame. A new casting yard has also been set up for underground section-I at the HBTU premises, which is equipped with the state-of-the-art machines and facilities.” He also briefed about the upcoming tunnelling work, which will be executed in the near future, through the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). Under underground section-1, there will be a construction of four Metro stations namely, Chunniganj, Naveen Market, Bada Chauraha and Nayaganj. Out of these four metro stations, the initial three will have a length of 215 meters and width of 23 mts while Nayaganj Metro Station will be of 225 metres long and 22.3 meters wide. Meanwhile, traffic diversion has come into place at Parade crossing where Naveen Market is located and at Bada Chauraha where a prominent city mall is situated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-metro-work-enters-new-phase/articleshow/86950395.cms||---

Deposing before the inquiry commission on Monday, first additional junior civil judge-cum-first additional judicial first class magistrate of Shadnagar, P Shyam Prasad stated that though the accused were not produced before him in person, he presumed that they did not seek legal aid as no prison official had turned up before him when he heard the police custody petition. The judicial magistrate was asked several questions about the procedure followed while granting custody of the accused on December 2, 2019. The commission’s advocate and members based their questions on the affidavit filed by the judicial magistrate before the commission, where it was stated that the accused were issued notices pertaining to the requisition filed by ACP Shadnagar seeking their custody. The magistrate said the accused were not produced before him by police while seeking custody and he did not ask ask them the reasons for not doing so. The magistrate was asked how did he state the accused neither filed any counter to custody notice nor engaged any counsel to oppose custody petition when they were not produced before him. To this he stated, “If the accused intend to file a counter, they generally send a jailor. As I did not receive any counter through the jailor, I presumed that no counter was filed.” As the final question, the panel asked the magistrate “How many times did you give police custody without seeing the accused, without talking to them and without any reports being brought regarding them”, the magistrate said, “One or two times.” While answering a question about intimating family about custody petition, the magistrate said he went by the remand report of executive magistrate in which it was stated that families were informed under CrPC Section 50-A.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gave-cops-custody-sans-seeing-hearing-accused/articleshow/86948109.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Speaking after the conclusion of mouna deekha (silent protest) at Dharna Chowk, Indira Park as part of All India Congress Committee’s call for a nation-wide protest against the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy said while Modi speaks on so many issues in his Mann Ki Baat programme, he should also come clear on the alleged killing of the farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. Revanth demanded that a special court be set up to hear the Lakhimpur Kheri farmers’ massacre and to complete trial within a month and that culprits be hanged at a street in public view. “All the accused in the incident should be arrested. Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra should be removed from the cabinet. We will continue the agitation until farmers get justice,” Revanth said. Revanth also slammed chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for not condemning the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.  “The Lakhimpur Kheri incident is similar to the one that took place in Nerella of Sircilla constituency in Telangana. Farmers had objected to illegal sand mining in their areas. Some of them were run over by trucks allegedly belonging to the sand mafia.

Sajjanar was primarily questioned on sanctioning of long-range weapons to policemen escorting the rape & murder case accused and how certain details were revealed during a press conference held on November 29, 2019. “Usually long weapons are provided for escort duties at the request of DCP concerned irrespective of nature of offences,” Sajjanar told the commission, adding that six long weapons were given to the Disha team on escort duty as per requisition of DCP, Shamshabad. He also said that he did not ask the DCP the need to carry six long weapons. On being asked if he could recall any instance where six long weapons were provided for escort duty of rape and murder accused, the senior cop said that he would have to check and get back. Responding to queries on press meet at DCP, Shamashabad, office on November 29, Sajjanar said that the DCP had informed him about the arrest at 5.30 pm while he was at RGI Airport and as per his request he came to the office to address the press at 7pm. On how he could give graphic details of the crime, including tyre being deflated and piece of cloth stuffed in Disha’s mouth, at 7pm to the media while the recording of confessions continued beyond 10pm, the former CP said, “The entire press meet was on the basis of briefing given to me by DCP, Shamshabad. The details were based on CCTV footage, call data records of the suspects, underwear and purse of the victim found at the crime scene.... I think by the time press conference was held, confession of accused number 1 (Md Arif) was already recorded.” Quizzed about the arms and ammunition distribution register entry stating that the two 9 mm pistols, which were allegedly snatched by the accused from the police personnel working at Nandigama and Amangal stations on December 6, 2019, were shown as seized on December 3, 2019, the former CP said that he will have to check the reason for the error.

The tanker supply is meant for areas which have poor water supply such as hilltops, congested slums and peripheral locations. “Using this technology the HMWS&SB vigilance wing busted the racket in Old City. However, the probe revealed the negligence of water board officials, had colluded with the offenders,” HMWS&SB vigilance wing inspector P Tirupati told TOI. The inspector informed that while the irregularities were spotted by officials of the concerned division, they did not alert the higher-ups. As a result, the vigilance wing had to jump into action. To check irregularities in tanker supply, the water board had introduced the automatic vehicle tracking system five years ago. Under this, both paid and free tankers were fitted with GPS devices. “We tracked tankers for five to six months in Old City, right from filling to delivery point and recorded every movement. We found gross violations in the system,” the inspector said.  HMWS&SB managing director M Dana Kishore convened an emergency meeting with vigilance wing at Khairatabad on Monday and asked them to launch a thorough probe on the free water tanker system in Greater Hyderabad and its periphery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tanker-diversions-probe-points-to-role-of-water-officials/articleshow/86948147.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala's snake bite murder case: Sooraj S Kumar guilty, sentencing tomorrow||KOLLAM: The 6th additional sessions court here on Monday has found Sooraj S Kumar guilty in the sensational Uthra murder case. Sooraj, the main accused, is the husband of Uthra who was found dead at her home on May 7, 2020, after being bitten by a cobra. Sessions judge M Manoj stated in the verdict that the accused was found guilty under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 302 (murder), 328 (poisoning) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. The court said all the prosecution charges levelled against the accused were proved beyond doubt. The case was then posted to October13 for delivering the sentence. After reading out the verdict, the judge asked the accused to come near him and told him that all the crimes charged against him were proved and asked him whether he had anything to tell the court about the punishment to be awarded to him. Sooraj said that he had parents and a sister at home and there was nothing more to say. Special public prosecutor G Mohanraj told the court that capital punishment should be awarded so that it gives a strong message to society. He pointed out that it was one of the rarest of the cases the country had ever seen. The prosecution built the case on the strong foundation that Sooraj’s heinous acts had no parallel as he was scheming another attempt to murder the victim, his wife and mother of his child, even when she was screaming out in pain on the hospital bed at Thriuvalla following a viper’s bite. Uthra of ‘Vishu’ Vellasseril, Eram, Anchal, sustained the snake bite on the night of May 6, 2020. On May 7 morning, her mother noticed her lying lifeless in her bedroom. Initially, they did not have any suspicion regarding Sooraj. But Sooraj’s insensitive behaviour immediately after Uthra’s death made her parents suspicious, and they filed a complaint with Kollam rural SP Harisankar. From there, the case took a different turn. The state intelligence too had asked for a thorough surveillance. As the case was transferred to the district crime branch, the team led by DSP A Ashokan started scientific investigations, setting aside the local police’s conclusions. The prosecution produced 87 witnesses, 288 documents, and 40 material evidence. The findings in the dummy test also became crucial. Chavarukavu Suresh, the snake charmer who handed over the cobra to Sooraj and charged as another accused in the case, later turned approver. Kollam rural SP KB Ravi, investigation officer Ashokan, rural crime branch DSP Ashok Kumar, Kollam ACP Vijayakumar, City DCRB ACP Pratheep Kumar, Thenmala range forest officer Jayan, snake expert Vava Suresh were present in the court. Besides special public prosecutor G Mohanraj, advocates K Gopeesh Kumar, CS Sunilkumar, A Saran were also present. Advocate Jitha S Nair appeared for the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sooraj-guilty-sentencing-tomorrow/articleshow/86948192.cms||---

A day earlier, on Sunday, PSPCL had purchased 285 lakh units at an average price of Rs 11.6 per unit. On Saturday, the power discom bought power at Rs 13 per unit. Consumers had to face power cuts lasting up to four hours. Punjab State Power Corporation Limited officials described the state’s coal stock position as critical. They said only 12 rakes of coal were received on Sunday, against the daily requirement of 22 rakes. PSPCL is procuring power from the market, especially to cater to the power demand of agriculture sector. PSPCL chief managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad said the corporation met maximum demand of 8,885 MW of Punjab state on Sunday and about 1500 MW of power had to be purchsed from power exchange to meet the gap between supply and demand. “Power supply to agriculture sector improved considerably on Sunday, wherein supply of about six hours was given. The quantum of power cuts on other categories of consumers also remained significantly less. We hope power availability is likely to improve within 1-2 days as additional quantum of about 400 MW is expected to be received from state sector and other outside longterm sources. One more unit of GGSSTP, Ropar, shall also start generating power from Tuesday,” said Prasad. “Moreover, 50MW generation from Anandpur Sahib hydel project also started on Monday; it will increase to 100MW shortly,” he added. Power supply on Sunday was 1,796 lakh units against the demand of 1,892 lakh units. In terms of load, the power shortage was more than 1,000 MW. Maximum demand is around 8,850 MW. “Power utilities which are away from coal pithead are facing a coal shortage. Many thermal power plants are left with three-four days of coal stock. A number of thermal plants in the country failed to maintain the coal stock as per CEA guidelines and now states like Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, and others are facing power cuts,” said AIPEF spokesperson V K Gupta. Coal stock sitution In Punjab, all private coal-based plants have less than two days of coal stock remaining. The power plant at Rajpura has 1.9 days of stock, and it is 1.6 days in Talwandi Sabo and 0.8 days at GVK in Tarn Taran. Sate-owned plants have less than 4 days of coal stock left. Ropar thermal has 3.6 days of coal stock and Lehra Mohabatt has 7.8 days of stock. State-based coal-based plants are still operating at 50% capacity. Unit of GVK shut One unit of GVK thermal plant has shut down due to coal depletion. A GVK official confirmed that one unit of GVK power plant in Tarn Taran was shut down on Sunday. The official said the plant’s second unit was running at full capacity and the plant had around 10,000 MT of coal stocked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/power-crisis-gets-deeper-pb-buys-power-at-rs-14-5-per-unit/articleshow/86950428.cms||Bharat Khanna

---||Delhi||HC pulls up govt for failing to end long-pending petty cases against minors||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday pulled up Delhi government for failing to comply with its order to end with immediate effect all cases of petty offences against minors where inquiries were pending for over a year. The court noted that the state had also not complied with its direction to apprise it of the number of cases where inquiries were pending in each JJB in the city for six months to one year, along with the date of institution of the inquiry and of the first production in each case. “Children can’t wait. Juveniles can’t wait. You take as much time as you want, but children cannot be put on hold,” a bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani underlined. During the hearing, Delhi government showed a chart to the court revealing that there was a difference of 409 minors in the record of juveniles produced before the JJB and released. “Where are these 409 juveniles? They have fallen through the cracks. These 409 (minors) will be lost in the system. We shudder to think what awaits them. What is happening? What happened to these 409 and where are they?” it asked. The bench pulled up the government saying its conduct was not satisfactory. “You should follow ‘Alice in the Wonderland’, which says if everybody minded their own business, the world would go around a great deal faster than it does,” it remarked. It, however, allowed the government’s prayer for more time to file an affidavit elaborating the steps taken by it to comply with the court’s previous order. When the court asked when would all juveniles, allegedly involved in petty offences and against whom inquiries were pending, be produced before JJB, the government counsel said it would be done in 10 days. “You should have done it by now. We are surprised with what JJBs are doing. Are they not aware of our order? They must comply with it. By now, the JJB should have directed police to produce all juveniles before the board,” the bench said. “We can understand the executive is finding it difficult to comply with our order, but why is JJB finding it difficult to comply. We cannot turn a blind eye to it,” the bench noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-pulls-up-govt-for-failing-to-end-long-pending-petty-cases-against-minors/articleshow/86977919.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||For speedy land compensation, NHAI to switch to new system||NEW DELHI: In its bid to fast track disbursement of compensation for land acquisition to property owners, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will now shift to a new system where the amount will be transferred directly to the beneficiaries’ accounts through the Public Finance Management System (PFMS). This will also avoid the blocking of thousands of crores of rupees in banks for months which can be utilised for construction. Recently, around Rs 38,000 crore of NHAI was lying in bank accounts meant for land acquisition. Sources said road transport secretary, Giridhar Aramane, who has additional charge of NHAI chairman, has issued directions to adopt this mode of payment to landowners, which the road wing of ministry has been following for the past 2-3 years. NHAI is the biggest land acquirer for expansion of highways and in the past four years it has disbursed about Rs 1.3 lakh crore for land acquisition. Currently, the NHAI deposits the compensation amount in designated banks for disbursal as soon as the 3 G (sanction of compensation) award is finalised for acquiring land. But the competent state authorities, known as CALA, takes longer to disburse the amount. Though such payment through PFMS is being made for land acquisition by the road wing of the road transport and highways ministry, sources said the “sheer volume” of land acquisition and land owners are a challenge for implementing this in the NHAI. “It’s a good system. But we need to have the mechanism in place to handle huge amounts and numbers of beneficiaries,” said another official. PFMS validates the bank or post office account details with the beneficiary's bank or post office. This ensures that money is transferred to a validated account thereby reducing the risk of misdirected payments. The implementing agency verifies the details of name, address provided by the beneficiary with the validated information provided by the bank or post office. Thereafter the implementing agency can make e-payments to beneficiaries to their validated bank accounts directly from the same PFMS portal where beneficiary details have already been captured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-speedy-land-compensation-nhai-to-switch-to-new-system/articleshow/86954244.cms||Dipak K Dash

The modalities are being chalked out by officials following a directive to the effect from the chief secretary’s office. The department proposes to award a scholarship to the top 100 students -- 70 from the state board, UBSE (Uttarakhand Board of School Education), and the rest will be selected from the CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) board. The aim is to provide aid those meritorious students who have to struggle to continue to pursue higher studies after school due to financial constraints, the officials said. Directions were also issued to the education department officials by the chief minister office to visit a government-run school once a week and conduct the classes themselves. The CMO also ordered the officials to work on increasing enrollment of students in the state schools. Sources said the department has decided to give an opportunity to those candidates who have scored less than 50% marks at the under-graduation level to apply for a primary school teacher’s post. Earlier, only candidates with more than 50% marks were shortlisted for recruitment as primary school teacher at state-run schools. Sometime ago, a public interest litigation was also filed at the Ut tarakhand high court against this rule.

---||Bhopal||Prolonged rains disrupt supply cycle; vegetable prices soar in Bhopal||BHOPAL: Prolonged rain and hike in fuel prices have led to a sharp spike in prices of vegetables ahead of Dussehra — which might push the prices up further. Heavy rains damaged many crops, with vegetables rotting in fields, say farmers. This has led to shortage in supply in market, pushing up the prices. On Monday, coriander was being sold at a rate of Rs 200 per kg. Prices of all green vegetables are on a higher side. Seasonal cauliflower which should have started flooding the markets is being sold at Rs 60-80/kg, tomato is Rs 60 a kg, spinach Rs 60/kg and so on. Vendors going around the localities carry lesser vegetables — both in quality and quantity. Javed Khan, a wholesaler in mandi said, “There has been a considerable decline in the amount of vegetables reaching Bhopal mandi.” “ First it was too much rainfall followed by too hard sunlight. Besides, the transportation charges , first from farm to mandi and then mandi to the retailer is also adding to the price”, he explained. Raja Kushwah, a farmer on the city outskirts said, “ I have incurred a huge loss. There was hardly any growth in cauliflower and the hara dhania has decayed. So was the case of spinach”. This is likely to go on for almost two to three weeks till the new crop grows and reach markets, he said Neha Marwah, a homemaker said, “Prices are rising every day. You can’t not buy vegetables. We have started curtailing use of vegetable which are getting too pricey.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/prolonged-rains-disrupt-supply-cycle-vegetable-prices-soar/articleshow/86948190.cms||---

In fact, he was even stopped at the nakabandi, but managed to get away by showing his police identity card. Gaikwad is a driver for an assistant commissioner of police at the Sion division. On Sunday, the crime branch had arrested Gaikwad and his wife Monali for the murder of her lover, Arjun Jagdale alias Dada. Officials said that on September 29, Gaikwad had called Jagdale to Mumbai, served him liquor at his Worli police quarters and then killed him. He hacked the corpse into several pieces and drove off with the body parts in his Wagon R.  “The accused says that he was confused and didn’t know where to dump the body. He reached Antop Hill, where he was stopped by the nakabandi police team. But he is not clear on whether he was stopped before he dumped the body or after. He flashed his ID card and got away,’’ said an officer. The police have seized Gaikwad’s Wagon R, which has heavily tinted windshields, due to which the car’s contents cannot be seen from outside. Sources also said that his wife told police that Gaikwad killed and chopped Jagdale’s body, and that she merely helped him pack the body in bags. “She is trying to shield herself or mislead the police. There are discrepancies in the statements of the couple, hence we have to take their information with a pinch of salt,” added another officer. Cops said that Gaikwad is playing tricks with them, and refuses to disclose where he dumped the victim’s head. Without the head, it will be challenging for the police to establish during trial that the corpse is indeed Jagdale’s. On Monday, the investigators also took Gaikwad to various spots where they deduced he might have dumped the head, to no avail. The mystery of the headless body began on September 29, when the Antop Hill police had found the corpse outside sector 7, at CGS quarters, Wadala. This location is close to the police station. Without the head, all that the police had to go on was a tattoo (which had the Marathi word Dada) on the left hand of the body. They also found a steel plate fitted in the deceased’s ankle, which eventually helped cops identify him as Jagdale. From there, they found phone records connecting the victim to Monali, and were able to crack the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-headless-body-was-right-under-cops-nose/articleshow/86950465.cms||Ahmed Ali

Although the Covid case count in the Tricity has been reducing and is between five and two cases every day, serious cases admitted in PGI’s Covid hospital are increasing. “We will continue treating Covid patients as over a period of two weeks, severe to serious Covid cases have increased from eight to 22 . We also continue our non-Covid services in Nehru hospital extension,” said PGI director Prof Jagat Ram. “The festival season is around the corner and we have started seeing an increase in admissions much before that. This is due to non-adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour,” he added. However, public health experts said that most of these cases are of the old viral shedding and turned positive on GeneXpert. “The CT score is mostly above 40 for such patients who had come to the emergency or are due for surgery. This high value indicates low infection transmission rate,” an expert said, adding that three to four RTPCR cases are being received in the PGI emergency every day. Public health experts have also warned of possible mutations as few people are wearing masks or adhering to social distancing. “At the Ramleela grounds, it is rare to see people wearing masks. Even cops do not wear them,” an expert said. With tropical infections like dengue, malaria and scrub typhus being seen in city hospitals, experts feel preventable diseases should be taken care of.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgis-covid-case-count-up-by-63/articleshow/86948216.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Will MLAs switching sides boomerang on BJP, Congress?||DEHRADUN/NAINITAL: While the BJP and the Congress are busy boasting of making major political gains by inducting rival MLAs in their fold, an uneasy calm is brewing in the rank and file of both parties. BJP members in Bhimtal have opposed the induction of Ram Singh Khaira – a former Congress member who contested and won 2017 assembly polls as an independent. Many Congress workers are not happy either with the Arya duo’s induction. Opposing the induction, Sarita Arya, who was Congress MLA from Nainital in 2012 and had lost to Sanjiv Arya in the 2017 polls, wrote on her Facebook page on Monday, “I have a lot of options and will take a call after discussing the issue with my well-wishers.”. Former Congress state chief Kishore Updhyay through a written message after the induction of Yashpal and Sanjiv warned of “consequences” of the move. In his message, Updhyay wrote, “As a consequence of the ongoing political developments, we may be able to understand the pain and feeling of people (including Congress members) who made their best effort to save democracy, Congress and the government in 2016.” Another Congress member, who did not wish to benamed, said, “What will happen to the dedicated party members who have worked for five years and were eying a party ticket? In 2017, the Congress witnessed large scale protests and if party members are denied tickets at the last minute, there will be a repeat of that scenario.” Meanwhile, days after Kaira joined the saffron fold, BJP workers in Bhimtal have also come out opposing the move, warning the party against giving him a ticket. Kaira had joined the BJP on Friday in the presence of Union minister Smriti Irani, MP Anil Baluni and state party president Madan Kaushik. It is believed that Kaira had joined the party in an effort to secure a ticket for himself from Bhimtal in the forthcoming polls. BJP workers on Monday held a meeting and said that the candidate from Bhimtal should be a party worker and not a ‘turncoat.’  “The party has inducted an MLA whom we opposed for five years. Kaira acted against the interest of the BJP and all of a sudden, he has been brought on board. How can we support him?” said former cabinet minister Govind Singh Bisht. The BJP workers also said that they will not participate in any event attended by Kaira, nor will they allow him into any party events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/will-mlas-switching-sides-boomerang-on-bjp-cong/articleshow/86946296.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Chandigarh||Cuts spell dark days for Punjab Inc: Industrialists||CHANDIGARH/LUDHIANA: The industry in Punjab has been suffering production losses due to unscheduled power cuts ranging from four to five hours for the last three days, said representatives of industrial groups across the state on Monday. The statements came even as Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi promised to not let the state plunge into a black out. Responding to a query by media persons in Chandigarh regarding acute coal shortage in the country, Channi said he had already taken up this issue with the ministry of coal to ensure supply of coal. Meanwhile, Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association president Badish Jindal said a power cut was imposed for five hours in industrial hubs across the state on Saturday and another for four to five hours on Monday. “Power cuts are causing huge production losses. Industries which require continuous process, such as steel or plastic, have failed to run due to failure of continued supply by PSPCL,” he said. Jindal, who is based in Ludhiana, said this was increasing the costs and unrest in workers, as they were forced to sit idle for long hours. “Alredy hit by Covid-19 and farm protests, the industry is facing the final nail in its coffin in Punjab in the shape of these power cuts,” said Jindal. He added this was peak production time for industries such as hosiery and bicycle as festival season was round the corner and the least the Punjab government could do was to provide round-the-clock power to industry. “The coal ministry is claiming availability of 400 lakh tonnes of coal, which is sufficient for 20 days and is assuring continuous supply of coal to 135 thermal plants of India. On the other hand, the chief of PSPCL is claiming huge scarcity of coal and is imposing huge unscheduled power cuts in the state,” he added, questioning who should the industry believe. Vipan Mahajan, director of Nova Fitness and Phillips Sports Limited in Jalandhar, said industry in Jalandhar was facing daily power cuts since Saturday. “Today, we have asked the contract labour force to sit at home after we came to know that these cuts may continue. There is no use of paying full day’s salary to staff for just 3-4 hours of work,” said Vipan Mahajan, director of Nova Fitness and Phillips Sports Limited in Jalandhar, adding that the bigger the industry, the bigger the loss. Varun Arora, president of Amritsar Foundry Engineering Association, said they had also been bearing the brunt of unscheduled cuts ranging from two to three hours since Saturday. Vinod Vashisht, president of All India Steel Rollers Association in Mandi Gobindgarh, said though they had not faced any power cut till now, they had been asked to be prepared if the situation deteriorated. Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners Manufacturers Association of India, said the danger of blackout will make matters worse for us. “It will be impossible to arrange any power alternatives for longer durations to run our factories in case the power plants shut down. Government must act now and take corrective measures to save the industry from being pushed into darkness.” Rajkumar Singla, president of Fastener Supplier Association Ludhiana, said PSPCL chief’s statement on the shortage of coal with private plants was giving them sleepless nights. “We do not know who is to be blamed for the coal shortage, but we have just one demand that state government and PSPCL should find out a solution as soon as possible or else industries will face huge losses and even government revenue will suffer if industrial production comes to a halt in the state. State government should consider purchasing power from states like Himachal and Uttarakhand which produce power through non-coal-based means.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-crisis-punjab-industry-cries-for-help-cm-says-wont-let-black-out-happen/articleshow/86950687.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Uthra case: Scientific probe helped crack planned murder||KOLLAM: The investigation team probing the Uthra murder case depended on scientific investigation to bring the case to a logical conclusion. The team led by Kollam rural SP Harisankar and crime branch DSP A Ashokan had a big challenge before them as there was no eye witnesses in the case and there was no clue to doubt that a snake could be used as a weapon for murder. The crime branch team had to depend on circumstantial evidence and the evidence gathered in a scientific manner. When they confirmed the use of a snake, another challenge was to make the evidence trustworthy. There were two similar cases in Maharashtra and Rajasthan where snakes were used for murders. But in both the cases, the prosecution could not prove it beyond doubt. Uthra’s postmortem report, autopsy examination of the snake (cobra) used as a weapon of murder, chemical analysis report, call records of Sooraj and snake charmer Chavarkavu Suresh, and CCTV visuals confirming the meeting between Sooraj and Suresh at Enathu all were gathered to plug the loopholes and led the investigation in the right path. Digital evidence was collected to conclusively point towards Sooraj’s detailed planning to make use of snake as murder weapon. Forensic examination reports said that the snake’s bowel was empty. This shows that the snake had been kept in a plastic jar for seven days without being fed. Material evidence was collected with great precision. Finally, a dummy test was conducted to ascertain the width of snake bite (the distance between the teeth) which happens when a snake bites naturally and the one sustained when it is pressed to bite. While normally, the width will be around 1.7cm, here in Uthra’s case it was 2.3cm and 2.7cm. Only when a cobra is pressed on its head to make it bite would the bite width be around 2.5cm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/scientific-probe-helped-crack-planned-murder/articleshow/86948268.cms||---

Devotees were allowed to gather and do the dandiya as well as garba. At Kalibari in Chandigarh, where the Durga Puja has been conducted for the longest time in the city, the management allowed everyone to be part of the celebrations. Manager of Kalibari said, “This time, there is no restriction on the number of people to attend puja but the committee will make sure that all Covid protocols are followed.” The administration had given the temple the go-ahead to conduct festivities in full swing. The temple committee has shared the schedule with devotees. Besides puja and arti, cultural programmes are also being organised in the temple. Durga Puja festivities started in Kalibari on October 11 and will conclude with Maha Dashami on October 15.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 50,000 flout Covid norms at Kankali Mandir||BHOPAL: During the Navratri festivities, one thing has become crystal clear yet again- people have not learnt any lesson from their past mistakes that caused several deaths and mass scale destruction in lakhs of homes during second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. It was shocking to see that despite experts and health officials repeatedly advising people to adhere to Covid norms, thousands of devotees thronged the Kankali Mata Mandir at Gudawal village in Raisen district (about 20 kms away from Bhopal) on Sunday. And what was even worse was - the way most of the people cocked a snook at Covid norms and mask rule, even though it has been proved that after each festival, Covid cases surge. Since it was the first weekend of Navratri, over 50000 people visited the temple from 7am till 8pm on Sunday.  “Temple committee had made elaborate arrangements; there were masks provided free of cost to all and sanitiser rule was strictly followed, but the surge of crowds was such that it wasn’t possible to control 50000 people, many of whom removed their masks while singing praises of Mother Goddess and walked very close to one another,” said one of the committee members and a trustee of Kankali Mata Mandir, Fateh Singh Meena. On their part, temple committee members were making non-stop announcements telling people to maintain adequate social distancing and not remove their masks, very few paid heed among the crowds, said Meena. “Sunday was an unusual day, although on regular days of Navratri, about 5000 devotees come to the temple each day, so it is easier to maintain Covid norms.” There were over 50 cops at the venue on Sunday, trying to control the crowds. Also, around 60 volunteers of temple committee and tehsil officials, including patwaris of adjacent villages, were also helping to educate people, but the crowds were busy waiting for their turn to have Goddess’ darshan, lamented Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/50k-flout-covid-norms-at-kankali-mandir/articleshow/86948229.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

A row had broken out after civil society and rights activists alleged that the amendment encouraged child marriage and accused the government of promoting it. Breaking his silence over the Bill, Gehlot in his address at the event, ‘Hoslon Ki Udaan’, clarified, “The Supreme Court had given an order to register all marriages to safeguard the legal rights of children born out of wedlock and widows. Although we were following this order, a controversy arose that the state was encouraging child marriage after the Bill was passed by the assembly. We will now request the governor to send the Bill back so that we can relook the legal angles. It is our pledge not to let child marriages happen in Rajasthan and there will be no compromise on the same. It is not a matter of ego and, in case if legal experts say that we should not go ahead with the amendment, we will not proceed with it.” Bill promoted child marriage: ExpertsThe Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages (Amendment) Bill, 2021 passed by the assembly had opened a can of worms after legal experts and activists claimed that it promoted child marriage by giving it validation. Although a child marriage is voidable, it is also a punishable as well as a nonbailable offence against those who solemise it. While the government claimed that the proposed amendment is to safeguard the legal rights of children, experts said that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 already does that with sections for custody and maintenance of children of child marriages (section 5) as well as legitimacy of children born of child marriages (section 6) thereby questioning the state’s justification. In the amendment, the government has made provisions for registering marriages of girls below 18 years of age and boys below 21 years. Hailing CM's statement to recall the Bill, Kriti Bharti, managing trustee of the Jodhpur-based Saarthi Trust who had filed a PIL against the Bill, said, “While the final decision is pending, this is half a victory for us. I am hopeful that child marriages will not be registered in Rajasthan.” Bharti has annulled 43 child marriages and stopped over 1,500 of them, so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-to-recall-review-marriageregistration-bill-says-gehlot/articleshow/86952357.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||All-party meet seeks caste census||Hyderabad: An all-party meeting attended by the members of Congress, CPI, CPM, Telangana Jana Samithi and other welfare associations on Monday unanimously resolved to demand that the BJP government at the Centre take up caste-wise census, especially of the Backward Classes (BCs), to ensure social justice is delivered. Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy wondered why Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not supporting one nation-one census theory. The caste-based census can help the government undo the injustices done to some of the communities. “But the BJP is stunting the political growth of BCs by not taking up caste-wise census,” Revanth alleged. The demand of the BCs for caste-wise census was justified and Congress supports it totally, he said. Also, CM KCR should make public the data of Samagra Kutumba survey, he demanded. TJS president M Kodandaram said though adopting a resolution in the assembly was important, all the political parties need to collectively exert the pressure on Modi government to conduct caste census.  The National BC Welfare Association led by its president R Krishna unanimously decided to hold an all-party meeting-cum-seminar in the Constitutional Club, New Delhi, on October 31 in support of caste-wise census of BCs. Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav, Lalu Prasad, Mayawathi, HD Deve Gowda, other national-level and important leaders from CPI, CPM, TRS, YSRCP, TDP, DMK, AIADMK, among others, from 30 political parties are expected to attend.  Dasoju Sravan gave a call to all the 144 sub-castes in the BCs to get united and boycott the upcoming general census, if BJP government did to take up caste census||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/all-party-meet-seeks-caste-census/articleshow/86948241.cms||Roushan Ali

He had told TOI, “Channi and Sidhu have different roles to play. Both of them are doing pretty well. While Channi is managing the state, Sidhu is leading the party in the right direction. There is neither any difference nor any confusion among the top brass of the Punjab unit.” On being asked whether Channi would remain the CM if the Congress is re-elected in the state, he said, “Congress has a tradition and we have been following it for years. After the election, the Congress chief names the chief minister and the CLP approves it. We will follow the same pattern in Punjab as well. Therefore, there is no point in making predictions.” Meanwhile, Rawat also denied having any information about Sidhu’s resignation. “Sidhu continues to work as the Congress state chief. Channi and Sidhu will lead the party to a win in the 2022 polls,” added Rawat. On Monday, Rawat was in Delhi to attend the “ghar vapasi” event of former assembly speaker and minister Yashpal Arya and his son Sanjiv in Delhi. “I would like to mention that a battery of leaders from the BJP is willing to join the Congress in Uttarakhand. However, we will take a call only after looking into various aspects related to the leaders,” said Rawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cong-chief-to-decide-next-punjab-cm-after-elections-harish-rawat/articleshow/86946339.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||India||Panel to study plan for a body to raise funds for conservation||NEW DELHI: The environment ministry will constitute a committee to examine a proposal to establish a national foundation for mobilising resources from various sources, including from private entities, for funding wildlife conservation activities. The decision to this effect was taken in the last meeting of the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL). The committee, chaired by environment minister Bhupender Yadav, asked the ministry to study various issues relating to the establishment of the foundation after inviting suggestions from stakeholders including conservationists, NGOs and Central Zoo Authority. The national foundation is envisaged as a government-owned public trust which will be registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. "The Foundation will provide a range of activities for private or corporate funding and will have flexibility in terms of resource mobilisation, operations and collaboration with other organisations for the purpose of wildlife conservation including zoo related activities,” said minutes of the meeting of the committee, made public last week. During the meeting, held through video conference on September 24, one of the members of the NBWL, H S Singh, suggested that the foundation may be established at state level rather than the national level. Environment secretary, R P Gupta, during the meeting noted that the budget available for the management of protected areas is not sufficient and funds need to be mobilised from other sources. Most of the participants in the meeting agreed that the establishment of the foundation at the national level would be beneficial for wildlife conservation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/panel-to-study-plan-for-a-body-to-raise-funds-for-conservation/articleshow/86954245.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The officer’s wife was allowed the privilege on her undertaking to pay a licence fee and other charges.  The HC bench of Justices P B Varale and N R Borkar, however, said it was not inclined to allow the wife’s plea to let her and the children continue residing there till 2023. The wife had petitioned the HC to challenge an order turning down the officer’s July 2021 request for retention of the accommodation. The husband, had been transferred to another state last September. The wife said that he later filed for divorce. Her petition, argued by advocate Angsuman Oza, contended that if forced to vacate, her children’s education would suffer as she had no financial means to arrange an alternative accommodation in Mumbai. She sought permission to stay on till her daughter completes her higher secondary schooling. Mumbai Naval Station is facing an acute shortage of accommodation, and more than 200 officers are waiting for houses, said the ministry of defence counsel, Shehnaz Bharucha, seeking dismissal of the petition. The ministry said the accommodation is for service personnel and not their family members. Its counsel said the wife has no legal right to file the petition or to be allotted or retain any accommodation as she is not a serving naval officer. The husband had not challenged the order to vacate the house, the ministry submitted. The HC directed the ministry to let them stay in the accommodation till March/April 2022 “considering that facts and circumstance, and in view of her undertaking. It asked the petitoner to “abide by the terms and conditions of the undertaking” and to vacate the accommodation as soon as her daughter’s Class X examination is over.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-allows-naval-officers-estranged-wife-to-stay-in-his-official-residence/articleshow/86952375.cms||---
---||Delhi||Proposed delineation may bring down the total area under NCR||New Delhi: The four participating states in the National Capital Region (NCR) on Tuesday tried to find a middle ground on the proposed delineation of the region, which may result in reduction of the total area, after Haryana pushed for drastic reduction of its area under the NCR. The states have a consensus that the geographical size of the region should be a contiguous circular region of 100 km radius from Rajghat (Delhi), a statement from the housing and urban affairs ministry said. “Beyond 100 km radius and up to the existing NCR boundary, all notified cities and towns along with a corridor of 1-km on either side of connecting Expressways, National Highways, state highways and Regional Rapid Transit System will be included. Further, the decision to include or omit tehsils lying partly within this 100 km delineation shall be left to the respective state governments,” the ministry said. Union Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri chaired the meeting of NCR Planning Board on Tuesday where the issue came up for discussion. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who attended the meeting, had earlier raised the issue of how a large portion of his state has come under the NCR. The state had urged the NCRPB to decrease its area. The NCR includes 14 out of 22 districts of Haryana and nearly 46% of the region falls in the state. “The NCR area has increased from 30,242 sq km in 2001 to 55,083 sq km now. Earlier, when we had any reservation about adding more areas the states would ask why we were against expansion of the region. Originally, the NCR covered areas falling within 100 km radius. Though the current consensus is a proposed one, it’s in the right direction. But delineation cannot be based on just a boundary put on paper, but we have to consider the administrative boundaries of districts or tehsil,” said an official, who did not wish to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/proposed-delineation-may-bring-down-the-total-area-under-ncr/articleshow/86978058.cms||Dipak K Dash

Hitendra, a resident of Karawada gram panchayat in Kherwara division, was working in Russia. The information about his death was given to the Pahada police station in Kherwara by the Russian embassy on August 17. Since then, the family members have been seeking help from the district administration, the embassy and the politicians to bring back his body. His mother, wife and children are desperately waiting for the body to arrive. They have tried their best and approached all possible sources but nothing has worked out. Hitendra had gone to work in Russia through an agent from Jaipur, who is currently in Russia.According to Babulal, uncle of Hitendra, in the latest development, the embassy has informed them that the Russian police have decided to carry out the burial in Russia. This is against the family’s wish, said Babulal. “Two months have already passed, we want the body to be brought to India so that the cremation can be done in a dignified manner,” he said. He has even accused the agent of hiding the facts about Hitendra’s death from the relatives. “After informing about the death, the agent has switched off the phone. The Russian embassy is not providing any concrete details about the death of my nephew,” said Babulal.MP Arjun Meena said, “We are trying our best to bring back the body and are in regular touch with the embassy and MEA.” The documents of the deceased have been sent to the ministry, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-months-on-mans-kin-await-body-from-russia/articleshow/86950576.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh govt ignoring coal crisis, says Kamal Nath||BHOPAL: State Congress chief Kamal Nath said on Monday that those in the know of things are themselves admitting that thermal powers in the country have just four days of coal stock left and at the same time, they are denying there is any coal crisis or power crisis in the country. He said that they should clarify the minimum stock of coal a thermal power station should have and the stock of coal they used to have in the past. They are attributing shortage of coal to increase in the prices of coal in the international market, increase in the demand of electricity and waterlogging in the coal mines but they are not admitting that the government didn't take steps to rectify the situation in time. These developments have not happened all of a sudden and if the government knew about the impending coal crisis, why didn't it take steps to avert the crisis. In fact, it's "inertness" of the government that has led to coal crisis, he said. The former chief minister expressed surprise that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan didn't respond to his queries on coal crisis and unscheduled loadshedding in the state despite his posers not once but twice. People who are responding to questions on coal crisis and loadshedding, don't know anything about power production, he said. The state government is still "lying" that there is no coal crisis in the state and there is no situation of power cuts, but the "fact" is that in thermal powers of the state, coal stock of 2 to 4 days is left, which is indicative of a deep power crisis ahead. Several units of the thermal power stations have stopped because of coal crisis, leading to power production reducing by half. He further said that chief ministers of several states are appealing to the Prime Minister for sufficient supply of coal, but chief minister of Madhya Pradesh has not woken up to the situation till now and is busy in electioneering for BJP candidates in the by-polls due in the state. He urged the chief minister to take note of the coal crisis and impending power crisis as festive season is on and people of the state are also worried over media reports of an impending power crisis in the state. Nath said that the chief minister should take up the matter with the central government and take all the steps possible to restore normal supply of coal so that power production in keeping with the demand could be ensured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-govt-ignoring-coal-crisis-lying-about-ower-cuts-nath/articleshow/86948286.cms||---

Farmers shouted anti-BJP slogans, waved black flags at BJP leaders and even tried to jam the national highway. Heavy police force was called to pacify the agitated farmers. The farmers showed black flags to the local BJP legislator Rajkumar Thukral, BJP district president Shiv Arora and municipal corporation mayor Rampal Singh, who had arrived to be part of the event. BKU district president Saheb Singh Sekhon said that farmers from across the country have been protesting against the contentious laws for more than 11 months, but the government is not concerned at all. "Recently, we lost four fellow farmers in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, where the son of a BJP leader mowed them down brutally by his car. The community is fighting for its rights, but BJP is busy organising events like this. We will not tolerate such disrespect and arrogance and are therefore protesting the swearing-in ceremony".

According to the department, it is a policy matter, which is to be decided upon by the cabinet for MCs across the state.

The youth had returned to the city some days ago and was earning his livelihood by riding a taxi bike. Cops suspect the youth may have been shot dead due to some old rivalry. According to police, the blood-stained body of a youth was found near Khatiyon Ki Dhani near Homeopathy University in Sanganer Sadar area. “The youth had sustained bullet injuries to his head. It appears that he was shot point blank. Our patrol team went to the spot during the early hours on Monday and took stock of the situation,” said a senior officer of Sanganer Sadar police station area. The deceased has been identified as Rinku Kumar Meena. “He was a native of Hingota village of Mandawar tehsil in Dausa district,” said a senior officer. Dausa man’s murder not for gain: Cops“He was riding a taxi bike and living in a rented place near Gandhi Nagar railway station area. He had not visited his rented accommodation for the past 20 to 25 days,” said the officer. When the family of the deceased was contacted, they said that he had gone to Jaipur three days ago. “His mobile phone, wallet and ID were intact and showed that the murder was not for gain. The reason behind the murder could be some rivalry in his village or in Jaipur,” said an officer. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said, “We have some concrete clues on the whereabouts of assailants and will solve the murder. I can tell you that the police took swift action. We will soon solve the case, make arrests and share the reasons of murder.” In the afternoon, the body was handed over to his relatives after the post-mortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dausa-man-providing-taxi-bike-service-shot-dead-in-sanganer-sadar/articleshow/86952390.cms||---

Even as more than 10,000 village panchayats go to polls in December this year, the ruling BJP is looking to increase the number of village panchayats by about 1,500. While urban areas are BJP strongholds, opposition Congress made the most political gains in rural areas in the past. Out of 14,300 village panchayats covering over 18,000 villages, elections for around 10,300 are scheduled in December 2021. Although village panchayat elections are not contested on party symbols, the forthcoming elections will clearly indicate the mood of rural voters ahead of the assembly election. A key source close to the development informed, “The panchayat & rural development department has completed all formalities like passing of resolutions by large panchayats for the formation of new panchayats and approval of district authorities and the development commissioner to form new panchayats. After the approval from minister Brijesh Merja, a notification to form around 1,500 new village panchayats will be issued.” “Most of the proposed new village panchayats are in 93 tribal talukas, as due to scattered population, these villages face many development challenges. The newly formed bodies will begin getting government grants. On an average, a village gets between Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 crore grant every year,” sources informed. A key source claimed, “Announcement of these rural areas as new village panchayats mostly in tribal areas is likely to help the BJP in upcoming village panchayat elections as well as the upcoming assembly elections scheduled in December 2022.” Although village panchayat elections are not fought on party symbols, both BJP and Congress have in the past village panchayat elections, have claimed victory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-to-notify-1500-new-panchayats/articleshow/86950623.cms||Kapil Dave

Since Sooraj’s arrest, his house Sree Soorya, is remaining locked from inside with the family members very rarely appearing in the open. There was no response from them when media persons repeatedly knocked on their doors. Earlier, Sooraj’s father, mother and unmarried sister were arrested under charges of domestic violence and remanded in judicial custody. Though they managed to get bail, the three of them have shut themselves inside the house. Police had dug out part of Uthra’s gold jewellery from Sooraj’s house premises. In this connection, police had charged the family members too as co-accused. Their earlier stance was that police were beating up their son to own up the responsibility of Uthra’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/soorajs-family-goes-incommunicado/articleshow/86948322.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Rabindra Sangeet singer Swapan Gupta loses battle with cancer||KOLKATA: Swapan Gupta, one of the senior-most Rabindra Sangeet exponents of contemporary times, passed away on Monday morning. He was suffering from cancer and undergoing treatment for a long time. On Monday, he suffered a major heart attack and succumbed to it at 7.30am. He was 75. Gupta’s wife Tapati is a renowned teacher of English and taught at Presidency University and Calcutta University. Once at the Saraswati Puja cultural programme in 1965 at Narendrapur, he was asked to sing a few Tagore songs till Debabrata Biswas arrived.  In the midst of his rendition, Biswas walked in and loved the way Gupta sang. He asked Gupta to sing some of his songs. Biswas was so overwhelmed when Gupta sang “Akash Bhora Surjya Tara” that he asked him to become his student. Rabindra Sangeet critic Swapan Shome said, “Gupta learnt Tagore songs from George Biswas for 10 long years.”  Being visually impaired did not affect his training. “He was especially loved because people wanted him to continue Debabrata Biswas’s tradition,” said singer Pranati Tagore.  Gupta’s first record came out in 1968 under the guidance of Maya Sen. He became a sensation with rendition of songs like, “Lukale bolei khunje bahir kora” and “Amay thakte de na apon mone”. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee in her condolence message said, his style of singing mesmerised all for years. He was conferred Sangeet Mahasamman by the state government in 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rabindra-sangeet-singer-swapan-gupta-loses-battle-with-cancer/articleshow/86948351.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 50% eligible population in 6 districts vaccinated||AHMEDABAD: The urban-rural divide is apparent when it comes to Covid-19 vaccination in Gujarat. While 89% of the eligible population has been administered the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in the state, the rate is as high as 97% for the eight municipal corporations. However, this rate dips to 85% for the rest of the state (other than the municipal corporation areas). Similarly, against 52% eligible population getting both the doses in eight cities, the number in case of the 33 districts was 41.5%.  Six districts — Ahmedabad, Mahisagar, Tapi, Vadodara, Valsad and Dahod — have 90% or more Covdi-19 vaccine coverage in case of the first dose. The number of districts with over 50% coverage of both the doses is also six — Ahmedabad, Aravalli, Mahisagar, Narmada, Navsari and Vadodara. The figures exclude the municipal corporation areas. “Vaccination currently is the only way through which we can bring down the number of daily cases and reduce the severity. The aggressive vaccination has yielded results in urban areas such as Ahmedabad and Surat which once recorded very high daily cases,” said a city-based public health expert. Experts, however, stressed on creating awareness about the importance of vaccination rather than just increasing the number to achieve the target. “Some malpractices have also come to the fore as the officials are also under stress to complete the vaccination target. But the focus must be on effective communication and public participation,” said the expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/50-eligible-population-in-6-districts-vaccinated/articleshow/86950674.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Ahmedabad||Power generation in Gujarat drops in September||AHMEDABAD: Coal-based thermal power plants across Gujarat struggled to produce enough power due to the paucity of coal and spiralling prices of imported coal. The power generation at these plants in September declined to one third of the power produced in the same month last year. What’s more, the coal-fired power plants — both public and private sectors — in the state could produce only 30.75% of the electricity that was targeted to be produced in September this year. The coal-fuelled power plants’ actual production stood at 2,355.44 GWh (gigawatt hours) in September, which is 66% less than 6,965.98 GWh produced in September2020, shows the Central Electricity Authority (CEA)’s tentative monthly generation report for September. In fact, the production in the preceding months was also higher than September this year. The actual production was recorded at 4,195.30 GWh in August, 4,566.15GWh in July and 4,091.41 GWh in June. Gujarat’s total installed capacity for coal-based power generation is 16,092 MW. The coal-fired plants in the state produced 30.75% of the 7,660 GWh targeted to be generated in September 2021. This ratio was higher at 56.11%, 61.06% and 57.21%in August, July and June respectively. According to the CEA generation report, private sector power plants, including those run on imported coal by Tata Group, Adani Group and Essar Group, generated 1,128.51GWh in September as against 5,877.34 GWh in the same month last year. Private power plants production was 19.42% of the planned generation of 5,811 GWh for September 2021. However, the state government run power plants’ actual generation was registered at 1,226.93GWh in September as compared to 1,088 GWh in the corresponding month last year. These plants produced 66.36% of the planned generation for the month. High prices of imported coal and problems pertaining to its availability hindered power production at the plants operated by the private sector. Apart from high prices, other factors also adversely affected the power generation at imported coal-based power plants. Power generation at state-run power plants got impacted as there was a paucity of coal. Secondly, the domestic coal that was supplied to these plants was wet and it was mixed with clay because of flooding in coal mines following heavy rains. As a result, the desired plant load factor or PLF (a measure of output of a power plant) could not be achieved, said sources close to the development. “There have been deliberations going on with imported coal-based power producers to ease out the situation. All efforts are being made by GUVNL and Gujarat government to ensure that these plants are brought to the grid again as soon as possible,” said Shahmeena Husain, managing director of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL), the apex power utility in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/power-generation-in-gujarat-drops-in-sept/articleshow/86975960.cms||Kalpesh Damor

Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) now plans talks with district authorities to put a cap on visitors’ at monuments report overcrowding. “The visit on Sunday was part of religious tourism. There were few visitors to Karla caves as most headed to Ekvira Devi Temple. Of the nearly 1.5 lakh people who visited the temple on Sunday, most were not wearing masks, and there was no social distancing,” a senior ASI official said. The official suggested an increase in police vigilance at such locations during festive days. “Nearly 100 personnel were at the caves on Sunday to manage crowds, but all efforts fell flat. The situation was horrible and it is not known how much of it may have contributed to the spread of Covid,” he said. The official said Karla caves has a relatively smaller area, so the district authorities should imposed a cap the number of people visiting such spots during festivals. Another ASI official said people who visited the temple on Sunday were there to pay homage to the goddess because of Navaratra festival. “The temple premises, right from the gate till the parking lot, was packed. Crowds persisted for 12 hours on Sunday, and started thinning only after 5pm,” he said. Only 600 tickets were sold for Karla caves on Sunday, but thousands entered without tickets, another official said, adding, “There was also no space at the ticket counter due to the those thronging the spot.” Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “We must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.

An SDMC official said the policy was earlier approved by the lieutenant governor. “With the notification of the policy, we are allowed to implement it on the ground with immediate effect,” said the senior official. An association of ayurvedic and spa centres has filed a petition in Delhi High Court against the Delhi government’s guidelines banning the cross-gender massage. “Since the court has not stayed the guidelines, we are allowed to notify as well as implement them with immediate effect. The matter is still sub judice,” said the official. The guidelines state that the facilities for men and women will be in different sections and massage centres could remain open only between 9am and 9pm. Also, police verification of an owner/spa manager will be mandatory before issuing the licence while there will also be a mandatory provision for production of ID cards of all customers. All such centres have been directed to strictly adhere to all instructions for grant/renewal of these activities under the jurisdiction of SDMC. “Permission will be granted in areas coming under the category of commercial, local commercial, notified commercial and mixed-land use. New spa/massage centres will not be allowed in residential areas,” said the official. According to the technical guidelines, the minimum floor area should be 900 square feet and the minimum height should be 9 or 8 feet for airconditioned premises. The minimum area to put up a masseur table must be 50 square feet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmcs-licence-policy-for-spa-centres-bars-cross-gender-massage/articleshow/86950667.cms||---

The high court’s stance on government sanction was reiterated by Justice Mary Joseph after considering two petitions by sub inspector D Rajagopal and constables Manirajan, Baby, and Sharafudeen of Ezhukone police station, who were accused of torturing an accused in custody, including burning his tongue with a lighted cigarette. As per Section 197 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), no government official can be prosecuted for any offence alleged to have been committed while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of official duty without obtaining prior sanction from the government. In the judgment, the high court said Section197 is not intended to safeguard illegal acts and ruled that sanction from the government is not required to prosecute police officers who engage in police brutality as such acts are not related in any manner to discharge of their official duties. The sanction for prosecution was intended to save a public servant acting in bonafide and duly exercising the authority recognized by law, without exceeding jurisdictional limits, the court added. Accused policemen cannot take advantage of Section 197 after committing mischievous acts under the guise of lawful discharge of official duties, the court said. An incident occurring in a police station will not legalize it if the power is exercised by policemen for illegal gain, the court said while upholding a trial court’s decision to convict the petitioners even without prosecution sanction from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-govt-nod-not-required-for-trial/articleshow/86948353.cms||---

Present on the occasion were West Bengal Heritage Commission Suvaprasanna, heritage architect Partha Ranjan Das, members of Dutt’s family, theatre worker Soumitra Mitra, members of WBHC including Sujata Sen and members of Facebook’s Purono Kolkatar Golpo group that chronicles Kolkata of yore. Firhad Hakim and Suvaprasanna at the Maniktala Christian Cemetery on Monday To mark the occasion, Suvaprasanna designed a laminated poster about the Dutt sisters that was distributed among those present on the occasion.“Toru Dutt, who is regarded as India’s Keats and died prematurely at the age of 21, was the first Indian to have translated works of 65 great poets from French to English. The Dutt sisters were immensely gifted and I am glad that the plaque has been unveiled,” Suvaprasanna said. Talking about Toru’s exceptional brilliance as an author, author Chinmay Guha, said, “Toru was five years elder to Tagore, 18 years younger to Bankimchandra and 22 years elder to Sarojini Naidu. She, along with Aru, had opened new horizons.” He also recalled how, on a visit to Paris two years ago, a young professor was immediately able to connect to Toru Dutt when he had mentioned about a young poet from Kolkata. Firhad Hakim paid a visit to the enclosure where the Dutts lie buriedOnce the plaque was unveiled, Hakim paid a visit to the enclosure where the Dutts lie buried. The cemetery is currently a picture of neglect, littered with overgrown bushes. The premise was partly cleared for the occasion though a lot more needs to be done. Regular maintenance is a key issue. “After Pujas, I will get the cemetery cleaned,” Hakim told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plaque-unveiled-in-memory-of-toru-aru-dutt/articleshow/86948392.cms||---

Meena, a resident of Mauli Jagran, said she and her two relatives Prabha Devi and Raj Kumari were returning home after some work. When they reached near the petrol pump in Vikas Nagar, two strangers stopped them. “One of them read some mantra and a passerby walking nearby fainted. The two told us they knew magic tricks,” the women alleged. They said they when the man became conscious after they repeated some ‘mantra’. Offering to show them a magic trick, they asked them to keep their gold items and cash in their hand. The three women handed over a pair of gold earrings, a gold locket and Rs 100, 150 and 200. The accused gave them a slip and asked them to bury it in the wooded area in front of them. All three left to bury the slip. When they returned, they found the two and the man who fell unconscious missing.

One method was to map the water quality index (WQI). Can the river support life? How good or safe is the river water for human use? A 15-year-study, from 2005, recorded the WQI of the Sabarmati deteriorating severely all along its length. If 0 was the best number and 1 the worst on the WQI, then the Sabarmati’s score in its final leg after it passed through Ahmedabad and before it met the Arabian Sea varied between 0.45 and 0.7. The study was conducted by a team of researchers from International Water Association (IWA). A team consisting of Anant Patel and Karishma Chitnis measured water parameters at Dharoi dam, Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad, and Rasikapur. “At Rasikapur location, which is in the downstream of Sabarmati river, the WQI value ranged between 0.45 to 0.7, which showed the effect of industrial effluent discharge on final river water quality,” the paper states. “Whereas at upstream points such as the Dharoi dam, the WQI ranged from 0.3 to 0.5, which is an indication of less pollution load on the river compared to downstream.” The Sabarmati flows from Aravalli hill ranges in Rajasthan and meanders across 371km — 48km in Rajasthan and the remaining 323km in Gujarat. At its 51km stage, the river combines with Wakal bank on the left. At the 67km mark, it merges with Sei stream on the right bank and with Harnav at 103km on the left bank. Wakal, Sei, Harnav, Hathmati, and Watrak are small tributaries of the Sabarmati in Gujarat. But to understand the degradation of the river, a team of geographic information system (GIS) experts from three universities examined LANDSAT satellite images from the US Geological Survey to measure the turbidity levels of the Sabarmati, which runs through the heart of Ahmedabad. The study was published in October last year. Turbidity is a way to gauge water’s cloudiness. The experts found that pollution levels dropped by 36% during the lockdown. Maps were acquired for a five-year period: 2015 to 2020. The maps clearly show that the river stretch within the city normally appears deep yellow, red, and green: the signs of heavy pollution. The river turned blue, reflecting the hue of resurrection, during the corona closure. The LANDSAT maps contained colour coded reflectance data. They showed turbidity levels, which result from industrial and domestic sewage discharges, improving by more than 36% in the April-May period last year. Turbidity levels had gone up as high as 19.39 milligram per litre (mg/l) by February that year. In May, they dropped to just 5 mg/l. The river stretch near Sardar Patel Bridge had the highest amount of metal contamination when compared to upstream, suggesting high anthropogenic activities, the research paper said. ‘Anthropogenic’ denotes origin in human activities. The paper was carried in the reputable journal of Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment published by Elsevier. “We noticed that the average suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Sabarmati river water has significantly decreased by about 36.48% when compared with the pre-lockdown period,” the paper had said. “And a drop of 16.79% was observed from the previous year’s average SPM.” The authors of the paper were Mohammad Adil Aman of the department of remote sensing and GIS applications at Aligarh Muslim University; Mohammed Salman of the department of geography at Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi; and Ali Yunus of National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sabarmati-turns-red-then-dead/articleshow/86950724.cms||Paul John
---||Jaipur||Oswal group’s number of factories, products grows in lockstep with family tree||The Partition was painful. For Deshraj Jain, it was no different. Leaving behind his small laundry soap business in Lahore, he landed in Amritsar in 1947. There he tried to rebuild the business and ran it for some years. Somehow it did not work. In the meantime, some of his family members had shifted to Jaipur and Deshraj too relocated. Recalling the early days, Devendra Jain, his eldest son, now 82, says despite the setback, his late father again started the business in a rented shop in Johari Bazaar. He used to make 50-60 kg soaps a day. Oxen carts and rickshaws were used for supply. “The struggle continued till we had our first factory in 1976 in the VKI industrial area. By then I too had joined the business and then other brothers followed me,” said Devendra. With the passage of time, the Oswal group built the business brick by brick. After soaps, they added spice, rice, edible oils, washing powder, toilet cleaner, and tea among others. Today, it makes 35 types of products. The spread of the product portfolio intriguingly mirrored the expanding family tree. “From the roots of Partition to the fruits of joint family, the path is strewn with sacrifice, hard work and trust among the family members,” says Surendra Jain, one of the patriarchs. Over the decades, the family has grown into over 50 members. The number of factories has risen to 16. “Our footprint expanded as we entered new markets in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana. All this has been possible because there is trust among family members and the values of our father,” says Surendra. As the second generation grew older, new kids in the family knocked the door. Two of the older brothers have been spared the rigors of the business. While the eldest brother Devendra oversees a charity school they have set up, Surendra (72) is carrying out the social and family responsibilities for the extended group. Two younger brothers are still helming two big manufacturing units. “When children grow up and are ready to take up responsibilities, it is planned beforehand to give them a new unit or a role,” explains Surendra. Listing the reasons for the success, Surendra says what drives our business is quality, trust and the principle of no credit. “Ours is a no-credit model. We only supply to those who pay upfront. That’s been the practice since the beginning,” he says. The third generation of the family founded “Eight Brothers” in 2013, a joint venture, to expand the joint family business further. Surendra says, “With the ‘Eight Brothers’, they are taking the joint family system further.” He said at the end of every year, after setting aside the required capital for expansion, profits are distributed to individual family members. “While they live in different houses, they gather frequently on various social, family and business occasions,” adds Surendra. Recalling an event when the group faced its worst moments, Devendra says in the 1980s, the retail shop unions wielded power. “They stopped selling our soaps over margins. Then, we decided to enter the retail market and they were humbled,” says Devendra. Today, the group has 55 outlets of its own in different cities. When asked what separates them from the second generation, Saurabh Jain of the third generation, says, “It is risk taking. Our father and uncles would not have taken the risks we took to expand the business.” It’s not that every risk they took paid off. Saurabh says, “Our products like shaving cream and shampoo did not work. Even though the products were good, they did not go the way we wanted. Maybe we did not know the youth would develop a liking for beard,” said Saurabh with a chuckle. But at the same breath Saurabh says the foundation of a sustainable business model has been laid by their father and uncles. “The pillars have been built. We just need to keep adding new floors,” he explains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/oswal-groups-number-of-factories-products-grows-in-lockstep-with-family-tree/articleshow/86952521.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Only citizens who have taken at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine will be allowed to attend such functions. There will also be ‘Jan Anushashan’ curfew from 11pm to 5am, stated fresh Covid guidelines issued by the state home department on Monday. Shopping malls, shops and business establishments can remain open till 10pm. The decision has been taken keeping in view Durga Puja, Navaratri, dandiya and garba festivals. “Only those who have taken at least the first dose of vaccine will be allowed to attend religious functions/events/programmes. They will also have to strictly adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour, including wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and sanitising, etc. Proper ventilation should also be maintained at all the venues,” stated the guidelines issued by principal secretary (home) Abhay Kumar. As with exhibitions and social gatherings, permitted in the earlier order dated September 17, religious programmes can only be held after informing the district administration. In addition to cattle fairs, citizens will be allowed to organise ‘haat bazaars’ following Covid appropriate behaviour. Auto fuel stations, CNG, retail/wholesale outlets of petroleum products and gas will be operational as per the scheduled time. The fresh guidelines came into effect on Monday itself. With the state government allowing only 200 people to attend social gatherings and religious programmes, the organisers will hold dandiya and garba functions in small groups (50-100) in colonies, bylanes, residential localities and roads. Even though there is a steady decline in the number of Covid positive cases in the state, the spread of the infection hasn’t stopped yet, the guidelines warn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nod-to-hold-religious-eventsfrom-6am-to-10pm-in-state/articleshow/86952418.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi is being singled out, minister Imran Hussain writes to Centre||NEW DELHI: Food minister Imran Hussain on Monday wrote to Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Piyush Goyal stating that the capital was being singled out and given discriminatory treatment over ration distribution. The response comes days after the Centre told Delhi government that it wouldn’t allow it to go ahead with doorstep delivery of ration because the scheme went against the National Food Security Act (NFSA) guidelines. “I wonder why Delhi is being singled out and objections are being raised to prevent the implementation of a scheme that is undeniably and irrefutably in public interest and will serve the needs of the downtrodden and marginalised sections of society. Several states like Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana have already rolled out home delivery of ration,” said Hussain. Hussain stressed that the scheme was completely in accordance with the relevant provisions of NFSA. “We request you to withdraw the letter under reply, lest an impression be created that the central government is party to the attempt of the petitioner to obstruct and overreach orders passed by Delhi High Court,” he added. The Centre’s letter was issued to Delhi government on a representation made by Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh (DSRDS) that had approached Delhi High Court seeking a stay on the scheme claiming that it was against NFSA. “Delhi High Court did not accept their grounds and refused to grant a stay. It allowed Delhi government to implement the scheme. In fact, it issued certain directions to Delhi government on the steps that should be taken while implementing the scheme. The court was assured that all directions would be scrupulously followed,” Hussain stated. The minister claimed that DSRDS was attempting to overreach the high court order of September 27 and thereby interfering with the course of administration of justice, which amounted to contempt of court. “It appears that this fact has not been brought to your kind notice and suppressed from you,” added Hussain. Rejecting the charges, DSRDS president Shiv Kumar Garg said, “We are not going against the high court order. The AAP government is misreading the order. There is no provision in NFSA for home delivery of ration. We have already filed a special leave petition against the high court order in Supreme Court.” After the high court passed the order, the AAP government again sent the file pertaining to doorstep delivery of ration to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and appealed to him to approve it so that people of Delhi could get subsidised rations at their doorstep. The scheme has triggered multiple flashpoints between the LG and the elected government since early 2018. The LG has denied his nod citing lack of clearance from the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-is-being-singled-out-hussain-writes-to-centre/articleshow/86950730.cms||AlokKNMishra

Urging all farmer organisations to pass a resolution applauding him for his stand on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, the Shiv Sena said that Varun was the only ‘man’ in the BJP who dared to condemn the assault on farmers not caring about the political price he would have to pay. An editorial headlined ‘Congratulations Varun Gandhi’ in Saamana, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, said,“Varun and his mother, Maneka Gandhi, were removed from the party’s national executive and punished. He supported the farmers openly and demanded strict action against those who crushed them. He did not say anything wrong.Varun Gandhi spoke with courage.” The editorial also hit out at the BJP. “No one is willing to listen to farmers. Prime Minister Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and the country’s Agriculture Minister have not even condemned the incident. At least the Agriculture Minister should have visited Lakhimpur-Kheri. But he didn’t go, and, instead, stopped those who wanted to go there. How many BJP leaders have condemned the killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri? BJP MP Varun Gandhi is the only rare instance,” the editorial said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-praises-varun-gandhi-for-supporting-farmers-cause/articleshow/86952420.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Chandigarh||Medical institutes not apt authority to certify fitness standards for recruiting forces: Punjab and Haryana HC||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that medical institutes like Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, are not the appropriate authority to certify standards required to be observed for medical examination for the armed forces. HC was of the view that the medical examination by such institutes cannot be taken into consideration for the forces. Justice Rajbir Sehrawat passed these orders while dismissing a plea filed by a Navy aspirant. The petitioner, Kuldeep Singh, had challenged the order dated May 4, passed by the Navy authorities though he was declared medically unfit for enrolment in the force. The petitioner had mainly argued that he was also examined by PGIMS, Rohtak, and that the institution has not found the problem as being reported by the Navy medical authorities. “The medical examination by PGIMS, Rohtak, is of no relevance qua the requirements of the recruiting force. Hence, the same cannot be taken into consideration,” the judge held while dismissing the plea. The petitioner had approached the HC seeking directions for re-examination by some independent medical board. His main emphasis was that since he got himself examined from PGIMS, Rohtak, and Medical Centre, Agroha, in which no such disease as pointed out by Navy authorities was reported. He had sought directions to give him some time to file an appeal against his rejection by the Navy authorities or to re-examine him by some independent medical board. Responding to the petition, the Navy authorities informed the HC that the petitioner was examined by the graded specialist (ENT) and classified specialist (dermatology). On such examination, he was found to be fit qua his problem of ‘left tympanic membrane perforation (healed)’. However, the Appeal Medical Board found the petitioner on account of another problem — ‘keloid tendency (forearms)/hypertrophic scars’ and ‘hypopigmentation over hands/verruca valgaris’. The said problem has been graded as a reason for unfitness according to the standards of medical examination. After hearing all the parties, the HC held that the petitioner could not be enrolled in the force, and hence, has been rightly declared to be medically unfit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/medical-institutes-not-apt-authority-to-certify-fitness-standards-for-recruiting-forces-hc/articleshow/86950712.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Ahmedabad||Coal depleted, move industries to gas: PIL||Ahmedabad: A petitioner, who has sought Gujarat high court’s directions to the government to shit all industries from the use of coal to gas to reduce air pollution, suggested to the court on Tuesday that the need to shift to gas is even greater nowadays looking at the looming shortage of coal and imminent blackouts. In his affidavit, petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal asserted, by citing news reports on coal shortage and possible blackouts, that “If adequate supply is not secured immediately, it is likely to lead to widespread blackouts. This is a fit case for the court to direct use of PNG/CNG in all industrial units.” He further argued that shifting to gas is preferred because burning of coal causes air pollution. PNG/CNG are cleaner fuels and lead to little or no pollution. Several states have mandated the use of gas instead of coal. The governments have a duty to provide clean air and under provisions of the Air Act, the authorities have powers to mandate the use of gas. Last week, in response to the PIL, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had submitted that it has had a plan in place since 2017 to reduce air pollution, which is at its worst in Gujarat’s major cities and various industrial clusters. The board said if the plan, as is implemented, will yield results and pollution can be cut by 35%-50% by 2025-26. In response, the petitioner submitted that the authorities have failed to take adequate steps to control air pollution in the state. GPCB does not address the central issue of the widespread use of coal which causes increased air pollution and is silent on shifting to gas. The petitioner said the authorities are silent because there has been no step taken to reduce coal use and switch to cleaner fuels like gas. The state authorities sought time to respond , and the HC posted a further hearing for Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/coal-depleted-move-industries-to-gas-pil/articleshow/86975952.cms||---

The newly appointed Gujarat Congress in-charge, Raghu Sharma, who is the health minister in the Rajasthan government, led the silent protest. It was organized by the party outside the Mahatma Gandhi-founded Kochrab Ashram in Paldi. Sharma also alleged the misuse of EVMs by the BJP in Gujarat and elsewhere. Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda; the leader of the opposition in the assembly, Paresh Dhanani; and former state chiefs of the Congress, Bharatsinh Solanki and Arjun Modhwadia took part in the three-hour protest with the party’s workers. They wore black masks and held banners demanding justice for the farmers. “Since Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra’s son is involved in the killing, we cannot expect a free and fair probe,” said Sharma. “Mishra must resign from his post. We demand that the probe be handed over to a special investigation team under the direct supervision of a Supreme Court judge.” When asked about the BJP’s growth in Gujarat and across India, Sharma said, “The BJP’s growth started only after the use of EVMs in all the elections began.” He added: “There is need to adopt manual voting as is the case in the US to ensure free and fair elections.” Four farmers, two BJP workers, a driver and a journalist were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. The chain of violent events began after an SUV mowed down some farmers protesting against the Centre’s three agri-marketing laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-cong-seeks-sc-watched-probe/articleshow/86950700.cms||---

He said to implement the digital system, a committee be constituted so that the ongoing development works in the cities of the state can be digitally monitored. Vij was presiding over the review meeting of the officers of ULB department. He said a transparent plan should be formulated for the ongoing developmental works in the cities of the state and random checking of development works should also be done. He said technology should also be fully utilised under the scheme to be made so that the services of municipal bodies can be made available to the people sitting at home. He further added that a time limit should be fixed for all the ongoing developmental works related to the ULB department and if any contractor does not complete the work within the stipulated time, then action should be taken against him by imposing penalty. Similarly, there should be a third party investigation into the developmental works being carried out, wherein technical experts should also be involved, he added. Vij also said the contractors engaged in cleaning work should be checked to manage the work in the cities efficiently. Similarly, back-up teams for cleaning and lighting should be made according to each city and town so that the works of local bodies can be effectively dealt with. While giving instructions to the officers, Vij said the Swachh App should also be handled in an effective manner. The ULB minister also said a website should be developed to monitor the ongoing projects. He suggested a system should be prepared for registering the grievances of the people. Reacting to it, the officers said a portal called Nagar Darshan is being built for people to register their grievances. Vij also directed the officers to make proper use of the existing infrastructure to increase the income of the department.

---||Kolkata||Times Sharod Srestho chooses best among equals as pandals, idols, lights stun visitors||Kolkata: Durga Puja, the mother of all festivals in Bengal, turns the city into a fairy land, with its grandeur and pomp. A sea of people taking over the roads, innovative pandals—some depicting current affairs and some bringing back tradition—and the magnificent illumination make the Pujas in Kolkata unforgettable. What adds to the spirit is Times Sharod Srestho, which judges baroari or community Pujas across Kolkata registered with The Times of India. The aim is to recognize the tremendous efforts put in by the organizations. Though Calcutta High Court has barred the entry of visitors inside pandals, stating that last year’s 10m restrictions will be in force this time too, pandal-hoppers seem to be happy to catch a glimpse of the decorations and idols from afar. To help them out, the Times Sharod Srestho verdict on the best Pujas is here. The competition for the Pujas across north and south Kolkata were in various categories, such as Best Pujo, Best Idol, Best Pandal, Best Innovation and Safe Pujo. The Best Innovation honour went to Santoshpur Avenue, while the Best Idol award was bestowed on Chetla Agroni. Behala Barisha Club won the prize for Best Pujo and Suruchi Sangha Best Pandal. The Safe Pujo award went to five community Pujas—Tala Pratyay, Naktala Udayan Sangha, Beleghata 33 Palli, North Tridhara and Kashi Bose lane. While the initial rounds of judging were carried out by art college students, a panel of celebrity judges visited the shortlisted Pujas on Sunday, October 12. Judging the Pujas were actresses Tanusree Chakraborty, Sauraseni Maitra, Swastika Dutta, chief public prosecutor Tamal Mukherjee, CEO-Eastern Region, Apollo Multispeciality Hospitals Rana Dasgupta, who was accompanied by his wife Karabi, VP, Apollo Multispeciality Hospitals Somnath Bhattacharya, who also went with his wife Aditi, regional manager, operations (East), Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ayan Sarkar, regional business manager, housing loan (East), Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Rishu Kumar and senior executive officer of Indian Chamber of Commerce Rajat Jana. “No other festival comes close to the grandeur of Durga Puja in Kolkata. I am proud to be a part of this,” Dasgupta said. A resident of Jamshedpur, it is Sarkar’s first Puja in Kolkata. He said, “I am already floored by what I have seen till now. Puja in Kolkata is indeed unparalleled.” Times Sharod Srestho 2021 was presented by Apollo Multispeciality Hospitals. The banking partner was Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, while associate sponsors were ICC and mjunction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/times-sharod-srestho-chooses-best-among-equals-as-pandals-idols-lights-stun-visitors/articleshow/86948517.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Colleague sacked, NHM contractual staff go on strike||Ranchi: Over 180 contractual staff working at the state unit of National Health Mission (NHM) went on an indefinite strike over abrupt termination of one of their colleagues and alleged harassment by senior officials. They also demanded implementation of HR policy with immediate effect. Senior officials of NHM, however, said the termination is linked to financial irregularity by the contractual staff. Work at the NHM headquarters came to a grinding halt after more than 180 employees who are working at state headquarters under different health department cells went on strike soon after offices opened on Monday. The reason behind the strike was sudden termination of state programme manager Jwala Prasad on charges of financial irregularity. The protesting contractual workers alleged that Prasad was sacked on false charges. “We have been working non-stop for the past two years without holidays or regular pay as we were asked to do so during the pandemic and this is what we get in return. The man who was fired didn’t toe the line of senior officials and that is why they have removed him,” said a senior consultant on condition of anonymity. The employees wrote a letter to MD NHM requesting him to revoke Prasad’s termination and also demanded that nobody else should be removed in this manner. Prasad said: “I have been made a scapegoat for reasons unknown. Recently I had forwarded a proposal of community training programme on Covid-19 on the directions of additional mission director Vidyanand Sharma Pankaj. Pankaj had directed me to propose a name of a NGO and it was sent to MD NHM for approval. I didn’t recommend anyone but they sacked me saying my proposal smells of financial irregularity. If the proposal hasn’t been accepted, where is the irregularity?” NHM mission director Bhuvnesh Pratap Singh said the employee whose job was terminated was involved in financial irregularity worth Rs 5.5 lakh. However on being asked about the proposal which was never accepted, he refused to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/colleague-sacked-nhm-contractual-staff-go-on-strike/articleshow/86949132.cms||---
---||Ranchi||CTVS department in RIMS completes 100 open heart surgeries||Ranchi: Vikash Kumar Rai, a native of Jamui district, got a fresh lease of life after doctors of Cardio Thoracic Vascular Surgery (CTVS) department successfully conducted an open heart surgery on him. Rai who is recovering and is expected to be discharged in a week also became the 100th patient of the department to have undergone open heart surgery in last 16 months. As CTVS department successfully completed 100 cases last week, RIMS management along with doctors and staff celebrated the event and spoke about the journey which started almost a decade back in 2012. Talking to TOI, cardiac surgeon and head of CTVS department at RIMS, Dr Anshul Kumar said: “We have come a long way from not being able to perform a single open heart surgery for the first seven years after the inception of the department. We are working on half pace and once provided with better manpower we will be able to double the numbers.” According to RIMS officials, CTVS was started in 2012 but many doctors who had joined the department left the institute due to infrastructural shortcoming. In 2017, Dr Anshul and Dr Rakesh Choudhary joined as a faculty after which operation theatre was commissioned in October 2018 which opened the doors for vascular surgeries in the department. However, the first open heart surgery was conducted in February 2019 when doctors of CTVS along with assistance of two experts from PGI Chandigarh conducted the first open heart surgery. Recounting the first surgery, Dr Kumar said: “Haseeba Biwi, a 50-year-old woman from Purulia, was our first open heart cardic case at RIMS. She still comes for her follow-up and is healthy.” The super speciality department also has helped many poor patients who couldn’t afford to go for open heart surgery which is a costly affair in private hospitals as 90% of patients were provided the treatment under Pradhan Mantri-Jan Arogya Yojna (PM-JAY) Ayushman Bharat scheme for free of cost. Apart from that many who weren’t covered under the central health insurance scheme were provided free treatment by RIMS administration’s free approval plan. “Around 90 out of 100 surgeries we have done has been conducted under Ayushman Bharat scheme which costs over Rs 3 lakh at a private hospital. We have also treated patients who haven’t been covered under Ayushman and after administrative approval they can get their treatment for free as treatment upto Rs 1 Lakh can be provided for such patients at RIMS and out costing is about Rs 70,000,” said Dr Kumar. Umesh Rai, father of Vikash Kumar Rai, said: “I was left disheartened after doctors of IGIMS Patna refused to perform a surgery on my son so I came here. My son is recovering well and the doctors say that he will be discharged in a week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ctvs-department-in-rims-completes-100-open-heart-surgeries/articleshow/86949215.cms||Gaurav Pandey
