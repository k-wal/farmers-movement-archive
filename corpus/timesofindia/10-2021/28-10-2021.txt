---||India||SC cannot be stymied by failure of witnesses to appear: Tharoor on Pegasus order||NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday said the Supreme Court cannot be stymied by witnesses' failure to appear or members refusing to sign attendance register -- the means by which -- the Congress MP alleged the parliamentary panel on IT was thwarted from looking into the Pegasus issue. The remarks by the chairperson of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology came after the Supreme Court appointed a three-member panel of cyber experts to probe the alleged use of Pegasus spyware for surveillance of certain people in India. "Supreme Court orders inquiry into GoI's (Government of India's) use of Pegasus spyware. Just as well the SC cannot be stymied by the failure of witnesses to appear when summoned, or members refusing to sign the attendance register -- the means by which the Parl Cmt was thwarted," Tharoor tweeted. The Tharoor-headed IT panel was to hold a meeting on July 28 during which several issues including the Pegasus snooping allegations were expected to be discussed. It had also summoned officials from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Communications (Department of Telecommunications) on the subject "Citizens data security and privacy". However, the meeting could not take place as the BJP members of the panel did not sign the attendance register, even though they were present in the meeting room, leading to a lack of quorum. E-mail communications were received by the committee branch of the secretariat on July 28 afternoon from the three ministries/department that their representatives would not be able to appear before the committee due to Parliament-related work. Tharoor had written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to take action over ministry officials not attending the panel meeting. In a significant verdict over the issue of protecting citizens' right to privacy, a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana asserted that in a democratic country governed by the rule of law, indiscriminate spying on individuals cannot be allowed except with sufficient statutory safeguards by following the procedure established by law under the Constitution. Stating that it was compelled to take up the cause to determine the truth and get to the bottom of the spying allegations, the SC said the entire citizenry is affected by these charges due to the "potential chilling effect", lamenting that no clear stand was taken by the Centre regarding actions taken by it over the Pegasus row.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-cannot-be-stymied-by-failure-of-witnesses-to-appear-tharoor-on-pegasus-order/articleshow/87318468.cms||---

The arrested accused are Arvind Singh alias Guddu Singh (50) and his brother Jitendra Singh (48). The village falls in Jitna police outpost under Ghorasahan police station area. A Special investigation team in leadership of Sikrahna SDPO Rajesh Kumar had also been formed for arrest of all accused in this shocking murder. As per police, Puja used to frequently call concerned outpost in-charge apprehending threat to life from her parents. More than 15 persons including Puja’s father Manoj Singh alias Manoranjan Singh, an ex-serviceman, had barged inside Avanish’s house by breaking a mud wall at around 6.30pm on Monday. Police said Puja has made her 12 family members including father and uncles Arvind and Jitendra and at least seven other unknown persons accused of killing her husband. As per police, Avanish had locked himself inside a room but Puja's family members dragged him out after breaking door and shot him twice in head from behind. Jitna outpost in-charge Anil Kumar said that Puja’s father shot Avanish dead using his licenced pistol. He said they also first attempted to strangulate Puja and kidnap her but failed. Her family had even tried to take away the couple’s eight-month-old girl but she was thrown below a bed amid the scuffles, as per Kumar. Kumar said Puja’s father-in-law Premchand Singh and his wife were brutally assaulted with iron rods and wooden sticks after they killed Avanish. “Three empty cartridges were recovered from spot. Yes, this is true that Puja uad informed us on a few occasions that she apprehends threats from her family members to which police were also sent at her home,” he said. He said that the murder was fallout of anger as Avanish and Puja performed love marriage in a court in Delhi in 2018 after eloping from Motihari. “Puja’s family had not accepted her marriage even though the youth belonged to their caste. The couple used to live in Delhi. But Avanish lost his private job from pandemic after which they returned village on July 5 this year,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-two-arrested-sit-formed-in-motihari-youths-murder-for-solemnising-love-marriage/articleshow/87317509.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Srinagar||Some day POK will also join this part of Kashmir: Top IAF officer||SRINAGAR: The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Air Command, Air Marshal Amit Dev, expressed his hope on Wednesday that some day India would have the whole of Kashmir. He was careful to clarify that India has no plan at the moment to capture Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Speaking at Rangreth, in Budgam district, on the 75th anniversary of the landing of Indian troops in Kashmir, Air Marshal Dev also said people in PoK were "not being treated fairly by Pakistan". "I am sure that some day PoK will also join this part of Kashmir," he said. "Kashmir is one, a nation is one. People on both sides have common attachments. History is witness that nations come together. God willing, it will always be there…," he said. He recalled that the exercise carried out by the Indian Air Force and Army on October 27 in 1947 resulted in freedom for this part of Kashmir. J&K lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha said Pakistan had spread lies for the past 75 years. "There is a perception that Kabalis tried to invade Kashmir in 1947 but the fact is that they were the Pakistani Army men in the guise of Kabalis," the L-G said while addressing a function at the Old Airport, Rangreth, on Srinagar’s outskirts. He said that the Army gave a befitting reply to Pakistani invaders on October 26, 1947. Indian troops had landed in Kashmir on October 27, 1947, a day after the then maharaja, Hari Singh, had signed the instrument of accession with India. Air Marshal Dev said the IAF faces many challenges but the basic one is of technology. Talking about new technology, like drones crossing into India with weapons, he said, "We have equipment against it and it has been deployed here as well. We are now increasing deployment with further procurements. The drone challenge is a small challenge and we will be able to deal with that challenge as and when it comes."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/srinagar/western-air-command-chief-hopes-one-day-india-will-have-whole-of-kashmir/articleshow/87319057.cms||M Saleem Pandit

In a virtual media interaction on Wednesday evening, Chari said that this mission among other things will help in testing technologies at the space station for Nasa’s mission to the moon called Artemis. On Thursday, the crew will be going through a complete dress rehearsal of the launch. Chari, with a crew of three, will command the SpaceX Crew-3 mission to the International Space Station which will lift off from launch pad 39A at Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre on October 31 at 11.51am (IST). On December 10, 2020, Chari was among the eight chosen for the moon mission. This means that there is every chance that the Indian-American will have his footprint on the lunar surface. Nasa hopes to land a coloured astronaut and the first woman on the south pole region of the moon in 2024, according to current plans. Called exploration technologies, Chari said among the aspects that will be tested for the moon shot at the space station will be those linked to life support systems. “We will be able to troubleshoot problems nearer earth before flying to the moon,’’ Chari said, adding: “We are super excited to be actually sitting here (crew quarters at the Kennedy Space Centre), just a few miles away from the rocket we’ll get to ride on.’’ He said that his crew had an opportunity to interact with the Inspiration4 team. Inspiration4 was the world’s first private mission to orbit which was launched on September 16 2021 by SpaceX. “Though it was a private mission, we benefited from their experience. Both ways it proved beneficial,” Chari added. Earlier, while talking to the media after the crew arrived at the Kennedy Space Centre on Tuesday, Chari lauded the partnership between government and private agencies which is proving beneficial to space missions. Chari said: “Be it cargo or Inspiration4, more data is always good which can make space flight safer and better. In terms of fixes and risk mitigation, thousands of people have been working to make sure that we are safe. We have complete confidence in the system.’’ With regards to science on this mission, he said his interest is environmental systems, increasing efficiency to recycle water and scrubbing carbon dioxide.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spacex-crew-3-mission-to-help-test-space-tech-raja-chari/articleshow/87319309.cms||---

The searches were held at 17 locations in Anantnag, Kulgam, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Budgam, Kishtwar and Jammu districts of J&K, an agency spokesperson said. The NIA had registered a case on February 5 in connection with separatist and secessionist activities of the JeI. “The members of the organisation have been collecting funds domestically and abroad, which are being used for violent and secessionist activities,” the spokesperson added. “JeI has also been motivating impressionable youth of Kashmir and recruiting new members (Rukuns) in J&K to participate in disruptive secessionist activities.” The agency team conducted searches at the premises of office bearers and members of JeI. During the searches various incriminating documents and electronic devices were seized from the premises of the suspects, officials said. Sources said that the house of one Mohammad Akhram Baba in Devsar and one Shaban Shah in Babapora were raided among several other locations. Mohammad Akhram (69) is a resident of Devsar and a retired government employee and was allegedly affiliated with the JeI. The NIA also carried out raids in the houses of Ghulam Mohammad Raina (75) and Ghulam Mohammad Wani (75) in Gundpora and Arin villages of Bandipora respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jamaat-terror-funding-case-nia-raids-17-places-in-7-jk-dists/articleshow/87319450.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Bangladeshis protest outside UK parliament over temple violence||LONDON: Hundreds of Bangladeshi Hindus joined Indian-origin Bengali Hindus at a protest outside the UK Houses of Parliament on Wednesday demanding the British government put pressure on Bangladesh to take action over the recent anti-Hindu atrocities. The protesters, men, women and children, travelled to London from Bradford, Birmingham, Manchester, Wales and Scotland. Outside the House of Commons they shouted "Stop Killing Hindus" and "We want justice" and held placards saying "Stop ethnic cleansing in Bangladesh". "There are a significant number of Bangladeshi Hindus living in the UK and we want British MPs to know what is happening in Bangladesh. We want the UK Foreign Office to put pressure on the Bangladesh government to take action," explained Himanish Goswami, youth ambassador for the Bangladeshi Hindu Association (UK). They marched down Regent Street, past bemused shoppers, to the BBC headquarters where they demanded the broadcaster cover the anti-Hindu riots and questioned its silence, shouting "Bias BBBC", holding placards saying: "We demand the BBC and world media investigate and report on the ongoing atrocities on Hindus in Bangladesh." Rumy Haque (48), a Bangladesh-born Muslim, joined the protest. "It happens every year. It is being done by Islamist extremists who want Bangladesh to be a Muslim country. I think it must be funded by Saudi Arabia or Pakistan. There are preachers in Bangladesh radicalising youngsters. It is an attempt at ethnic cleansing. They want to get rid of all the minorities. The majority of Muslims in Bangladesh don’t support it but they are too scared to speak out," she said. Kolkata-born Bikram Banerjee, from Bengali Hindu Adarsha Sangha UK (BHAS UK), which represents Bengali Hindus in Britain, said: "The BBC is suspiciously quiet, not saying anything about the human rights violations happening in Bangladesh. But we are British taxpayers. Hindu lives matter. We hope they will fulfil their (responsibility) as a news broadcaster." Bangladesh-born Proshanta Purokayastha, chairman of BHAS UK, said: "This has been going on since 1946, The administration is not taking any action so we want the UK government to put pressure on Bangladesh and create dialogue and stop the violence." Shatta Bhowmick (19), a Bangladeshi-origin Briton, said: "It is a daily thing when we go to the temple in Bangladesh, they spit on us and they always want to convert us to Islam. As a woman you have to dress modestly. My family there has not been able to go out since the violence. The government shut down the Internet to hide what is happening. I have hope the British government can influence Bangladesh." Biplab Roy Chowdhury, who fled aged five months to India after his father was killed in 1973 in Bangladesh, told TOI: "Where there used to be whole villages of Hindus, now there are just three or four houses." More than 150 British Indian organisations have sent a joint letter to UK PM Boris Johnson calling on the British government to condemn the violence and to ask the Bangladesh government to protect Hindu minorities, to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice, ensure that the Bangladeshi government restores the Hindu temples, and to use its influence to ensure Bangladesh abides by its commitment to human rights. Conservative MP Bob Blackman has tabled two early day motions in the House of Commons condemning the violence.

Such a scenario might result in self-censorship. This is of particular concern when it relates to the freedom of the press, which is an important pillar of democracy. “Such chilling effect on the freedom of speech is an assault on the vital public-watchdog role of the press, which may undermine the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information,” the Supreme court said. Read AlsoSupreme Court: Judiciary cannot be a mute spectatorNEW DELHI: Agreeing that some amount of surveillance, by following due procedure of law, may be essential to fight violence and terrorism, the CJI Ramana-led bench said said it cannot brush aside the allegation that several citizens are being snooped on. The court also contended: "The mereAllowing the pleas of the petitioners, some of whom have claimed to be victims of snooping, the top court said it is very important for journalists to be able to protect their sources of information. “Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for the freedom of the press. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest,” the court said. “Having regard to the importance of the protection of journalistic sources for press freedom in a democratic society and the potential chilling effect that snooping techniques may have, this court’s task in the present matter, where certain grave allegations of infringement of the rights of the citizens of the country have been raised, assumes great significance. “In this light, this court is compelled to take up the cause to determine the truth and get to the bottom of the allegations made herein,” the court said. The Supreme court said that although declared to be inalienable, the right to privacy of course cannot be said to be an absolute, as the Indian Constitution does not provide for such a right without reasonable restrictions. “As with all the other fundamental rights, this court therefore must recognise that certain limitations exist when it comes to the right to privacy as well. However, any restrictions imposed must necessarily pass constitutional scrutiny,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/snooping-can-have-chilling-effect-on-press-freedom-sc/articleshow/87320807.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||SC calls govt denial 'vague', orders probe into alleged Pegasus snooping||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed a probe into the Pegasus snooping controversy by a three-member expert committee under the supervision of former SC judge R V Raveendran, holding that a "prima facie case" is made out for an investigation in the light of the Centre's "omnibus and vague denial" of the alleged surveillance and the need to uncover the truth of the accusations. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli also brushed aside the contention of the government that it should not interfere in the issue as national security is involved. The apex court said though the Centre may decline to provide information when constitutional considerations exist, such as those pertaining to the country's security, this did not mean "... the State gets a free pass every time the spectre of 'national security' is raised". CJI Ramana, who penned the judgment, said, "It is a settled position of law that in matters pertaining to national security, the scope of judicial review is limited. However... national security cannot be the bugbear that the judiciary shies away from, by virtue of its mere mentioning. Although this court should be circumspect in encroaching upon the domain of national security, no omnibus prohibition can be called for against judicial review. The mere invocation of national security by the State does not render the court a mute spectator." The top court has ordered perhaps the most comprehensive probe to be carried out in the world on the issue after the "snooping" scandal emerged and hit several countries. The court particularly highlighted the "chilling effect" of surveillance on the freedom of the press and allowed the plea of the petitioners, some of whom are journalists, and the Editors Guild of India, who had claimed that they have been snooped on. It said surveillance is an assault on the functioning of the media and a hindrance to the discharge of its duty as the society's watchdog. "Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for the freedom of the press. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest," it remarked. The court held that if the allegations that spyware was used to snoop on several groups of citizens, including activists, politicians, scribes and also members of the judiciary, are true then this will have a chilling impact and there is a need to get to the truth to uphold the fundamental rights of people, which include right to privacy.

Framing the terms of reference for the panel, the court said it will "inquire, investigate and determine" whether the Pegasus suite of spyware was used for snooping in India and who were the targets. It will also report if the spyware was acquired by the Centre or states or any government agency and if citizens were spied on. "If any governmental agency has used the Pegasus suite of spyware on citizens, under what law, rule, guideline, protocol or lawful procedure was such deployment made? And if any domestic entity/person has used the spyware on the citizens of this country, then is such a use authorised?" it said.

The Centre initially gave a brief affidavit denying the allegations, then agreed to submit a more detailed one only to declare it has nothing to add while stating that no illegal or unauthorised tapping-snooping was being done. The court took into consideration the seriousness shown by several other countries on the issue and considered the allegation that a foreign authority, agency or private entity may be involved in placing Indian citizens under surveillance. The court said unauthorised surveillance or accessing of data stored on phones and other devices of citizens for reasons other than nation's security would be illegal, objectionable and a matter of concern. "In a democratic country governed by the rule of law, indiscriminate spying on individuals cannot be allowed except with sufficient statutory safeguards, by following the procedure established by law under the Constitution," it said. It emphasised that despite repeated assurances and opportunities, the Centre only placed on record what it called a "limited affidavit", which does not shed any light on its stand or provide any clarity as to the facts of the matter at hand. "We live in the era of information revolution, where the entire lives of individuals are stored on cloud or in a digital dossier. We must recognise that while technology is a useful tool for improving the lives of the people, it can also be used to breach that sacred private space of an individual," it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-calls-govt-denial-vague-orders-probe-into-alleged-pegasus-snooping/articleshow/87321081.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The bench referred to seven "compelling reasons" to order the probe and said that the court would interfere as rights of the entire citizenry are affected by the allegations due to the potential chilling effect and because no clear stand was taken by the Centre. The Centre initially gave a brief affidavit denying the allegations, then agreed to submit a more detailed one only to declare it has nothing to add while stating that no illegal or unauthorised tapping-snooping was being done. The court took into consideration the seriousness shown by several other countries on the issue and considered the allegation that a foreign authority, agency or private entity may be involved in placing Indian citizens under surveillance. The court said unauthorised surveillance or accessing of data stored on phones and other devices of citizens for reasons other than nation's security would be illegal, objectionable and a matter of concern. "In a democratic country governed by the rule of law, indiscriminate spying on individuals cannot be allowed except with sufficient statutory safeguards, by following the procedure established by law under the Constitution," it said. It emphasised that despite repeated assurances and opportunities, the Centre only placed on record what it called a "limited affidavit", which does not shed any light on its stand or provide any clarity as to the facts of the matter at hand. "We live in the era of information revolution, where the entire lives of individuals are stored on cloud or in a digital dossier. We must recognise that while technology is a useful tool for improving the lives of the people, it can also be used to breach that sacred private space of an individual," it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-judiciary-cannot-be-a-mute-spectator/articleshow/87321130.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Responding to China's new boundary law that came into force on October 23, the ministry of external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Wednesday, India expects "China will avoid undertaking action under the pretext of this law, which could unilaterally alter the situation in the India-China border areas." The MEA raised red flags about China's new law in its statement. The MEA said, "China's unilateral decision to bring about a legislation which can have implication on our existing bilateral arrangements on border management as well as on the boundary question is of concern to us." China has been ramping up its infrastructure building in the border areas, not just against India and Bhutan but Afghanistan as well, where fresh fears have arisen of Uighur militants crossing over into Xinjiang from Afghanistan's Badakhshan province. However, given that the India-China boundary remains disputed and undemarcated, this law would have clear implications for the future of boundary negotiations. Boundary talks have been going on at a snail's pace between NSAs of both countries, the last meeting having been held in 2018. But little progress has been made with China having refused to exchange maps from 2002. The spokesperson said, "We have noted that China has passed a new "Land Boundary Law" on 23 October 2021. The law states among other things that China abides by treaties concluded with or jointly acceded to by foreign countries on land boundary affairs. It also has provisions to carry out reorganisation of districts in the border areas." Read Also'Soldiers will stand firm on LAC despite harsh weather'NEW DELHI: Indian troops will "stand firm" in defending the country's territorial integrity despite extreme weather and terrain conditions, while ongoing talks with China continue to resolve the 17-month-long military confrontation in eastern Ladakh, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday.Most China experts see this law as a legitimisation of activities that have already been under way for some time. But given that the passage of this law comes right in the middle of a prolonged stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh, it appears to be a signal of greater intransigence by the Chinese side. The MEA spokesperson said, "India and China have still not resolved the boundary question. Both sides have agreed to seek a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution through consultations on an equal footing." The new law sets in stone the changes made on the ground. Former envoy to China Gautam Bambawale said, "The law is a post-facto legitimisation of what the Chinese have been doing in border areas for some years now. For India, what is more important is what they do on the ground. The absence of this law did not prevent them from massing troops and attempting to change status quo in eastern Ladakh or re-settling population by building new villages in border areas across Arunachal." The parts of the law of concern to India state that "the sovereignty and territorial integrity of ...China are sacred and inviolable", and asks the state to "take measures to safeguard territorial integrity and land boundaries and guard against and combat any act that undermines these".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/avoid-using-new-law-to-alter-border-areas-india-to-china/articleshow/87321149.cms||Indrani Bagchi

One of the 10 accused in the case, Fakkruddin, got the benefit of the doubt for lack of evidence. The court of additional district and sessions judge Gurvinder Singh Malhotra will pronounce the quantum of punishment on November 1. Special public prosecutor Lallan Prasad Sinha said the NIA would demand capital punishment to at least five of the nine convicts. Five of the convicts - Haider Ali, alias Black Beauty, Imtiaz Ansari, Umer Siddique, Azharuddin Qureshi and Mujibullah Ansari - are already serving life terms for the Bodh Gaya Mahabodhi blasts just over three months before the October 27, 2013, attack on Modi's rally. The other four are Numan Ansari, Ahmad Hussain, Mohammad Feroz Aslam and Mohammad Ifteqaar Alam. One among the original 12 accused in the case has already been convicted by the Juvenile Justice Board, Patna. "The original plan was to assassinate Modi through suicide bombing, but the terrorists gave up that plan after a recce showed that his fortress-like security cover would be hard to penetrate," the special public prosecutor said. PM Modi was then the CM of Gujarat. NIA found out that the terrorists had detonated a suicide vest tied to a palm tree in Ranchi's Sithiyo area in preparation for the serial blasts. The arrest of Imtiaz, who had been injured during an accidental blast at Patna railway junction on the day of Modi's rally, blew the lid off the conspiracy. Another suspected SIMI terrorist, Tariq Ajam Ansari, was killed while inserting a pencil battery into an IED inside a public toilet on platform number 10 of the station. At least three IEDs were defused at the venue of the rally later. Special public prosecutor Sinha was assisted by additional public prosecutor Pramod Kumar and lawyers Sanjay Kumar and Manoj Kumar. The convicts were represented by advocate Sayed Imran Ghani.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/9-convicted-of-blasts-at-modis-2013-patna-rally/articleshow/87321151.cms||Debashish Karmakar

This is the story of BBMP’s Sahaaya 2.0 app. And, many citizens say their complaints are declared closed even before they are addressed. Ramakrishna Rao, a resident of Kathriguppe, raised several complaints with respect to garbage not being lifted from near his house for the past two months, while the app showed that they had already been resolved. “The corner site near my house had turned into a dumpyard, with neighbours dumping waste in the plot at nights. Regardless of the times that I have raised a complaint, BBMP has done nothing about it but promptly claimed every time that the issue had been resolved. The BBMP helpline is useless and always busy, and the application is worse,” Rao, a retired bank employee, said. Geetanjali Kannur from Arekere who’s a techie, said her complaint regarding an overflowing pipeline from a manhole, has not been addressed for over a month. “I raised a complaint on September 9 and a ticket was sent. In less than two weeks, it was closed, while the problem persisted,” she rued. On September 24, she raised a ticket as there was stench coming from the manhole. “It was also closed in 48 hours, without being addressed. Sahaaya is a failed mechanism,” she added. A resident of Channa Nayakana Palya in Doddabidarakallu recalled how his complaint to Sahaaya about a road having turned into a swamp stretch unravelled a few months ago. “I complained on Sahaaya after the road in front of my house became swampy and caved in as it was dug up by utilities many times. The engineer called me and said the cave-in was the result of BWSSB works. He said all that he can do is give the number of the contractor who had dug up the road. He gave the number and the complaint was declared resolved. The road has only become worse,” he said. A senior BBMP IT official said most complaints they get are with respect to other civic agencies and are closed after alerting the agency concerned. “People raise all sorts of complaints — from waterlogging to sewage pipeline overflowing to electricity shutdown and lack of streetlights — and all these issues are not addressable by Sahaaya 2.0. We are only responsible for BBMP-related work. Leaking manhole and drains are not our concern. Citizens need to raise complaints on Namma Bengaluru application, not here,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bbmps-sahaaya-app-offers-little-help-to-address-blureans-woes/articleshow/87321254.cms||Nithya Mandyam

This, they say, can help control the time needed to transform liquid to soft solid state, thus enhancing the stability and shelf-life of these materials widely used in cosmetics and personal care products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, paper fillers, coating pigments, thickener in cosmetics and nano-composites. The research could also provide a new tool to achieve control over the properties of clay suspensions and can help understand and predict bulk flows of soil and mud particularly in river delta formation, landslides and so on. Their work by Chandeshwar Misra, Venketesh T Ranganathan, and Ranjini Bandyopadhyay was supported by RRI, department of science and technology (DST) and the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) has been accepted in the journal Soft Matter published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. “Water is a key component in any soft material that involves clay as well as artificial clay particles. Understanding the influence of water structure on the clay colloid dispersion properties, therefore, is extremely important. To this end, researchers used dispersions of charged Laponiteclay colloids as a model system to understand the properties of clay-water mixtures,” the RRI said. The researchers found that water structure in a clay water mixture, known as aqueous colloidal clay dispersion, influences its mechanical, aging — a spontaneous buildup of sample elasticity due to formation of microscopic colloidal structures — and structural properties. “The team explained that clay colloids acquire electrical charges when mixed or dispersed in water and the resultant aqueous dispersions show an interesting behaviour called aging. Since the sodium ions that reside on the clay particle surfaces leach out into the water, the clay particles in the dispersion become increasingly negatively charged with time. Strong osmotic pressure gradients result, and the clay dispersions automatically transform or age from a liquid state to a soft solid state owing to the electrostatic interactions between clay particles,” the RRI said. Researchers said their experiments involving incorporation of external additives demonstrate a strong influence of dispersion medium structure on the dispersion properties when the interparticle electrostatic interactions are weak. “We introduce a new temperature dependent measurement protocol, wherein the temperature of the medium is fixed before adding the clay particles, to manipulate the hydrogen bonds in the aqueous medium in the absence of external additives. Accelerated aging, observed upon raising the temperature regardless of the experimental thermal histories, is attributed to increased interparticle electrostatic interactions as in the room temperature experiments with ionic additives,” their paper reads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/new-study-finds-way-to-control-clay-dispersion/articleshow/87321255.cms||Chethan Kumar

Sagar has filed a complaint with Vyalikaval police against the accused, a hairstylist in his late 30s. The hairstylist has locked his house and his mobile phone remains switched off, said police. He has been booked under IPC sections, including 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means). According to Sagar, the hairstylist’s homemaker-wife approached him in February, seeking his help in discovering her husband’s extra-marital affair. Sagar found the hairstylist had a girlfriend, living about 6km from Muneshwara Block. “I alerted the homemaker and she requested me to take pictures of them. I gave her pictures in the second week of this month. When he came to know about it, he abused me. On October 24 evening, I went to their house to return the lunch box given to me by the homemaker. Suddenly, the hairstylist came home and the woman asked me to hide inside the kitchen. But he found me and using a kitchen knife, he injured my face, hands and neck,” Sagar said in the complaint.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hairstylist-attacks-neighbour-for-spying-sending-pics-to-wife/articleshow/87321259.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Gaming law is based on populism, say petitioners||Bengaluru: The Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act, 2021, which seeks to regulate online gaming, is a measure based on “populism and paternalism” as activities under game of skill are added to game of chance.Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Rummy Federation, one of the petitioners, made this assertion on Wednesday while arguing against the new legislation before the Karnataka high court.Singhvi added that the bone of contention is that the new legislation includes games of skill, despite the fact that four Supreme Court judgments and two high court verdicts, such as those from the recent Madras and Kerala high courts, have all clearly held against such a proposition.Senior advocate Aravind Datar, who appeared for the Gaming Federation of India, argued that the new amendment lacks legislative competence with regard to the inclusion of game of skill under its ambit.He said that if someone bets that fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah take a wicket in a particular over, it can be called a game of chance. At the same time, if he (Datar)and Abhishek Singhvi engage in a game of chess for a Rs 500 bet, it is a game of skill and also a civil contract. “However, the new law considers it as an offence,” Datar added.He added that the inclusion of online gaming will also give rise to territorial jurisdiction issues.Senior advocate DLN Rao argued that the explanation contained under the new amendment seeks to traverse beyond the provisions of the parent Act and the same is not permissible.Though in the afternoon session, Justice Krishna S Dixit indicated that he would hear the matter in its entirety and asked whether the police are prepared not to take any coercive action by registering FIRs, advocate-general Prabhuling K Navadgi submitted that such a blanket interim order is not necessary as it may hamper registration of cases related to betting in cricket matches.Considering this submission, Justice Dixit adjourned the hearing to Thursday, indicating that the court will consider the prayer for interim relief.The All-India Gaming Federation and others have challenged the nascent legislation and claimed that they were surprised by the action of the state government in banning online games for skill being played for stakes by virtue of the Amendment Act.They contend that the amendment is manifestly arbitrary and vague. They argued that games of skill do not fall within the ambit of “wagering and betting” as sought to be defined in the new legislation.“The state government does not have the legislative competence to enact the Amending Act. Entry 34 of List II of the Constitution of India empowers the state government to legislate only with respect to “betting and gambling” and that this entry does not extend to legislating on games of skill,” the petitioners stated.According to them, the definition of “place” has been expanded to include virtual platforms, mobile apps, internet and the effect is that the state now has the power to control virtual platforms, mobile apps, the internet, communication devices, electronic applications, software, online gaming and computer resources.Highlighting the impact of the amendment, the petitioners have said that gaming has now been defined to include online games and surreptitiously extends it even to games of skill played for stakes.“The explanation now defines wagering and betting to include any act of risking money on a game of skill by persons playing such a game or by a third party. As explained on the floor of the state assembly by the chief minister, the amendment permits playing of chess, but criminalises playing of chess for profit, money or otherwise,” the petitioners have pointed out further.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/gaming-law-is-based-on-populism-say-petitioners/articleshow/87321260.cms||---

The glass house (in pic), spread over 1,450 sq ft and built at a cost of Rs 5.5 crore, landed in a controversy and was never inaugurated. It was under five feet of water on Tuesday. Heavy rain over the past three weeks, about 42% of the average annual rainfall of Chikkaballapur, has filled up the lake for the first time after three decades. The district receives an average annual rainfall of 752mm, but the first three weeks of October alone saw 296mm of rain. About 70 acres of land in the buffer zone of Gopalakrishna Amanikere was sanctioned in 2013 to the horticulture department to build a glass house and develop a botanical garden by the then deputy commissioner of Chikkaballapur district. Considering the structure illegal, the Lokayukta court had ordered that the buffer zone of the lake be vacated and officers undertaking civil works in the buffer zone of the lake be prosecuted. However, no action was taken to demolish the glass house built in the lake’s buffer zone. The departments of revenue, public works and horticulture are playing the blame game and are not ready to take the responsibility. President of Shashwata Neeravari Horata Samiti, R Anjaneya Reddy, said: “It is a criminal offence to build a permanent structure in the buffer zone of Gopalakrishna Amanikere, which is a lifeline for the hundreds of farmers of Chikkaballapur taluk.” Senior assistant director of horticulture, state sector, Manjunath G told TOI that since there is a court order, he cannot comment on the issue. “We are waiting for suitable instructions from the director of horticulture,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/glass-house-in-lakes-buffer-zone-submerged/articleshow/87321264.cms||---

The observation was made while rejecting a petition filed by M//s Conserve Ready Mix Concrete, a Bengaluru-based partnership firm and its directors. The petitioners had challenged a February 1, 2021, order passed by a city magistrate court taking cognizance of a case registered by M/s. RKM Sand Aggregates, Hoskote, in relation to four cheques of Rs 16.5 lakh each, contending that they were issued only as security. After perusing the materials on record, Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar pointed out that there is prima facie material indicating that although the cheques in question were issued by way of security, there existed legally enforceable debt on the date of their issuance. The complainant company claimed that a little over Rs 77.5 lakh was outstanding from the petitioner vis-a-vis purchase of materials. The firm said that although the four cheques were given as security there was a breach of assurances given in the MoU between the companies and claimed that the petitioners had assured that they would clear the balance amount of Rs 11.5 lakh, in addition to handing over four transit mixture vehicles valued at Rs 66 lakh and also clear the loan on those vehicles, payable to M/s Tata Finance company.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/action-legit-if-cheque-issued-as-security-against-debt-bounces/articleshow/87321265.cms||Vasantha Kumar

According to police, the suspect, Gopala Krishna, a manager with an e-commerce firm and resident of Tarabally, later consumed poison near Geddalapura Lake, 6km from Lingadiramallasandra, and died. The deceased woman is Usha S from Bellambara village near Ankola, Uttara Kannada district. She was a security guard with a private firm. Police sources said they are yet to find out why Krishna gave her the antihistamine injection. Police said that Krishna and Usha were earlier colleagues in the security division of an e-commerce firm. “The woman was found murdered in her rental house and her ex-colleague’s body was found near a lake the same day. We are investigating the links between two deaths,” Kona Vamsi Krishna, superintendent of police (Bengaluru district), said. According to preliminary probe, Krishna separated from his wife from a few years ago. He started living with his elder sister and grew close to Usha when she was working under him. He showed interest in marrying her, but she rejected his proposal. On the wee hours of Wednesday, he came to her residence on learning she was alone as her elder brother was on night shift duty.

The complainant, Sureka Paval, 39, from Tiruppur city of Tamil Nadu had sent two of her horses, Frenchman and Vijay’s Champ, to United Riders Barn on Hennur-Bagalur Main Road managed by one Nitin Gupta, on September 1, 2021 for equestrian training for her 13-year-old son. Nitin Gupta, however, told TOI that the death of the horse was unfortunate. “It was a case of colic that caused indigestion, ultimately resulting in its death. We were training the woman’s son with the horse and things were looking good and they were competition-ready. But unfortunately the horse died; such incidents happen in sport at times,” he said, adding that the postmortem report was handed over to the animal’s owner. “Late October 22 evening, I received a call from one of caretakers, Kiran, that my Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI)-approved horse Frenchman was unwell. He then called again the next morning to inform me that the horse was fine. A few hours later he called to inform me that the 12-year-old animal had died,” Sureka said. The woman said a postmortem of the horse was carried out by veterinarian, Sanjay, under the supervision of her local representative and the animal was buried. “My son and I reached late on October 23 and demanded an explanation from Nitin Gupta about the death. But what I encountered was three drunken youths, who reached the barn and forced me out, demanding that I take with me my second horse,” Sureka said. She has complained that her horse had been injected with an unknown substance, which could be a case of poisoning the animal. An FIR was registered against Gupta under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and a police probe is under way. The woman claimed that a proper postmortem report has not been provided to her till date.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/horse-dies-in-city-tn-woman-cries-foul/articleshow/87321272.cms||Petlee Peter

The couple left behind separate suicide notes in which they said they were killing themselves as they were fed up of their multiple injuries sustained during an accident over a year ago that had left them bedridden. The duo, aged 74 and 69, had retired as teachers from Delhi University. Police came to know about the incident on Wednesday around 3.45pm when the couple's daughter called them. The daughter lives with her family in south Delhi. "On Wednesday, the couple's caretaker came to the house around 2.30pm. He rang the doorbell several times, but nobody responded. He then informed their daughter about it. She arrived there and both of them broke open the door. They found the bodies of the couple hanging from a steel pipe," said a senior police officer. DCP (Southeast) Esha Pandey said, "Two suicide notes were found on a table. The couple mentioned in the notes that they were fed up with their bedridden life caused due to multiple fractures suffered in an accident. The bodies were handed over to the family after an autopsy. No foul play was suspected." Police said the accident had taken place last year when the couple was driving to Gonda, UP. "Their vehicle crashed while trying to save a biker. While the husband sustained fractures in the spinal cord, the wife got injuries all over the body. They couldn't recover completely from the injuries due to old age and were under the supervision of a caretaker," said the officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bedridden-elderly-couple-die-by-suicide/articleshow/87321300.cms||---
---||India||Delhi HC notice to cops on removing barricades||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the stand of Delhi Police and the Centre on a PIL seeking removal of "unnecessary and hazardous" iron barricades from several roads across the national capital. Chained barricades on the roads have been proved to be fatal many times, the plea claims. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh sought the authorities' replies before November 24. One of the reasons for huge traffic jams in the city is unnecessary barricading of roads, and the mismanagement in the installation of iron barricades on several roads across Delhi causes grave hardship and inconvenience to the safety, security and welfare of the public, claimed the petition filed by Jan Sewa Welfare Society. The organisation said that the guidelines on the installation of barricades on the roads were not being properly adhered to. Several complaints were made to the authorities concerned in this regard, but no action was taken, it claimed. The plea stated that the police's own standing order stipulates that mobile barricades are important and effective tools to maintain law and order, control crowds, regulate the flow of vehicular traffic, ensure security checking at VVIP functions and also check crime and apprehend criminals. But of late, it has been observed that mobile barricades are being used in a haphazard manner and stolen and a few displaying names of police stations are found in the jurisdiction of another police station, it claimed. Besides direction to comply with the guidelines, the plea sought to set up an area-wise committee, including members of the civil society, to survey, supervise and assess the locality for installation of mobile police barricades and submit its report fortnightly to the police officer concerned. It also sought to fix liability on the officers responsible for the erratic installation of mobile barricades.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-notice-to-cops-on-removing-barricades/articleshow/87321302.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BMTC will roll out five e-buses from next week||BENGALURU: Starting November, Bengalureans could travel in environment-friendly non-AC electric buses. BMTC is planning to induct five of them from November as feeder services to Namma Metro, mainly from Kengeri. BMTC officials said they identified five routes for e-buses: Kengeri- Yeshwantpur via Kengeri Satellite Town, Kengeri-Yeshwantpur via Nayandahalli, Yeswantpur-Banashankari, Kengeri-Banashankari and Kengeri-Bidadi. Other routes are still in the planning stage, they added. Last month, BMTC received its first e-bus from NTPC-JBM Auto JV. This is part of the 90 non-AC midi (9-metre-long) vehicles under the Bengaluru Smart City scheme. BMTC is paying Rs 51.6 per kilometre with electricity to NTPC-JBM for 180 assured daily km per bus for 10 years. Each bus can take 33 passengers. Initially, the plan was to induct 10 buses from November, NTPC-JBM Auto could provide only five. The remaining 85 buses will be inducted by the year-end. BMTC managing director V Anbu Kumar said: “All 90 e-buses under the Smart City scheme will be inducted by the year-end. We are planning to set up charging facilities at three depots — Kengeri, KR Puram and Yeshwantpur.” While they can run 120km per single charge, BMTC will have to ensure the buses go the full distance. Officials said opportunity charging (charging battery for short periods throughout the day) time of 45 minutes will be provided to cover the remaining 60km. In fact, BMTC has to pay under-utilisation charges (50% of the gross cost contract) if an e-bus runs less than 180km per day. Kumar said: “It’s not very difficult to operate 180km per bus since most of our buses are covering that distance. We are designing these feeder bus routes”. The BMTC board has decided to issue a work order to Ashok Leyland to provide 300 e-buses under the Centre’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India —II scheme. “We will soon issue work orders to Ashok Leyland,” added Kumar. BMTC has already lost its FAME-I subsidy. Experts say induction of e-buses is likely to reduce environmental pollution and reduce operational costs due to soaring diesel prices. Under the Gross Cost Contract or lease model, BMTC will pay private firms on a per-km basis. The firms will deploy a driver and take care of the fleet’s operation and maintenance. However, BMTC deploys the conductor and the fare will be the same as diesel non-AC buses. BMTC has also initiated the process of transferring excess drivers working in Yeshwantpur and Kengeri depots to other places. Though BMTC was the first state-run transport utility in the country to have conducted trial runs for e-buses in 2014, there was a delay in inducting e-buses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bmtc-will-roll-out-five-e-buses-from-next-week/articleshow/87321395.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Bring in fixed taxation on petrol & diesel: Experts in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has promised to reduce sales tax on petrol and diesel after the bypolls, considering the economic conditions. But some experts have said that reducing tax won’t serve the purpose, given the highly fluctuating nature of oil prices. They suggested that the government bring a fixed rate of taxation, instead of linking it to the basic prices of fuel. Truckers and other stakeholders have demanded such a move from the Centre and state governments to control the unbridled fuel price rise. The Federation of Karnataka State Lorry Owners and Agents Association on Sunday announced that it would lay siege to Vidhana Soudha on November 5 and its members would march to the offices of the district administration in all districts. “The prices are increasing daily and the structure of state taxation is worsening the problem. Since the tax rates are linked to basic prices, the amount of tax increases as and when the basic prices are increased. What we want is a set amount of tax per litre that is delinked from the basic price, so that the retail prices of oil are stabilised,” said GR Shanmugappa, president of Federation of Karnataka State Lorry Owners and Agents Association. The Karnataka sales tax on petrol and diesel is ad valorem in nature, which means the amount of tax increases with the increase of basic price, and the state levies 35% and 24%, respectively, on petrol and diesel. This is unlike the fixed nature of additional excise duty (AED) levied by the Centre -- Rs 32.80 per litre of petrol and Rs 31.80 per litre of diesel. “Even if the state reduces the tax, supposing by 5%, it will be neutralised in 15 days and we will see higher prices again. This is due to the ad valorem nature of sales tax and the continuous rise in the price of crude oil that, in turn, pushes up the basic prices of petrol and diesel,” said BT Manohar, a member of Karnataka State GST Advisory Council. He said that bringing fuels into the GST regime would result in the same problem. The state earned a sales tax of Rs 26.35 on a litre of petrol on October 1 when the basic price was Rs 42.5 and the retail price was Rs 105.44. The tax amount rose to Rs 46.87 on October 24 (Sunday) when the base price was Rs 46.87 and a litre of petrol sold for Rs 111.34 at retail outlets. “When all other components, including central AED and dealer commission, are fixed in nature, why don’t they fix a specific amount of state sales tax on a litre of fuel? If the state government is interested in stabilising prices, then it should do it,” KM Basave Gowda, the president of Akhila Karnataka Petroleum Dealers, said. “The Centre and the states must sit together to formulate the tax structure. This is critical since the surge in fuel prices are hurting the competitiveness of the economy, apart from resulting in the rise in the prices of other commodities,” said professor M Govind Rao, economist and former director of National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bring-in-fixed-taxation-on-petrol-diesel-experts/articleshow/87321398.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

The Union ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) has recently sought the status report from the state regarding removal of transport checkposts at state borders. Though the Karnataka government maintains that all commercial tax checkposts have been removed after the GST regime, 15 RTO checkposts are still operational for physical verification of vehicle documents. Many truckers allege massive corruption as well as traffic congestion at checkposts, resulting in slower freight and passenger movement. “RTO checkposts defeat the purpose of the GST regime. E-bill under GST regime was expected to ensure seamless movement of trucks. Why is the state government not implementing the Centre’s decision to remove checkposts?” asked a truck owner. A transport department official said they are mainly checking road tax and permit violations and overloading at these checkposts. “It’s a policy decision of the state to remove these checkposts. The transport minister will take a call. Overloaded goods vehicles violating permit conditions also lead to air pollution and road accidents. How will we take action against illegal commercial vehicles avoiding permit fees and road tax? Some are also transporting illegal goods,” said an official. B Channa Reddy of the Federation of Karnataka Lorry Owners Association said: “These RTO checkposts are nothing but collection points. Officials and politicians don’t want to abolish these checkposts since their ‘monthly collection’ will be affected. They want more violations so they can collect more bribes. If enforcement was stringent over the years, why are the violations not coming down? For every truck, they collect Rs 100 to Rs 5,000 based on violations. If we don’t pay, then they will ask us to go to court so most truckers will pay.” Additional commissioner for transport (enforcement) L Narendra Holkar said: “We have not taken any decision on removing checkposts. It was just an advisory from MORTH and not a direction. The state will take a decision on this. We are not collecting any tax but focusing on enforcement under Motor Vehicle Rules.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ktaka-yet-to-get-rid-of-rto-checkposts/articleshow/87321399.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The division bench called the delay “deliberate” and gave the direction while hearing a contempt petition by MN Umesh, a Bengaluru advocate. During the hearing, the court was told that although the institute was made functional on July 5, 2021, it cannot be made operational unless a sanitisation exercise is done that requires at least two months.“We fail to appreciate as to why the institute was not sanitised till date and why they are waiting for the court to allow them time to sanitise the institute. The conduct of the authorities concerned is highly deprecated,” the bench said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/medical-edu-principal-secy-asked-to-appear-before-court/articleshow/87321400.cms||---

The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has installed Automatic Fare Collection gates at all Phase 1 Metro stations. The gates accept both QR-code and the open-loop mobility card. Phase 2 Metro stations already have NCMC and QR-code compliant AFC gates. BMRCL said it was ready to launch the card. “We are waiting for the CM’s date for the launch of NCMC. It is most likely to be launched by the first week of November. All testing and trials are complete. Passengers will be able to use the NCMC card at all stations once it is launched. But the QR-code ticketing system will take some more time,” said an official. He said all AFC gates at Phase 1 stations will accept both QR-code and NCMC in a phased manner. Under the QR-based ticketing plan, BMRCL will allow users to buy tickets through its app and will also provide paper tickets through counters. The app/paper ticket will display the QR code, which could be tapped at the QR enabled gates at stations. Once operational, the commuters will no longer need to carry the smart cards or tokens. At present, 72% passengers use smart cards and 28% tokens.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/metro-set-to-launch-common-mobility-card-qr-code-ticketing/articleshow/87321401.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Of late, consumers have faced problems in getting new connections, RR numbers and having names changed. The initiative seeks to provide services within 24 hours. The services include power supply for domestic and commercial purposes for load up to 18 KW wherever additional infrastructure is not required, name change, tariff change and other services. While these services were available only by offline registration, now they can be sought with online registration as well. Documentation requirements will be minimal and applicants will be informed about the progress through SMS and email alerts. “The idea is that people should be in direct connect with Bescom. Earlier, service connection duration varied between 3 and 90 days and a section officer would visit the spot 2-3 times. Now all that is eliminated,” Rajendra Cholan, MD, BESCOM, said.

---||Bengaluru||Sindgi, Hangal byelections: Major parties sweat it out on the last day of poll campaign||BENGALURU: On the last day of public campaigning for Sindgi and Hangal bypolls on Wednesday, the three parties made a last-ditch effort to woo voters through a series of rallies and roadside meetings. The polling will be held on October 30 and the counting of votes on November 2. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and opposition leader Siddaramaiah, who campaigned in Hangal, expressed confidence that their respective parties would win both the seats. “The victory of the BJP in both Sindgi and Hangal is as certain as we are certain about tomorrow’s sunrise,” Bommai claimed. Though the results of these bypolls will have no political significance, the BJP, Congress and the JD(S) carried out a spirited campaign like never before, collectively holding over 600 rallies and meetings in both the constituencies. That the chief minister, the opposition leader and KPCC president DK Shivakumar held over 30 rallies each in both the segments alone indicated the significance the parties attached to this election. JD(S) leaders HD Deve Gowda and HD Kumaraswamy had also camped in Sindgi constituency for over 10 days to drum up support for their candidate despite the party being on a weak footing. The reason being the general belief that the results of these bypolls will set tone for the 2023 assembly polls. As it is the first major election under the leadership of Bommai, the saffron party deployed all its resources to woo voters while the opposition is putting all its might to hand out a defeat to the CM and thus bring down his morale. The high-voltage campaign that was witnessed over the last two weeks was focussed more on name calling and mudslinging rather than development issues. The war of words started with the decision of the JD(S) to field Muslim candidates in both the seats. The Congress, which feared that the JD(S) would divide Muslim votes, called the latter a B team of the BJP. While it ensured a verbal battle between the Congress and the JD(S), Kumaraswamy's outburst against the RSS brought BJP also into the slugfest. Eight candidates crorepatis, two face criminal casesOf the 18 candidates contesting the two byelections, eight have declared themselves to be crorepatis and two are facing criminal cases. The data was shared on Wednesday by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) which analysed the details of the 33 assembly seats and three Lok Sabha seats in the country that are going for bypolls on October 30. Leading the fray, in terms of total assets, is BJP’s Hangal candidate Shivaraj Sajjanar with a whopping Rs 13.4 crore in wealth and Rs 52 lakh in liabilities. He is followed by Congress’ Hangal candidate Srinivas Mane, who has declared assets of Rs 8.3 crore (Rs 1.9 crore liability) and Congress’ Sindgi candidate Ashok Manguli with Rs 7.3 crore (Rs 1.2 crore liability). BJP’s Sindgi candidate Ramesh Bhusanur is also not far behind with Rs 3.7 crore assets (Rs 42.4 lakh liability). The JD(S), interestingly, has a crorepati in Naziya Angadi fielded from Sindgi with declared assets of around Rs 1 crore and Rs 7 lakh liability, but also at the other end of the spectrum in Niyaz Shaikh who has more liability than assets. Shaikh has declared assets of Rs 1.6 lakh and a liability of Rs 8.6 lakh. Of the 18 candidates, analysed by ADR, 14 of them are either graduates or post graduates. Two candidates, both independents, have declared serious criminal charges being filed against them. They are — Dr Sunil Kumar Hebbi contesting from Sindgi and Nazeer Ahmed Savanur from Hangal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/major-parties-sweat-it-out-on-the-last-day-of-bypoll-campaign/articleshow/87321405.cms||---

We’ve also introduced besan chikkis, pista motichoor, and a pista kaju roll to celebrate the Indian halwai,” she added.Similarly, The Sweet Whisk – a speciality home bakery – started by Hiba has introduced marshmallows with a twist – in flavours such as jalebi, rasmalai and rose-pistachio.

For Deepavali, we are offering four varieties of Mysore pak, cashew-based pedas, non-dairy gulab jamun pre-mix and elaneer halwa (made of coconut water),” he said, adding that they deliver across the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/mithai-cakes-to-vegan-sweets-unique-deepavali-trends-this-yr/articleshow/87321407.cms||---

---||India||90% in Delhi have antibodies against coronavirus: 6th Sero||NEW DELHI: More than 90% of those covered under the sixth serological survey in Delhi have developed antibodies against coronavirus, according to a report submitted to the government on Wednesday. This means that Delhi is unlikely to witness a Covid wave as destructive as the second one in April and May, until a new severe variant emerges, a government official said. "However, we cannot say Delhi has achieved herd immunity despite such a high level of sero-prevalence," the official said. Also, it cannot be said whether vaccination has a role to play in the high seropositivity rate in the capital. "We have found Covid antibodies in more than 90% of the samples collected during the sixth round of the survey," an official source said. The sample collection under the sixth sero-survey started on September 24. A total of 28,000 samples were collected from all the 280 wards, including New Delhi Municipal Council and Cantonment Board wards, in the capital. The seropositivity rate in every district is more than 85%. More women were found seropositive as compared to men, sources said. "We cannot say exactly if Delhi has achieved herd immunity because there are no studies or data to show that the virus won't spread after a certain percentage of population is affected," the official said. "However, the same variant of the virus (Delta) cannot lead to a major epidemic. So, we can say there won't be another wave of coronavirus as big as the second one, until a new severe variant emerges," the official added. Also, the antibodies developed will be partially effective against the new variant. This is the first survey to be done after Delhi was hit by a fourth Covid wave in April and May. The fifth round of sero survey conducted in January had shown that 56.13% of the people in Delhi had developed antibodies against Covid-19. In April and May, Delhi battled a brutal second wave of the pandemic that claimed a massive number of lives with oxygen shortage and reduced supplies of essential medicines at hospitals adding to the woes. On April 20, Delhi had reported 28,395 cases, the highest in the city since the beginning of the pandemic. On April 22 the case positivity rate was 36.2 per cent, the highest so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/90-in-delhi-have-antibodies-against-coronavirus-6th-sero/articleshow/87321435.cms||---

He asked the officials to ensure cleanliness and security for devotees at all the ghats. Boarding a steamer boat, Nitish started from Gandhi Ghat and went up to the Kangan Ghat in Patna City. He also inspected the Chhath ghats up to Nasriganj in Danapur area. He asked the officials to make all necessary arrangements at the river islands so that devotees do not face any difficulty in reaching there and offering ‘arghya’ to the Sun God. The CM said the ‘peepa’ bridges were being built near the Collectorate Ghat and the Mahendru Ghat to ensure smooth approachability up to the nearest river islands. He asked the officials to find out the possibility of building another ‘peepa’ bridge near the Bans Ghat for smooth approach to the nearby island. There are around 80 ghats between Nasriganj and Didarganj where lakhs of devotees gather to offer ‘arghya’ to Sun God and perform other rituals during the four-day ‘mahaparv’. This year, the Chhath rituals will begin on November 8 with ‘nahay- khay’ and end on November 11 with the ‘arghya’ to the rising sun in the morning. Last year, the Chhath Puja could not be organized on the banks of the Ganga in a grand way due to the Covid-related restrictions. But this year, the state government has lifted those restrictions. “This year, the level of Ganga water is high due to heavy rainfall in its upper catchment areas. In such a scenario, there is a need for proper security at all Chhath ghats,” Nitish told reporters after inspection of the ghats. He said the officials and engineers have been asked to select the location of Chhath ghats keeping in mind the water flow and its depth. The CM said the officials have also been asked to ensure proper barricading alongside the river near the ghats for safety of the devotees. Nitish said he would again inspect the Chhath ghats on November 3 to take stock of the preparations. Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, the CM’s principal secretary Deepak Kumar, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, development commissioner Amir Subhani, DGP S K Singhal, additional chief secretary (road construction) Pratyaya Amrit and several senior officials accompanied the CM during the inspection of the ghats.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/cm-take-safety-measures-at-ganga-ghats-for-chhath/articleshow/87316282.cms||Madan Kumar

The step has been taken with a view to checking the spread of Covid during Diwali and Chhath Puja celebrations. After a recent advisory issued by chief minister Nitish Kumar, the railways has provided adequate space to the state health department at all major railway stations of the ECR for setting up testing booths. Consequently, all the passengers reaching Bihar by special trains from different states during the festive season are undergoing Covid test. According to ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the government has set up testing booths at the Patna Junction, Ara and Buxar stations under Danapur division. Railway Protection Force personnel are helping the health department officials test the passengers. “While five Covid testing booths are functioning at the Patna Junction, one each has been set up at the Ara, Buxar, Begusarai, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga stations,” the CPRO told this reporter. An official also claimed that the railways was strictly enforcing Covid safety protocols at the Patna Junction and the Rajendra Nagar Terminal. He added, “A team of the health department and railway officials are keeping tabs on the special passenger trains reaching Bihar from Maharashtra and Delhi. However, no one has tested positive for Covid yet.” The state government has set a target of conducting at least 30,000 tests every day at different stations in Bihar. It also intends to increase the number of Covid testing booths at major stations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/covid-testing-booths-set-up-at-major-stns/articleshow/87315593.cms||Kumod Verma

It gives a sense of reassurance to the police force who risk their lives to protect people,” Sawang said. Rajeev Juneja, CEO of Mankind Pharma who was also present at the conference, commended efforts taken by the police during the pandemic. A total of 123 family members of deceased police personnel received the cheques.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/deceased-cops-kin-get-rs-3-lakh-each/articleshow/87317603.cms||---

Congress, on the other hand, denied such talk and accused RJD of creating confusion ahead of the bypolls. The RJD and Congress are at loggerheads and both have fielded their candidates in the two assembly constituencies against JD(U) after the Lalu’s party refused to cede Kusheshwar Asthan seat for the grand old party, which had contested the seat in the 2020 assembly election under the seat-sharing agreement between the two and finished runner-up. In retaliation, the Congress also fielded its candidate from Tarapur, with its state unit declaring that their alliance was over. “Sonia Ji inquired about my health. I told her that her party is an all-India party. She asked me to bring all like-minded people together and hold their meeting,” Lalu told the reporters before leaving for campaign in the two constituencies on Wednesday. However, Congress in-charge for Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, whom Lalu had called a “Bhakchonhar” (imprudent person), denied any such telephonic conversation between the RJD chief and Sonia Gandhi. “Such statements (of Lalu)) have no meaning. Few people try to create confusion in the battlefield and RJD is doing the same. I am the AICC in-charge for Bihar and we are fighting the bypolls as per instruction from our high command. Had any such talks happened, I would have been informed,” said Das at a press conference held here in the evening. He even appealed to the voters of Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur to not get misled by Lalu’s statement. He further said instead of regretting now, Lalu should have called him and sorted out the issue of seat distribution. “I had met Lalu ji a few months ago to enquire about his health. He could have called me to sort out the matter, but grabbed our seat,” said Das. To a media question whether he will meet Lalu when the latter calls him, he replied, “After election, if he calls me, I will go and meet.” On Lalu’s commnent on him, Das said, “He can say whatever he wants, but Congress has taught us discipline and there is a culture in the party.” Das further said, “Our fight is against both the RJD and JD(U). These two seats will not change the government, but will bring a new ray of hope for Bihar.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/lalu-says-sonia-called-him-cong-denies-any-such-talk/articleshow/87316132.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Puja has named her 12 family members, including father and uncles Arvind Singh alias Guddu Singh (50) and Jitendra Singh (48), in the FIR in this connection. The police arrested Arvind and Jitendra from Sathaura village under Jitna police outpost of Ghorasahan police station area in East Champaran. A special investigation team (SIT) has been formed under Sikrahna SDPO Rajesh Kumar to arrest the other accused. As per police, Puja used to frequently call concerned outpost in-charge, apprehending threat to life from her parents. More than 15 persons, including Puja’s father Manoj Singh alias Manoranjan Singh, an ex-serviceman, had barged into Avanish’s house at around 6.30pm on Monday and killed him. As per police, Avanish had locked himself inside a room but Puja’s family members dragged him out after breaking the door and shot him twice in the head. Jitna outpost in-charge Anil Kumar said Puja’s father shot Avanish dead using his licenced pistol. He said they also attempted to strangulate Puja and kidnap her, but failed. Her family had even tried to take away the couple’s eight-month-old girl, but she was thrown below a bed amid the scuffle. Kumar said Puja’s father-in-law Premchand Singh and his wife were brutally assaulted with iron rods and wooden sticks after they killed Avanish. “Three empty cartridges were recovered from the spot. “Puja informed us on a few occasions that she apprehends threat from her family members. Police were also sent to her house,” he said. “Puja’s family had not accepted her marriage even though the youth belonged to their caste. The couple used to live in Delhi. But Avanish lost his private job during the pandemic and they returned home on July 5 this year,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/two-of-girls-family-arrested-for-honour-killing/articleshow/87317277.cms||Debashish Karmakar

A similar row erupted in Kakinada on October 26, Tuesday, at the historic St Anns Aided High School. Worried over the future prospects of their children, parents ‘gheraoed’ the local MLAs in these two instances. The 67-year-old Children’s Montessori High School, Vijayawada, has recently decided to close the school, citing the reason that “the teachers are taken by the government”. As per the recently framed government policy, the state government will take over schools, including the staff, infrastructure and assets, from the willing managements. Consequently, such schools will become government institutions. The government will absorb the existing aided staff of such institutions into government or other local body schools. But if the managements are willing to surrender only their staff, but not their assets, the grant-in-aid will be withdrawn permanently for such institutions. The staff will be absorbed into the government schools. Consequently, these schools have to be operated as private unaided institutions. If needed, the education department officials shall accommodate the existing students of such private schools into local schools of their choice at the request of their parents in writing. The parents’ worry stems from several factors, such as having to shift their wards to a different school (in case of a closure), hike in the annual fees (if the school is stripped off the aided status) and the concerns over the quality of education in other schools. Moreover, several aided schools have been offering affordable and quality education for decades, playing their own role in improving the literacy rate in the state. Meanwhile, a few aided schools have also approached the court. AP Teachers Guild General secretary, A Victor Immanuel, has requested the government to absorb all the staff of aided schools, including those who have not given their assent. “At the same time, I request the aided schools to not close the institutions in the middle of the year as it would adversely impact the students,” said Victor Immanuel. State education minister A Suresh made it clear that the education department will not forcibly take over the aided schools. “Only those schools and colleges, which are willing, will be taken over by the government,” the minister said. “Even now, the schools/colleges, which gave their consent earlier, can withdraw their consent and continue as earlier. As per the report submitted by the committee constituted to study the performance of private aided educational institutions, the conditions at the aided institutions are deteriorating, both on the infrastructure and academics front. The state government wants to improve the quality of education in all schools and colleges,” said Suresh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/parents-protests-intensify-row-over-aided-institutes/articleshow/87317563.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

He said private educational institutions could take back schools if they wanted to run them on their own. Speaking to the media here on Wednesday, the minister said the government has constituted a committee to assess the performance of private aided schools after chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy wanted to upgrade all educational institutions to meet the future demands of children. He said the CM is very particular about making the education sector strong as the government has already launched the modernisation of government schools and colleges under the Nadu-Nedu programme. The minister said the government has taken certain decisions regarding private aided educational institutions based on an expert committee report. He clarified that the state government would takeover such institutions only after the managements, along with teachers, willingly assented to the move. He said the education department has prepared a timetable to map students of schools that may face closure. He assured the government would not allow a single student to suffer due to closure of schools or colleges and added that web counselling for allocating posts to teachers from schools taken over will be conducted at the end of the month. He criticised the TDP for ruining aided educational institutions without filling the vacancies. He also said strict action will be taken against schools that collect a fee higher than the amount fixed by the regulatory commission.  The education department will map students of schools that may face closure. Teachers from schools taken over will be web counselled at the end of the month||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/wont-allow-a-single-student-to-suffer-min/articleshow/87317665.cms||Samdani MN

---||Business||RBI: All micro loans must be collateral-free||TNN Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said it proposes to make micro-lending collateral-free, not just for microfinance institutions (MFIs) but for all lenders. This follows non-MFIs adopting harsh collection measures, arbitraging the different regulations for MFIs and other lenders. Delivering the inaugural address at the Sa-Dhan National Conference on ‘Revitalising financial inclusion’, RBI deputy governor Rajeshwar Rao said that current regulations have created a non-level playing field. “The current regulatory framework, which was put in place with the objective of making credit available to low-income households and to protect borrowers from harsh recovery practices of the lenders, is applicable only to NBFC-MFIs. Whereas other lenders, who now have a share of around 70% in the microfinance portfolio, are not subjected to similar regulatory conditions,” he said. Rao asked lenders to be cautious and not to copy the large ones as microlending has a social objective as well. “Prioritisation of profitability at the expense of social and welfare goals of microfinance may not be an optimal outcome. Lenders need to remain cognizant of the fact that the balance sheet growth should not be built by compromising on prudent conduct,” he said.Rao pointed out that borrowers who take microloans lack the type of collateral preferred by the lenders. However, he noted, lenders still repossess whatever little collateral they have for pledging. “It is more for inducing repayments rather than to recover losses. Therefore, it has been proposed to extend the collateral-free nature of microfinance loans, as applicable to NBFC-MFIs, to all lenders in the microfinance space.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-all-micro-loans-must-be-collateral-free/articleshow/87318693.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Court notice over medico’s papers||Ahmedabad: A division bench of the Gujarat high court on Wednesday issued notice to the state government over an appeal filed by an MBBS student and his father seeking directions to GMERS, Himmatnagar to supply documents including the internship certificate. Petitioners – Rajesh Patel and his son Neil – have filed the appeal after they were not satisfied with the single-judge bench’s order, by which the HC had ordered the college management to return the original documents including mark sheets, which were retained by the college on the ground that Neil had not paid Rs 2 lakh bond or served in rural areas. On the other hand, the petitioners have been claiming that the student had never submitted the bond and he was not bound to discharge any obligation to this effect. While ordering the college management to return all original documents to the student, the single-judge bench also paved way for the college to recover the bond amount of Rs 2 lakh from the student, who is eager to get the internship certificate so that he could pursue further studies in the US. As the issue involves payment of bond amount to which the petitioners show resistance, the bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Mauna Bhatt made it clear, “You are a doctor who has studied in a government medical college through a quota seat. This court has consistently taken the view that MBBS doctor, who got admitted to the said courses are bound by duty to serve in rural areas.” The court refused to grant any interim relief and posted further hearing beyond Diwali vacation, but permitted the petitioners to approach the court during the vacation if they feel it is necessary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/court-notice-over-medicos-papers/articleshow/87318446.cms||---

This series-A round, which raises the 10-month-old company’s valuation to Rs 1,575 crore, was led by partners of DST Global with participation from Tiger Global and Alkeon Capital as well as existing investors Accel and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Zolve, which has partnered with a US bank, uses the local credit scores of migrants to issue a credit card upon landing. Besides a credit card with all the reward features in the US market, Zolve provides access to a savings account that gives users the fast transfer feature available in India despite the non-availability of platforms like the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) or Immediate Payment Service (IMPS). “Neobanks are more mature in the US than in India and it is easier to have a partnership. UPI is a unique proposition that is available in India. What we are trying to do is provide them UPI type of experience in the US market. We will be funding those accounts by keeping a float and getting it done,” said Zolve founder & CEO Raghunandan G. While there are no fees for the customers, Zolve would earn through the fees paid by the merchant whenever the customer uses the credit card. “Migrants use the credit card more frequently not because they need to but because those transactions help them build up a credit score which is used for many things besides credit,” said Raghunandan. He added that Zolve is on course to become a full-stack financial services provider with products focused on instant remittance, insurance and loans in the pipeline. DST Global has previously led rounds in many prominent global fintechs such as Robinhood, Nubank, Chime, Revolut, and Wealthsimple. Tiger Global too has multiple unicorns in its portfolio. Since launching in September this year, more than 70,000 customers from Australia, Canada, Germany, India and the UK, among others, have signed up for Zolve. The new round of funding comes just seven months after announcing a large seed round of Rs 113 crore, which saw the participation of Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners and a host of other marquee investors. Raghunandan had earlier founded taxi aggregator TaxiForSure, which was sold to Ola Cabs in 2015 for $200 million. He has been an angel investor in over 50 startups following the successful exit, including Vedantu, Bounce and Ninjacart.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/neobank-zolve-valued-at-rs-1-6k-cr-after-rs-300cr-round/articleshow/87318638.cms||Mayur Shetty

The company cleared the last hurdle for its IPO — a nod to its offer document from the Registrar of Companies — on Wednesday. The clearance for the IPO came on the day Swiss Re announced a Rs 920-crore investment in Paytm Insuretech, the holding company for its non-life business, for a 23% stake. The price range for the shares is likely to be Rs 2,080-2,150. At that price range, the company’s targeted valuation is around $20 billion (Rs 1.5 lakh crore). The red herring prospectus gives an insight into the company’s financial performance in the first quarter. According to the document, the company’s revenue is up 46% to Rs 948 crore in Q1FY22 from Rs 649 crore in Q1FY21. Paytm’s losses stood at Rs 382 crore for the three months ended June 2021 following higher employee expenses, which include accounting for ESOPs and an increase in headcount. Paytm’s user base grew in the first three months of FY22 to 33.7 crore registered consumers and 2.2 crore merchants. The number of monthly transacting users also saw a 33% increase to 5.7 crore as of September 30. Payments and financial services contribute nearly 80% of the revenue for the company. According to the prospectus, the revenue for the first quarter in this segment stood at Rs 689 crore. The contributing margin, which is a reflection of unit profitability, rose to 27% from 15% a year ago. In July this year, Paytm acquired Raheja QBE General Insurance at a deal valuing the company at Rs 568 crore. The company is held through a One97 associate Paytm Insuretech. On Wednesday, Paytm said that it has partnered with reinsurance giant Swiss Re for a joint venture. Swiss Re will invest (by way of equity shares and compulsorily convertible preference shares) approximately Rs 920 crore (Rs 397 crore upfront, and the remaining in tranches, subject to fulfilment of certain milestones) for an aggregate stake of 23% on a fully diluted basis. The Swiss Re deal indicates that the non-life business valuation has gone up manifold after being part of the technology platform.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paytm-ipo-opens-on-8th-swiss-re-boards-non-life/articleshow/87318874.cms||Mayur Shetty

It is spread across 209 acres of land and has several classrooms and laboratories with numerous students in MBBS (100), postgraduate courses (39), paramedical diploma programmes (95), and Grade-A nursing courses (75). “Our aim is not only to make the students knowledgeable and employable, but also good human beings,” said Dr Sinha and added that the college was working continuously to improve its academic standard, laboratories, libraries, medical facilities and postgraduate departments. Referring to the glorious past of the JLNMC, Dr Sinha claimed that hundreds of doctors, who had studied MBBS there, were holding top posts in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, and other countries. “Besides, many of our alumni have joined the JLNMC as teachers in various departments,” he added. Earlier, gold medals were given to the toppers of the 2015-2020 and 2016-2021 batches.

---||Business||Indians paid Rs 9,700cr in hidden forex fees||Mumbai: Indians paid nearly Rs 9,700 crore in the form of fees hidden in inflated exchange rates while making remittances in 2020. This is more than a third (36%) of the total fees of Rs 26,300 crore that Indians paid for sending money across their country’s borders. The fees reflect a lack of transparency and high charges applied by banks on remittances. Banks have been reducing the fees on foreign remittances and their income under this head fell from Rs 15,017 crore in 2016 to Rs 12,142 crore in 2019. However, they have protected themselves by recovering Rs 4,422 crore through exchange mark-up in 2020, which was up from Rs 2,505 crore in 2016. These figures were from independent research carried out by Capital Economics in August 2021, which aimed to estimate the scale of foreign exchange transaction fees in India. The study was released by Wise, the technology company that was founded with the objective of reducing cross-border remittance costs. Overseas workers sending money into India are also losing money. Over the past five years, money lost to exchange rate margins on inward remittances has grown from Rs 4,200 crore to Rs 7,900 crore. Meanwhile, fees paid to transaction costs have grown from Rs 10,200 crore in 2016 to Rs 14,000 crore in 2020. “A significant portion of these fees paid on remittances to India come from people in Gulf countries where most are employed in blue-collared jobs to support their families back home in India,” a statement issued by Wise said. Of the share of total fees paid on inward remittances to India in 2020, Saudi Arabia ranked first at 24%, followed by the US (18%), the UK (15%), Qatar (8%), Canada (6%), Oman (5%), UAE (5%), Kuwait (5%), and Australia (4%). “While technology and internet have eased some of the issues related to the convenience and speed of foreign funds transfers, the age-old practice of hiding fees in the exchange rate results in people spending too much on hidden foreign currency fees — money which should rightfully stay in their pockets,” said Wise India country manager Rashmi Satpute. Indian consumers spending abroad paid Rs 1,441 crore as transactions fees, of which Rs 1,303 crore was hidden charges in the form of exchange mark-up. According to industry sources, the high mark-up by commercial banks gives rise to unofficial money changers who buy currency from incoming Indians and sell them to outbound tourists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indians-paid-rs-9700cr-in-hidden-forex-fees/articleshow/87318811.cms||---

Justice C Hari Shankar granted four weeks to Ramdev to file his response to the suit, which he said was not frivolous and a case for its institution was “definitely” made out. The court clarified that it is “not expressing any opinion on the merits of the allegations in the plaint against Ramdev and the issue of grant of any relief, interim or otherwise, shall be looked into subsequently.” “I have seen the video clips (of Ramdev). Your client is scorning the allopathic treatment protocol. He has literally gone to scorn at the prescription of steroids, people going to hospitals. From the perusal of the clips, there is definitely a case for the institution of the suit. They (plaintiffs) may have nothing for an injunction but the case is not frivolous,” the judge told senior counsel Rajiv Nayar, appearing for Ramdev. The senior lawyer said while he had no objections to the issuance of summons in the matter, he opposed the allegations made in the case. Apart from Ramdev, summons was also issued to Ramdev’s second-in-command Acharya Balkrishna. The court issued notice to social media platforms Google, Facebook and Twitter as well in response to the plea filed by resident doctors' association of All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Rishikesh, Patna and Bhubaneswar; association of resident doctors, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh; union of resident doctors of Punjab; resident doctors' association, Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut; and Telangana junior doctors' association, Hyderabad. They alleged that Ramdev was misleading and misrepresenting to the public at large that allopathy was responsible for the deaths of several people infected by Covid-19, and insinuating that allopathic doctors were causing the deaths of the patients. Senior counsel Akhil Sibal, representing the associations, had argued that amid the pandemic, the Yoga guru made unsubstantiated claims on Coronil being a cure for Covid-19, contrary to the licence granted to the drug for merely being an “immuno-booster” and submitted that Ramdev, who is a highly influential person, was sowing doubts in the minds of the general public.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/case-not-frivolous-hc-issues-summons-to-baba-ramdev-over-docs-plea/articleshow/87319271.cms||---

The Authority is also planning to construct table-top crossings, demarcate dedicated vending points, upgrade bus queue shelters and create seating space under the Rs 13.87-crore project. One of the busiest stretches in the city, MG Road houses several malls — MGF Metropolitan, Sahara mall, City Centre, and Metropolis Mall — as well as private offices, hotels, gated societies and two metro stations — MG Road and Sikanderpur metro stations. As a result, the area witnesses a heavy rush of pedestrians to cross the roads that leaves it risk-prone. According to GMDA officials, table-top zebra crossings were being considered for the stretch to facilitate the movement of pedestrians and non-motorised vehicles by ensuring slower driving speeds. “The entire stretch will be revamped to ensure better space utilisation for cyclists and pedestrians, and to make it more organised,” an official said. Earlier this week, GMDA’s Core Planning Cell (CPC) was informed that civil works under the project would be undertaken by the Authority, while The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) would be roped in for greenery work, while beautification of the stretch would be done by corporates through CSR initiatives. “The CPC has recommended the work. We will soon hold a meeting with all stakeholders, including the malls and other establishments, along the stretch to discuss the design,” the official said. The project, involving several civil works, was likely to take at least nine months to complete after the allotment of an agency. “We should be able to deliver the project by 2022 end,” the GMDA official said. Namrata Sharma, who works at a private comp-any located on MG Road, said cycle tracks and demarcated crossings for pedestrians would make the stretch safer for pedestrians and drivers. “As of now, people cross the roads wherever they want to, which not only compromises on their safety but also means that drivers using the stretch need to ensure that they move more cautiously than in most other places. It creates scope for accidents and mishaps, so this plan of the GMDA, if executed well, is quite promising,” Sharma added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/mg-road-to-get-rs-14-crore-pedestrian-cyclist-friendly-makeover-soon/articleshow/87320259.cms||Sakshi Dayal

The Bank’s gross non-performing assets declined by 11.3% at Rs 15,665 crore in September quarter, as compared to the same quarter last year. Its net NPA reduced to Rs 3,741 crore, from Rs 5,290 crore in the same period. IOB has also restructured loans worth about Rs 7,500 crore in this quarter. Its MD & CEO Partha Pratim Sengupta said the PSU bank has about 60%-70% of slippages have come from an NBFC (i.e) SREI Infrastructure Finance (at Rs 650 crore) and two other accounts.“Due to the court’s stay on the case, banks could not book that NBFC account as NPA. However, these three accounts will not impact my books, as we are provided for at least 80% of these accounts,” he assured. With the Net Interest Margin declined to 2.43% for this second quarter, as against 2.57% a year ago, he replied that lower NIM is due to the competitive market, where most banks have reduced their interest rates. Whatever income is lost via NIM, has to be made up through other income. Provision Coverage Ratio has improved to 92% as against 91.56% as on June 30, 2021. The bank said it has made required provisioning in advances in specific Accounts so as to improve Net NPA. “Our corporate loan book covered over 97%. We have achieved the monthly set target of cash recovery of Rs 1100 crore in this quarter too,” he added. Total deposits stood at Rs 2.5 lakh crore as on September 30, 2021, and total income for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 stood at Rs 5376 crore.

---||Vijayawada||Whitefly infestation hits coconut orchards in Andhra Pradesh||VIJAYAWADA: Several coconut orchards in Andhra Pradesh are hit by rugose spiralling whitefly (RSW), affecting coconut production. The whitefly disease has also infested oil palm trees. The problem is largely felt in Konaseema region of East Godavari district, where around 30% of the crop area has been infected by whitefly. India is the third largest country in coconut cultivation after Indonesia and the Philippines, with 1.46 crore metric tonnes production per annum. Andhra Pradesh is the fourth largest state in India — after Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu — in coconut cultivation. As much as 1.23 lakh hectares of land are under coconut cultivation in the state, while 1.70 lakh hectares are under palm oil plantation. East and West Godavari districts, mainly the Konaseema region, have large coconut plantation and coconuts grown in this region have huge demand considering the high oil content. But farmers are facing severe problems since 2018 due to whitefly infestation. According to horticulture scientists, whitefly directly attacks the plant by sucking its juices and forms a white mould resembling fungus. The yield reduces significantly and it is tough to control the problem if not identified in the early stages. MVS Nagireddy, vice-chairman of AP Agriculture Mission, said they are focusing on methods to control the infection and regain the production. “The whitefly infestation started in 2018 in Tamil Nadu. It gradually spread to all states. We have visited the agriculture university in Tamil Nadu and enquired about the situation there. Around 60% of coconut plantations in Tamil Nadu have been affected. We are on high alert and working out an action plan along with the coconut research centre at Ambajipet. Similarly, AP tops other states in oil palm cultivation with around 1.7 lakh hectares growing the crop. We have alerted the farmers and are focusing on control measures,” he said. Dr T Janaki Ram, vice-chancellor of YSR Horticulture University, said a biocontrol laboratory was established on the university campus to take up research on controlling whitefly infection in coconut and other horticulture farms. “Biocontrol methods are effective to control whitefly. Farmers should focus on them instead of using chemical-based insecticides. They are effective and cheap,” he said, adding that whitefly infection can spread to papaya and custard apple plantations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/whitefly-infestation-hits-coconut-orchards-in-ap/articleshow/87317738.cms||Venu Lanka

Only 23% of customers who paid at Google Play and Apple Stores said that they went through the OTP-based authentication transaction for their app purchases, found the survey conducted by LocalCircles — a community social media platform. Also, 46% of consumers who paid for apps in the last 12 months said they have been wrongly charged or overcharged. After the new rules came into force in October, many cardholders found their subscriptions discontinued and they had to register their cards afresh for continued services. This was because the RBI banned merchants from making recurring debits unless the cardholder’s one-time consent is communicated to the bank through an OTP. Also, banks are required to provide advance notice of the recurring debit and a link to enable users to discontinue the payment. LocalCircles surveyed 40,000 respondents, which included citizens residing across 302 districts of India. Of these, 48% respondents were from tier 1, 27% from tier 2 and the rest were from tier 3, 4 and rural districts. In the new regime, customers who want a standing instruction in place for recurring payments will have to register for the e-mandate at the merchant’s site for the first transaction, with a validity period and maximum amount. Also, mandate registration, modification and deletion will all require additional factor authentication (AFA). Additionally, transactions for amounts greater than Rs 5,000 will have to be authorised each time by the cardholder. LocalCircles had earlier raised the issue of unauthorised debits with authorities after a survey showed that customers had concerns over these after they continued to recur from foreign providers. Incidentally, some consumers have had to cancel their cards as they did not find a way of discontinuing the recurring debits.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/card-users-happy-with-rbi-securing-recurring-payments-finds-survey-of-app-stores/articleshow/87318648.cms||Mayur Shetty

The Union government earlier allocated 80 lakh vaccine doses to Andhra Pradesh as part of its October quota. But it has now decided to allocate 35 lakh more extra vaccine doses. This takes October’s vaccine allocation to 1.15 crore doses, the highest-ever given to the state in any single month since the launch of the vaccination drive in January. The Union government sent 1.05 crore vaccine doses to AP in September.

Addressing any election rally after six years following his stay in Ranchi jail in connection with the fodder scam cases, Lalu lashed out at Nitish and the NDA government over unemployment, price rise and lack of development. Back in his style in both the Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies where byelection is scheduled on October 30, Lalu said, “He (Nitish) has got nervous and giving such rubbish statement. He thought ‘visarjan’ means killing… I will not kill you. You will die yourself.” He took a jibe at Nitish by recalling his earlier statement that “mitti mein mil jayenge, BJP ke saath nahi jayenga”. What happened to that? Lalu asked. “He (Nitish) used to say he will stand with those who fight for special status of Bihar. What about that?” Lalu said and recalled the arrest of former deputy prime minister Lal Krishna Advani in Bihar on his instruction and added that he has never compromised with the communal forces. He also played the caste census card in this election rally and said the present NDA government was intentionally not wanting it as they were against the development of Dalits and backwards. Training his guns at the NDA government at the Centre, Lalu said they had been selling all the public properties. He also mentioned about his tenure as railway minister the railways earned profits. He then appealed to people to vote for RJD, assuring that his party will be always there for them. Talking about previous year’s assembly election, he alleged that several RJD candidates were intentionally made to lose by some foul play in the counting; otherwise Tejashwi would have become the CM. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said a huge crowd had gathered and people’s faces were reflecting their inclination towards RJD. “It was beyond imagination,” added Gagan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/nitish-nervous-says-lalu-at-rallies-in-k-asthan-tarapur/articleshow/87316614.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Lalu, along with his younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, addressed one rally each in the two constituencies on Wednesday. Singh accompanied them in the helicopter. “Once again Jagdanand Singh has tried to break the party (RJD) and stopped me from going to the election rallies with my father,” tweeted Tej soon after Lalu had left Patna for the election rallies. Tej even uploaded to his social media page a photo from a scene of the Mahabharata showcasing Singh as the Kans. In the same morning he had shared a video of his spending time with his father Lalu and wrote that Lalu told him about the JP movement and struggle. Such tantrums from Tej have become a common affair nowadays, one RJD leader said, preferring anonymity. Though both Lalu and his wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi deny any tussle in the first Yadav family, Tej had many times made the differences public. Tej had earlier staged a dharna outside his bungalow alleging he was not allowed to enter 10, Circular Road, where his parents were staying. He had even warned his younger brother Tejashwi, whom he had often referred to as his Arjun, to remain conscious and follow the right way, or else it will not be possible for him to become CM.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/tej-pratap-hits-out-at-rjd-state-chief-again/articleshow/87316193.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The deceased has been identified as Prabhu Yadav (70). His two injured sons are Nandan Kumar and Sonu Kumar, both in their early 20s. Police said both were undergoing treatment for bullet injuries. Their neighbour Debu Yadav is the prime accused in the case. Debu is a labour contractor, who used to engage persons from Pathlafar and neighbouring villages in Delhi for working on daily wages, Town police station SHO Vinod Ram said. He said Debu had taken Nandan and Sonu to Delhi where they had been working for him for the last eight years. “Payment of around Rs13,000 was due with the contractor. Both had returned from Delhi along with several others, including Debu, on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, both brothers and their father reached Debu’s house and demanded money. A heated altercation took place and the contractor fired at least five rounds from an illegal countrymade weapon, killing Prabhu and injuring his two sons,” the SHO said. He said Debu and several of his associates fled after the incident. “Debu’s wife and another waman were arrested for supporting Debu and helping him escape,” he said. The SHO said Prabhu’s eldest son Awadesh Kumar has lodged an FIR against 11 persons, including Debu and Phudan Yadav. “They are evading arrest.

---||Vijayawada||Meet the CEO who weathers global risks, bid for Air India||VIJAYAWADA: Palaypu Laxmi Prasad, chairman and CEO of US-based Interups Inc may have been a lesser-known entrepreneur until recently. However, Prasad hit headlines after becoming the first to submit an expression of interest for the disinvestment of Air India last year. After experiencing first-hand difficulties in the Indian and US economies, the chartered accountant now stands as an influential advisor to retired NRIs from south India. Prasad handles around 36,000 retirement accounts, mostly of NRIs, and has completed acquisitions through the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Speaking to TOI, Laxmi Prasad explains that he began his career after completing his chartered accountancy (CA) in 1989 and handled his first initial public offering (IPO) at his brother’s company in 1992 at the age of 26. In 1995, Prasad began his entrepreneurial career by producing his own IPO for Palaypu Financial, a stock that traded highly for two years before the Hyderabad market was hit in 1996, leaving him with a loss of Rs 30 crore. After this, Prasad revived his career in the US by joining Prudential, a Fortune 500 company, as a producer. In the wake of the 2001 World Trade Centre collapse, Prasad turned to tax practice and financial planning after several software jobs were lost. “By 2008, we were handling taxes of nearly 55% Indian software engineers in the US. Then the Lehman Brothers collapsed in the US. That time I saw a major complication. That is when we moved from tax practice to handling retirement funds. Luckily, during the same time, gold took an upward turn. That is when I used to help Indian software engineers to use gold as a tax saving instrument and even today that is helping them,” Prasad told TOI. Interups Inc holds $2.16 billion in tax-deferred assets which are used as an anchor investment for various acquisitions. Prior to the Air India bid, Interups had picked up a 49% stake in Trujet airlines. Explaining the Air India bid, Prasad said they, in fact, bid higher than Tata, at Rs 13,500 crore for 49%. “We had so much planned for Air India. We wanted to support the employees of Air India and offered 51% for the staff and were agreeable to have 49% equity. The insufficiency of the application process from the employees resulted in them getting disqualified and we had no say in that,” Prasad said. Prasad believed that while the airline was undeniably loss-making, it had invaluable intangible assets that made it worth the bid. Nevertheless, the NRI has several successful investments in his portfolio, which include 40,000 hectares of palm oil plantations in Guyana, Gayathri projects and a major hotel asset in Bengaluru. “By 2008, we were handling taxes of nearly 55% of Indian software engineers in the US.

The Institute worked with researchers from IIIT Hyderabad, IIIT Naya Raipur, Kyungpook National University (South Korea), and University of Wollongong (Australia) to develop this protocol. A group of interdisciplinary researchers led by Dr Alavalapati Goutham Reddy and Prof Ashok Kumar Das developed an ‘authentication with key agreement protocol for EV dynamic charging infrastructure entities’ and published their findings in the reputed peer-reviewed journal ‘IEEE Transaction on Vehicular Technology’. These findings demonstrate that the messages exchanged between electric vehicles and dynamic charging infrastructure are secure, preventing attackers from tracking the vehicle and gaining any benefits. The researchers studied static, quasi-static, and dynamic charging systems of electric vehicles. Static charging, which allows consumers to park at their homes or offices, needs the car to be immobile while quasi charging is used to charge vehicles that stop briefly. Dynamic charging is still a work in progress. As it involves a wide range of communication principles, novel technologies, and charging infrastructure, there can be several security issues such as message tampering, spoofing, or delaying among others to disconcert the charging service. This research was led by Dr Alavalapati Goutham Reddy, assistant professor, department of computer science and engineering, NIT-Andhra Pradesh. The research paper was co-authored by Raveendra Babu, research scholar, NIT AP along with Prof Ashok Kumar Das of IIIT Hyderabad, Dr Ruhul Amin of IIIT Naya Raipur, Prof Young-Ho Park of Kyungpook National University, and Prof Willy Susilo of University of Wollongong. Dr Alavalapati Goutham Reddy said; “A lot of effort needs to be done to make charging while driving a reality. This is because there are so many communication principles and so many different types of messaging and charging infrastructure established in public places that are prone to security and privacy concerns.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/nit-ap-develops-protocol-to-address-security-in-ev-charging/articleshow/87317680.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

He directed the executive engineers of the water resources department (WRD) to keep a watch on the rising level of the Ganga and submit a report to the officials concerned every day. The DM also asked the executive officers of the Patliputra, Bankipore and Azimabad circles of the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) to get all the ghats cleaned and barricaded as soon as possible. “Signs will be put up near the barricades so that the devotees do not cross them while performing Chhath Puja rituals. They will have to follow the instructions when they offer ‘arghya’ (pay obeisance to Sun God),” he told this reporter. Singh added, “There will be changing rooms, control rooms, watchtowers, toilets, public address system, drinking water, help desks, proper lights and adequate power supply at the ghats. There will also be a ban on the operation of private boats in the Ganga during Chhath.” Besides, the DM instructed additional collector (disaster) Santosh Kumar Jha to deploy NDRF and SDRF men along with divers at all the ghats. He also directed the officials to identify the dangerous ghats, prepare their list and ban the entry of devotees there. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, he asked the officials to ensure that the safety protocols, which include the use of masks, hand sanitizers and maintenance of social distancing, are followed at the ghats during the celebrations. The DM said, “A plan is being made for the construction of Pipa Pul at Collectorate Ghat and Mahendru Ghat so that the devotees can reach the Ganga easily.” The district administration has already divided the ghats in 21 sectors and deputed magistrates and police personnel to monitor the works being done there for Chhath. PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma, deputy development commissioner Richie Pandey, additional collector (revenue) Rajiv Srivastava and other officers also accompanied the DM to the ghats.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/pvt-boats-not-to-ply-in-ganga-during-chhath-festivities-dm/articleshow/87315529.cms||Faryal Rumi

The ganja was found hidden in a vehicle carrying coconuts. Chinturu police station inspector G Yuva Kumar and Mothugudem PS sub-inspector V Sathi Babu were checking vehicles on Sukumamidi bridge and stopped the coconut-loaded van for checking. While two persons were arrested from the van, another person who was piloting the van in a car, was also apprehended after a brief chase. Two of those arrested, Kadiyam Guru Sagar and Pogidala Parvathalu, are from Khammam district in Telangana, while the third person Naini Rama Rao is from Malkangiri district in Odisha. Chinturu ASP G Krishnakanth said stepped-up vigil by the police in the Agency areas has led to seizure of large quantities of ganja over the last three months. “Ganja traders are finding new ways to dodge the police. One of the gang members goes a little ahead in a car or bike and informs the vehicle carrying ganja behind if there are any police checks-posts. But we will continue to outsmart them,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/ganja-worth-rs-2-cr-seized-in-eg-dist/articleshow/87317017.cms||Samson Raj

The pricing gives the company a valuation of between Rs 44,250 crore and Rs 46,125 crore ($5.9-6.2 billion). This values the firm at more than the Rs 25,923-crore market cap of New India Assurance — the country’s largest non-life insurer. The IPO comprises a fresh issue of Rs 3,750-crore equity shares and an offer for sale (OFS) of about Rs 1,960 crore by existing shareholders. As part of the OFS, SoftBank (SVF Python II - Cayman) will sell shares worth Rs 1,875 crore. SoftBank will sell up to a quarter of the nearly 16% stake it holds in the company. The founders will also sell shares of around Rs 58 crore in the IPO. The proceeds from the IPO will be used for funding strategic investments and acquisitions, expanding presence outside India and general corporate purposes. Policybazaar, which started out as a comparison website that generated leads for insurance companies, has evolved into a platform that allows users to search, buy, renew and lodge claims. After receiving an insurance broking licence, the company has expanded its offline presence for distribution. “We have got 12.6 crore annual visits, which is significant considering that we are not an entertainment website,” said Policybazaar founder Yashish Dahiya. According to him, the protection gap in India (gap between required sum insured and total sum insured) is 83% compared to 70% in China and 48% in the US, and 63% of payments for healthcare are made out of pocket. “The total sum insured from our policies in FY21 was Rs 7 lakh crore and the premium was Rs 4,701 crore from 48 insurance partners,” said Dahiya. In terms of revenue, it is bigger than several insurance companies. Besides the insurance vertical, the company distributes loans through Paisabazaar in partnership with 56 banks and fintech firms. Dahiya said that while Policybazaar would work closely with insurance companies the focus would be on the consumer and it would continue to uphold its ethos, which was to bring transparency into the market. “Of our global investors, besides Intel Cap, none of them have exited the company. All investors are firmly staying invested,” said Dahiya. He added that given the growth potential in India, the company would not be a mature business even after five years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/policybazaars-rs-5710cr-ipo-gives-co-valuation-of-6bn/articleshow/87318841.cms||---

AP Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) has readied the stage to invite tenders as it is waiting for final clearance from the judicial preview commission. The government has fixed the reserve price for all six zones at Rs 5,882 crore. The bidders have to collect the seigniorage and mineral consideration charges from the licensees after remitting the bid amount to the state government. The government recently handed over sand mining and sale to a private agency through open tender and has now decided to hand over the collection of seigniorage and consideration charges from minor mineral quarry owners to private agencies. Previously, the mines and geology department collected seigniorage from the licensees. However, the government later found that the mines and geology department was unable to prevent illegal excavation and transport by the licensees. The government came to the conclusion that massive irregularities were taking place at the field level, causing huge revenue loss to the exchequer. While staff crunch in the department is said to be the prime reason, the alleged nexus between miners and some senior officials is another reason cited for quarry owners to resort to irregularities. It was also found that illegal extraction by miners was causing irreparable damage to the environment as miners were digging four times deeper than the permitted depth and taking out minerals in violation of the guidelines. The state government has studied practices followed in different states and decided to go with some of the best practices followed in Karnataka and Odisha to hand over cess collection to private agencies. The state government is also hopeful of garnering additional revenue through the new system. The north-coastal districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam have been included in package-I while East Godavari and West Godavari districts have been clubbed into package-II. Krishna and Guntur will be in zone-III. The mineral rich Prakasam district has been bracketed into an exclusive zone-IV. While Nellore and Chittoor are in zone-V, Anantapur, Kurnool and Kadapa comprise zone-VI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/ap-to-enlist-pvt-bodies-for-mineral-collection/articleshow/87316962.cms||Samdani MN

The typed letter bore two names as senders— that of Mohua Ghosh, CU’s head of the department of chemical technology, and Gourhari Mishra, a contractual employee in the department’s lab. Denying any role in this, Mohua saisd she was “surprised, ashamed and hurt” and upset that she was named in the threat letter. The letter, which reached the CU VC, read, “Madam, your husband will be killed, and nobody can save the life of your husband.” CU VC Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee declined comment. “The matter is being investigated by police,” she said. Chakravarti Banerjee’s intimation to police had been treated as a formal FIR and a case has been registered against “unknown persons” at the Hare Street police station. “The FIR has incorporated sections 170 (personating a public servant), 500 (defamation), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 419 (cheating by personation) of IPC,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Ghosh said she had no idea of the incident. “Mishra works in my lab. But I came to know of the incident from others and after reading newspapers. I am equally surprised, ashamed, and hurt. The police are probing and let the truth come out. I do not wish to speak on Mishra now. But tell me, if anyone wants to threaten, will anyone reveal his real identity? I do not know how to react. I guess the authorities went to the cops as they felt the need to do so,” Ghosh told reporters. But she refused to share more details on Mishra. TOI couldn’t speak to Mishra. According to sources, Mishra had joined during the pandemic. CU sources said science secretary Amit Roy had spoken to Ghosh. Sources claimed Ghosh had told Roy she was taken aback and she could not believe Mishra could act this way. But Roy declined to say whether he had spoken to Ghosh or not.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cu-prof-ashamed-hurt-denies-role-in-alapan-death-threat-letter/articleshow/87319301.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The PMCH interns submitted an application to the superintendent, Dr IS Thakur, with a request to raise their stipend. They also threatened to go on indefinite strike to press for their demand. Assuring them to forward their demand to the health department, Thakur said the healthcare services were not affected anyway as the interns discharged their duties as usual. Sumit Kumar, an intern, said Rs15,000 per month is being paid to them as stipend while it is around Rs27,000 per month at IGIMS. He said the stipend amount of Rs500 per day was lower than the wage of a skilled labourer. The interns at NMCH, too, staged protest with banners demanding revision of stipend. They said the government should maintain uniformity in this regard. The protesting interns also recalled their tireless service to save lives in the second phase of the Covid pandemic early this year. NMCH medical superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh, however, said no delegation of interns met him with any grievance. “All OPDs, surgeries and other clinical services functioned as usual,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/pmch-nmch-interns-demand-hike-in-stipend/articleshow/87315512.cms||VK Tripathi

The current round was led by General Atlantic and also included participation from Canada’s largest pension fund CPPIB and Lightspeed Growth as well as existing investors Intact Ventures and Munich Re Ventures. Acko’s total funds raised till now stand at $450 million. Previously, the insurer had raised capital from Amazon, Accel, Elevation, Ascent Capital, Intact Ventures, Munich Re Ventures and Flipkart’s co-founder Binny Bansal, among others. “We were keen on investors who run regulated businesses or are partners to companies that run regulated businesses. Both General Atlantic and Canada Pension have investment in regulated financial services,” said Acko founder & CEO Varun Dua. “A big part of this investment will go into scaling our health insurance vertical. Almost half of the capital might end up focusing on the health insurance side.” Acko has the largest market share in embedded insurance products like mobility & gadget insurance across large digital consumer platforms like Amazon, MakeMyTrip, Ola, Urban Company and Bajaj Finance. In addition, Acko covers nearly a million gig workers in the country through partnerships with companies, including Zomato and Swiggy. “There is a digitally native population that will continue to grow. We would like to be the destination for protection for these customers,” said Dua. He added that he expected premium income to cross Rs 1,200 crore in FY22 and more than double to Rs 2,600 crore in FY23. Unlike rivals, Acko plans to remain focused on the consumer segment and does not intend to use its balance sheet to take on industrial risks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/insurer-acko-34th-indian-unicorn-in-2021/articleshow/87318819.cms||Mayur Shetty

Leaders fell silent at the stroke of 5 pm on the day as the Election Commission ordered the closure of the campaign, 72 hours before the polling, which is scheduled for October 30. The leaders who have been camping in the constituency campaigning for their candidates for all these days packed their bags and left, leaving the ground for the candidates. Election observers and the police started enforcing silent hours and preparing the ground for peaceful polls. Leaders of the ruling YSR Congress made last-minute efforts by addressing media conferences. Minister Adimulapu Suresh and senior legislator Ambati Rambabu termed the election as an opportunity to express support for chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s welfare governance. They wanted voters to teach other candidates and political parties, who have been making false promises and spreading misinformation about the government, a lesson. BJP state president Somu Veerraju, who addressed the press after the campaign ended, asserted the party’s victory in the by-election. He said people are looking towards the BJP leadership and the central government for the development of their area. He said the victory of the BJP in the by-election was a certainty. “Badvel will rewrite the history of Andhra Pradesh by electing the BJP candidate in the by-election,” the BJP state chief said. This is the third by-election in Badvel assembly constituency since 1952. The first by-election was held in 1963 following the death of sitting MLA Vaddemanu Chidanandam of Swatantra Party. The second by-election was held in 2001 due to the death of sitting MLA Bijivemula Veera Reddy of TDP. Now, the third by-election is scheduled to be held on October 30, 2021 following the death of sitting MLA G Venkata Subbaiah of YSR Congress.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/badvel-falls-silent-as-hectic-high-decibel-campaign-ends/articleshow/87316998.cms||Gopi Dara

Identified as Golu Kumar Singh (24), the slain youth was a native of Bahadurpur village and accused in two murder cases and a firing incident. He was first shot in the shoulder and then in the head from a very close range. He was rushed to a nearby private hospital, but the doctors declared him brought dead. According to police, Golu had come out of jail after being granted bail by a court almost three months ago. He had opened fire at the entrance of Saidpur Hostel a few months back. Bahadurpur police station SHO Sanovar Khan said Golu was going to the Patna Junction by a bike to drop his maternal uncle when he was intercepted by two men. “They had a scuffle with Golu which he tried to resist. Later, one of the men pulled out a pistol and shot him. His uncle is an eyewitness to the incident,” he added. Police suspect that Golu’s murder is a fallout of his rivalry with some inmates of Saidpur Hostel. “Police are going through the CCTV camera footages of the neighbouring areas to identify the killers and arrest them,” the SHO said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/24-year-old-youth-shot-in-patna-city/articleshow/87317367.cms||---

With shops and traders going soft on buyers without insisting on wearing facemask, the streets continue to remain the most vulnerable to the spread of the pandemic. With only a week left for the people to complete their festive purchase, NSB road, Teppakulam, Mainguard gate and Big Bazaar street have been overflowing with buyers. The significant fall in fresh infections has caused a lax attitude among the people, similar to that which prevailed before the onset of the second wave. A visit to the commercial streets would reveal that at least four-five among every 10 people are either not wearing facemask or have it drawn down to their throat. “We still have people who are unvaccinated and some who have not completed their second dose. The facemask is vital while going out in a crowded place even if social distancing is not possible,” a medical officer with Trichy corporation said. “Penalisation for non-adherence to face masks is continuing in commercial establishments. Some shops were penalised even Rs 5,000, and this will intensify in the commercial streets,” a health official with the civic body added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/traders-not-insisting-buyers-wear-mask/articleshow/87319302.cms||---

---||Trichy||Call to regulate street vendors as Diwali sales spell chaos in Trichy||TRICHY: Two years after Trichy corporation published the final roll of street vendors surveyed in all the 65 wards, the street vending committee to regulate them and facilitate amenities remains a farce. The delay in constituting the committee and holding election to appoint representatives of street vendors has cost the urban local body a revenue of Rs 50 lakh — the likely amount which it could have netted as user fee from vendors if the committee was formed. Apart from delaying the amenities assured for street vendors such as restrooms and generation of income for the civic body, the common public is also frustrated at leaving the vendors unregulated. With street vendors all-out to make the most of Diwali sales by establishing shops haphazardly on the commercial roads and adjoining arterial roads, traffic snarls have been been routine, the city traffic police said. The situation would not have arisen had the civic body amended the Tamil Nadu Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) scheme. According to it, a committee comprising corporation, police, NGOs and representatives of street vendors will be formed to earmark permitted and prohibited sites for street vendors to do business. Six members from among street vendors will be elected to represent the group in receiving loans and ensuring rights. Narrow sections will not be utilised for business to avoid traffic bottlenecks. The election has been delayed since 2019 for various reasons thanks to the lack of coordination and cooperation between corporation and street vendors. In the absence of amenities, most of the vendors openly urinate in the markets and commercial streets. Justifying the non-constitution of the vending committee, the civic body said a section of street vendors has obtained a stay order from Madras high court alleging that the enumeration process is incomplete. “We will try to constitute the town vending committee before Pongal. Lack of unity among street vendors is the issue,” a senior corporation official said. However, the fact remains that the civic body was reluctant to constitute the committee even when there was no legal hurdle. Street vendors’ representatives opined that the civic body could host peace talks with the disgruntled vendors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/call-to-regulate-street-vendors-as-diwali-sales-spell-chaos-in-trichy/articleshow/87319298.cms||Deepak Karthik

Son of labourers, he was allotted BTech Chemical Engineering at the online counselling held on Wednesday. “I am extremely happy to have been allotted chemical engineering. Getting into IIT was my dream and it has come true. NIT Trichy students guided me during the counselling,” Arun Kumar told TOI. He has secured an IIT-H seat under OBC-NCL category in which he secured rank 2,503. Sounding confident that he can easily manage campus life without facing any language barriers, Arun Kumar, who was a student of Sevalpatty government higher secondary school, said he was keen to enrol in IIT-Madras. “If there are unallotted seats in IIT-Madras and If I get a chance, I will opt for the institute irrespective of the course available,” he added. Amid several odds including poverty, the boy had undergone coaching since 2019 under IGNITTE, the teaching club of NIT-Trichy which helps economically backward and government school students clear competitive examinations. While the club has previously helped rural students get into NITs, this is the first time a government school student coached by it secured IIT admission. Having cleared JEE (advanced) in his first attempt, Arun Kumar’s family was worried about sourcing money for paying his tuition fee when he was assured an IIT seat. After TOI reported his achievement on October 23, several entities reached out to him including the district administration and the management of SASTRA University, Thanjavur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/govt-school-boy-gets-seat-in-iit-hyderabad/articleshow/87319282.cms||---
---||India||NCB misled court in Aryan's remand application: Lawyer||MUMBAI: Terming the arrest of Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha in the cruise liner case as illegal, senior counsel Amit Desai told the Bombay high court on Wednesday that enforcement officers violated the rules laid down for bailable offences involving small quantities of drugs for personal consumption. They should have issued a notice as mandated under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for the arrests, he said.  Senior counsel Amit Desai said NCB in its memo on October 3 itself concluded that it was a case of consumption and possession of small quantities which attracts a maximum of one year's imprisonment; it could not have arrested them. "It was bound to have first issued them a notice under Section 41A of CrPC which means they should've been called to give an explanation, not arrested," he said. Follow TOI's live blog for latest updates on Aryan Khan drugs caseHe cited an SC ruling that deprecated unwarranted arrests saying they cause "humiliation'' and a 2014 apex court ruling in Arnesh Kumar which enunciated the principle and sought mandatory enforcement of Section 41A for "all offences that attract less than 7 years' jail term". He cited an Andhra Pradesh HC judgment to say Section 41A applies to cases under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act too. "We (Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant) are arrested for an offence of consumption that has not been committed," said Desai, pointing out that they could only be accused of having an intention to consume. Justice Nitin Sambre of Bombay high court will continue hearing their bail pleas on Thursday. Desai also pointed to the bail granted to two co-accused Avin Sahu and Manish Rajgaria in the same NCB case following the October 2 raid at the international cruise terminal. There was recovery of 2.4 gm of charas from one, and none from the other, NCB said. Desai said on principles of parity since it involves a question of liberty, it can be looked at. He said the heart of the case is the conspiracy charge. "The NCB misled the court at 7pm in its first remand application (on October 3), saying that they were arrested for conspiracy though the arrest memo shows no arrest for conspiracy." He said "conspiracy" defined by jurists requires a meeting of minds prior to an act. For example, he said if two burglars break into the same house independently at the same time, it isn't a conspiracy. Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi for Aryan said in his arrest memo, "there is no mention of any recovery" and a joint possession cannot, in law, be shown. "Grounds must disclose correct facts," and this obligation coupled with the Constitutional and fundamental right under Article 22 (protection from arrest) and Article 21 means that "if there are any constitutional infirmities, it can't be cured by a remand application." Appearing for Merchant, Desai said the cases involving the trio are "individual and unconnected to others." He said "there can be no case of consumption either. Consume is a verb. Their case was at best of intention to consume which is not an offence under section 27 of NDPS Act." He said there should've been no arrest because Aryan had no drugs in his possession; NCB can, at best, establish possession of 6 gm by Arbaaz; and no tests were done to show consumption. "The NCB calls it international drug trafficking which is absurd and false," said Desai. Desai said the arrest memo was identical for Khan and Merchant though the law needs proper grounds to be set out. He said in remand application for Aryan, "they dumped...recoveries from others who were not arrested at the time." He said Aryan, Arbaaz and Munmun were arrested for identical offences of Sections 8(c) read with 20(b) (for possession) and 27 (for consumption). Section 28 (attempt) and 29 (conspiracy) were not on the horizon, which means maximum punishment would be one year. He said there was no case for a conspiracy as they were unconnected with each other with no agreement or meeting of minds. Since these were individual acts of alleged possession and consumption, NCB officers had a duty to first issue notice instead of effecting their arrest, he said. "What is recovered? Only 6 gm from Arbaaz and 5 gm from Munmun, but NCB said 21 gm. There's no connection. No Whatsapp messages and phone calls between them. The trial court rejected bail because NCB alleged commercial quantity recovered from an accused with who these have no connection.'' Advocate Ali Kaashif Khan for Munmun said NCB has misused Section 29. He said she has no connection with anyone else. He too said the arrest memo shows recovery of several alleged drugs, but NCB has not yet pointed out what drugs were recovered from whom.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ncb-misled-court-in-aryans-remand-application-lawyer/articleshow/87321477.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Delhi||Govt advocates return to tradition through ‘patakhe nahi, diye jalao’||New Delhi: Delhi government has started ‘patakhe nahi, diye jalao’ campaign to motivate people to embrace tradition and eliminate pollution. Environment minister Gopal Rai launched the campaign on Tuesday by lighting diyas at his residence and appealed to people not to buy firecrackers. Rai said the Kejriwal government will encourage people to celebrate Diwali with diyas — just like those times when crackers did not exist at all. Rai said, “Pollution levels in Delhi are very high around Diwali due to stubble burning in neighbouring states and the use of crackers during Diwali becomes fatal. It can be very dangerous for elderly and children. To eliminate this source of pollution, the AAP government has already ordered a complete ban on sale and use of firecrackers.” Appealing to Delhiites, Rai said Diwali is celebrated by lighting diyas and crackers only contribute to pollution. “We have to celebrate Diwali with great joy and zeal, but at the same time, make sure that we are not polluting our beloved state of Delhi. Therefore, it is an appeal to the children, parents, teachers and responsible citizens of Delhi not to make firecrackers synonymous with Diwali. This is a matter that concerns our life. The atmosphere post-Diwali ends up being suffocating instead of being joyous. This situation is extremely critical and we need to take it very seriously,” he said. The minister said this mission can only be successful with public cooperation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/govt-advocates-return-to-tradition-through-patakhe-nahi-diye-jalao/articleshow/87319303.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||WhatsApp chats given to the media: Lawyer tells high court||Mumbai: Bombay high court was informed on Wednesday by the counsel for an accused in the cruise liner drug bust case that alleged Whatsapp chats involving Aryan Khan and others surfaced in the media even before coming on to court records. Amit Desai, arguing Arbaaz Merchant’s bail plea, said “only thing they have argued to keep us in custody is WhatsApp chats. But even with WhatsApp chats there is no evidence.” He said, “I am told that Whatsapp chats get released to the media. We are struggling with those problems of media trials…” Desai added that Punjab and Haryana high court in a NDPS case had held that WhatsApp chats cannot be used as grounds to deny bail without a section 65B certificate (for authentication) under the Evidence Act. He said the NCB showed no seizure memo for the phones and merely said they were handed over voluntarily. The law is “that the integrity of the devices are to be maintained.” Mukul Rohatgi added that, “on WhatsApp chats I am handicapped. They have the chats, yet they choose to mislead the court.” — Swati Deshpande||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/whatsapp-chats-given-to-the-media-lawyer-tells-high-court/articleshow/87319306.cms||---

Police have arrested both the accused. Police identified the deceased as a resident of Soozhiyakottai near Ammapettai. She was unmarried and used to graze goats every day. She left the house at 8 am and returned by 6 pm. On Monday morning also, she left home with the goats as usual. However, she did not return till late in the evening and only the goats came back. Her parents and relatives launched a search in and around the village when they camea cross her half-naked body at a secluded place on the outskirts of the village. Her dress was torn and there were injuries all over her body, police said. On information, Ammapettai police reached the spot, retrieved the body and sent it to Papanasam government hospital for postmortem. Experts from the forensic department conducted a search on the spot where the body was lying and found that there was a bait stick on the banks of the Vadavaru river nearby. Based on the clue, police commenced the investigation. Meanwhile, it came to light that T Periyaswami, 30, a native of the same village, was seen engaged in fishing using the bait stick in the river where the woman was grazing goats. Police secured him and during interrogation, Periyasamy told police that while he was fishing in the river, he noticed the woman alone with her goats. He forcefully took her to a secluded place and raped her.

---||Ahmedabad||Auda drafted highest number of TP schemes in past 5 years||Ahmedabad: In over two decades the highest number of town planning schemes — those which form the basis for future urban planning and development of a particular area in a city — were passed in past 5 years. Recently Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority presented a report where it claimed that between 2016 and 2020 some 80 town planning maps were prepared covering an area of 11,441 hectares. Of these, 28 plans have received final sanction from the state government for an area of 2,611 hectares. Till 2000, only 40 TP schemes were prepared by Auda. But between 2001 and 2015 during each 5-year-term, 43, 40 and 42 TP schemes were prepared by Auda. The TP scheme is a crucial planning tool which allows appropriation of land for public purposes such as building street networks, social amenities and other infrastructure. It helps organize urban growth in a planned manner. Senior officials claim that this has lot to do with the different phases of the city’s expansion. The first development plan of 1965 had proposed a ring-shaped 240m wide green belt extension. Subsequently, a new plan proposed an expansion of 8.4 sq km. This was in a year when the total municipal area was 93 sq km. Today, the urban agglomerate area of the city, including Auda areas, is around 1,900 sq km with a covering 9% of the total land cover. “The aim of green belt was to restrict urban sprawl and balance open versus built development and act as a sink for urban pollution,” claims a World Bank paper authored by Madhu Bharti and Shagun Mehrotra. But this proposal met with resistance as landowners were unhappy with AMC’s compensation and challenged the plan in court. In the 1980s and 1990s the report states, the city rapidly expanded beyond municipal limits, leading to fragmented urban expansion, particularly along the western fringes of the city. “This was partly attributed to the Urban Land Ceiling Act, 1976, which led to artificial rise in land prices within city limits. Over time, many encroached on these green belt reserves to build houses,” states the paper. The green belt was conceptualized in 2001 revised plan to facilitate integrated urban development along city’s metropolitan periphery.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/auda-drafted-highest-number-of-tp-schemes-in-past-5-years/articleshow/87318454.cms||---

---||Delhi||Order asking undertrials to pay Rs 10L to escort staff nixed||New Delhi: A Delhi court has set aside an order by which two undertrial prisoners were directed to pay more than Rs 10 lakh in salary to their escort staff while they were out on parole in a cheating case. Additional sessions judge Parveen Singh said the magistrate court, while directing the couple to comply with the demand of the police to pay the amount, acted beyond its jurisdiction. On January 17, 2020, the magistrate court had granted the couple custody parole for seven days, which was extended till January 31 and thereafter they surrendered before the jail authority. They borne all the expenses of the escort staff such as fooding, lodging, and travelling. Their counsel stated that on July 2, 2021, the Third Battalion asked them to pay Rs 10.6 lakh in lieu of salary of the escort party. The counsel contended that they had not taken any escort party in their private capacity and it was assigned to them as per the direction of the jail authority and that at the time of appointing the escort staff, the jail authority had not whispered about the salaries of the escort staff to them. The police had submitted that in the magistrate court’s order, it was directed that “applicants shall bear the costs of travelling, food, and other expenses of the guards.” The instructions of the government clearly stipulate the amount which is to be charged in case of providing guards and the charges have been levied as per those instructions, they added. ASJ Parveen Singh noted in his order on October 26 that it was correct that while granting custody parole to the revisionists, the magistrate court had directed that they would be liable to bear the cost of food, travelling and other expenses of the guards and there was no dispute that the cost of travel and food has been borne by them. The dispute was with regard to the expression ‘other expenses’, the court said. “A bare reading of the Delhi Prison Rules provides that a prisoner, in case of being granted custody parole, is only liable to pay for the cost of transportation and no other liability for payment of salary/ honorarium in lieu of guards being deployed can be charged.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/order-asking-undertrials-to-pay-rs-10l-to-escort-staff-nixed/articleshow/87346327.cms||Usha Das
---||Ahmedabad||IT, pharma, real estate sectors enter gifting mode||Ahmedabad: With offices opening and markets functioning almost as usual, the trend of corporate gifting has picked up pace in the run-up to Diwali. Real estate developers, IT and pharmaceutical companies, which have a sizeable budget for corporate gifts, are leading the pack. However, companies that specialize in corporate gifts suggest that while order volumes have revived, overall budgets have shrunk by at least 40%. Ravi Parekh, founder of a corporate gifting company, said, “The market is very good post-Navratri and orders from corporates have started pouring in since then. However, budgets have reduced drastically as companies in some sectors are still in revival mode. The order volumes are good. IT companies have particularly increased their budgets for employee gifting whereas pharma companies too are spending well on corporate gifts for clients.” Electronic items including power banks, temperature-sensing water bottles and wireless chargers are largely in demand. The focus has clearly shifted away from dry fruits and sweets which were once popular among corporates for Diwali gifts. Gourmet food products ranging from imported coffee, handmade chocolates, sherbets, a variety of flavoured teas, organic and vegan gourmet food are being widely preferred for gifting. A number of hotels in the city have also launched their gifting range including candles, sweets, savouries, and confectioneries. “Several financial institutions, banks and even embassies are placing bulk orders for our Diwali gifting range. At the same time, several guests have also been purchasing these for their family and friends,” said Jaideep Anand, general manager of a Gandhinagar-based luxury hotel. Industry estimates suggest that the annual corporate gifting business in Gujarat is at least worth Rs 1,000 crore, of which a minimum of 40% takes place during Diwali. Those getting gifting orders indicate that clients are asking for a lot of customisation and uniqueness. “Clients require a personal touch and customisation. Since we specialise in traditional regional foods, we get orders to create customised hampers with local sweets and savouries for clients. For instance, if a client is from West Bengal, then the hamper will comprise of specialty foods from West Bengal,” said Harmit Singh, founder of a city-based retailer of regional food products. Small businesses, food entrepreneurs gain big from corporate orders As corporate budgets have shrunk this time, and the need for personalising gifts have increased, a number of small businesses, home chefs and bakers are gaining from the corporate gifting trend this Diwali. For instance, Aditi Shishoo, whose e-commerce venture retailing speciality nuts and spices from Kashmir is less than a year old, bagged many corporate orders. “My venture is new and the response this time has been phenomenal. We are catering to at least 10 corporates this time with orders from pharma and automobile sectors among others. The Kashmiri saffron and shilajit — a herb and mineral formulation — are a hit in Diwali gifting hampers,” she said. Similar is the case with many home chefs. “Many people have started their own food ventures which are doing great this Diwali. Corporates want to stand out so they seek unique gifting options for clients. Several home or small entrepreneurs are preferred not just for the customisation but also because they will walk the extra mile,” said Rohan Bhatt, a city-based food entrepreneur and co-founder of an online community of food lovers. Sargam Manjawala, founder of a home-style baking studio, said, “Clients ask for food products that are non-perishable and unique. I have got an order for vegan biscotti and fennel sherbet from one of my clients this time.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/it-pharma-real-estate-sectors-enter-gifting-mode/articleshow/87318462.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mystery man in alleged NCB payoff turns out to be a fake||Mumbai: The mysterious ‘Sam D’Souza’, whose name cropped up in allegations of a pay-off to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in the Aryan Khan case, has turned out to be a Palghar resident whose profile was apparently misused to create a fake identity. Hanik Bafna (35) on Monday submitted a complaint to the Palghar police superintendent after he began receiving calls regarding his alleged involvement in the drugs case. He has sought police help saying his photo and phone number were misused by a witness in the case, Prabhakar Sail, who claimed he overheard a man named Sam D’Souza and another witness in the same case, K P Gosavi, discuss a Rs 25-crore payoff to spring Aryan out of jail on October 3. Bafna said his WhatsApp display picture and a decade-old phone number were circulated as that of D’Souza’s. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had subsequently claimed that the man identified as D’Souza was the biggest player in money laundering and was well connected with politicians. In a complaint to Sahar police, Sail had said that of the Rs 18 crore to be collected to get Aryan released, Rs 8 crore was to be paid to NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. He said Gosavi had handed over a bag containing Rs 38 lakh to D’Souza. Gosavi's selfie with Aryan had gone viral after the latter’s arrest. In his complaint, Bafna has said he met Sail a few months ago for a business deal that did not materialise. He had come in contact with Sail through the latter's brother Satish in 2019. Bafna said they exchanged phone numbers but did not stay in touch. He said on October 3, the date mentioned by Sail in his affidavit, he was in Palghar. He has asked the cops to check CCTV images to verify his movements. He denied receiving Rs 38 lakh. Bafna, a longtime resident of Palghar, is currently on bail after spending two months in jail in a cheating case a few years ago. Police said they are verifying his claims. No FIR has been registered. Bafna said after his photograph was circulated in the context of the case, he began receiving calls from family and friends. Manish Bhanushali, the BJP worker who was among the witnesses of the drugs bust case, had also said he had seen a Sam D’Souza on the ship but did not know if any money was paid to him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-mystery-man-in-alleged-ncb-payoff-turns-out-to-be-a-fake/articleshow/87319324.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Dalit family attacked for praying at temple in Kutch||RAJKOT: Six members of a Dalit family, who were offering prayers at a temple’s installation ceremony in their village in Kutch, were allegedly attacked by a mob from upper caste communities. A mob of 19 to 20 people attacked Govind Vaghela, a farmer who also runs a provision store at Ner village near Bhachau and his uncle Ganesh at their farm. Later, the mob allegedly even targeted his family members who were at home. Upon learning that cows have damaged his crops, Vaghela and his uncle rushed to the farm and when no sooner they reached, a mob suddenly appeared from behind the bushes and attacked the duo. Vaghela told police that the attackers beat them with wooden sticks, pipes, axe and sickle and threatened to kill him and his family for turning up at the temple during the installation ceremony. In the melee, one of the attackers also robbed Vaghela’s mobile phone and damaged his autorickshaw too. The duo, however, managed to escape from the farm but after reaching some distance, duo collapsed. When Vaghela gained consciousness, he found himself was being taken to a government hospital in Bhachau. After the attack on the duo at the farm, the mob went to Vaghela’s house and thrashed his father Jaga, mother Badhi, brother Bhura and cousin Hasmukh mercilessly. The four injured persons were also taken to government hospital in Bhachau from where all six victims were referred to Bhuj General Hospital. Police said the family had offered prayers at the temple’s installation ceremony that was conducted from October 18 to 20. Two FIRs were registered — one of attempt to murder, rioting, assault, trespassing, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation, and another under sections of Arms Act and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act — based on Vaghela and his father Jaga’s complaints. In his complaint, Vaghela mentioned that the attackers were angry because they did not pay heed to the warning of not turning up at the temple and went there. “When we went to the temple, the attackers held a meeting wherein it was decided to set the bovines free on his farm and then attack our family,” Vaghela stated. Offences have been registered against Kana Ahir, Rajesh Maraj, Dinesh Maraj, Kesra Rabari, Paba Rabari, Chauda Koli, Kana Sadur Koli, Sava Koli, Kana Raghu Koli, Momaya Koli, Rana Balsara, Hema Rabari, Naya Ahir, Arjan Rabari, Navgan Rabari, Bhanji Suthar and around four unidentified persons. “Nine teams of cops have been formed for combing in the village and surrounding regions to nab the attackers,” said deputy superintendent of police K G Zala.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/dalit-family-attacked-for-praying-at-temple-in-kutch/articleshow/87317253.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Five tourists from Bengal die as vehicle falls into gorge in Bageshwar||By Pramod Dalakoti BAGESHWAR: A day after bodies of five Bengal trekkers were retrieved from the Sunderdhunga glacier in Uttarkhand’s Bageshwar, five more tourists from West Bengal, including a husband-wife duo, died in an accident in the district when their vehicle fell into a 100-m gorge on Wednesday. Eleven others, including drivers from Uttarakhand and more tourists from West Bengal, were injured in the accident. Two of them are critical and are being treated at Bageshwar district hospital. Five of them were given first aid and four received minor injuries. According to Vineet Kumar, district magistrate (Bageshwar), three 'tempo travelers' with Bengal tourists were on their way from Munsiyari to Kausani when at a perilous turn the first tempo slammed its brakes suddenly and the one following it crashed into it. The DM explained that the first vehicle may have developed a snag. Local authorities as well as the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) rushed to the spot and helped some passengers to safety. The dead tourists have been identified as Subrata Bhattacharya (61) and his wife Runa Bhattacharya (56), residents of Durgapur Steel Plant, Bardhaman; Kishore Ghatak (59), Saoni Chakraborty (55) and Chandana Khan (64), all from Asansol.

---||Nagpur||City to have 9-10 more corporators||Nagpur: The state cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal to increase the number of elected representatives in civic bodies. Following the decision, the number of corporators is likely to go up by 9-10 in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Earlier, the minimum number of corporators in a municipal corporation was 65 and maximum 175. In view of manifold increase in the population in cities and towns and need to expedite development, the cabinet has increased the minimum number of corporators by 17%. i.e. from 65 earlier to 76. As per the cabinet decision, average growth in population from 2011 to date will be considered for revising the number of corporators as census could not take place in 2021 following Covid-19 pandemic. At present, the NMC has 151 corporators. As per NMC officials, the city’s average population is around 28.6-29 lakh. After the decision, the minimum number of corporators will be 156 and maximum 168 for a city with population between 24 lakh and 30 lakh. As per the formula decided, one corporator will represent 50,000 people. With this, the NMC is likely to get nine more corporators if the population is considered as 28.6 lakh and 10 more corporators if the population is counted as 29 lakh. Following the change, the total number of elected representatives in NMC is likely to increase to 160-161. Accordingly, the number of wards will also increase. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government had recently revised the ward system from four members per ward to three members. Accordingly, the city was supposed to get 50 wards — 49 wards with three members and one four-member ward. If the number of corporators stands at 160, there will be 53 wards, of which 52 will have three members and one with four members. In case of 161 corporators, the city is likely to be divided in 54 wards, 53 with three members and one ward with two members. Exact numbers, however, will be known after the notification is issued by the state’s urban development department in coming days. Apart from elected corporators, the NMC also has five co-opted corporators.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/city-to-have-9-10-more-corporators/articleshow/87317240.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Ahmedabad||Occupant’s name to be removed from residential property tax bill||Ahmedabad: In order to simplify the process of property tax payment and reduce unnecessary application burden on its staff, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s revenue and tax department has decided to remove property occupant’s name from residential property tax bills. “Right now, the bills bear residential property owner’s name as well as of the individual who occupies it. Property tax amount remains unchanged regardless of whether the property is occupied by the owner or if has been given on rent,” said Jainik Vakil, chairman of AMC’s revenue committee. Vakil said that the department gets applications to change occupant’s name in the bill whenever tenants change. “This causes unnecessary problems for the tax-payer and also increases the workload of the staff. So, we have decided to remove the name of the occupant from the bill. Henceforth, it will only carry name of the property owner,” Vakil said. He added that with this step, the revenue department is expecting a decrease of 25% of applications from what it receives today. Vakil added that the name of the occupant will be mentioned only where ownership of property is not clear. “Properties like chawls, shanties, AMC, union government properties and properties on revenue limits will be exceptions to the new rule,” he said. The department is also considering reducing number of documents for various tax-related procedures. “As of now, the department receives applications for around 15 types of tax-related procedures for which they have to submit around 12 documents. We are considering reducing the number of documents to only three or four,” Vakil said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/occupants-name-to-be-removed-from-residential-property-tax-bill/articleshow/87318469.cms||---

Granting more time to police, a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh sought status of cases that were going on in the trial court, including the number of chargesheets filed, charges framed, trial commenced and the number of witnesses examined. It listed the matter on December 23 several petitions, which alleged that ruthless and excessive use of force and aggression was unleashed by police and paramilitary forces on students within the university on December 13 and 15, 2019. The petitioners are lawyers, Jamia students, residents of Okhla in south Delhi and the Imam of Jama Masjid mosque opposite Parliament House, who have sought setting up of an SIT, Commission of Inquiry (CoI) or a fact-finding committee, medical treatment, compensation, and interim protection from arrest for the students, and registration of FIRs against the erring police officers. On their part, police have opposed the plea for setting up an SIT or a CoI to investigate the incidents saying it would “amount to supplanting the law” and pointed out that chargesheets had already been filed in connection with the violence. Responding to the allegations of police entering the varsity without permission, the counsel had said, internationally police were not denied access to educational institutions and universities. About providing compensation to students who were injured, he had said it could be awarded only if there was an admission of the breach, and in the present case the issue was still being examined.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-seeks-status-of-pending-jamia-violence-cases/articleshow/87346362.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Shoan outshines Siva||Bengaluru: Karnataka youngsters Shoan Ganguly and Siva S brought out their competitive best in the 200m medley event at the Senior National Aquatics Championships here on Wednesday. In a race which went down to the wire at the Basavanagudi Aquatic Centre, Shoan’s late surge saw him edge out Siva for the gold.Siva was the first off the blocks, breaking away from the pack in the first 50m butterfly event and made the turn for the backstroke event with a healthy lead and Shoan in the second place. In the butterfly event, Shoan began to cut Siva’s lead and in the final 25 metres of the last lap — freestyle — he pulled away and touched pad in 2:07.37, pushing Siva (2:07.79) to the second place. RSPB’s Robin Singh T Emil (2:12.51) settled for the bronze.“In butterfly and backstroke, he was almost a body length in front. In breaststroke, I tried to get back, but couldn't. But in the freestyle leg, I was confident I could catch him,” said Shoan.SRIHARI SHATTERS RECORDOlympian Srihari Nataraj continued to set the pool on fire, eclipsing the 100m freestyle record twice. First in the morning heats and then the finals. The 20-year-old, who trains under seasoned coach Nihar Ameen, was a cut above his competitors.In the heats, Srihari, with a time of 50.17 seconds, broke Virdhawal Khade’s mark of 50.53 recorded in 2012. He returned in the evening to dominate the two-lap race and dipped the national mark further, going sub-50 seconds and coming home in 49.94.“Going into the heats, I was enjoying the moment. Wanted to go the same time in both 50s, but that did not happen. In the final, the goal was to get the best Indian time,” an elated Srihari said.Delhi’s Kushagra Rawat rewrote a second national record in as many days. In a lopsided 800m freestyle event, the 21-year-old won gold in 8:08.32 to better his own mark of 8:09.47, set in 2019.“For the 800m, I was expecting a much better time. But I am happy with the overall show as it was a new record. I did not have anyone as a pace-setter as I was swimming all alone by myself. I came back from US in July, having learned a lot about my swimming. I applied those things after coming here. I know I can go still better than this,” pointed out the SRCC, Delhi University graduate.Results: Men: 800m freestyle: 1. Kushagra Rawat (Del; 8:08.32; NR), 2. Aneesh S Gowda (Kar; 8:23.89), 3.

---||Nagpur||Driving schools to hike fees as rising fuel prices dent biz||Nagpur: Leading driving schools in the city are mulling to increase fees to overcome rising expenses and falling profit margins citing several reasons like fuel price hikes, drop in number of driving licence seekers approaching them for training and higher rentals of offices. Most driving schools TOI spoke to claimed that the rising fuel prices, which constitute a significant portion of the monthly variable cost, are adversely impacting their businesses. “We had not increased the fees for the last many years, but due to 30% decline in the number of applicants for driving training and petrol prices crossing Rs112 per litre, things are becoming increasingly difficult to manage,” said Manish Wazalwar, founder director of Wazalwar Driving School. Currently most driving schools in the city are charging about Rs6,000 for a full course (light motor vehicles), while Wazalwar Driving School charges Rs4,200. “From November 1, our school will charge Rs5,000 as fees for the training,” said Wazalwar. Nagpur Driving School Association president Rajendra Gour said most schools affiliated to the association have unanimously decided to revise the fees upwards. “The members have agreed that they would revise the fees from January 1, 2022. Already, the pandemic and rising prices of all commodities have hit the citizens very hard. Earlier, we had decided to increase the fees from November 1,” he said. Most of the driving school owners said the continuous fuel price hikes have significantly dented the profits. Desai Driving School also plans to increase the training fees post-Diwali. Refusing to divulge his identity, a representative from the school admitted that expenses to manage a driving school have increased manifold. “Now, we are left with no option but to increase the fees,” said the owners. Some driving schools, as part of their cost cutting drive, have stopped providing complimentary pick-and-drop services to trainees. Wazalwar Driving School has shut five offices across the city to curtail losses. Wazalwar said due to the pandemic, he has seen 30% drop in the number of trainees in his school. Gour put the blame for the sharp decline in the number of licence seekers approaching driving schools on illegal means of procuring driving licences with the help of touts in the transport department. According to Gour, the malpractice of procuring driving licence is making city roads unsafe with a sharp increase in road accidents. He also said even the fees for getting trained to drive heavy vehicles will also be revised from the existing Rs15,000 to Rs17,000. Wazalwar added: “It is not only about higher fuel prices. Even the rentals of accommodation facilities that we take on lease for offices and prices of spare parts and maintenance cost of vehicles have gone up significantly.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/driving-schools-to-hike-fees-as-rising-fuel-prices-dent-biz/articleshow/87317285.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Bengaluru||Astronomers find evidence of possible planet outside Milky Way||Bengaluru: Astronomers using Nasa’s Chandra X-ray Observatory have found evidence for a possible planet candidate in the M51 — “Whirlpool” — galaxy, and have said it potentially represents what would be the first planet seen to transit a star outside of the Milky Way. The researchers used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to detect the dimming of X-rays from an “X-ray binary”, a system where a Sun-like star is in orbit around a neutron star or black hole. The authors interpret this dimming as being a planet passing in front of the neutron star or black hole, according to an official statement.“Looking for the dimming of a star’s light as something passes in front of it is called the transit technique. For years, scientists have discovered exoplanets using transits with optical light telescopes, which detect the range of light humans can see with their eyes and more. This includes both ground-based telescopes and space-based ones like Nasa’s Kepler mission. These optical light transit detections require very high levels of sensitivity because the planet is much smaller than the star it passes in front of, and, therefore, only a tiny fraction of the light is blocked,” the note reads.The scenario of a transit in an X-ray binary is different, the astronomers said. And it’s because a potential planet is close in size to the X-ray source around the neutron star or black hole, a transiting planet passing along Earth’s line of sight could temporarily block most or all of the X-rays. “This makes it possible to spot transits at greater distances — including beyond the Milky Way — than current optical light studies using transits,” the note reads. The researchers have also released graphics and illustrations. The left panel (see image) shows M51 in X-rays from Chandra and optical light from Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope. A box marks the location of the possible planet candidate, an X-ray binary known as M51-ULS-1. An artist’s illustration in the right panel depicts the X-ray binary and possible planet. Material from the companion star (white and blue in illustration) is pulled onto the neutron star or black hole, forming a disk around the dense object (red and orange). The material near the dense object becomes superheated, causing it to glow in X-ray light (white). The planet is shown beginning to pass in front of this source of X-rays. A separate graphic shows how X-rays from M51-ULS-1 temporarily decrease to zero during the Chandra observations.“While this is a tantalizing study, the case of an exoplanet in M51 is not ironclad. One challenge is that the planet candidate’s large orbit in M51-ULS-1 means it would not cross in front of its binary partner again for about 70 years, thwarting any attempts for a confirming observation for decades. There is also the possibility that the dimming of X-rays is due to a passing cloud of gas near the M51-ULS-1, though the researchers think the data strongly favour the planet explanation,” the note reads. The paper describing these results appears in the latest issue of Nature Astronomy. The authors are Rosanne DiStefano (CfA), Julia Berndtsson (Princeton), Ryan Urquhart (Michigan State University), Roberto Soria (University of the Chinese Science Academy), Vinay Kashap (CfA), Theron Carmichael (CfA), and Nia Imara (now at the University of California at Santa Cruz).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/astronomers-find-evidence-of-possible-planet-outside-milky-way/articleshow/87321498.cms||---

A five-member NCB team from Delhi, led by deputy director Gynaneshwar Singh, arrived in the city on Wednesday and recorded Wankhede’s statement for three hours. Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the drug case and bodyguard to controversial witness K P Gosavi, in an affidavit had mentioned about a Rs 8 crore payoff to be made to Wankhede. Sources said Wankhede has denied the allegation. Interestingly, Singh appealed, through the media, to Gosavi and Sail to appear before the agency as they are not traceable and their cellphones are switched off. Pune police has issued a lookout notice against Gosavi against whom there are criminal cases pending. In fact, on Monday, a police team reached Lucknow in search of Gosavi, but he had already left the Uttar Pradesh capital by then.

---||Dehradun||Activists question police over not arresting two main accused in fake Covid-19 testing scam||HARIDWAR: Social activists have questioned the approach of Haridwar police in the fake Covid-19 testing scam as the two main accused in the case -- Sharat and Mallika Pant -- have still not been arrested. Both accused are owners of Max Corporate Services and were declared as proclaimed offenders by a local court about two months ago after a non-bailable warrant was issued against them. According to the law, a proclaimed offender can be arrested by any police officer without any warrant or an order from a magistrate. “Fake Covid-19 testing during Kumbh Mela is a very serious crime and therefore, it is baffling that the police have not yet arrested the two accused. Why are the police giving them a chance to evade the law? Their properties have also not been seized so far. Is there some political pressure? This is not how police work in usual cases,” said social activist JP Badoni. When asked about the allegations, SP Haridwar Kamlesh Upadhyay told TOI, “There is no political pressure. Our investigation is ongoing and an accused has been arrested in the matter. We didn’t arrest Sharat and Mallika Pant so far as their bail applications were pending in the court. This limited our options. Now that their bail pleas have been rejected by sessions and the high court, we will arrest them soon.” In July, the SIT had arrested Ashish Vashisth, director of Delphia labs, which had a tie-up with another lab allegedly involved in the scam. The SIT found that Max Corporate Services, which was not approved by the ICMR, had signed an MoU with Nalwa Labs and Dr Lalchandani Labs to become eligible as one of the agencies for conducting Covid-19 tests during the Kumbh. Prior to this, a detailed investigation by the health department had found that nearly a lakh fake tests were conducted in Kumbh in April.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/activists-question-police-over-not-arresting-two-main-accused-in-fake-covid-testing-scam/articleshow/87317265.cms||MS Nawaz

The observation came after special public prosecutor submitted that the personal data contained in the mobile phone of the accused could not be supplied to other accused in view of the privacy concern. The court noted that the public prosecutor had shown two sealed envelopes that contained photographs taken out from the phone, which contained private intimate pictures and videos by the accused people. “It appears that there is a question of right of privacy of accused and supply of any such data, as asked for, will have an impact on personal lives of accused, and thus, supplying of any photographs or video as contained in the mobile phone of accused to any other accused people or even to the counsels of accused would not be possible,” the order noted. The counsel for some of the accused, however, submitted that it was a case of conspiracy for which they would require the contents of mobile phone of other accused, who were stated to be related to each other, and in the interest of the defence of the accused people, this issue of supply of personal data, including whatever video or photographs were available in the mobile phones, should not be closed and be kept open. Some of the counsel for other accused sought time for deliberating on the aspect and for making submission on the next date of hearing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/mobile-data-cant-be-shared-with-riot-co-accused-court/articleshow/87346381.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||PM Modi, Amit Shah to visit poll-bound Uttarakhand in quick succession||DEHRADUN: Sounding the poll bugle in Uttarakhand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah are expected to visit the hill state in quick succession - within a week's gap. While Shah is scheduled to arrive in Uttarakhand on October 30 - his second visit to the state this month - and is likely to hold multiple meetings with partymen to review BJP's strategy for next year's assembly elections, PM Modi is slated to visit the Kedarnath shrine on November 5, a day after Diwali. The PM will inaugurate reconstruction projects worth Rs 400 crore in Kedarpuri and also unveil a statue of Adi Shankaracharya, who is believed to have taken samadhi in Kedarnath. Modi will be visiting the Himalayan shrine a day before its portals are going to close for winter break on November 6 on the occasion of Bhaiyya Dooj. BJP sources told TOI that party leaders will be there at each of the 11 other jyotirlingas in the country, besides Kedarnath, and offer prayers simultaneously while the PM is at Kedar. "Although the confirmed schedule of PM has still not come, it is likely that BJP leaders will be there in all the jyotirlingas and other temples and offer prayers simultaneously along with the PM who will be at Kedarnath," said Manveer Singh Chauhan, BJP spokesperson. Meanwhile, the BJP leaders in Uttarakhand are confident that Modi and Shah's visit will bolster the party's poll prospects. Chauhan said, "PM Modi has a special attachment for Uttarakhand and his visits surely help the party politically, especially when the assembly polls are so close." Significantly, this will be PM Modi's second visit to Uttarakhand within a month. He had visited the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Rishikesh on October 7 to inaugurate an oxygen plant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/pm-amit-shah-to-visit-poll-bound-uttarakhand-in-quick-succession/articleshow/87317290.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Goa||Reels of first-ever Konkani film set for restoration after 50+ years in storage||PANAJI: The long search for the last surviving reels of the first full-length Konkani film, Mogacho Aunndo (Love’s Craving), has ended, after six reels of the film directed by Al Jerry Braganza were recently handed over by his family to the film heritage foundation. The family has also parted with another six reels of Braganza’s second film, Sukhache Sopon (1966). “The films are in terrible condition as a result of them being stored in hot and humid conditions for over 50 years,” said filmmaker, archivist and founder-director of the foundation, Shivendra Singh Dungarpur. Since 2015, the foundation has been constantly following up with the Braganza family, asking them if they have any further film material they would like to give the foundation to salvage, to save the films. “Finally this year, Sam Braganza, the grand-nephew of Al Jerry Braganza, agreed to give us film material that had been stored all these years in his home,” Dungarpur told TOI. It was Nachom-ia Kumpasar director Bardroy Barretto who managed to convince Sam, following which cinematographer Keshav Prakash, who lives in Goa, agreed to check the film reels. Dungarpur said that his heart sank to see the condition of the films on video call. “Some of them looked sticky, warped and very brittle, and in many of the reels it seemed like the images were gone as Keshav described — the condition seemed dire,” he said. Along with the reels of both the films is a 16mm reel of film that still needs to be identified. The reels were carefully packed and sent to Mumbai by road, and are currently in the foundation’s archive, being worked on by conservators. These films are a very important part of Konkani history, he said. “This is precious celluloid material as this is all that seems to remain of both these Konkani films. There are no digital copies,” said Dungarpur, who took the initiative to salvage the trailer of Mogacho Aunndo after he was handed the film few years ago. “This just underlines the importance of preserving our film heritage on celluloid. So much of this has been lost not just because of general apathy, but also thanks to the misconception that celluloid has become obsolete in the digital era.” The 300ft of the trailer was restored by L’Immagine Ritrovata, a film restoration lab in Bologna, Italy, where a 4K scan of the reel was retrieved after almost two years of intensive chemical treatment and repair. “This time, we will do the treatment and repair in-house. The foundation has trained conservators who can work on the films in its archive. There’s a lot of work to be done, and it will be a long and painstaking process,” he said. Conservators are preparing a detailed inspection and condition report of each reel, cataloguing the damage and deterioration. “They will then work out a treatment and repair plan for each film, including dehydration and rehydration of each reel where required, that will have to be monitored on a daily basis. It is still too early to know if we have the complete films, and also, how much can be salvaged and restored,” he said. Today, producers are discarding celluloid as soon as films have been scanned, not realising that celluloid has depth and resolution that is still to be matched by digital scans, he added. “Celluloid is the only proven archival medium with a lifespan of a century if it is stored in proper conditions, whereas the longevity of digital formats remains unproven and untested as the data requires constant migration to newer formats with rapidly changing technology,” he said. “Original celluloid material is worth its weight in gold, which is why the film heritage foundation has collected over 500 films on celluloid. We are constantly searching for more, urging producers to deposit their films with us for preservation before it is too late,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/reels-of-first-ever-konkani-film-set-for-restoration-after-50-years-in-storage/articleshow/87319392.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Satya Pal Malik should quit as governor if he wants to play politics: Goa BJP||PANAJI: BJP went on the offensive against former Goa governor Satya Pal Malik, whose allegations of corruption in the Goa government sparked protests by the opposition, who demanded the resignation of chief minister Pramod Sawant, and said the current Meghalaya governor must first resign from his constitutional post if he wanted to “play politics”. “Malik (after resigning from his governor’s post) can join any political part of his choice and enter the fray. If he does not want to resign and if he is going to continue as the governor, he should make good use of the position for the people of Meghalaya,” state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said on Wednesday. He rubbished all allegations of corruption made by Malik and said it was sad that the former governor fell prey “to a conspiracy”. Even as the opposition upped the ante against Sawant, Malik tried to clarify on Wednesday that his remarks on corruption against the Goa government had been misconstrued, and that they were not directed at the chief minister. “I don’t want to say anything more. I love the people of Goa, I love the Goa government. I have regards for the Goa chief minister. I don’t want to do something as though I have made it my mission to harm him. He should not give his resignation,” he said. “Pramod Sawant is not at fault. There are some other people who are benefiting from it (the corruption). I cannot name them. I have not taken it upon myself to ruin the government of Goa,” Malik said. But Tanavade said that although Malik had clarified, the state unit of the party was bound to condemn the allegations leveled against the Goa administration. Tanavade also alleged that it was a conspiracy by the interviewer, who put words into Malik’s mouth during the controversial interview and made Malik speak “what he (the interviewer) had in his mind”. Tanavade said contrary to the Meghalaya governor’s recent allegations, Malik, as Goa governor, had praised the state’s Covid management. “Malik has alleged in his interview that all stores selling essential commodities in Goa were shut during the Covid lockdown and that some private person was given the contract to supply them. This is wrong. All essentials and services in Goa were kept shut or open as per the central government’s guidelines,” he said. “He also alleged that the Goa government wants to demolish the heritage building of Raj Bhavan. This is completely false. The Raj Bhavan is a heritage building and no government can demolish it. A new building was proposed in another location in the complex, while preserving the heritage structure as it is,” Tanavade said. “The position of the governor is a constitutional post of a very high order. Someone holding the position has to maintain its esteem and cannot run it down,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/malik-should-quit-as-guv-if-he-wants-to-play-politics-goa-bjp/articleshow/87319372.cms||---

Sources said the Apex court had asked the parties to file a written submission by October 29, if any. Following which the verdict can be pronounced anytime, they said. Residents and stakeholders had been waiting for more than four years for the hearing. On November 16, 2017, the Supreme Court had restrained a total of 82 large sand mine lease holders in the state from carrying out mining of sand and bajri in the state. Since then, many infrastructure projects and private housing projects and residents are purchasing sand illegally at exorbitant prices. After the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) recommended issuing environmental clearance (EC) to valid Letter of Intent (LOI) holders, the case was heard twice in the Apex court. A source said, "On October 21, today’s date was given by the SC. The argument has been concluded and now judgment is awaited." A source said, "The CEC was appointed by the Supreme Court to look into the issue of illegal sand mining. After the physical inspection, it recommended the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) to issue environmental clearance to valid LOI holders within three months." The committee report recommended that the MoEF&CC will issue ECs in respect of all the valid LOI holders recommended by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) in its meeting held during 2014-2016 without insisting on submission of scientific study report as a precondition for grant of the EC within a period of three months. According to sources, out of 82 large leases, the (EAC) recommended 65. However, the final nod will be given by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had earlier restrained large sand mine lease holders without procuring environmental clearance (EC) from (MoEF&CC). To grant the EC, the ministry later laid the condition to carry out a scientific replenishment study.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/top-court-reserves-verdict-on-2017-sand-mining-case/articleshow/87320368.cms||---

In both city and rural parts of Nagpur, the vaccination campaign will be in full sway as per state government orders. It’s been five months since vaccination began for 18 years and above population, but many in this category are yet to take the jab. Nagpur district collectorate kicked off the Yuva Swastha Mission Lasikaran (youth vaccination mission) at colleges from October 25. This campaign will continue till November 2 and authorities have urged students to take benefit of this. Just a few months earlier, there were serpentine queues and huge waiting time for booking a vaccination slot online. However, in almost every part of the district now, paid/free vaccination can be done without any hassle. Taking this further, the district health department is visiting campuses for vaccination of eligible students. Under this, 68 colleges under higher education department and 171 colleges under technical education department will be able to take the benefit in the district. As per the latest data available with the authorities, 812 students have taken the vaccine in 16 colleges. From Wednesday, 239 colleges will be covered under the campaign. A media statement from the district collectorate confirmed that these colleges will be from both city and rural areas. Pramod Pampatwar, director of Jhulelal Group of Institutions, said, “Students must not miss this chance of getting vaccinated. Across the world it has been proven that two doses of the vaccine will give you a strong level of protection. And if you (students) want to enjoy offline classes, mingle with friends etc, then there is no better way than to take vaccine. This vaccination drive is what will drive them on the road to education.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/vax-drive-for-students-at-239-degree-colleges-in-dist/articleshow/87317328.cms||---

In a report, the central groundwater board also stated that the overall utilisation of the resource has dropped. “The overall stage of groundwater development (utilisation) in the state of Goa is 23.5%, and all talukas fall under the safe category,” said the report titled ‘Dynamic ground water resources of Goa, 2020’, submitted to the state secretary for water resources on Wednesday. The re-estimation of Goa’s ground water resources was carried out as per data collected up to March 2020. “The water level rise in the range of 0-2m is general in Goa. Rise in water level of 2-4m is observed in almost all talukas and more than 4m is observed in parts of Bardez, Ponda, Salcete, Sattari and Sanguem talukas,” states the report. Fall in water level in the range of 0-2m was observed in parts of Pernem, while water levels were also seen to have dropped in the range of more than 4m in an isolated patch in Sanguem taluka. The board and the state water resources department carried out the assessment as per the groundwater estimation committee methodology 2015, which requires such re-estimation to be done once in three years. The board is monitoring water levels in Goa through 96 dug wells and 45 piezometers under the national hydrograph network monitoring stations. Data from these stations were used for assessing the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon water levels, fluctuations and decal trends. As per the report, there is sufficient rainfall in the state for irrigating the crops during monsoon. The ground water quality is also good, found the report. The board found that discharge of water in Goa was 20% as against the recommended 5%. This was because of the state’s terrain. Discharge is the runoff during the monsoon, as against retention. “In case of Goa, the terrain is highly undulating and laterite formations are highly porous. As a result of this, the aquifers get fully recharged quickly and on cessation of rains, water level in the wells deplete fast within 2-3 months,” the report states. However, in the present assessment, no drying-up of wells was observed in the last five years of water level data recorded, states the report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/all-12-talukas-have-safe-ground-water-levels-central-body/articleshow/87319400.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Parking, sanitation and uneven roads are the big issues that the traders are facing which have forced them to complain to JMC-Heritage. On Wednesday, members of the market association in Walled City met JMC-Heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar and commissioner Avadhesh Meena regarding these issues. Kailash Mittal, vice-president of Johri Market association said, “Vehicles parking beyond prescribed timings is not allowed, but contractors are taking money and allowing people to park their vehicles right through the day. This has impacted our customers.” Parking problem is also rampant in Bapu Bazaar, Chandpol and Kishanpol markets. In the festival season, people from all over the city come here for shopping, but with congestion in the market, people are these days reluctant. President of Jaipur Vyapaar Mahasangh Subhash Goyal said that the festival season is a peak time for business and when such civic problems occur, we lose a lot of money. “Already people are avoiding coming to Walled City for shopping because of traffic problems. We want a solution or Walled City market will lose its charm.” Meena said, “We held a meeting with the traders. We have noted down their complaints and their problems will be resolved soon.” Traders are also objecting to garbage lying across the city and sanitation workers not cleaning them on time. Bapu Bazaar market secretary Vicky Chelani said smart city work that is going on in the city has created lot of construction waste lying on the roadside.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/parking-and-sanitation-woes-hit-festive-shopping-in-walled-city/articleshow/87320372.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 10 hurt as ‘speeding’ BEST bus crashes into a dumper at Dadar||MUMBAI: Ten persons were injured when a ‘speeding’ BEST bus crashed into a dumper near Dadar TT on Wednesday morning. The incident once again highlights the need to train bus drivers on plying cautiously, said BEST committee members. While four were seriously injured, including 52-year-old bus driver Rajendra Kale and conductor Kashiram Dhuri (57), four others, including two teenagers aged 16 and 17 years, sustained minor injuries. “Two more passengers complained of minor injuries but they left the spot without taking treatment,” said BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade. The injured have been shifted to Sion hospital for treatment. A senior BEST official said “the driver either lost control of the vehicle or was speeding”. The dumper truck had halted at a signal (near Khodadad Circle) while a few vehicles, including another BEST bus, broke the signal and were moving ahead. The Tejaswani bus reportedly came at a speed from behind and crashed into the dumper. The Tejaswini bus was ferrying commuters on route number 22 from Marol to Pydhonie, and the mishap occurred en route at Dadar. “Tejaswini are special buses launched by the state government to exclusively ferry women commuters. However, during peak hours, it allows men to board buses,” said BEST committee member Sunil Ganacharya. Doctors at Sion Hospital said four of those admitted had sustained serious injuries, while four had minor wounds. Dean Dr Mohan Joshi said the driver and the conductor suffered severe injuries. “The driver of the vehicle has suffered an injury to the liver,” he said, adding that the conductor too had a fractured rib. A third person suffered a fracture to the head and neck and the fourth was serious and admitted to hospital. BEST committee chairman Ashish Chemburkar visited Sion hospital where he met a few patients and their relatives, and the cost of treatment is being borne by the undertaking. The Matunga police have registered a case of rash and negligent driving in the case. “Looking at the CCTV footage, prima facie it appears it was the BEST driver’s fault. But we are waiting to record his statement before deciding the course of action,” said a police officer.

The court will hear the matter on Saturday. The crime branch unit 11, probing an extortion case against Singh, dismissed cop Sachin Waze and others, has issued two-three summons, but Singh has not responded. The non-bailable warrant will pave the way to declaring Singh an absconder. “The procedure is that first we have to send notices. If the person fails to respond, the court issues a bailable warrant and then non-bailable warrant. If he fails to turn up even then, we start the procedure of declaring the person an absconder,” said an official. He added that Singh has failed to appear before the state-appointed Justice Chandiwal committee, the National Investigation Agency, and the crime branch. The state government has stopped IPS officer Singh’s salary from October. In March, Singh was removed as Mumbai police chief and made DG, home guards, following the Antilia bomb scare case, but he did not join. Five separate offences have been registered against Singh.

The department has confirmed to TOI that the classes will start from the next academic year. "The foreign languages experiment has never taken place in our government schools and this will be the first time that languages like German and French will be taught to the students of secondary classes," said Seema Jaunsari, director of the state secondary education department. She added, "The Atal Utkrisht Schools are CBSE-affiliated English-medium institutions. They have been developed on the lines of top private schools. Currently, we have 28,000 students enrolled in about 180 Atal schools. The strength of students in these model schools is likely to increase in the coming months." Besides foreign languages, education department officials are also planning to launch courses related to coding and artificial intelligence in the Atal Utkrisht Schools. Earlier this year, the Uttarakhand education department had also announced its plan to develop around 898 primary schools as feeder schools to the Atal Utkrisht Schools. According to officials, the lessons won’t be strictly taught in the English medium but there will be compulsory teaching of the English subject in these feeder schools so that the transition of students from the feeder schools to the Atal Utkrisht Schools is smooth. Meanwhile, the education department is yet to start the process to recruit primary teachers in state-run schools even as the aspirants, looking forward to the recruitment process, have been protesting for over a year now. They have urged the government to set the recruitment process in motion as early as possible.

DG (ACB) B L Soni said that Devesh Chauhan is accused of giving bribes to RSLDC officials through middleman Amit Sharma. Soni said that ACB arrested Chauhan after investigators corroborated the latter’s involvement in the bribery case. The ACB on September 11 had ACB busted a corruption racket at RSLDC and arrested two of its employees, scheme coordinator Ashok Sangwan and Rahul Kumar Garg, an assistant lecturer who was on deputation as a manager of the corporation. The agency had also seized the mobile phones of two IAS officers, chairman Neeraj K Pawan and MD Pradeep K Gawande to probe their role. The two accused had sought the amount in lieu of clearing pending bills and for granting permission for continuing the training programme by the complainant. Sources in the agency said that during the investigation they learnt that a private company had also allegedly facilitated bribery through a middleman. As investigators examined the bribery racket, Chauhan’s name cropped up during the probe. “Prima facie investigation pointed out that the kickbacks were given to remove the company from the blacklist,” an official said. ACB officials said that senior officials of the BVG and RSLDC are under the scanner for their alleged involvement in the bribery racket. “We are investigating to find out exactly who had ordered for the bribe and how the entire illegal transaction was carried out,” an official said.

Information Kerala mission has been tasked with the responsibility to integrate the data on property tax with the ePoS machines. Biju Prabhakar, principal secretary (urban), convened a meeting on Tuesday and finalised the framework for implementing the project. It will be introduced in the city corporation on a pilot basis and will be scaled up in all other local bodies. “Android based handheld devices are being introduced in the wake of recent developments in the city corporation. The new system is expected to bring in transparency and make all payments accountable. Expression of interests will be called from six banks. The banks will also sponsor development of a mobile app which is required for the system. In addition to this, around 230 various payments; all those above Rs 1,000 will go digital and talks are underway to make use of Akshaya centres for this purpose,” said Biju Prabhakar who chaired the meeting. A committee comprising officials of IT mision, LSGD, IKM and representatives of banks will monitor the system. Mayor Arya Rajendran also told the council meeting held on Wednesday that scientific interventions are being made in tax collection and recording, referring to the meeting convened by the principal secretary. The city corporation officials who attended the meeting said the android based handheld devices will be equipped with the facility for real-time updation of collection records, real time generation of tax arrears and dues and all digital payments can be done using this device. “If a resident wishes to make the payment by cash, the bill collector can update the payment and instantaneously it will be recorded on the system server. This will negate the need for posting. Besides, receipts will also be generated on a real time basis. It will also have the provision of QR code by which payments will be possible through UPI apps or scan,” said an official. In 2014, the civic body had held talks with a firm to introduce a new system of bill-collection which proposed to make use of radio frequency identification tags that had already been installed in various households in all the wards. The bill-collector was required to read the device on RFID tag and this would be automatically recorded on the corporation server. The system had been introduced on an experimental basis at Thalassery in 2014. The project, however, did not make any headway. Meanwhile, the BJP and UDF ended their strike on Wednesday. The special council meeting witnessed a heated debate on tax fraud and revenue loss. BJP councillors alleged that there were procedural lapses in suspending the staff involved in tax fraud and that it was intentional. BJP councillor V G Girikumar said the decision to suspend the staff was not presented in the council and without getting ratified by the council, the suspension would cease to hold any value. However, corporation officials said the matter was reported in the previous council and was recorded in the minutes, which was circulated among the councillors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/soon-android-based-epos-machines-for-tax-collection/articleshow/87318516.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan to streamline system to check graft in Indira Rasoi scheme||JAIPUR: As many alleged irregularities have surfaced in the state government’s ambitious Indira Rasoi scheme, the directorate of local bodies (DLB) is all set to establish a foolproof system. Many complaints were registered recently that allegedly fake receipts are produced by the operators to receive the state government’s grants without providing food, when the online system is not functional. Across the state, 358 locations for the kitchen have been set up, after spending Rs 100 crore. To develop the infrastructure, the state government had provided Rs 4.87 lakh to each operator. Every year, Rs 2 lakh grant has been also provided. The cost per plate is Rs 20, however, it is provided on subsidised rates. The consumers have to pay only Rs 8 per plate. Monitoring of the scheme is done using technology. Those beneficiaries who have mobile phones, receive a coupon via SMS. A senior official said, “We have written a letter to the Department of Information Technology & Communication to develop an offline module to issue coupons. Many a times, operators claim online system is not working. In that situation, it’s hard to verify that the food has been provided or not.” A record will be maintained in the offline system. The operators will have to upload it online. “The operators can issue online coupons only after the permission of the nodal officer at the local body,” the source said. After the change in regime, the Congress government had overhauled the Annapurna Rasoi scheme launched by former chief minister Vasundhara Raje to serve food at subsidised rates across the state. The reason for the move is that the existing Congress government wants to provide food to the poor after spending money in a transparent manner. “The department will soon develop a foolproof system to check the leakages. We have directed to maintain the record of the beneficiaries offline,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-to-streamline-system-to-check-graft-in-rasoi-scheme/articleshow/87320377.cms||---

Justice Nitin Sambre, who is also hearing the bail plea of Aryan Khan in the cruise ship drug case, told Punamiya’s lawyer Rizwan Merchant: “This is not done. Let your client know that this time I am only saying not before me, but next time I will issue contempt. This is not how the courts work.” Merchant tendered an apology, saying: “I am with your Lordship and would never attempt to stop the Hon’ble Court from issuing such orders.” He added he won’t be representing Punamiya anymore. “I have withdrawn from appearance as I have to attend to some important case,” Merchant later told TOI. The Thane police probing the scam are also examining the role of IPS officer Param Bir Singh, who allegedly extorted money from builders in 2016 when he was the Thane police commissioner. It is not known why the judge was offended and recused himself. But he made it clear that the interim protection given to Punamiya has been withdrawn. The case is that officials of the Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation had allegedly connived with many builders and submitted forged documents to get exemption from surrendering 5% surplus land to the government. As per the ULC scheme, these builders were supposed to surrender the surplus land to build houses for economically weaker sections. It is further alleged that Punamiya and others, under Singh, summoned several builders involved in the scam and collected huge funds. The entire operation caused a loss of more than Rs 100 crore to the exchequer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/bombay-hc-judge-recuses-in-punamiya-case-nixes-interim-relief/articleshow/87330212.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Ahmedabad||ATS busts VoIP exchange||Ahmedabad: The anti-terrorist squad (ATS) on Wednesday arrested one person with 139 sim cards and busted an illegal voice over internet protocol (VoIP) telephone exchange operating in the city. Based on a tip-off, an ATS team raided a flat at Sakib Apartments in Juhapura on Tuesday and apprehended Shahid Saiyad, who was running the illegal exchange using four sim boxes, a LAN switch, a laptop and a router, said Pinakin Parmar, superintendent of police, Gujarat ATS. A SIM box is a device that holds multiple sim cards and is used as part of a VoIP gateway installation. Preliminary investigation revealed that the exchange was set up by Najib P P, a native of Kerala, with help from his aides Amit, a resident of Pune and one Sohail, who is from Goa, the official said. Najib was running the exchange remotely from Bahrain. As video calls through applications such as WhatsApp are banned in Gulf countries, Indians living there have to pay ISD rates to make international calls here. Najib and his men make money by selling calling cards and sending commissions to Shahid, Amit and Sohail here, he said. Police recovered 139 sim cards installed in the sim boxes to generate VoIP calls, he said. As directed by Najib and Sohail, Saiyad started this VoIP-based exchange around a year ago, he said. “This exchange was used to convert incoming international calls into normal voice calls using VoIP technology. This is illegal and against the rules of the department of telecommunications. This activity also results in a loss to the government,” Parmar said. While Saiyad has been arrested on charges of cheating and criminal conspiracy, the three other accused are absconding, he said. On learning that Najib was also operating another exchange in the Mira Road area of Mumbai, a joint team of ATS and Mumbai police raided a flat at ND Plaza No.3 on Tuesday and nabbed one Sajjad Saiyad with 115 sim cards and other equipment. Further investigation in that case is being done by Mumbai police, an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ats-busts-voip-exchange/articleshow/87318531.cms||---

He had come to the shrine after holding a public rally in Muzaffarnagar (Uttar Pradesh). Owaisi was given a rousing welcome by the members of his party and other supporters. However, the large gathering made his movement difficult. After paying his obeisance at the tomb of 13th-century Sufi saint Alauddin Ali Ahmed Sabir Kaliyari, Owaisi quickly headed to Manglaur (near Roorkee) and met with his party’s Uttarakhand president Nayyar Kazmi at his residence. According to TOI sources, Owaisi discussed the party’s poll campaign strategy with Kazmi during the meeting, which continued for a little over half an hour. Subsequently, he left for Delhi. The Uttarakhand unit of AIMIM has already announced that it will field candidates on 22 out of 70 seats in the Uttarakhand assembly. A majority of these 22 constituencies are in the four plain districts of the hill state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/owaisi-visits-piran-kaliyar-sufi-shrine-holds-meets-with-aimim-ukhand-prez/articleshow/87317357.cms||Tapan Susheel

The government had announced that 2.65 lakh tablet devices will be distributed among students of govt schools but with high demand across the country during festival season and low supply from the manufacturing companies, the government may not be able to procure all the devices by early next year. “There is a high demand for tablets during Diwali and there is a lack of manufacturing of the ‘chips’ which are installed in the devices. We won’t be able to procure all the tablets by early next year. Also, the model code of conduct is likely to be put in place in January, further hampering the chances of tablet distribution before assembly elections,” said a state government official.

---||Jaipur||Female infant mortality rate is lower than males in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: For the first time, female infant mortality rate (IMR) has gone down below male IMR in the state. Recently released data from the Sample Registration System (SRS) office of the Registrar General of India shows for every 1,000 male babies born, 36 die before turning a year old, while it is 35 for females. The data is based on the figures of 2019. From 2009 to 2019, female infant mortality has dropped sharply in the state. From 61 deaths per thousand live births in 2009, it has now dropped to 35 in 2019, a decrease of 26 deaths per thousand live births in 10 years.  In comparison to female infant mortality, the male infant mortality has reduced by 22 deaths per thousand live births in the same period. From 58 deaths per thousand live births in 2009, it has now reduced to 36 deaths. “This has happened for the first time when the female IMR has less than their male counterparts,” said a senior health department official. The official added that it had happened because state government was promoting the Save Girl Child campaign by introducing girl child friendly schemes such as Rajshree. Also, the free medicine and free diagnostic test schemes encouraged people to take their daughters hospitals for treatment without thinking about expenses. It is a major success for the health department officials from auxiliary nurse midwives to officials at the senior level who have been encouraging people to bring down the IMR. In urban areas, female IMR is 24 while in rural areas it is 38, indicating that the state government has to do a lot of work in reducing the gap between rural and urban areas for saving girl child. Male IMR in cities is 26 deaths per thousand live births compared to 39 in rural areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/female-infant-mortality-rate-is-lower-than-males-in-state/articleshow/87320396.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

This is despite Uttarakhand recording an improvement in its IMR in 2019 as compared to 2018 when the hill state registered 31 infant deaths for every 1,000 live births. However, the state’s IMR was found better than the national average of 30 in the recently-released SRS report. According to the data, the national average for IMR is 34 in rural areas and 20 in urban areas. In Uttarakhand, the rural and urban belts have IMRs of 28 and 26 respectively. Experts believe that while the improvement in IMR is significant for the state, they pointed out that several areas in the hills still lack basic health infrastructure. “It is an achievement that the IMR of the state has come down. However, other Himalayan states have IMR figures in single digits. So, we still have a long way to go,” said Anoop Nautiyal, founder, social development for communities. Meanwhile, officials allege that the state's high IMR is because of the large migrant population in the villages of Haridwar, Dehradun, Udham Singh Nagar, and other districts. They added that this population refrains from using health services mostly due to a lack of awareness. “We have dedicated helplines for expectant women. Our staff reaches out to them for follow-ups after the delivery as well. A third of mortality cases take place within 24-to-48 hours of birth. Therefore, we are creating awareness among healthcare staff and locals with regards to immediate birth precautions, early breastfeeding, and hypothermia prevention along with immunisation. The state's IMR rate has improved and we are working to bring it down further” said Dr Saroj Naithani, director, National Health Mission.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhand-infant-mortality-third-worst-among-himalayan-states/articleshow/87317396.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik, on Wednesday, gave the state government two weeks to submit a detailed report. Back in 2018, the HC had formed a high-powered committee to recommend measures to prevent landslides in Baliya Nala while hearing a petition by a Nainital resident on the issue. The committee had experts from IIT Roorkee, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, and Forest Research Institute of Dehradun, among others. The panel had suggested several measures, including construction of safety walls along Baliya Nala and relocation of people. The Baliya Nala area on Bhowali Road has been witnessing landslides almost every year since the 1970s. However, these rain-triggered occurrences have started impacting human settlements adversely in the last few years.

Among the students who took the health sciences entrance test, 17 scored 100 percentile with Nanded’s Fatema Ayman getting the first rank, followed by Aniruddha Ainwale and Mumbai’s Rajveer Lakhani. The state’s CET cell declared the results of the MHT-CET on Wednesday evening. A total of 2.3 lakh candidates had registered to take the entrance test for admission to engineering colleges, of whom 1.9 lakh took the online exam. Similarly, the count for those who signed up to take physics, chemistry and biology was 2.8 lakh, of whom 2.3 lakh took the test. Last year, the exam had registered over 5.4 lakh but only 3.8 lakh, 71.2%, appeared. “The results are better than last year. We feel that despite the pandemic, students stepped up their efforts,” said an officer from the CET cell. While 28 students scored a 100 percentile in both PCM and PCM, 1,958 got 99 percentile in PCM and 2,300 in PCB. Last year, while 41 students bagged the perfect score in both the mathematics (PCM) and biology (PCB) groups, as opposed to just two in 2019, another 3,967 got 99 percentile in 2020. For Dahisar’s Arsh Maknojia of Prakash College, the pandemic had a positive impact as he had fewer distractions. “As I could not step out of home, I studied a lot. I want to pursue computer science engineering from VJTI,” he said. Like him, Dishie Vinchhi, another 100 percentiler, said while she took the CET, she also did well in the JEE (Advanced). “I love math and hence computer science was natural progression.” She is spoilt for choice. “With my JEE (Advanced) rank, I can get into IIT Goa or an NIT or use my CET score to join VJTI.” Neeraja Patil, also from Mumbai, said she had secured a seat in IIT Bombay’s computer science department and would be joining there. “I just prepared for JEE and took the CET as a backup.” Similarly, Nikita Maurya of Sardar Vallabh Patel Science College, Mira Road, who scored 100 percentile in PCB, said she wants to be a doctor and is awaiting her NEET results, but took the CET as a practice test. “The PCB test has now lost its relevance. It is largely taken by those who want to pursue pharmacy, and it also acts as a back-up test for many who are unsure of their performance in the NEET,” said professor Subhash Joshi of Science Parivar. “At the same time engineering students who will take up a seat in an IIT or NIT or even a private university will drop out of Maharashtra’s admission process and students will see bettering of their SML (state merit list) ranks,” he added. With students scoring better marks in MHT-CET, admissions to sought-after government engineering colleges are likely to get more competitive this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-mht-cet-results-improve-in-pandemic-yr-28-in-state-8-in-city-bag-100-percentile/articleshow/87319487.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The complaint of Yogesh Soni, 29, was filed on Tuesday. Soni, who makes jewellery, told police that he has an account in SBI’s Vyasvadi branch and also has a credit card. Soni said that when his credit card application was being processed, he inadvertently gave the wrong email ID, which he wanted to change. On December 31, 2020, tried to do so on the SBI app. On January 1, 2021, a person identifying himself as Vivek Rajput phoned him and offered assistance to change his email ID. Soni was fooled into believing that the caller was a bank official. The caller said Soni would have to share the details of his credit card to rectify the email ID. Soni believed him. Soon thereafter, Rs 39,999 was debited from Soni’s credit card. He called the police control room and got a token number from the cybercrime police. He was told to file an application at the police station concerned. After about 11 months, Vadaj police have registered a case of cheating and breach of trust.

The accused has been identified as Anu alias Muttai Anu of Olippunada near Naruvamoodu. The officials said that they intercepted Anu at Mukkampalamoodu based on an intelligence information they received. The accused tried to resist the arrest by attacking the officers. However, the officers managed to overpower him and take him into custody. The accused Anu is a habitual offender, involved in several grave crime cases, including attempt to murder. He used to sell ganja and narcotic drugs using the code name 'muttai' (sweet) and hence earned the nickname Muttai Anu. Anu was caught by a team led by excise inspector S S Sachin. The officials said that nitrazepam tablets, which were seized from the accused, are used for treating patients with mental illnesses. The tablets weighed 16 grams in total. Nitrazepam tablets can be purchased from medical stores only using a triple-prescription from the doctor. The doctor, pharmacist and the buyer must keep a copy of the prescription and the pharmacist must keep a separate registry at the shop to keep the details of the sale of this drug. Possessing more than 20 grams of this drug without prescription is a crime that can fetch a punishment of imprisonment up to 10 years and penalty of Rs 1 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/excise-arrests-man-with-ganja/articleshow/87318607.cms||---

GIDC (Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation) is on the verge of finalizing a land parcel of over 1,000 acres for the proposed park. The Government of India has announced that the sites of the mega integrated textile regions and apparel parks will be picked through competitive selection. But the Gujarat government is confident that the state will get India’s first PM-MITRA park as it is a leader in textile production and trading. According to the proposed PM-MITRA scheme, a minimum of 1,000 acre land is required for the park. A source aware of the developments said, “GIDC has identified land in Navsari, Bharuch, and Surat districts. A planning team of GIDC has visited four pockets of Bharuch: Khanpur-Deh (812ha), Uber (1,000ha), Malpur (199ha), and Khareli (622ha).” The source added: “New locations in Surat and Navsari are also being looked at.” The source said the scheme will offer an opportunity to create at a single location an integrated textiles value chain spanning all the business aspects — spinning, weaving, processing/dyeing, printing, and garment manufacturing. Maximum Development Capital Support (DCS) of Rs 500 crore will be provided to all greenfield PM-MITRA projects for the development of common infrastructure, sources said. The source said, “Maximum of Rs 200 crore will be given to brownfield PM-MITRA projects for the development of common infrastructure.” In addition, the source said, Rs 300 crore of Competitiveness Incentive Support (CIS) will be provided to each park for the early establishment of textile manufacturing units. An investment over Rs 20,000 crore is expected in the PM-MITRA parks, added the source. “State BJP president and Navsari MP C R Paatil and Union minister of state for railways and textiles Darshana Jardosh, who is the Surat MP, are pushing hard for the first park under the PM-MITRA scheme in Gujarat,” the source said. “Since land availability is low near Surat and Navsari, Bharuch could be finalized as the site for the PM-MITRA park.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/guj-frontrunner-for-indias-1st-mega-textile-park/articleshow/87318602.cms||Kapil Dave

Tushar Sharma, a resident of Meera Road in Thane who works as user experience designer, in his FIR with Bopal police said that he along with his parents were on a road trip to Rajasthan from Mumbai. As he was tired, he decided to halt near Nirma University on SG Road after which he went to South Bopal for some work. At this time, he received an email, purportedly from his boss, demanding Rs 24,700 to make a payment to a vendor. Sharma paid the money immediately through a UPI app to that person. After a while, he got another email demanding Rs 1.24 lakh but as he said he did not have that much money, the person told him to pay whatever he could. He then paid Rs 25,300 to that person in the same manner. When he again checked the email later, he found something fishy and contacted his boss, who told him that she did not send any email demanding money. The man took screenshots of the transactions and filed a complaint. Bopal police filed a complaint of breach of trust, cheating and producing fake documents as genuine along with charges under the Information Technology Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/mumbai-man-duped-of-rs-50000-by-fake-boss/articleshow/87318570.cms||---
---||Delhi||After long wait, DDMA okays Chhath||NEW DELHI: Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday allowed Chhath Puja celebrations at designated sites with strict protocols amid a significant improvement in the Covid-19 situation. On September 30, DDMA had prohibited public celebration of the festival, triggering protests. LG Anil Baijal tweeted: "After detailed deliberations, it was decided to continue with the test, track & treat strategy along with strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour to prevent any resurgence of infection, particularly in view of the ongoing festive season. It was decided to permit celebration of Chhath Puja at designated sites subject to strict compliance of the orders of NGT and SOPs laid down by the revenue department in this regard." The district authorities, in consultation with stakeholders like Chhath Puja organising committees and RWAs, would designate the sites. Plans are also afoot to make artificial ponds to organise the festivities. The onus of ensuring that Covid-appropriate behaviour is strictly followed would be on the organising committees. The focus would be on ensuring that the designated sites are not crowded and only a limited number of people are allowed so that social distancing is followed. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said very strict protocols would be required to be followed during Chhath Puja celebrations. He appealed to all to celebrate Chhath with all necessary precautions. Delhi government in a statement said the approval was given due to a lot of efforts by it, especially the persistence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. "SOPs will be issued for Chhath Puja celebrations soon. I appeal to the people that Chhath Mahaparv, the festival of faith, which is a very important festival, should be organised with great care," said Sisodia. After initially justifying the ban, the CM had written to the LG, who is also the DDMA chairman, urging him to permit Chhath celebrations. Sisodia had also written a letter to the Union health minister urging him to allow the festival. Chhath is a major festival in Delhi and is popular particularly among people belonging to Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh. It will be celebrated over four days, from November 8 to 11. Last year, Chhath and other festivals were banned due to the adverse Covid-19 situation. Compared with last year, the current situation is under greater control.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/after-long-wait-ddma-okays-chhath/articleshow/87321592.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Digha fisherman turns crorepati overnight||DIGHA: A fisherman in Digha has become a crorepati overnight by selling 33 gigantic telia bhola fish, which he and his associates had trapped early on Tuesday night deep inside Bay of Bengal. Each of the fish weighed between 20kg to 25kg and they were sold at Rs 13,000 per kilogram, making the fisherman crorepati in a day. On Wednesday, he had a similar catch of telia bhola fish that was sold at Rs 57 lakh through the day, helping him earn Rs 1.5 crore on two days. Chanchal Pradhan (45), who has been in the business for more than two decades, was busy securing the huge cash he earned over two days at Digha Mohana market. He owns the trawler company Maa Basanti that caught the fish. Sukhdeb Das, a fellow fisherman at the market, said: “On Tuesday, he came to the market with 33 huge fish. During the auction, each fish was sold for Rs 12,800 per kg and he earned total Rs 98.7 lakh. On Wednesday, he came back to the market with 37 more telia bhola fish of slightly smaller size that fetched him Rs 57 lakh.” Das added that fishermen catch usually four or five telia bhola fish but he stressed that such a large number of fish caught together is very rare. The telia bhola, an absolutely edible fish, is also known for its medicinal value — the reason behind its high price in the market. Sources said that on Tuesday, those associated with multiple pharmaceutical companies had bought the fish. “Some pharmaceutical companies have a patent over the usage of the fish parts like oil, omega III fatty acid and liver extracted from the fish,” said Suman Sahu, a senior state fisheries department official. Earlier on Tuesday, five fishermen had trapped a telia bhola fish, weighing over 78kg, in the Sunderbans. The seven-feet long fish was later taken to the Canning wholesale market for auction and it was finally sold for over Rs 36 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/digha-fisherman-turns-crorepati-overnight/articleshow/87318608.cms||Suman Mondal
---||Goa||India deserved a point against UAE: Igor Stimac||India were left to rue a costly mistake as United Arab Emirates (UAE) scored a solitary goal win in the AFC U-23 Championship qualifiers at the Fujairah Stadium on Wednesday night. With three points in their pocket after the opening night’s win against Oman, India set out to frustrate UAE but were undone late in the game when they conceded a penalty. Abdulla Idrees converted the penalty in the 82nd minute to keep the hosts alive in the championship. All four teams in the group – which includes Oman and Kyrgyz Republic– now have three points each. With the group toppers qualifying, India will need to put it across Kyrgyz Republic in the decisive clash on Saturday and hope that UAE does not taste win, thanks to the head-to-head rule. The 11 group toppers qualify automatically for Uzbekistan 2023, while four second-best placed teams will also find a spot. “We made one mistake and that cost us a point, not three, as we didn’t deserve three points against UAE,” India coach Igor Stimac said after the game. “In the first half, we handled it well, especially when the legs were still fresh. We also had two great chances in the first half. We played against a very good side who were deserving winners. In the second half they demonstrated their power.” Stimac made only one change to the team that defeated Oman 2-1 in the previous game. He introduced Lalengmawia Ralte in place of Aniket Jadhav to make the midfield more compact. Lalengmawia justified the coach’s faith with an impressive performance. India tried to catch UAE on the counter and had chances, but Rahul KP and Vikram Partap both went close. UAE were always the dominant side and pushed India back for most part. They created several openings too, but it was goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh who rescued India with some good saves. Stimac brought in fresh legs to contain UAE and somehow steal a point, but the hosts still found a way. Ten minutes before the final whistle, UAE won a penalty after captain Suresh Singh pulled down Ali Saleh inside the box. Defender Abdulla stepped up and made no mistake from the spot to score the goal that eventually separated the two sides. “We gave away an easy penalty, without any reason,” said Stimac. “The ball was going away from goal and there was no reason to touch the player. We made one silly mistake. I warned my players, ‘don't touch any player in the box, keep your hands tight’. We made one mistake and that mistake cost us a point.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/india-deserved-a-point-against-uae-igor-stimac/articleshow/87346533.cms||---

While many private schools have welcomed the move, most of them plan only a post-Diwali resumption. With the hybrid learning option — both online lessons and in person — available, private schools aren’t certain about all parents consenting to their children returning to school. The government schools, however, are confident of full attendance after a hiatus of a year and a half. Sudha Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka, and chairperson, National Progressive Schools Conference, an association of private schools, said her school would reopen only on November 8. “With all classes to resume, a lot of preparations are needed,” she said. “We also have to arrange the resumption of school transport.” Acharya will hold a meeting on Thursday to plan the attendance. “I have five sections in each class, so I think I can call some sections on one day, the rest on another day. The hybrid system has already burdened the teachers, and many who take classes in IX and X also teach the junior sections. It has been a difficult time juggling between online and offline class,” she added. At The Indian School, principal Tania Joshi believes the hybrid learning option might deter children from returning to school. She also thought the school might need to boost its internet setup. “Even if one student in a particular class comes for lessons, the teacher has to take both online and offline classes. For the senior section, the upper floors in the school building were equipped with a strong internet network. Now, depending on the response, we may have to make internet arrangements on the other floors,” said Joshi. The institution will start collecting data on teachers’ vaccination from Thursday. The Action Committee, an association of unaided private schools, said schools would ensure rigorous safety protocols. “Mutual trust and cooperation among schools, parents, students and teachers will make the reopening safe and smooth,” said Bharat Arora, general secretary of the organisation. Some government schools, expecting high attendance, are thinking of calling students for shorter durations initially. A K Jha, principal, Government Co-ed Sarvodaya School, Sector 8, Rohini, said, “I don’t think calling one class one day and another the following day is the way forward. This offers no continuity,” he said. “I will work out a way for senior students to be here from 8.30am to 11.30am and the rest thereafter till 2pm.” Jha expects no problem with social distancing even with 3,000 students on the roll. At Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School, Ambedkar Nagar, principal Aruna Anand too felt space wouldn’t be a constraint.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/happy-but-pvt-schools-worry-about-hybrid-mode/articleshow/87319568.cms||Shradha Chettri

The SAG coaches have shortlisted 48 men and 38 women of the community after talent scouting trips to different villages.The Siddis settled in parts of Gujarat and Karnataka before independence. The community has a population of around 12,000 in Gujarat. As Siddis have a sturdy physique and are known for being genetically strong, qualities must for top-level athletes, the state government has decided to train them in various sports. L P Bariya, chief coach of SAG, Kanji Bhaliya, senior coach of Gir Somnath district and Manish Jiladiya, Porbandar district coach, shortlisted the candidates after an extensive talent scouting process. The trio visited 20 villages like Lambur, Sirvan, Rasulpura, Madhupur, Chitravad, Moruka, Jasapur, Javantri of Talala taluka which have a significant population of the Siddis. “The project is a brainchild of SAG director general C V Som. While watching the Tokyo Olympics, he thought that if nurtured properly, Siddis can excel in various sports,” Bhaliya said. The state government is targeting to get a medal in the 2024 Paris Olympics through these youth. A committee of 30 members travelled in these villages for 25 days to spot sporting talents. The committee was accompanied by former national champion athletes Yunus Raika and Hanifa Majgul, who also are Siddis. A similar project was launched by the Union sport ministry in 1985. The project named, Special Area Games, was aimed at spotting talented Siddi youths in Gujarat and Karnataka and training them. ‘N-word’ mentioned twice in govt release The N-word, an ethnic slur avoided across the globe for being racist, was used twice in a press release issued by the information department of the state government. The N-word was used in the press release issued to the media informing about training Siddis, the African origin people, in various sports. Worldwide the N-word is considered insulting for the community as it indicates racial discrimination.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/in-quest-of-oly-medals-siddis-to-be-trained-by-sag/articleshow/87317522.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Water level up in Mullaperiyar dam, shutters likely to be opened||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/IDUKKI: With water level in Mullaperiyar dam rising, the circumstances are such that the spillway shutters of the reservoir have to be opened on Friday 7am, a release from Idukki district disaster management authority said on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, citing Tamil Nadu officials, water resources minister Roshy Augustine said that the dam spillway shutters will be opened if the water level in the reservoir reaches 138ft, based on the rule curve fixed by Central Water Commission (CWC). The water level in the reservoir was 137.75ft by 7pm on Wednesday after remaining more or less steady at 136.60ft from Tuesday morning. If water is drained from Mullaperiyar dam it will flow into Idukki reservoir which is presently at orange alert level. Augustine said the district administration has made all arrangements for the release of the dam water. The minister said the state was not ready to accept the supervisory committee’s stand that there is no need to change the water level in Mullaperiyar dam. A detailed report of the rule curve for 10 days from June 10 to November 30 was submitted to the Supreme Court last week. For ensuring people’s safety, the state will demand the construction of a new dam before the Supreme Court, he added. The water level at Idukki has considerably come down, hence the inflow from Mullaperiyar can be accommodated if at all the shutters of its spillway are opened, the minister said. Meanwhile, the third shutter of Idukki dam was closed on Wednesday after water level in the reservoir declined. The three shutters of the dam were opened on October 19 when the water level was 2398.08ft. KSEB authorities said the last shutter was closed at 3.15pm and that the water level was 2,397.90ft at 5pm on Wednesday. He said it has been brought to the notice of the supervisory committee that at least five feet of water level has increased in a single day in Mullaperiyar. Hence, the state will demand that the water level should be brought down to 136ft. The state will ensure that the safety concerns of the dam are brought before the court when the hearing continues on Thursday, he added. Revenue minister K Rajan said heavy rains have been predicted in the state till October 31 and hence authorities are taking all steps to evacuate the people in case of emergency. It has been estimated that 883 families will have to be evacuated from three taluks and seven villages once the Mullaperiyar dam is opened. The minister said the details of these people have been collected and steps have been taken to set up 20 relief camps. Pinarayi may meet StalinMeanwhile, there are reports that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan will meet Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin in December to discuss the Mullaperiyar issue. The meeting is expected to take place in Chennai wherein the irrigation ministers and officials of both states will take part. Idukki collector Sheeba George said cases will be registered against people spreading panic about Mullaperiyar dam under IT Act and other Sections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/mullaperiyar-water-level-up-shutters-likely-to-be-opened/articleshow/87318628.cms||---

Harpreet, who is in Merchant Navy, said he spent Rs 18 lakh to send Manvir to Canada and after reaching there, she cut all connections with him.Harpreet said, “First, Manvir concealed her age. We learned it later that she was a year older to me. After our marriage, she started humiliating and insulting me and my family in front of relatives and neighbours. She would often pick up fights. I apprised her family of it, but to no avail. She told me that she married me as she wanted to settle abroad. When I told her that I wanted to live in India, she started harassing us. Eventually, we agreed and sent Manvir to Canada on a study visa on August 22, 2017.” Harpreet added, “After reaching there, Manvir was quite happy and behaved well with me and my family. She kept asking for money, which we sent. After some time, she started ignoring us. I asked her to call me there on a spouse visa, but she applied for a visitor’s visa. She did not pursue my file and I did not get the visa. She neither called me there nor agreed to return to India. She then stopped talking to us, though I had spent Rs 18 lakh to send her to Canada.” On March 22, Harpreet lodged a complaint with the Ludhiana police. An inquiry was marked to the Crime against Women Cell (CAW-III). ASI Lakhwinder Singh said following a detailed inquiry by the CAW, the PAU police registered a case against the woman under Section 420 (cheating) of the IPC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/canadian-booked-for-cheating-husband/articleshow/87317508.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Mobile internet ban new norm for govt exams in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Clamdown on mobile internet services during recruitment exams have become the ‘final resort’ to prevent cheating mafias. Internet curfew was earlier used to contain communal strife in specific areas, but it has now become a standard procedure during government exams, especially after 2018 when mobile Net services were suspended for an examination to hire 13,142 constables. In 2018, the cheating mafia had rigged a test held in March, forcing Rajasthan to scrap the exam. A relentless operation against gangs led to multiple arrests and re-examination. The authorities back then promised a ‘cheating free’ recruitment process even though it amounted to high-handedness in causing large-scale disruption in internet communication. Since then, the internet shutdown became an important practice during recruitment tests. For instance, mobile internet services were shut down across multiple cities during a teachers’ recruitment test, also known as REET, on September 26. The same clampdown was ordered for Patwari direct recruitment exams held on October 24 and October 25, which was attended by over 10 lakh students. On Wednesday too, several cities had to go through the same ordeal when divisional commissioners directed a curb on mobile internet for RAS (Rajasthan Administrative Services) preliminary exams. Recurrent restrictions, however, barely stopped the gangs from fielding dummy candidates and using bluetooth devices hidden in innerwears and slippers. For instance, police in Sawai Madhopur had discovered that REET question papers had allegedly reached some suspects before the exam, leading to multiple across from different cities. “Bluetooth devices have small reach and the accused can be easily caught during a simple frisking. Mobile internet, on the other hand, can facilitate widespread cheating easily as papers or answers can be shared,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/mobile-net-ban-new-norm-for-govt-exams-in-raj/articleshow/87319570.cms||---

The report said the DO level of one of the three samples was found to be lower than desired. The sample will be tested again to cross check the result. KMDA and the fisheries department had inspected the water body on Monday after dead fish was found floating. “The normal DO level in any water body should be over 5mg/litre. According to the report, the DO level of two of the samples tested was more than that, but one showed a lower level of DO. The fisheries department authorities will again test the sample. All the other parameters are normal,” said a KMDA official. Officials said WBPCB will also collect water samples from the Sarobar water body on Thursday to test the parameters and the fisheries department has also collected some of the dead fish to examine the cause of death. “All the reports are expected by this weekend,” said a KMDA official. “The dissolved oxygen level is low. But other parameters also need to be assessed to see if there are other factors behind fish dying,” said environmental scientist Swati Nandi Chakraborty. “The lake water needs to be thoroughly desilted to remove the toxic surface from the top soil,” said environmentalist Somendra Mohan Ghosh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rabindra-sarobar-water-sample-shows-low-oxygen-level/articleshow/87318609.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Kolkata||Team from Hungary to pay homage to ‘pilgrim scholar’ at Asiatic Society today||Kolkata: A mission from Hungary will visit Kolkata on Thursday to pay respects to one of the greatest Hungarian scholars, Alexander Csoma de Koros, who lived and worked in the city from 1831 to 1842 to compile and publish two landmarks of Tibetan language — the English-Tibetan-Sanskrit Lexicon and Grammar of the Tibetan language — at the Asiatic Society, under the tutelage of Lord Bentinck. On Thursday, the Hungarian ambassador, Andras Laszlo Kiraly, will visit the Asiatic Society with a team of scholars to see the room, where Koros worked. Koros is popularly known as a “Pilgrim Scholar” in Hungary, who had left his homeland in 1819 to reach Central Asia on foot in search of the origins of the Hungarians. The Hungarian mission is bringing with it an exhibition on Koros’s lifelong quest that finally led him to the portals of Indology. The room on the first floor of the Asiatic Society, where he worked, is still preserved. The Hungarian embassy had restored and conserved the room with Koros’ memorabilia a couple of years ago. “We are deeply touched by the gesture that Hungary has shown towards a scholar who lived and worked here nearly two hundred years ago. We are waiting for the exhibition on Thursday and it will definitely boost our knowledge about Koros,” said Satyabrata Chakrabarti, the general secretary of the Society. The Hungarian embassy collaborated with Hungarian scholar, Margit Koves, who teaches at the University of Delhi, for the exhibition. “We hope that the people of Kolkata will get to learn better about Koros. We are grateful to the city for providing home and scholarship to one of our greatest scholars. He was perhaps one of the first examples in Indo-Hungarian co-operation that continues to flourish to this day,” Koves said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/team-from-hungary-to-pay-homage-to-pilgrim-scholar-at-asiatic-society-today/articleshow/87318616.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

After the Delhi Disaster Management Authority decided at a meeting on Wednesday to allow schools to open, many schools have decided to open after Diwali, though online classes will continue for the time being. Gaur, a public relations professional whose kid studies in Bhatnagar International Foundation School in Vasant Kunj, said, “I will definitely send my son to school. Though the school notice says attendance is not mandatory, it is important for children to get a break from screen education. out of the screen.” The school notice said, “Parents too should have their Covid vaccination certificate available. To give parents and children time to prepare, the school will begin classes after the Diwali break.” Another parent, lawyer Tanya Agarwal, added, “This is a long-awaited decision that will help our children return to a normal life just as adults have. Symptomatic cases should be dealt with as required with minimum disruption for the rest of the children.” She hoped that families would act responsibly in the Diwali season to avoid a spurt in infection. Mohit Goel, whose kid is a nursery student at Bal Bharti, Pitampura, also felt that a start had to be made. “I feel the situation is under control and we have to make a new beginning,” he said. “Besides, the older students from Class IX upwards have been attending school for the past few months and everything seems okay. However, the government should keep a keen eye on the situation.” Goel’s elder child has been attending his Class XI at St Columba’s School. There, of course, are some parents who aren’t keen. Harjinder Singh’s older son, a Class IX student, is attending classes, but he doesn’t want the younger one to return to school. “If the institution provided proper hybrid teaching, I wouldn’t send my children to school,” the south Delhi resident said. Abhishek Jha makes no bones about his reluctance on the issue. He declared, “There can be no school without vaccination for the children.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/parents-eager-on-new-beginning/articleshow/87319603.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Jaipur||Over 1.1 lakh students secure seats under RTE via lottery in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Over 1.11 lakh students succeeded in securing seats under Right to Education (RTE) for which lottery was drawn on Wednesday. About 62,671 boys and 48,418 girls got seats who will now take admissions in their respective schools as per their priority. Meanwhile, private schools said that their dues are yet to be cleared by the state government. Around Rs 300 crore is pending involving 50,000 private schools. Although the government has started the process of payment, only 10% of schools have received their amount. Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar, said, “The process of clearing our bills is really slow. We have to wait for a long time to get our money due for the last two years. The government needs to speed up the process.” School education minister Govind Singh Dotasra drew the lottery on Wednesday at Shiksha Sankul. When asked about the question of clearing the school bills, he said, “It is under process and will be done on a priority basis. We have supported the private schools throughout the session. Many schools didn’t provide online classes to students, but we are still considering their case. RTE lottery is a routine and clearing the bills will take its own course.” Another issue parents face is the internet shutdown during government examinations for two days. Some parents were not able to fill the RTE forms on time hence, they are demanding to be given two extra days for that.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/over-1-1l-students-secure-seats-under-rte-via-lottery/articleshow/87319599.cms||---

The street vendors have been on a fast in protest as they have been forced to vacate their place of business near Law Garden by traffic police, despite having street vendor cards from the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). On Tuesday, the vendors who were sitting on a fast at Law Garden were detained by Navrangpura police. They are continuing their fast at the police station. “The health of two women protesters, who had not eaten for over 72 hours, deteriorated. Ambulances were called and they were shifted to VS Hospital,” said Rakesh Maheria of the Gujarat Lari Galla Patharna Sangh, an association of street vendors. Maheria is one of the protesters sitting on fast. Maheria said traffic police evicted 35 street vendors from near Law Garden around two months ago. “We met the state home minister who promised to look into the matter. However, vendors are still not being allowed to do business at Law Garden. As a last resort we decided to sit on a fast,” Maheria said.

Then, this is not to dampen your holiday spirit, but a heads up on health: You will have to show an RT-PCR report on return. In what appears to the Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) preparation to thwart chances of spike in Covid-19 cases during or after the festival, it had, on Tuesday, asked citizens to keep a 72-hour fresh report of RT-PCR tests handy upon return. On Wednesday top SMC officials, however, clarified that the rule will apply especially to those going outside the state and not for travellers within Gujarat. But it is not yet clear how the civic body’s health teams will identify people who have returned from other states. Lakhs of people from neighbouring states of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and ALSO other parts of the country living in Surat go to their native places in Diwali vacation. These travellers return after 15 to 20 days of vacation and health officials of SMC plan to check their RT-PCR reports apart from other tourists to the city. “If anyone tests positive, we will track that patient and ensure the person follows quarantine guidelines. If a person is not carrying the report we collect their details and get their test done,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner. “The appeal has been made to ensure that those visiting states with higher positivity rate follow Covid-19 protocols. And when they return we can identify who is positive among them,” Pani told TOI. All the travellers coming by road, rail, air and sea will be covered under this appeal, he added. Incidentally, the delta variant of Coronavirus had reportedly come to the city from Maharashtra where it was widespread then. On Wednesday, four positive cases were reported in the city taking the total number of registered cases to 1.11 lakh till now. According to official figures 1,629 deaths have been reported till now. As per official records 1.1 lakh people have been discharged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/rt-pcr-report-is-passport-to-surat-after-diwali-break/articleshow/87317575.cms||---

Moreover, he has been learning Korean through watching movies and videos on YouTube. So when an opportunity to work in Korea arrived he did not have to think twice. Sandeep was one among the hundreds of applicants who thronged the seminar hall at Mascot hotel on Wednesday to attend an awareness session organised by ODEPC (overseas development and employment promotion consultants ltd) regarding recruitment of agricultural labourers for onion cultivation to South Korea. “I have no prior agricultural experience, but the pay appears to be higher as compared to other opportunities. They are offering a salary of Rs 1 lakh. If I am getting this job, I will be able to visit the place too, which I have always dreamt,” said Sandeep S. Barely five days have gone since ODEPC issued the job notification for recruitment to South Korea. The salary comes around 1000-1500 USD and the qualification is a pass in class X. The working hours are from 8 am to 5 pm for 28 days a month and duty time meal is also provided. Around 600 aspirants turned up for the seminar on Wednesday. Joji Peter, who works as a resort manager and an applicant, says he is not worried about language. “I always wanted to work in foreign countries and the salary they offer is also good. I have been working as a manager in a resort in Munnar for the past few years. I am not really worried about the language, because the officials have said that only basic knowledge English is needed for this job,” he says. Among those who attended the programme on Wednesday there were also farmers with prior experience. “I have been into farming for the past few years and this project in South Korea offers a good salary also,” says Maneesh Babu, an applicant from Mavelikkara. ODEPC has so far received 5,000 registrations. “We have got a lot of applications. Around 5,000 people have registered already. The challenge they have to face will be the climate, which may go up to minus 20 degree celsius and food, which can be Korean food.” “They have to find their accommodation also. Language may not be a problem because basic knowledge in English will be enough,” said Anoop K, ODEPC managing director. The applicants will be selected based on the requirements. There are people who registered online and did not appear on Wednesday. The priority will be given to the people who appeared in person. The list of the selected applicants for the job in South Korea will be published within 10 days. After the selection process is finished, the necessary copies of documents, including passport, vaccination certificates and medical fitness certificate will be collected for the applicants.

---||Delhi||After long wait, Delhi Disaster Management Authority okays Chhath||NEW DELHI: Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday allowed Chhath Puja celebrations at designated sites with strict protocols amid a significant improvement in the Covid-19 situation. On September 30, DDMA had prohibited public celebration of the festival, triggering protests. LG Anil Baijal tweeted: “After detailed deliberations, it was decided to continue with the test, track & treat strategy along with strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour to prevent any resurgence of infection, particularly in view of the ongoing festive season. It was decided to permit celebration of Chhath Puja at designated sites subject to strict compliance of the orders of NGT and SOPs laid down by the revenue department in this regard.” The district authorities, in consultation with stakeholders like Chhath Puja organising committees and RWAs, would designate the sites. Plans are also afoot to make artificial ponds to organise the festivities. The onus of ensuring that Covid-appropriate behaviour is strictly followed would be on the organising committees. The focus would be on ensuring that the designated sites are not crowded and only a limited number of people are allowed so that social distancing is followed. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said very strict protocols would be required to be followed during Chhath Puja celebrations. He appealed to all to celebrate Chhath with all necessary precautions. Delhi government in a statement said the approval was given due to a lot of efforts by it, especially the persistence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “SOPs will be issued for Chhath Puja celebrations soon. I appeal to the people that Chhath Mahaparv, the festival of faith, which is a very important festival, should be organised with great care,” said Sisodia. After initially justifying the ban, the CM had written to the LG, who is also the DDMA chairman, urging him to permit Chhath celebrations. Sisodia had also written a letter to the Union health minister urging him to allow the festival. Chhath is a major festival in Delhi and is popular particularly among people belonging to Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh. It will be celebrated over four days, from November 8 to 11. Last year, Chhath and other festivals were banned due to the adverse Covid-19 situation. Compared with last year, the current situation is under greater control.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/after-long-wait-ddma-okays-chhath/articleshow/87319636.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||India||US CDC eases norms to let in those jabbed with Covaxin||HYDERABAD: At a time when the World Health Organisation (WHO) is dithering on granting emergency use listing (EUL) to Bharat Biotech's Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has paved the way for Covaxin-vaccinated individuals to travel to the US. However, this clearance comes with a rider. CDC has put Covaxin on the list of qualifying Covid-19 vaccine candidates that meet its criteria for exception under the category of "Participants in certain Covid-19 vaccine trials", as stated on the CDC website. It is unclear whether all those who have received both doses of Covaxin can avail of this exemption from quarantine or if it is only for those who participated in the Phase-3 trials. It is also unclear if the eligibility extends to those who received Covaxin after it was granted restricted EUA under "clinical trial mode" by the Indian drug regulator in January this year while its Phase-3 trials were underway. The "clinical trial mode" tag was removed and regular EUA was granted by the Indian government in March. The other vaccines (not approved by WHO or the US government) on this list of exceptions include the Chinese CanSinoBIO's Ad5-nCoV, Clover Biopharmaceuticals' SCB-2019, Novavax and Serum Institute of India's NVX-CoV2373, or Covovax. The CDC decision came even as WHO once again put off its decision on granting EUL to Covaxin till November 3 after its technical advisory group (TAG) met in Geneva on Tuesday. "TAG met on October 26, 2021, and decided that additional clarifications from the manufacturer are needed to conduct a final EUL risk-benefit assessment for global use of the vaccine. The TAG expects to receive these clarifications from the manufacturer by the end of this week, and aims to reconvene for the final risk-benefit assessment on Wednesday, 3 November," a WHO spokesperson told TOI in an emailed response. Meanwhile, according to the CDC website, "Airlines and airline operators must confirm that any 'covered individual' claiming this exception has official documentation (clinical trial letter, participant card, or modified vaccination card) of clinical trial participation." The first criterion laid down to avail of this exception is that "the passenger has participated or is participating in a Phase-3 Covid-19 vaccine trial with a qualifying vaccine candidate list ... that meets CDC criteria for the exception". The second criterion is that the "passenger received the full series of an active (non-placebo) Covid-19 qualifying vaccine candidate or an EUL vaccine and lists the name of the vaccine product and the date received".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-cdc-eases-norms-to-let-in-those-jabbed-with-covaxin/articleshow/87321663.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The short-duration intense rains have been recorded more this year. For eg, on Oct 11, there was 10cm rainfall reported in just four hours which impacted Chalakudy river, Kerala Sholayar, Peringalkuthu and Parambikulam dams. Following this sudden rainfall event, there was much hue and cry saying dam waters were released. But it was not so. It had rained similarly downstream also, causing flooding in several areas,” said James Wilson, dam safety expert and member, expert advisory group-KSEB. In case of dams managed with Tamil Nadu, the state is in constant touch with the officials. “We have sometimes seen difficult behavior from the Tamil Nadu government. But by and large, they have been conceding with our demands for release of water. The difficulty comes when there is pressure from their farmer groups. Unfortunately, in Kerala, there’s a lot of unwarranted and wrong information doing the rounds on the dams and reservoir management. “You can’t compare Idukki and Peringalkuthu dams. It is important to understand the inflow and storage capacity and how to manage this inflow when one talks of dam management,” he added. Tamil Nadu Sholayar starts filling from the end of July and is full by November. We can’t fix a rule curve, because if we do so, we will have to release the water to Kerala Sholayar and into the sea. However, we have to keep in mind that these dams have been made for a purpose, for irrigation purposes. There are nearly 4.15 lakh farmers dependent on those waters, Wilson said. “The recent weather events since 2018 has thrown open the need for a dynamic management of the reservoir. It is an evolving scenario and has been managed thus, unlike in disaster management, where you can take a decision by issuing a five-day warning and evacuating according to the situation. In reservoir management, the challenge is taking a decision at least one week earlier, based on the weather forecast. It is a complex challenge and there is an underlying risk— if you open and release and then it doesn’t rain, you end up wasting water which is for irrigation,” said SP Ravi, director, River Research Centre, Chalakudy. While rule curve is an indicator, authorities should take a call to release water before the levels increase downstream. Hence, when Mullaperiyar water levels are being fixed, the Idukki dam situation should also be kept in mind, he said. It is time to evolve into the concept of river basin reservoir management, Ravi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/sudden-changes-in-rain-hit-dam-management-experts/articleshow/87318647.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Experts admit that admissions in Telangana dropped as the exodus to deemed-to-be-universities and private universities in neighbouring states increased in the past few years. “The deemed-to-be-universities are more innovative in curriculum. There is a huge pool of courses to choose and exposure is also higher.

The train took three rounds on the 650-metre-long test-track and thus ran 3,900 metres. Its testing is being done ahead of its RDSO trial on the main track scheduled to be held in mid-November. Once the trial is successful, the dream of Kanpur to have Metro train service will come true. Kanpur Metro train is likely to start commercial operation either in the end of December or early January. The testing of the train was also successful on Tuesday. Scores of Metro staff were present to witness the train chugging. They said the dream has become a reality because of their hard work done in the last two years. Managing director, UPMRC, Kumar Keshav said, "Kanpur Metro ran on the test track in the depot on Monday evening. It is extremely satisfying and fulfils the achievement of the UPMRC team." There is no substitute for hard work, he said and added "We will be achieving bigger goals in the next few months". The three-coach Metro train looked exceptionally beautiful when it started moving on the test-trial after the driver buzzed its horn and switched on its headlight.

Besides praising them in his speech, he made many announcements aimed at benefitting Ludhiana industrialists. The decisions taken by the CM of scrapping 40,000 cases of VAT assessments in the state, abolishing the institutional tax, reducing fixed charges on power connections by 50%, earmarking Rs 150 crore for Focal Points and introducing one-time settlement schemes will benefit city industry the most in Punjab. One of the major announcements made by Channi was fixing a timeframe for completion of the upcoming Halwara airport. He said he would lay its foundation stone on November 15 and ensure its completion in eight months.The decision to scrap the VAT cases will benefit a big number of city businessmen. A senior officer of the state taxation department said, “Out of the 40,000 cases of VAT scrapped by the CM, about 25,000 are from Ludhiana. Of the 8,000 cases that will be decided under OTS, 50% are from Ludhiana, which will now be disposed of by paying only 30% liability and that too in two years. Abolition of the institutional tax will also benefit Ludhiana the most as the highest number of its assessees are here. The demand to abolish this tax was recently given by several business associations to the CM.”Welcoming the decisions taken by Channi, Upkar Singh Ahuja, Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) president who was one of the speakers at the event, said, “There is a dire need to resolve the issues related to the industry and CICU has been pursuing them since a long time. We are grateful to the CM for announcing industry-friendly measures and accepting our long-pending demands. Eliminating VAT assessment cases and allowing OTS schemes for settling disputes of businessmen with different departments, like taxation, Punjab Small Industry and Export Corporation, Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation (PSIDC) and Punjab Financial Corporation (PFC), will benefit the Ludhiana industry the most, as the highest number of disputes are from here.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/channi-courts-industry-ends-vat-cases-abolishes-institutional-tax/articleshow/87317594.cms||Mohit Behl

His condition deteriorated last night and, by morning, he was declared dead. His body will be cremated at his ashram in Morena in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot and PCC president Govind Singh Doatasra paid tributes to Rao at Vinoba Gyan Mandir Hall in Jaipur earlier in the day. In his condolence message, Gehlot said that his association with Rao went back 60 years, when he was 10-12 years old. “He came to Jodhpur with the then Congress president K Kamraj. Since then, he has been visiting Rajasthan and holding several youth camps and has inspired lakhs of youths in the country,” said Gehlot. In another tweet, he said, "I am personally aggrieved at the demise of veteran Gandhian, Padmashree Bhaiji Dr SN Subba Rao. He had been associated with the youth of this country for the last 70 years and constantly inspired them through his camps." Born in Bangalore on February 7, 1929, Rao was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi from his teenage years. He has participated in the freedom struggle right from the age of 13 and never looked back. He is known for his ‘Shramdan’ camps that mobilised youths to participate in nation building in the Gandhian way. Gehlot, considered close to him, has supported all his activities in the state. He was called as a special invitee to several programmes organised by Gehlot, especially the National Youth Festival held in Udaipur in 2011. Gehlot offered him a place to stay near Jaipur instead of Madhya Pradesh as a mark of respect for him. He was associated with first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on several projects related to non-violence. He was also instrumental in forming the peace and non-violence cell.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gandhian-subba-rao-passes-away-in-jaipur/articleshow/87319661.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vacation cut, pupils to be in school for national test on November 12||MUMBAI: The state education department has cut short the Diwali vacation for school students as an all-India test is to be held on November 12. Called the National Achievement Survey, the test is held to study the health of the education system. A circular released by the state on Wednesday directed schools to shut for Diwali from Thursday and reopen on November 11 — a day before for schools. So, schools must function on November 12 so that the achievement test based on multiple choice questions can be held for students of classes 3, 5, 8 and 10. TimesViewSlashing Diwali vacation at the last minute has put teachers and parents in a fix, as most had made travel plans for the first time since the pandemic. Schools that reopened on October 4 were busy with exams that were to end by October 30. Told to shut from Thursday, some exams will have to be put off to mid-November. Schools say it is unfair on students who will spend Diwali vacation studying. The National Achievement Survey could have been held by end of November when schools across the country would open for physical classes.In Mumbai, schools are conducting the first semester exam in online and offline modes. The education department had announced Diwali vacation till November 22. Now, with the test date announced, schools (aided, unaided) have been told to be ready to be picked up for the NAS. Around 10% of schools in each district will have to participate in the NAS. The 90-minutes test will assess understanding of for classes 3 and 5 students in maths and language, while students of classes 8 and 10 have 120 minutes to answer questions based on maths, science, social science and languages. Primary schools are still to resume physical classes in the state. Selected schools will have to prepare a maximum of 30 students. So, if a school has 45 students in class 3, chits of 45 students will be made. Of these, 30 will be picked up. Students named on the chit will be taken for the NAS. This survey test was last conducted in 2017 for classes 3,5 and 8 and in 2018 for class 10. This year, the assessment survey assumes significance as it will throw light on how students coped with online classes amid the pandemic. State deputy director of education has asked schools to ensure that they are functioning on November 12. Field investigators and observers—selected among teachers of schools—will be appointed to monitor the test. School heads said that with parents’ consent a must for physical classes, it may be tough to get a strength of 30 students per grade. “Many students will be out of town for Diwali and may not return for the test on November 12,” said the principal of a school. NAS findings would help diagnose learning gaps of students and determine intervention required in education policy, teaching practices and learning.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-vacation-cut-pupils-to-be-in-school-for-natl-test-on-nov-12/articleshow/87319665.cms||Sandhya Nair

It (second dose) also adds to the durability of protection,” said senior scientist Raman Gangakhedkar, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Gangakhedkar said, “It is important to adhere to the evidence generated by the manufacturer through the vaccine trials and take two doses. Single dose and the duration for which it will protect currently lacks in data.” The latest state health department report has revealed that 70 lakh people haven’t taken their second jabs despite completing the interval between the doses. Officials stated that most were delaying or skipping the second dose despite being eligible as the festivals had set in and the second wave appeared to be abating. Not just for Covid vaccines, multiple doses are required for most vaccine strategies to induce efficient protection. “After a first priming dose, immunity is stimulated. But over time, it contracts. At this time, a second dose improves the breadth of immune response and ensures the durability of the same,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the national Covid task force. In Covid-19, studies have consistently shown lower vaccine efficacy after the first dose as compared to the efficacy after the second dose for all vaccine platforms. “Hence, it is critical to complete the vaccine schedules at the right time to ensure optimal protection,” Pujari said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/2nd-shot-boosts-memory-cells-adds-to-durability-say-experts/articleshow/87330706.cms||Umesh Isalkar

There has been a rise in the number of diesel thefts from parked trucks since the fuel’s price breached the Rs100-mark. In the last week alone, two cases of diesel theft were registered with the Pimpri Chinchwad police, in which over 300 litres of diesel was drained out of the fuel tanks. Transport operators from Nigdi and Bhosari MIDC said at least one incident of diesel theft occurred daily, but the drivers did not approach the police. “Most of them are in a hurry to deliver the consignments on time. So, they prefer to bear the loss,” said a transport operator from Transportnagar in Nigdi. Early on Tuesday morning, around 200 litres of diesel worth Rs20,000 was stolen from a container truck parked along the service road at Bavdhan. About 70 litres of diesel, worth Rs7,000, was stolen from a transport operator’s truck in Bhosari MIDC around 5.30am on October 21. Transport operator’s manager Rahul Shinde told TOI that the CCTV outside the office had captured the theft. “The thieves came in a car around 5.30am. One of them broke the lid of the fuel tank of a truck and pumped out the diesel,” Shinde said. “Few days ago, our security guard had noticed some suspects trying to steal diesel from another truck. The thieves threatened him with a weapon,” Shinde added. An officer from the crime branch said they had identified the vehicle involved in the diesel theft. “We shall soon arrest the suspects,”he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/spurt-in-diesel-theft-from-parked-trucks/articleshow/87318646.cms||Mihir Tanksale

---||Kochi||Mark landslide-prone areas in Idukki: District panchayat||IDUKKI: After three panchayats in Idukki were hit by landslides that claimed human lives and damaged property recently, the district panchayat has asked the government to mark landslide-prone areas in the district without delay. Idukki collector Sheeba George has already sent a letter to state disaster management authority (SDMA) to conduct a study on landslide-prone areas in the district. “After the flood in 2018, Geological Survey of India provided a map of the landslide-prone areas in the district. But, the recent landslides happened in Peruvanthanam and Koottickal that were not included in the high-risk areas. Multiple landslides caused large-scale devastation in these areas,” she said. District panchayat president Giji K Philip said landslides wreaked havoc and claimed lives. “We will submit a letter to the government to mark landslide-prone areas in the district immediately. Every time after landslides, we rebuild destroyed roads and bridges. But if we know the hazard areas of the district we can evict people from there during monsoon and save lives ,” he said. “Our goal is not to evict people from the area immediately. When we know what places are vulnerable, we can take early precautions and try to avoid human habitations in such areas in future,” he said. Sajinkumar KS, assistant professor, department of geology at University of Kerala said the recommendation by district panchayat is a solid move that will help prevent the loss of lives in future. As per the data from district administration, floods on Oct 16 resulted in a loss of Rs 183 crore in various sectors and claimed 12 lives in landslide and rain-related incidents. Kokkayar, Peruvanthanam and Arakkulam panchayats witnessed large-scale damage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/mark-landslide-prone-areas-in-idukki-district-panchayat/articleshow/87318674.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Tax relief on bonds to offset property sale gain stands despite broker delay’||MUMBAI: A taxpayer is eligible to claim benefits under section 54-EC of the I-T Act for investments in capital gain bonds even if a broker delays making the actual investment, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Mumbai bench, has held. Income-tax liability that arises from long-term capital gains on sale of immovable property can be reduced by purchase of bonds eligible under section 54-EC. However, to avail of the exemption, it is vital that the investment is made within six months of the sale of the property. The cost of the investment in eligible bonds is reduced from the long-term capital gains. In other words, the taxable component of the long-term capital gains is reduced to the extent of the investments made. In this case, a taxpayer sold a residential property in Wadala for Rs. 58.5 lakh on April 25, 2013. Towards the end of the six-month period, on October 24, she issued a cheque of Rs 50 lakh to Karvy Stock Broking, the authorised agent for the capital gain bonds issued by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). While the cheque was routed through a sub-broker, Karvy Stock Broking acknowledged receipt of the application and the cheque and affixed its stamp on the application form on the same date. However, the company handed over the cheque to NHAI on November 6, and was encashed a day later. In other words, the date of the cheque reaching NHAI and its encashment had crossed the six-month period. Thus, the benefit claimed by the taxpayer was denied by the lower tax authorities. This led to the taxpayer appealing to the ITAT. The tribunal bench of Vikas Awasthy and M Balaganesh observed that the intent of the taxpayer to invest in NHAI bonds within the statutory time period was clear as she had pre-closed her fixed deposits well in advance to be able to make this investment. On the date of issue of the cheque, her bank balance was sufficient to enable NHAI to encash it. Further, an affidavit from the sub-broker was also submitted affirming that he had collected the application form and cheque on October 24 and handed it to Karvy Stock Broking on the same date, which fell within the six-month period. Based on these facts, the ITAT held that the investments were made in NHAI bonds within the stipulated period and the taxpayer would be entitled to the tax benefit claimed by her.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-tax-relief-on-bonds-to-offset-property-sale-gain-stands-despite-broker-delay/articleshow/87319702.cms||Lubna Kably

Of them, we could vaccinate 767 residents through the doorstep initiative. We could not pass on the benefit to the rest because they didn’t provide a medical certificate, which is a pre-requisite,” said the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s chief immunization officer, Suryakant Devkar. Bed-ridden patients can avail of the benefit of free Covid vaccination after prior intimation and submission of required medical documents to the PMC’s email ID bedriddenvaccination.pune@gmail.com. “We have observed that in quite a few cases, patients are not attaching the doctor’s medical certificate citing the medical condition keeping the patient bed-ridden. Besides, quite a few are not attaching another medical certificate supporting fitness for Covid vaccination. Without these mandatory certificates, we cannot offer Covid vaccination to the bedridden citizens,” Devkar said. Besides, the family members of bedridden individuals would have to send PMC the beneficiary’s (bedridden family member’s) name, address and contact number. PMC had initially asked the relatives of beneficiaries to ensure the presence of a family doctor during the 30-minute post-jab mandatory observation period. “Later, we decided that our health staffers would observe the patient,” Devkar said. “The objective is to extend the benefit of vaccination to everyone,” said mayor Muralidhar Mohol.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/some-miss-out-on-doorstep-jab-due-to-lack-of-medical-cert/articleshow/87318666.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Nagpur||Thieves throw away diamonds, viewed as fake, worth Rs8.5L||Nagpur: Unable to identify precious stones, three interstate thieves threw away diamonds worth Rs8.5 lakh. The incident came to light after Government Railway Police (GRP) last week nabbed the thieves who had committed several thefts on running trains. According to police, the thieves might have thought that the stones studded with gold ornaments were fake. They broke them with stone and iron rods before discarding them, said police. Police said the thieves had allegedly stolen purses of two women passengers onboard the Howrah-Mumbai Gitanjali Express near Gondia railway station on August 10. “One purse contained gold ornaments worth about Rs19 lakh while in the other purse there were valuables worth Rs1 lakh,” said investigation officer and PSI Pravin Bhimte. The thieves fled after the strike. Both the theft cases were registered with Gondia police station. Bhimte said a special team was formed following a rise in cases of thefts on trains between Kolkata and Nagpur. During screening of reservation charts and CCTV footage, the team led by Bhimte found three passengers from Nagaon in Assam travelling in the train during the theft. The police then screened CCTV footages of different railway stations including Nagpur, Gondia and Durg. A team went to Assam and detained the trio, identified as Nayanmuni Medhi (26), his younger brother Dipjyoti Medhi (22) and Sanju Rai (28). “They melted the stolen gold ornaments and sold them to a goldsmith there. During interrogation, it came to fore that they were not aware that the ornaments were studded with diamonds, so they threw them away,” said Bhimte. The police have recovered stolen gold worth Rs10.60 lakh from the trio. “Currently, they are under the PCR of Nagpur railway police for four more days,” said Bhimte.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/thieves-throw-away-diamonds-viewed-as-fake-worth-rs8-5l/articleshow/87317632.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Businessmen have again raked up the issue of reducing the rate of power to Rs 5 per unit for industry as promised by the Congress in its manifesto before coming to power.Speaking to the TOI, Charanjit Singh Vishivkarma, former president of United Cycle and Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association said, “We welcome the announcements made by the CM , especially bringing the one-time settlement for disputes related to Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation. But along with making these announcements, he should have also ensured a timeframe for implementation of each one of these. We are wary as it has happened in the past too that announcements made by an outgoing government close to elections either remain in the files of the bureaucrats or the new government forgets to implement them.”According to Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners’ Manufacturers’ Association of India (FMAI), “We understand Channi’s concern towards MSME and appreciate the decisions made, but as very little time of this government is left, the CM should ensure that all of these are implemented before the code of conduct comes into place. However, major disappointment was no reduction in the rates of power for industry to Rs 5 as it was promised by the Congress before coming to power. It was a golden chance for the new CM to show the industry that he is committed to its progress.” Per unit cost of power As per the information given by FMAI, the per unit cost for small power (SP) connections is in the range of Rs 8 to Rs 9, while that for the medium supply (MS) is between Rs 10 and Rs 12. The SP and MS connections are the most commonly used by the MSME industry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/polls-near-will-cms-promises-be-fulfilled-asks-msme-sector/articleshow/87317621.cms||Mohit Behl

The health services officials stated that around four lakh doses had been distributed to the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies, and rural units of the district. Around one lakh doses are in store with them at the state offices, having required deep freezers. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said there was still a good duration of storage life of the vials because the pending stock was manufactured recently. According to Deshmukh, all the units have been instructed to exhaust the vaccine stock with them at the earliest through targeted vaccination approach. “We have received around 13.53 lakh doses in October. Of them, 12.46 lakh are Covishield doses and 1.06 lakh are Covaxin doses,” he said. Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) chief immunization officer, Suryakant Devkar, said, “We have ample ice-lined refrigerators (ILRs) and deep freezers to store the doses. We could observe the drop in the daily vaccination and it would pick pace once again most likely in November and December.” Sanjay Patil, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Hospital Board of India, said while most of the private hospitals had stopped vaccination, the current stock was likely to be less than one lakh doses. “The private hospitals are careful in making sure that there is no wastage of doses. A vial is opened when 10 beneficiaries are present,” he said. The pace of vaccination started slowing down across the state from September-end. The slide was significant this month. On Wednesday, around 26,023 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district with Covishield and Covaxin.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/slowdown-effect-over-5l-doses-in-stock-in-district/articleshow/87318659.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The baby was born at 26 weeks of pregnancy in June this year through an emergency C-section due to pregnancy-related hypertension in the mother at a private hospital in Aundh on June 28. The baby weighed just 480 grams at birth and was moved to the Jupiter hospital’s NICU the same day for higher medical care. The smallest baby (in weight and size) to have survived premature birth (27 weeks of pregnancy) in Maharashtra was born in Mumbai in 2018 and weighed just 445 grams. Jupiter hospital’s chief neonatologist Shrinivas Tambe said, “The first few days were highly critical for the baby as the organs, including lungs, heart, brain and skin, were completely immature.” The baby required mechanical ventilation for the first seven days, followed by breathing support provided by a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine for the next 70 days. “The baby also had a congenital heart defect, patent ductus arteriosus, which was picked up during a heart scan and was successfully treated with medication. The baby also suffered an episode of infection, which was immediately diagnosed and treated with antibiotics,” Tambe said. The baby was discharged after spending a 100 days in the NICU on October 7. “The baby weighed 2kg at the time of discharge. Presently, the baby is at home, gaining weight and showing signs of normal development,” Tambe said. The infant is now being regularly followed up on the out patient department (OPD) basis. “The hospital’s doctors are monitoring the baby’s growth and developmental milestones at the hospital’s OPD periodically,” the parents said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/premature-baby-weighing-less-than-half-a-kilo-survives-against-all-odds/articleshow/87318678.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Experts back Covaxin for faster double vaccination||Pune: Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is back in the spotlight because experts are vouching for its use in the ongoing vaccination drive for speedy double inoculation of the beneficiaries in the district. Sanjay Patil, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Hospital Board of India, told TOI, “With the stipulated gap decided by the Centre, Covaxin could turn into a better option for the speedy double vaccination of citizens. Many of them are from the 18-44 age group, the most active group in terms of outdoor activities. Hence, they need to be immunised at the earliest.” The minimum duration for the second dose of Covaxin is 28 days, much lower than Covishield’s at least 84 days. Patil said relaxing the second dose gap for Covishield could also be an option to boost the vaccination among the remaining citizens. He said both the vaccines were effective and had provided the much-needed protection from the contagion to citizens. Around five lakh beneficiaries in the district are yet to get their first jab against Covid. A total of 9.11 lakh Covaxin doses have been administered in the Pune district so far. The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) chief immunization officer, Suryakant Devkar, said getting the Covishield or Covaxin jab was voluntary, but considering the Covaxin’s less duration for the second shot, it should be given a serious thought by the beneficiaries. “We have advised colleges, where the vaccination drives are under way, to prefer Covaxin because it could speed up the double vaccination of students in no time,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/experts-back-covaxin-for-faster-double-vaccination/articleshow/87318671.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The current water level was well within the storage level compliant with the upper rule levels approved by the Central Water Commission (CWC), chief minister M K Stalin said in response to a letter by his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday. “With reference to Mullai Periyar Dam, we are monitoring the water level closely and the officials from our side are in constant touch with your team.

Stalin further said he has discussed the situation with the officials concerned and directed them to continue to monitor the water levels and regulate the outflow accordingly. “In addition, I have specifically asked them to share in advance, all the necessary information on water position and release, if any, so that your government can initiate such precautionary measures needed before the release of water,” he added. The Government of TN and the people were very concerned about the floods and the damages suffered by Kerala and its people in the last 10 days, Stalin said and assured “we will stand with you during these difficult times…”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/stalin-tn-drawing-maximum-water/articleshow/87318690.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Powai cycle track ‘road to destruction’: City greens||MUMBAI: A day after environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said no trees would be cut for the Powai lake cycle track and that “real” green activists and environmentalists have already seen and discussed the project, activists alleged the plan is a “road to destruction”. Several green activists on Wednesday held a press conference and demanded that all construction work for the project be stopped immediately. “This is not a cycle track project but a road project and this is nothing but a road to destruction. The so-called cycle track is close to 8 metres wide. Nowhere in the world do they have cycle tracks that are so wide. The BMC has claimed it will use Gabion wall technology. But this technology is not eco-friendly at all. They are just cutting mountains and constructing roads using these Gabion walls. This is also destroying the ecological habitat of Powai lake,” said activist Amrita Bhattacharjee. Bhattacharjee added several trees have been affected by the project. “Several trees are being cut and rocks and mountains are being destroyed. We don’t need this kind of cycling track here. The state government hasn’t even done the eco-sensitive zone mapping of this region, which is required. There is no detailed project report nor any information related to the project in the public domain. The BMC has refused to answer us and is not replying to our RTI queries also,” she said. The BMC on its part has said Gabion wall technology has significant benefits over other retaining structures as it is carried out by using natural stone which is an inert material. It is a porous material, and the gaps between the stones allow interaction between land and the water table. The pockets in the gabion wall become a place for vegetation to take root and prevent further soil erosion. Over time, in some applications, the gabion structure can become so inundated with vegetation as to no longer be visible. The growth of roots within the gabion helps the structure become more stable, enhancing the ecosystem. Shivani Bhatt of the Banyan Tree cyclists group said, “The cost on the environment is too high. We want a workable cycle track on regular roads. We don’t need fancy cycle tracks. They are using taxpayers’ money. They should give us all the information. They should share all the information and consult us. They are not replying to any RTI.” Nishant Bangera of Mews Foundation demanded that the project be stopped. “All construction must be stopped. They (BMC) have said the committee will guide them. But what will the committee do after the work is over? They are causing irreversible damage.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/powai-cycle-track-road-to-destruction-city-greens/articleshow/87319739.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Nagpur||Schools in a fix as state declares Diwali vacations from today||Nagpur: Schools across the state were in for a shock on Wednesday afternoon when they received a letter from their local education officials announcing the start of 14-day-long Diwali vacations from Thursday itself. With less than 24 hours notice, schools are in a fix over completing their scheduled examinations. Earlier, the vacations were scheduled from November 1. And this is not just for those who have reopened in physical mode. The notification issued on Wednesday makes it crystal clear that all ‘online’ work of the schools must also cease. Majority of the schools in the city are functioning in online mode only, as NMC has permitted only Std VIII-XII to conduct physical classes. Dilip Bose, executive member of School Headmasters Charitable Association (SHCA), said, “To suddenly change the vacation schedule is illogical because we will find it very difficult to implement the changes. Many of our member schools have exams this week, so now all of that will be cancelled.” Director of a multi-branch CBSE school said, “How are we expected to change the schedule on such a short notice? Our students are in the midst of giving their exams, so if we stop now then that means everything will fall over to post-Diwali.” Another CBSE school principal said, “We are currently conducting online examination for all students. But due to this schedule, we will lose minimum two exam days. Now you multiply that by number of classes and that much academic backlog that will have to cleared from November 11 onwards, when schools reopen.” From mid-November, CBSE’s term-1 board exams will start for both X and XII. A senior teacher said that a lot of their focus will be there only, “hence it’s important that exam paperwork is over and done with”. So why was the Diwali vacation schedule changed at the last minute? TOI contacted education minister Varsha Gaikwad, who replied with a text message that she’s in the cabinet meet and will revert. Till the time of going to print, the minister had not called back. TOI received messages from some more principals who felt that the education department should have consulted them. A senior principal said, “I understand that there are pressure groups who have an impact on government decision, but to do things at the last minute is not good. On Wednesday afternoon you tell everyone that this is the last working day before vacations.” Some schools are thinking of “defying” the notification. A principal told TOI that there will be no regular classes for anyone but they will go ahead with the exam. “Not conducting exam now will only add to students’ anxiety, so better to get it over and done with,” said the principal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/schools-in-a-fix-as-state-declares-diwali-vacations-from-today/articleshow/87317664.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The festival adorned with the colours of passion, fun, adventure, art, and skill culminated with a DJ Night, which students enjoyed immensely. The highlight of the final day was the selection of Mr and Miss Rhapsody and the fashion show ‘Allure’, in which around 300 students, along with 40 teachers, participated. Medicos in diverse and trendy attire gave tough competition to fashion models. A ramp walk and question round followed in which participants gave spontaneous answers to judges to win the title.

---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Ureter op ‘botched’, two docs to pay woman Rs 28.5 lakh||KALYAN: A consumer forum has ordered two doctors to pay compensation to a woman from Dombivli for a botched surgery. The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has ordered Dr Sheena Shanbaug from Dombivli and Dr Ujjwal Mahajan from Navi Mumbai to cough up Rs 28.5 lakh, to be paid to Shreya Nimonkar (40) who has been waging a legal battle for over 10 years. The commission has, in its order, also mentioned that if the two doctors fail to pay the amount within a month’s time, they will have to pay 12 per cent per annum, by way of penal interest, for the period of delay. It was in March 2010 that Nimonkar had approached Dr Shanbaug, seeking treatment. Her complaint states that she used to have severe body ache and would get exhausted during her menstrual cycle. Nimonkar alleged that Dr Shanbaug and Dr Mahajan had operated on her without her permission and without explaining the risks involved in undergoing the surgery. The complainant, in her appeal before the commission, alleged that both ureters were permanently damaged “due to negligence on the part of the doctors”. The ureter is a tube that carries urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder. Nimonkar’s complaint also states that the damage that has been caused to her ureters could not have occurred in a surgical procedure “unless the surgeon is incompetent” in handling surgical instruments “which clearly shown negligence on the part of both doctors”. The negligence came to light after Nimonkarapproached Sion hospital where Dr Ajit Sawant performed abdominal laparotomy in 2011. Nimonkar’s petition states that Dr Sawant explained that abdominal surgery was the only option. This procedure entailed cutting some 20 cm of the intestine. A tube was attached to both ureters. Advocate Pooja Joshi Deshpande, who appeared for Nimonkar, said, “The victim approached me in 2012. I approached the court after collecting all evidence related to the case and have fought this legal battle for around 10 years.” Nimonkar said that during this long period of the legal battle she has had to face “a lot of difficulty”. She said she even lost her husband to Covid. Dr Mahajan told TOI, “I’ve not done any wrong surgery and judges have issued an oral order. Once I receive a written copy about reason for fine, I will decide on whether to approach a higher court.” On her part, Dr Shanbaug said, “The Maharashtra Medical Council and National Medical Council, Delhi, have given me a clean chit, saying there is no medical negligence. I can’t comment on the judgment of court as I have not yet received the certified order copy.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-ureter-op-botched-2-docs-to-pay-woman-rs-28-5-lakh/articleshow/87319752.cms||Pradeep Gupta

Scientists of CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) have suggested a number of plants which you can grow in your house to prevent mosquitoes during the dengue season. According to experts, besides burning neem leaves, tulsi, lemongrass, lavender and even the seasoning used in your favourite pizza can help one ward away mosquito menace. Oregano, catnip, lavender, mint, lemongrass, basil, marigold and rosemary are some of the scientifically proven natural mosquito repellents. “Smell of lavender, mint or marigold may be soothing for us but it is repulsive for mosquitoes. The strong odour of these plants and presence of certain compounds in them like nepetalactone, pyrethrum and others deter mosquitoes,” said senior principal scientist at NBRI, Sharad Srivastava. “These saplings can be planted in pathways, balconies, near doors and windows,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/plant-repellent-saplings-at-home-prevent-dengue-sting/articleshow/87319758.cms||---

In his bail application, Jain has once again pleaded innocence by stating that the FIR is a conspiracy hatched by bootlegger Alpesh Waghvani alias Alpu Sindhi and it is being used as a ‘weapon’ to cause harm to his reputation. Jain even stated that he was ready for narco test or any other kind of scientific test but the investigating agency did not conduct any such tests. It is also alleged that his representations are not being considered and the FIR is being investigated with a prejudiced mind. The bail application also makes allegations against the law student that she filed the FIR on the insistence of Sindhi and her banking transactions raises doubt about her activities even as she claims to be a law student.

Fadnavis said 6 lakh works for water conservation were undertaken through the scheme. “The Bombay high court had even set up an expert committee to study this scheme. The committee had lauded this scheme and the high court had accepted their report. There are possibilities that there may have been some irregularities and these must be investigated,” Fadnavis said.  He said around 600 complaints had been received and these must be probed but, for this the scheme should not be run down. The state government, however, clarified that the inquiry it had set up was still underway and was not completed. On Tuesday the Public Accounts Committee headed by BJP legislator and former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, during a meeting, heard the clarifications made by the additional chief secretary of the soil and water conservation department to the issues raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Four cruise party ‘organisers’ seek bail, say they didn’t regulate entry, assign rooms||MUMBAI: Seeking bail for the four alleged organisers arrested in the cruise drug bust case, the defence told the special NDPS court on Wednesday that their company was only involved in conducting live entertainment shows on the ship, and did not have the authority to either regulate entry onboard or assign rooms. Gopalji Anand, Samir Sehgal, Manav Singhal and Bhaskar Arora of Delhi-based company Caneplus Trading Pvt Ltd, operating under the brand name Namas’cray, were arrested earlier this month. The defence said that in a tripathe agreement, while BigTree Entertainment’s BookMyShow did the online ticketing for remote booking, the boarding passes and key cards for rooms were issued by Waterways Leisure Tourism Pvt Ltd (Cordelia). “Neither sailing was in their control nor navigation of the ship. It was exclusively in control of Cordelia,” defence advocate Sajal Yadav said. “They have no control on the entry, exit, and who boards the ship. Then how is any of this applicable?” The defence also pointed out that no one from Cordelia or the sponsors are accused in the case. The defence added that before crossing the pier area to board the cruise ship, passengers had to pass through frisking, screening and security check by CISF. “More than 1,500 passengers were issued boarding passes by Cordelia. If any passenger,..by surreptitious means and concealment, successfully carried any contraband, without their consent or connivance or culpable negligence, knowledge thereof cannot be attributed to them,” the defence submitted. It was also argued that the NCB is using the term rave party which was not in any of their advertisements or representation. Yadav submitted that otherwise, too rave is a party with music, lights, and dance and not by definition a drugs party. He further submitted that the company in its promotions on social media had clearly warned every passenger against bringing any drugs or illegal substance, in view of their zero tolerance policy and also forbidden passengers from engaging in sexism, racism, transphobia, unprovoked touching, intimidation, homophobia, etc. The defence said that all four accused had family members on the ship. While one had got his mother, another’s wife was present onboard. Yadav also claimed that the accused were illegally detained as while their custody was taken after the cruise returned to the city on October 4, they were shown as formally arrested the following day. He also said that they were remanded to custody mechanically. “Application of mind has been embarrassing,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-4-cruise-party-organisers-seek-bail-say-they-didnt-regulate-entry-assign-rooms/articleshow/87319783.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Nashik||MSRTC bus services affected in parts of rural Nashik||Nashik: The statewide indefinite hunger strike called by the employees of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) on Wednesday adversely affected bus services in several parts of the Nashik district as some employees did not operate the buses from several depots. The state transport utility employees resorted to the strike in Peth, Malegaon and Manmad depots on Wednesday morning despite various organisations claiming that the call was only for an indefinite hunger strike at their district headquarters. Employees, owing allegiance to the Maharashtra ST Kamgar Sanghatana, Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), ST Kamgar Sena and others, have formed a joint action committee and from Wednesday, they started the agitation outside MSRTC’s divisional office even as some of the employees in various depots resorted to strike work. “Our demands are related to amalgamation of MSRTC with the state government, giving the employees their rightful dues of the dearness allowance (DA) and all pending dues be settled before Diwali. The strike comes after regular interaction with the MSRTC administration and the government, which has taken no cognizance of our demands so far,” Vijay Pawar, of ST Kamgar Sanghatana, said. The services were disrupted in three talukas since morning creating problems for office-goers and students. “Till the morning, the MSRTC employees were saying it was only a hunger strike. Now suddenly, the buses are off the roads. I had to catch a bus for Pune from here and that has been cancelled. Now, I will have to travel to Nashik first to reach Pune,” said Sameer Desle, a resident of Malegaon. Similar was the fate of students who could not get buses to reach their schools. Collectively the three depots account for movement of around 150 buses. An MSRTC official said that they were taking measures to resolve the issue at the earliest. Meanwhile, after 3pm, the bus service from New CBS to Pune was also affected partially as some of the employees refused to take up the scheduled work. Most of the MSRTC buses — ordinary and Shivshahi bus services — were thus stalled. However, the Shivshahi buses, that have been leased by the MSRTC, were operating as usual. “The 3.30 pm Shivshahi bus to Pune got cancelled and now I am forced to take the only available seat in the other Shivshahi bus. I need to return home from Pune before Diwali. I wonder how I will be able to do that,” Amit Patil, one of the commuters, said. Similarly, as the ordinary buses stopped plying, commuters were looking for every alternate mode of transport to travel towards Pune.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/msrtc-bus-services-affected-in-parts-of-rural-nashik/articleshow/87319764.cms||Abhilash Botekar

However, this clearance comes with a rider. CDC has put Covaxin on the list of qualifying Covid-19 vaccine candidates that meet its criteria for exception under the category of “Participants in certain Covid-19 vaccine trials”, as stated on the CDC website. It is, however, unclear whether all those who have received both doses of Covaxin can avail of this exemption from quarantine or if it is only for those who participated in the Phase-3 trials. It is also unclear if the eligibility extends to those who received Covaxin after it was granted restricted EUA under “clinical trial mode” by the Indian drug regulator in January this year while its Phase-3 trials were underway. The clinical trial mode tag was removed and regular EUA was granted by the Indian government in March. The other vaccines (not approved by WHO or the US government) that have made it to this list of exceptions include the Chinese CanSinoBIO’s Ad5-nCoV, Clover Biopharmaceuticals’ SCB-2019, Novavax and Serum Institute of India's NVX-CoV2373, or Covovax. The CDC decision came even as WHO once again put off its decision on granting EUL to Covaxin till November 3 after its technical advisory group (TAG) met in Geneva on Tuesday. “TAG met on October 26, 2021, and decided that additional clarifications from the manufacturer are needed to conduct a final EUL risk-benefit assessment for global use of the vaccine. The TAG expects to receive these clarifications from the manufacturer by the end of this week, and aims to reconvene for the final risk-benefit assessment on Wednesday, 3 November,” a WHO spokesperson told TOI in an emailed response. Meanwhile, according to the CDC website, “Airlines and airline operators must confirm that any ‘covered individual’ claiming this exception has official documentation (clinical trial letter, participant card, or modified vaccination card) of clinical trial participation.” The first criterion laid down to avail of this exception is that “the passenger has participated or is participating in a Phase-3 Covid-19 vaccine trial with a qualifying vaccine candidate listed … that meets CDC criteria for the exception.” The second criterion is that the “passenger received the full series of an active (non-placebo) Covid-19 qualifying vaccine candidate or an EUL vaccine and lists the name of the vaccine product and the date received.” According to CDC, airlines and airline operators need to ensure that the passenger has had the vaccination series completed at least 14 days before the flight’s departure.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/us-cdc-eases-hurdles-for-covaxin-jabbed-travellers/articleshow/87320547.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The police said that Abdul Fefdawala had made the speech at a hotel in the city during a community event ‘Fayam-e-Insaniyat’. “While addressing the audience, Fefdawala had evoked the Gujarat 2002 riots and said how members of the minority community were targeted and killed. He added that women from the community were raped and children were murdered and when he heard about it, he decided to do something,” said D S Chauhan, ACP (crime). Fefdawala went on to say that he established Majlise Alfala trust in the UK in 2003 to collect donations. “He contacted about 125 donors and started gathering money that was then routed to India. Fefdawala said during the speech that the money was sent to strengthen the community so that it can defend itself against attacks from other religions,” Chauhan, member of the special investigation team (SIT) investigating the case, told TOI. In the hour-long speech, Fefdawala constantly talked about making his community stronger in Gujarat. The event was also attended by Salahuddin Sheikh and Umar Gautam who have been arrested in hawala and religious conversion racket. The police said that Fefdawala, a native of Bharuch who later shifted to the UK, has sent over Rs 150 crore through hawala and donations in the last 18 years. The investigators got the video of the speech from one of the witnesses connected with Afmi Trust that was established by Sheikh in Vadodara. The cops have some videos of Gautam and Sheikh too. The UP ATS had arrested Umar Gautam and Qazi Jahangir in June this year on the charges of mass religious conversions through inducements like marriage or jobs. Umar was alleged to have converted over 1,000 persons in UP. He is suspected to be involved in mass conversions of deaf and mute students, women and children. Vadodara-based Sheikh’s name surfaced during their interrogation and the cops learnt that his bank accounts were used for hawala transactions. He was arrested later and Vadodara police are now investigating the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/accused-invoked-godhra-to-foment-communal-tension/articleshow/87317708.cms||Tushar Tere

The accused had raped the victim after conducting a fake marriage with her in front of the Guruvayur Temple. Fast-track court judge M P Shibu sentenced Shaji, son of Cherupanakkal Baby of Kunnamkulam, to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) and slapped a fine of Rs 2 lakh. The judge sentenced Alice, wife of Cheruvathur Thomas of Thozhiyur near Vadakkekkad, to six years RI and slapped a fine of Rs 25,000 According to the prosecutor K S Benoy, the 27-year-old woman was working as a sales girl in a private firm in Kunnamkulam when the assault had taken place. Shaji, an autorickshaw driver, had promised to marry the survivor and conducted a fake marriage in front of the Guruvayur temple by exchanging basil garlands in 2006. Shaji then took her to a nearby lodge and raped her there but the accused did not actually marry her. Later, in 2009, Shaji again approached the woman with promises of marriage, and took her to the house of Alice, who was running a home-nurse firm. The woman was raped there again and Alice had allegedly connived in the crime. The survivor had then suffered excessive bleeding, and the accused duo took her to Thrissur medical college hospital. However, both the accused had disappeared from the medical college, after leaving the injured woman there.

The vaccination drive is being conducted for the students who are yet to be inoculated. The state government has announced the campus vaccination drive as it has made it mandatory for every student to be fully vaccinated before they can attend the lectures physically. K L Bondkar, the Nashik region joint director for higher education department, said, “The colleges are planning these drives on a daily basis and expect the numbers to swell in the near future.” More than 700 students have taken the vaccine doses so far. The students are from higher education and technical education colleges across Nashik district, officers from both departments said. The vaccination centres are being organised at the institutions during the drive between October 25 and November 2. “We have already asked the colleges in the city and rural areas to start the drive as per their requirement and have assured them of our support. There are several colleges in the district — most of them in Nashik city — that have started the drive since Monday,” Ganesh Misal, the Nashik deputy collector and nodal officer for vaccination, said. Two colleges have started the vaccination process within the city limits and two others have started in the rural areas. The vaccination centres also act as common vaccination centre for the students of the different colleges. Therefore, students from any college can visit Bytco College at Nashik Road and KTHM College to get the shots. “There is no fixed data with the educational institutes on how many students have taken vaccination and what is the expected number. So the centres have been started and students who turn up are being vaccinated. Besides, the students are also getting vaccine doses at centres near their homes,” Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the NMC medical superintendent, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/over-700-college-students-take-jabs-at-nashik-colleges/articleshow/87319795.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He forges his body for Goliathesque muscularity and symmetry, which judges consider in bodybuilding competitions. A resident of Indiranagar, the 36-year-old officer was hailed by his army colleagues after he stood fourth in the 70kg senior open category of ‘world bodybuilding and physique sports championship’ held on October 4 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. He began training for bodybuilding after high school near Bhootnath.An alumnus of Lucknow Christian College, Henrique, a BCom graduate, said, “I was a thin and lean boy prior to high school, but today I am preparing for Mr Asia title and amateur Olympia International Federation of Bodybuilding & Fitness championship. My objective is to create awareness about healthy body among youths, who are blindly pushing themselves to have six- and eight-pack abs to follow actors and models.” Henrique was inspired by his schoolmate Siddharth Singh, now a major in army.“Bodybuilding is hard and demands utmost dedication, including years of training. Short-cut alternatives such as taking steroids without medical guidance may harm the body,” said Henrique, who was nicknamed ‘Hercules’ by his batchmates during training at Officers’ Training Academy, Chennai.

---||Nagpur||Central panel OKs Nag River project, with hike in property tax to run it||Nagpur: After remaining on paper for last 11 years, Nag River Pollution Abatement Project has been approved by the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) of Union finance ministry on Wednesday. But, the high-powered committee has asked Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to hike property tax to pay for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project. Also, the cost of the project is likely to be reduced by Rs100 crore or more. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B gave a presentation on the project to EFC and representatives of ministry of finance, Niti Ayog, Jalshakti, National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD), housing and urban affairs etc. He was accompanied by superintending engineer Manoj Talewar, executive engineer Shweta Banerjee and technical consultant Mohammed Israil. Sources from NMC told TOI, “EFC placed mandatory condition of increasing property tax and also levy new component of sanitation in property tax. NMC requires over Rs10 crore per annum for O&M of sewage treatment plants (STPs) and other infrastructure under the project. O&M is not part of the project cost. Civic chief had no option but accept the condition to get approval,” sources said. NMC had launched new property tax system in 2015-16, which increased tax by 2-4 times. Since then, tax has not been revised. Now, NMC general body will have to pass a resolution to increase the tax. The civic body will require the state’s approval also if it is to introduce new component for sanitation in property tax. Sources added EFC also said it would reduce the cost of the project by over Rs100 crore. “At present, the cost has been worked out at Rs2,117.56 crore. NMC has made provision of Rs132 crore for project management consultant (PMC) in the cost. The amount is 10% of engineering cost of the project. EFC said centre will bear only 5% of the cost. Also, EFC said it would deduct some more components from the project,” sources said. Radhakrishnan told TOI, “It is a historic moment for NMC as it is probably the first time the government approved a project for sewage and other infrastructure for revival of water body. EFC has approved deadline of eight years for execution of the project, which we will try to reduce.” Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari expressed gratitude towards Union minister Nitin Gadkari. “It is the dream project of Gadkari and NMC has the responsibility for successful execution,” he said. The process for rejuvenation of the city’s iconic river turned nullah started in 2010 after Nagpur bench of Bombay high court treated media reports of high pollution in the river, consequently polluting Kanhan, Wainganga rivers and Gosikhurd project, as suo motu PIL, and directed the civic body to rejuvenate the water body. NMC had first proposed the project in 2011. IN A NUTSHELL * Nag River Project is all about laying new sewage lines, treating and releasing it in water body * NMC is already recovering conservancy tax of 12% of rateable value in property tax * NMC is levying sewage benefit tax, which is 1% of rateable value * EFC has made it mandatory for NMC to bear cost of over Rs10 crore per annum on O&M of Nag river project * EFC placed condition before NMC of increasing property tax to bear O&M cost * Tax hike will require approval of NMC general body * State govt too has to sign off on levying new sanitation component in property tax||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/central-panel-oks-nag-river-project-with-hike-in-property-tax-to-run-it/articleshow/87317713.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Modi was then the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate. Six persons were killed and 89 injured in the six serial blasts. The NIA court of ADJ-XV Gurvinder Singh Malhotra will pronounce the quantum of punishment on November 1. Only Fakkruddin got the benefit of doubt due to lack of evidence against him. “The original plan was to assassinate Modi by suicide bombing after reaching near him, but the terrorists gave up that plan realising his fortress-like security cover after conducting reconnaissance and failure to make an explosive powerful enough for the purpose,” said NIA special public prosecutor Lallan Prasad Sinha. Modi was Gujarat CM that time. At least three IEDs were later diffused. The terrorists, all members of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) group, had detonated a suicide vest for test on a palm tree at Sithiyo in Ranchi before executing the serial bombing plan in Modi’s rally at Patna. The NIA had located the tree and found explosive traces on it after the arrest of the terrorists. Overall, 12 persons were involved in the serial blast case, but one Tariq Ajam Ansari died after getting injured while fitting a pencil battery in an IED inside a public toilet at platform number 10 of Patna Junction on the rally day and another one, Imtiyaz Ansari, was also injured and arrested from the spot. His confessional statement blew the lid off the entire conspiracy. Later, Haider Ali alias Black Beauty, Numan Ansari, a juvenile, Mujibullah Ansari, Umer Siddique, Azharuddin Qureshi, Ahmad Hussain, Fakkruddin, Mohammad Feroz Aslam and Mohammad Ifteqaar Alam were arrested in the case investigated by the NIA. The juvenile’s case was separated and shifted to Juvenile Justice Board while the rest ten faced trials in the NIA court. Special PP Sinha said the agency would demand capital punishment for at least five of the nine convicts, consideing the serious charges against them like murder, waging war against Union of India and association with a terror organisation. Haider, Imtiaz, Umer, Azharuddin and Mujibullah were also involved in the Bodh Gaya Mahabodhi Temple serial blasts on July 7, 2013 and are presently serving life imprisonment in the case. Sinha was assisted by additional public prosecutor (NIA) Pramod Kumar, Sanjay Kumar and Manoj Kumar in the case. The convicts were represented by counsel Sayed Imran Ghani.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/nia-court-holds-9-guilty-of-serial-blasts-in-modis-patna-rally/articleshow/87317802.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Vadodara||10 inadvertently get admitted at MSU’s science faculty!||Vadodara: MS University’s Faculty of Science on Wednesday came across an unusual episode when a student outfit claimed that the faculty had first admitted a group of students by mistake and later cancelled their admissions in first year bachelors of science. “At a time when the admission process has almost ended, the officials have told this group of students that they were admitted by mistake. These students have even paid fees, were attending lectures and now suddenly their admissions have been cancelled,” said Saurav Solanki, faculty class representative from the Royal Club of Science. Faculty dean professor Hari Kataria admitted that the students got admission as their applications did not get filtered during the online process. “Since the applications did not get filtered, the students had paid their fees and subjects too were allotted. But it came to my notice that this group of students who had scored less than 40%, in theory, had got admission at our faculty which is against our admission rules,” Kataria told TOI. Kataria said that he has given the option to the students to take admission at M K Amin College at Padra, which also falls under MSU. “Since, their pass percentage is very low, we cannot admit them at our faculty. They have the option of taking admission under a higher payment programme at Padra so that their careers do not get jeopardized,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/10-inadvertently-get-admitted-at-msus-science-faculty/articleshow/87317879.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Travel companies cautious on booking tickets to US||HYDERABAD: Lack of clarity over Covaxin’s validity among USA-bound travellers, has put city tour agents on guard. Worried about the fate of these passengers — and the repercussions for their business — most of them are steering clear of accepting requests for ticket bookings from people vaccinated with two shots of Covaxin. This, despite their desks being flooded with enquires from prospective flyers. “We are getting a lot of calls from people who have taken Covaxin and want to travel to the US. At least 50% of our enquires comprise such travellers,” said Abdul Majid Faheem, Travel Agents Federation of India (Telangana and AP chapters). “But we are not being able to entertain their requests because we are told they will not be allowed entry. If they get into trouble, it will adversely impact us as well. It’ll also become chaotic if we have to cancel them last minute,” added Faheem. The confusion has been created by the World Health Organisation delaying its emergency use license (EUL) to Covaxin. WHO’s technical advisory group met recently and decided to ask for more data from Bharat Biotech before issuing the license. TOI spoke to a number of airlines and travel agents across the country who said there was no clarity on whether a Covaxin-vaccinated person can travel to the US if he/she has a negative RT-PCR test result. “We hope this issue is resolved soon as there is a tremendous demand for the US at the moment and we do not want to lose out on business,” Faheem said. Agrees Rajeev Kale, president and country head (holidays, MICE, visa) at Thomas Cook (India). According to him, reopening of the US borders and acceptance of doubly vaccinated Indians has created high demand from Hyderabad and Telangana. “We are receiving not just queries, but also booking requests from customers who already have valid visas,” he said adding, “While we continue to receive interest from customers vaccinated with Covaxin shots too, we await approval from the US authorities before we are able to go ahead with such bookings.” The uncertainty has left travellers in a dilemma. “I was hoping to spend Christmas with my extended family in New Jersey. I really hope the authorities clear this Covaxin issue before Christmas,” said Manikonda resident, Arjun Rao, who took his second Covaxin dose in June. “We are also hoping for positive news for customers who are doubly jabbed with Covaxin to be allowed to travel soon,” said Daniel D’Souza, president and country head, SOTC Travel, stressing on the uptick in queries for the US especially for Christmas and New Year among fully vaccinated customers from Hyderabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/travel-cos-cautious-on-booking-tickets-to-us/articleshow/87320584.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is concerned that a large section of people are neither wearing masks, nor adhering to social distancing. Thus, Jadhav has directed that each of the six divisions of the NMC will have to deploy teams within their jurisdictions at the earliest. An NMC official said although the Covid situation in the city is under control, there could be fresh rise if people violate the safety protocols. “Only few days are left for the beginning of Diwali festival and people are out in the markets to shop. Many city markets have started witnessing huge rush of people on weekends and this will increase in the next few days,” the official said. “We are observing that a large section of people are not wearing mask at market and public places. This may lead to rise in new cases of Covid-19. Hence, we want people to observe Covid appropriate behaviour,” he added. The official said as per directive of the municipal commissioner, 18 teams, comprising civic officials and employees, have been deployed to take action against erring citizens, “Each team includes three members and they will start slapping fine from tomorrow (Thursday). A fine of Rs 200 each is to be recovered from those found without masks in public places,” the official said. The NMC had started slapping fines during the first wave of Covid pandemic last year and so far a total of 13,686 people have been penalised with fines amounting to Rs 48.29 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/civic-teams-to-take-action-against-errant-citizens/articleshow/87319853.cms||Tushar Pawar

A resident of LDA Colony, Mishra has been fighting for justice against the hospital where his wife died during treatment for Covid in May 2021. Soon after, he had filed a complaint of negligence and overcharging against the hospital with the chief development officer (CDO) in charge of the Integrated Covid Command Centre. Authorities have now acted following his relentless persuasion. The CDO wrote to Mishra, saying that the private hospital was found guilty of charging Rs 2.85 in excess. In total, Mishra was charged Rs 4.5 lakh, which was above the government-mandated rates for Covid patients. Mishra, however, in his reply to the CDO office has termed the decision as a “mockery of justice where a person’s life is being valued in money.” “My fight was not just for money, but for justice for my deceased wife and other patients who lost their lives due to the hospital’s alleged negligence,” he said. “Why is the hospital not being punished despite being found guilty and why for the past five months are files related to the complaint buried in health department offices?” he questioned. TOI has been highlighting cases of overcharging and other complaints such as Mishra’s all along.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/want-action-against-hosp-not-refund-for-covid-death/articleshow/87319889.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Association president Surendra Thingne warned of intensifying the stir if the NMC did not fulfil the demands before Diwali. The employees shouted anti-NMC slogans for almost three hours. As municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B was not in town, the protesters met additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and submitted a memorandum of demands. The demands of the employees include: Release of arrears for at least five months out of the outstanding 16 months since when the 7th Pay Commission came into effect; implementation of 11% dearness allowance from October salary paid in November; relaxation in rules to make temporary employees working in the civic body permanent, etc. “Currently, the NMC asks for 20 years in service for making employees permanent,” said Thingne. The association also demanded that all the vacant posts in the NMC be filled without delay. According to the protesters, over 45% posts are lying vacant and as a result, the existing manpower is overburdened. “As many 40 employees, including sanitary workers and teachers, have died due to Covid-19 while discharging duties during the pandemic period. However, the kin of the deceased employees are yet to receive Rs50 lakh compensation announced by the central government,” said Thingne. The NMC should give Rs10 lakh each to the relatives of the deceased and give job to one member from such families, he added. The agitators also accused the BJP-ruled civic body of adopting double standards. According to them, from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2017, the standing committee chairmen of the ruling party had earmarked Rs10 crore for disbursing 6th Pay Commission arrears. However, the budget amount was later utilized for some other purposes, they said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nmc-employees-protest-over-pending-demands/articleshow/87311765.cms||---

The accused boy has been shifted to the juvenile home as per the directions of the Malappuram juvenile justice board. Kondotty deputy superintendent of police Ashraf K said that further proceedings in the case would be decided by the Juvenile Justice Board. “We are ascertaining the exact age of the accused. If he has crossed 16 years of age, then the juvenile justice board will decide whether the case trial can be done before the court on the basis of the recommendation of the medical board,” he said. The probe team is also looking into the internet use behaviour of the boy and whether he had any history of substance abuse. The accused boy is a Class 10 student and has been charged under IPC section 511 of 376 (attempt to rape), 307 (attempt to murder) and 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty). According to the police, the woman was on her way to attend classes at a computer training centre when the boy grabbed her from behind and dragged her to a plantain field on the side of the road and tried to force himself on her at 1pm on Monday.

---||Meerut||Saharanpur woman found dead in Chhattisgarh||MEERUT: After 19 days of frantic search for his daughter Sonia Tyagi, 25, who went missing from Nainshob village in Saharanpur on October 3, the distraught father finally received a call he’d been waiting for, with the voice on the other end of the line breaking the bad news – the woman, found in a semi-conscious state in the jungles of Ranipura in Dhamtari district of Chhattisgarh, had died in hospital. Police, who identified her with the help of her Aadhaar card, say she was poisoned. The body was brought back on Tuesday and cremated. His eyes glazed with tears, Maniram Tyagi, a marginal farmer, who lives with two sons and three daughters at Nainshob village, said Sonia was an active Hindu Jagran Manch activist and was preparing for the Indian Police Service. "She was not married and wanted to join the police force. Her sudden disappearance followed by her death, that too in an unknown territory, is too much for us to bear. We had no clue how she reached Chhattisgarh and what must have happened to her there. She had no enemies, no love affair. Only God knows what happened to her,” her father said. SP (rural), Saharanpur, Atul Sharma, said, "A missing person complaint was registered in Saharanpur but she died in Chhattisgarh. Her postmortem was also conducted there and a probe is underway there. We will help in the investigation, if required." The only information that the family possesses about Sonia’s link to Chhattisgarh is that she had befriended some Meghna on social media and wanted her to marry her brother. To which, Meghna agreed and asked Sonia to meet her in Chhattisgarh. But that happened months ago. Why she left her home on October 3 without telling anyone is still a mystery for the family.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/19-days-after-her-mysterious-disappearance-saharanpur-woman-found-dead-in-chhattisgarh/articleshow/87315700.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Nashik||NMC allots another Rs 125cr for road relaying||Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has allotted an additional Rs 125 crore to complete its road relaying project. Initially, the civic administration had allotted Rs 250 crore to complete relaying of around 150km stretch of major city roads. After many corporators suggested adding a few more roads to this project, the civic administration increased the amount for relaying another 50km of road stretch. NMC officials said that they have proposed relaying of roads that are in a bad condition and the roads that were not redeveloped during the past few years. The concretization of the roads is also costly when compared to tarring. However, the life of tarred roads is only four-five years. Last year, the NMC had finalized the tender process and contractors for road projects worth Rs 250 crore, but one of the contractors who had participated in bidding was disqualified and he had moved the Bombay high court over some terms and conditions related to the project. However, in January this year, the contractor had withdrawn the case. NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav had put the road project on hold after the second Covid wave. Moreover, the drop in the civic body’s revenue was another reason for stopping the road relaying work. Now, as the Covid situation is improving, the municipal commissioner has given a go-ahead to the implementation of the project. NMC is also undertaking tarring of existing 50km roads at a cost of Rs 125 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nmc-allots-another-rs-125cr-for-road-relaying/articleshow/87319895.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Agra||Agra: 75 lakh sacks of potato lying in cold storage||AGRA: With 270 cold storage centres in Agra district set to shut down in four days, 75 lakh sacks of potato, 50 kg each, are still lying in cold storage, waiting to be disposed of. Agra district is the largest potato producer in north India with over 75,000 hectares of land under cultivation. Farmers said they have been unable to sell the produce as demand is low at the local level and rise in fuel prices have shot up transportation costs to other states. Rajveer Lawaniya, Bharatiya Kisan Union district president, told TOI transportation costs to other states have increased by 30% following rise in fuel prices. “Farmers are not able to take their produce to major markets in other states. We have been demanding the state and the Centre to declare Rs 1,600 per quintal minimum support price (MSP) for potato.” According to the BKU district president, “Last year, the cost of transporting one quintal of potato from Agra to mandis in Pune and Mumbai was Rs 170 per quintal. Following the increase in fuel prices, it has increased to Rs 325 per quintal.” Deputy director of horticulture, Dr Kaushal Kumar, meanwhile, said the time period for storage will be extended if required. The last date of dispatching potatoes from the cold storage is determined by the government. Mohammad Aamir, general secretary of Potato Producers’ Association, meanwhile, said, “Higher production of potatoes coupled with a pause on government schemes like midday meal due to the Covid-19 pandemic have resulted in higher supply of potatoes in the market, thus lowering prices. Farmers are struggling to retain their investments. Government should help the potato farmers in distress.” Farmer leaders have demanded that special ‘kisan rails’ be operated from Agra to other states. In September, north central railways had started the first such train from Yamuna bridge station of Agra to Changsari station in Kamrup district of Assam. Farmers said the train operated weekly in September but its operation has been irregular since then. The kisan rail had reduced the transportation time from six days to 24 hours. President of Agra Cold Storage Association Sudarshan Agarwal told TOI that in March, 2 crore packets of potatoes were stored in 270 cold storage centres in Agra. “According to government orders, the duration for storage ends on October 31. There are 75 lakh packets of potatoes still in storage. We have asked farmers to take away their produce. At the end of the month, the units will shut down for cleaning and repairing to prepare for storage of agricultural produce in the coming season.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/fuel-prices-push-up-transport-costs-75l-sacks-of-potato-lying-in-cold-storage/articleshow/87317868.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu bill on legislative council revival soon||CHENNAI: Staying true to its poll promise, the DMK government is likely to introduce a bill in the next assembly session to revive legislative council in the state, sources said. The party had promised to give opportunity to political thinkers, teachers, educationists, local body representatives, activists, writers and poets to become members of the council to offer valuable inputs. “About Rs 9,000 has been allocated in the budget for preparing electoral rolls for the council constituencies,” an official said. The Tamil Nadu Legislative Council (Repeal) Bill, 2012, introduced by the Jayalalithaa government has been pending in the Rajya Sabha for nearly 10 years.If created, the state could join the league of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka in having Upper Houses. While the previous DMK regime led by M Karunanidhi passed resolutions to revive the council, the subsequent AIADMK governments resisted successfully. The bill requires assent of both Houses of Parliament and the President. The present OPS-EPS led AIADMK opposes any move to reconstitute since party founder and former chief minister M G Ramachandran abolished the council in November 1986. However, its ally, the BJP had made it one of the poll promises, “to allow experts from various fields to debate and participate in the legislative process.” VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan said that the council would be beneficial to fine tune the legislation given its composition of intellectuals and representatives from various walks of life. “When we could have Rajya Sabha, the Upper House, why not a legislative council?” he said, welcoming the state government’s intention to create the council. Thirumavalavan said the DMK had informed his party about the revival of the council during the seat sharing talks for assembly election, but the VCK had not laid down any conditions even at that time for allotting seats in the proposed council and would not in the future too. While the political dynamics pave the way for clearance of bills at the Centre, observers point to the Assam and Rajasthan legislative council bills pending in Parliament since 2013. Mamata Banerjee-led All India Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal passed a resolution in July for creation of legislative council. Senior journalist Tharasu Shyam said that former chief ministers C Rajagopalachari, C N Annadurai, M Karunanidhi and M G Ramachandran were members of the legislative council. “When his nomination of actor ‘Vennira Adai’ Nirmala to the council ran into trouble owing to her insolvency issue and legalities thereafter, MGR dissolved the council,” Shyam said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-bill-on-legislative-council-revival-soon/articleshow/87318800.cms||Julie Mariappan

Kodiyeri Balakrishnan expressed this displeasure in the meeting of party MLAs convened at the AKG Centre. He was referring to the criticisms made by certain MLAs against public works minister Mohammed Riyas in the last parliamentary party meeting. The minister had flayed MLAs on the floor of the House against accompanying contractors for getting projects sanctioned. MLA A N Shamseer is learnt to have criticized this statement of the minister in the last parliamentary party meeting, which had gained widespread media coverage. Following this, the PWD minister himself came out in the open and reiterated his stand against MLAs accompanying contractors. The party itself, including the acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, had come out in the open supporting Riyas. But the CPM leadership was irked since the discussions that occurred in the parliamentary party meeting were leaked to the media. Balakrishnan, who addressed the party MLAs in the presence of the chief minister and Vijayaraghavan at the AKG Centre, said that such things should not happen in the future and it would not do any good to the party.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-leaders-irked-over-info-leak-of-party-meetings/articleshow/87318813.cms||---

Making it clear that Congress would stand by 25 lakh paddy farmers in Telangana, Uttam said the farmers having land under the ayacut of Nagarjunasagar dam have been traditionally cultivating paddy due to availability of irrigation water. “About 70% of the population depends on agriculture in Telangana and a majority of them have been carrying out paddy cultivation. The government’s move to threaten farmers not to take up paddy cultivation is nothing short of a Tughlaq decision,” Uttam said. The way Siddipet collector Venkatram Reddy spoke reflects the stand taken by the government against the farmers in Telangana. “||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/stop-threatening-farmers-uttam/articleshow/87318799.cms||---

He also added that if lawyers in Vadodara will request, he will again contest the polls for the president. “Time and again power-hungry people use junior lawyers for raising some or the other issues just before polls. We are warning them to not indulge in such practices and if they continue doing so then we will challenge them legally,” Bhatt said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/hasmukh-bhatt-to-continue-as-working-president-of-bba/articleshow/87317918.cms||---

Currently, motorists are using the newly-constructed service road on either side of the under-construction main carriageway of the highway. Residents of the area said though the service road has been constructed, the movement of heavy vehicles makes commuting difficult for children going to schools on bicycles and also for women riding two-wheelers. Pankaja Pathade of Maratha Colony area said, “For the past many years we are awaiting completion of the road construction. There are many residential areas adjacent to the incomplete highway stretch of 2.5-km. Residents of the area use the highway to go school, markets, banks, work, railway station, among others.” She added, “All these years people have been risking their lives while commuting on the dangerous highway. In 2018, when the trees along the highway were hacked, people thought that the road would be constructed within six months. But it has been three years since the trees were hacked for construction of the road and the work is still not complete.” Officials from the highway division of the PWD said they were continuously following up with the contractor concerned to finish the work at the earliest. “The workers were not available for almost two years due to the pandemic. But now as the situation has improved, the workers are back and the work will gather pace,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/construction-of-2-5km-highway-stretch-to-take-3-more-months/articleshow/87319911.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Pune||Four Pune pupils among 28 with 100 percentile in MHT-CET||PUNE: Of the 4,14,968 students who appeared for Maharashtra Common Entrance Test held this year, 28 students have secured 100 percentile. Eleven students belonged to the physics-chemistry-maths (PCM) group while the remaining 17 appeared for the physics-chemistry-biology (PCB) group. Tapan Chiknis, an engineering aspirant from Kolhapur bagged the top position in the state’s with Nanded’s Fatema Ayman getting the first rank in the medical group. The results were released online on Wednesday by the State Common Entrance Test Cell. Aditya Mehta (PCM), Prajakta Kadam (PCB), Shubham Benake (PCB) and Dnyaneshwari Raut (PCB) secured 100 percentiles from Pune. Seventeen-year-old Mehta, a Pune topper, had not yet checked his CET score when TOI contacted him. “I was expecting a high score, but I never thought I would get 100 percentile. I was preparing for JEE Advanced and my rank is 752. I have already secured a place in IIT Bombay in Engineering Physics,” he said. Aditya’s father works for a private company while his mother is a home maker. “I always wanted to get into research. I was inspired by the inventions of scientists that I read about in books and also the videos I watched online. I want to do something creative. I wanted to go for Indian Institute for Science but I am equally happy with my place in IIT Bombay,” he said. He coached at Bakliwal Tutorials. As many 3,86,604 students had appeared for the common entrance test for engineering in 2020. Of these, 22 students scored 100 percentile in the PCM group while 19 students had secured the perfect 100 percentile in the PCB group. “We feel that despite the pandemic, students stepped up their efforts,” said an officer from the CET cell. Just two students had scored 100 percentile in 2019. Experts said the PCB test has now lost its relevance. It is largely taken by those who want to pursue pharmacy, and as a back-up test for many who are unsure of their performance in the NEET. At the same time engineering students who will take up a seat in an IIT or NIT or even a pri vate university will drop out of state’s admission process and students will see a better position in the state merit list ranks, they added.  Admissions to sought-after government engineering colleges are likely to get more competitive this year. “There are 19 state ranks corresponding to every 0.01 percentile points. So 99.90 percentile will correspond to a state rank of about 190. Students can then estimate their approximate state rank based on the above. Twelve students from IIT-PK secured over 99.9 percentile with our topper Suyash Chavan scoring 99.97 percentile,” said Durgesh Mangeshkar, who runs IITians Prashikshan Kendra. Lalit Kumar, who heads Prime Academy, said that students got more time for preparation due to delayed exams and online mode. “There seems to be some polarization in scores as hard working students managed to increase their higher scores but low scores have fallen. Those who excelled in JEE also did very well in CET,” he added. Vaibhav Bakliwal of Bakliwal Tutorials said that since the CET examination was conducted after the declaration of JEE Main results, many students chose to skip it.

---||Pune||Pune municipal corporation floats riverfront work tenders despite opposition||PUNE: The civic body on Wednesday floated tenders worth Rs360 crore for the first phase of the riverfront development project that was opposed by environmentalists and civic activists on the grounds of cost escalataion and prossible environmental hazards. The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) initiative is designed on the lines of the Sabarmati Riverfront Development Project. The activists had claimed that the project might increase the chances of environmental hazards. They had also claimed that the civic body increased the project cost from Rs2,300 crore to Rs4,200 crore without proper public consultation. As per the tenders, the first phase will be carried out from Sangam Ghat to Bund Garden. Works in the first phase of the project will include beautification of the banks of the river, Naik island and the cycle tracks. A total of 44km stretch of Mula and Mutha rivers will be developed as part of the initiative. Out of that, over 32km will be developed in the first four stretches and the rest will be a part of the subsequent seven stages of the project. “The collection of tenders will start from October 29 (Friday). The civic body has given time till November 13 for submitting the bids,” said Yuvraj Deshmukh, superintending engineer (projects) of the PMC. The standing committee of the PMC had earlier this month given its nod to start the project. The general body had also unanimously approved the proposal. “The politicians have approved the project in a hurry. The problems of flooding and the issues related to blue and red lines have been ignored. This will affect the citizens, particularly those living near the river banks,” said Vivek Velankar of the Sajag Nagrik Manch. As per the data of the designers, 62 hectares of free land will be available for the development of the project which will be used for developing public amenities. Gardens and playgrounds are planned in these areas. Of the total areas to be developed, 79% will be a part of the green initiative and 21% will be related to engineering works.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-floats-riverfront-work-tenders-despite-opposition/articleshow/87318807.cms||---

Under the DBT scheme, the government will transfer money for purchase of uniforms, sweaters, shoes, socks and school bags to the Aadhar seeded bank accounts of parents of students enrolled in state-run and aided schools from class 1 to 8 across the state. Senior officials at the basic education department have sought approval from chief minister Yogi Adityanath to launch the DBT scheme on October 30. "The confirmation about the date is awaited from the CM office. The CM wants that money is sent to the beneficiaries before Diwali. We are expecting the launch by month end," said an official. In the first phase, 1.2 crore students from different districts in UP will be benefitted. Officials said, verification of Aadhar seeded bank accounts of 1.2 crore parents have been done via the DBT mobile application. The data is now being uploaded on the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) after which it will be transferred to the beneficiaries. Verification exercise of the remaining 40,000 students is underway. The latest data shows 4,166 schools across the state have not even initiated the verification work for DBT scheme. Aimed at eliminating middlemen and quality issues which erupt almost every year, the UP government in March decided to introduce DBT for purchase of uniforms, sweater, and shoes-socks from academic session 2021-22. So far, the education department disburses grants for uniforms to the school and the School Management Committees (SMC) comprising the school head teacher, guardians, local educationists and teachers helped in procurement. Since the process was sluggish, students either complained of late arrival of uniforms or poor quality. For remaining – shoes, socks and sweaters, and bag, tender is done at district level.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/diwali-bonanza-via-dbt-school-kids-to-get-uniforms-bags/articleshow/87319933.cms||Isha Jain

The BJP also launched a scathing attack on YSR Congress over alleged abduction of its leader, saying that the ruling party in Andhra has been threatening people to ensure its victory in Badvel assembly bypoll. At a press conference, BJP leader G V L Narasimha Rao and its national secretary and co-incharge of Andhra Pradesh, Sunil Deodhar said a party leader was abducted and forcefully inducted into the YSR Congress ahead of the assembly bypoll. “This time, the YSR Congress leaders are following the Bengal model and threatening people along with government employees during the election campaign that if they do not vote for YSR Congress, they will not get the benefits of government schemes," Deodhar alleged. Due to the corrupt government of Jaganmohan Reddy, the atmosphere in the state is against the government, he said. “The government of AP is trying to replicate the Mamata Banerjee model of governance,” he said. Asked if Naidu is exploring alliance with the BJP, Deodhar said, “There is no question of alliance with the TDP.

But this year, prices of almonds and figs, widely used in various sweets and festive preparations, have decreased by 20%. “Last year, sales were a total flop, and it did not even feel like Diwali due to Covid-19. This year, the prices have dropped, which has affected the sales in a positive way. Our sales have almost gone back to pre-Covid levels,” Sarvesh Agrawal, owner of a dry fruits shop near Market Yard, said. Almonds and figs, both of which were priced at Rs 1,000 per kg earlier, have dropped to Rs 700 and Rs 800 per kg now. Jatin Sulfagai, co-owner of two dry fruits stores at different locations in the city, said, “The price of pista (pistachios) has also decreased from Rs 1,000 to Rs 880 per kg.” Vineet Rathi, who operates two dry fruit shops in the city, said, “Customers are buying more quantities. The demand is good this year because more and more people are going out, visiting each others’ homes, exchanging gifts, and celebrating the festival, unlike the previous year.” He said that 50% of his stock is sourced from other cities and the rest is imported. “Anjeer (fig) comes from Mumbai, almonds from Delhi, and raisins from Nashik. We import our stock of dates,” he added. Apart from walk-in customers, dry fruit shops are also offering home delivery and online ordering through their websites. “We launched our website after the pandemic hit last year, which has received a good response. This year, there has been an increase in the number of orders for dry fruit gift boxes ranging from Rs300-Rs 3,000. We are also supplying such gift boxes to corporates, which had halted last year,” Himanshu Daga, employee at a dry fruit shop, said. Customers are delighted with the drop in prices. Amrita Bhagat, who was buying dry fruits, said, “ These dry fruits are consumed in large quantities in our household during Diwali. It is also customary for us to serve assorted dried fruits to guests during this year’s festive season.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ahead-of-diwali-dry-fruits-sales-up-as-prices-stay-lower-than-last-year/articleshow/87318818.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

I have all the relevant documents to prove my contention. In addition, I have specific information as to how he procured the caste certificate for procuring a job in the central government. Once we submit the forged documents to the competent authorities, st-ern action will be taken against Wankhede,” Malik claimed. Wankhede’s father, Dnyandev, rubbished reports that his son has fraudulently obtained a caste certificate to get into IRS and said that he is likely to file a defamation case as well as under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against Malik. Dnyandev said: “Sameer’s mother and I had a love marriage; she was Muslim. Sameer was marrying a Muslim, therefore, he completed the formality of a nikahnama. As far as his nikahnama is concerned, I had signed it without reading it. More than 1,000 guests had attended the ceremony. Sameer married Shabana under the Special Marriage Act and later divorced her under the same Act. Where is the question of cheating. Why is the minister making the allegations now?” According to reports, Wankhede has challenged Malik to prove that he has changed his religion. “I am Hindu from birth and I come from a Dalit family...I have never undergone any religious conversion,” he said. “My father is a Hindu and my mother was a Muslim...She wanted to follow Muslim customs for my marriage...the same month, I got it registered under the Special Marriage Act. If I have converted to another religion, Malik should sh-ow the certificate. My father will show the marriage certificate under the Special Marriage Act.” But according to an agency report, the qazi who had performed Wankhede’s first marriage, on Wednesday claimed that he belonged to a Muslim family otherwise the nikah would not have been solemnised as per Islam.

He performed the bhoomi pujan for the construction of the hospital. BJP MP from Ahmednagar Sujay Vikhe Patil, Savitribai Phule Pune University management council member Rajesh Pandey, Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences chancellor Rajendra Vikhe Patil were among the others present at the event. “Allopathy plays an important role in treating patients and curing them. But the importance of ayurveda cannot be undermined. The Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences, deemed to be a university, has taken an important step in providing good and natural healthcare to people,” said Koshyari. The governor called upon people to follow what has been written in the ‘Charak Samitha’, the comprehensive text on ancient Indian medicine credited to Charaka, who was a practitioner of ayurveda. “One should eat healthy, eat less and eat only what one has earned from hard work. This message suits all human beings. This is the basic thought that needs to be propagated across the world,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/ayurveda-is-as-important-as-yoga-says-governor/articleshow/87319923.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The gymnasium has been built at the cost of Rs26 lakh through MP local development fund sanctioned by former Union minister of state, Hasraj Ahir, in 2018-19. Ahir was to inaugurate the gymnasium on Wednesday. The drama began after INTUC youth leader Prashant Bharti barged in with his supporters opposing the naming of gymnasium after Savarkar. Bharti demanded that the gymnasium be named after Shivaji Maharaj. Tension increased as both the Congress and BJP activists came face-to-face on the issue. There were reports of mild hustle among the party workers. Ahir immediately intervened and pacified the Congress leader. He assured the Congress workers that though the gymnasium has been named after Savarkar, the ground’s name will remain Shivneri. Bharti then returned with his activists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/cong-bjp-face-off-over-naming-gym-after-savarkar/articleshow/87317949.cms||Mazhar Ali

Peroorkada area committee that met here on Wednesday to discuss the issue also decided to launch an inquiry against P S Jayachandran. A three-member commission has been appointed at the area committee level to look into the allegations levelled against Jayachandran and the panel has been told to submit a report within two weeks. Jayachandran did not attend the meeting in which the area committee took the decision. It is learnt that party leaders who attended the meeting criticised him over the controversy that showed the party in a bad light. In a written explanation given to the party, Jayachandran said he has not done anything wrong and that he had followed all the procedures while giving away the child for adoption. He said he had handed over the baby with the knowledge of his daughter Anupama S Chandran and that he was upset over the behaviour of Ajith Kumar, who has been living with Anupama. Reacting to the development, Anupama expressed dissatisfaction over the decision taken by the party local and area committees. She said she expected the state committee to take action against her father. “My father has been telling that he has done everything with the knowledge of the party. Hence, the state leadership should have conducted a probe and initiated action against him,’’ she said. Anupama and Ajith appeared before women and child development director T V Anupama to provide a statement on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/jayachandran-barred-from-party-functions/articleshow/87318835.cms||---

The Ramky group company said it could reduce the release of gases and has taken steps to cap the facility, adding that bio enzymes are used for odour mitigation. Shankar Narayanan from Jawaharnagar alleged in his application in NGT, non-implementation of various environmental laws and waste handling rules at the dumping site. NGT, on September 9, directed the respondents, including Hyderabad Integrated MSW Limited, a special purpose company of Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited, to file its response. HIMSW Ltd was handed over the old dumpsite at Jawaharnagar located in 339 acres for reclamation and development of treatment and disposal facility. “1 to 1.2 crore tons of estimated waste was already accumulated at the site prior to starting the facility. It is a dumpsite located in a hilly area with abandoned quarries. Before the facility was set up, it was unmanaged and neglected. When dumpsite was allotted to us, there was no habitation nearby. Due to rapid urbanisation, residential colonies and other institutes have started emerging in the vicinity,” said the company in its reply to NGT. It further said there was no open burning of plastic at the facility and the lighter density plastic is stored as refused derived fuels and used in 19.8 MW waste to energy plant. The high-value plastic is recycled in the 10 ton capacity recycling plant within the facility. The company also said it has constructed sheds over the bio composting plant and provides three stages of odour treatment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/stink-from-jawaharnagarunavoidable-says-ramky/articleshow/87319928.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||India||UN warns world set for 2.7 degrees C temperature rise on current emissions pledges||NEW DELHI: New and updated climate commitments fall "far short" of what is needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals, leaving the world on track to a global average temperature rise of at least 2.7 degrees C in this century compared to the pre-industrial level (1850-1900), said the UN Environment Programme's report released on Tuesday, while noting that the "vague" 'net-zero' promises are not enough to save the planet from catastrophic heating. The report - Emission Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On - underlined that the countries' updated climate action pledges, called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), would take an additional 7.5% off predicted annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2030, compared to the previous round of commitments. But this is not enough as there is a need to reduce 30% to stay on the least-cost pathway for 2C and 55% for 1.5C. Calculation shows that annual GHG emissions are currently 60 GtCO2e (Giga tonnes of CO2 equivalent). "Less than one week before CO in Glasgow, we are still on track for a climate catastrophe," UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said reacting to the report's findings. The report noted that though G20 countries as a group are not on track to achieve either their original or new 2030 pledges, ten G20 members, including India, are likely to achieve their original unconditional NDC targets under current policies. Besides India, the list of 10 include Argentina, China, EU27, Japan, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey and the UK. "Among them, three members (India, Russia and Turkey) are projected to reduce their emissions to levels at least 15% lower than their previous unconditional NDC emissions target levels under current policies, indicating that these countries have significant room for raising their NDC ambition," said the report. "To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C, we have eight years to almost halve greenhouse gas emissions: eight years to make plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts. The clock is ticking loudly," said Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/un-warns-world-set-for-2-7-degrees-c-temperature-rise-on-current-emissions-pledges/articleshow/87321779.cms||Vishwa Mohan

A magisterial court on Wednesday remanded the suspects, Alauddin Malik (45) and Mohammad Malik (38), in police custody till November 1. “The duo used to specifically approach IT firm employees in the said areas with attractive offers on ‘customs-auctioned gadgets’. They would even show the gadgets in a bag to the prospective buyer. After getting money from the buyer, they would engage the person in a conversation and replace the bag containing the gadgets with another one that contained stones and glass pieces,” assistant police (API) inspector Gajanan Jadhav of the Chandannagar police told TOI. Jadhav said, “The two men, using fictitious name and Aadhaar cards, executed a similar modus operandi to dupe software engineer Rahul Patva (38) of Rs 60,000 in Kharadi on October 15, but ran out of luck after the victim reported the matter to us. On Tuesday night, a police patrol team received a tip-off about the two men trying to sell the gadgets at a cheap rate in the same area and rushed there to check. During questioning, the duo admitted to having fleeced Patva and other techies.” When contacted, Patva told TOI, “The two men approached me outside my residence with an offer to purchase gadgets and I paid them Rs 60,000, but they handed me a bag with stones and glass pieces by diverting my attention, and then fled.” The duo told police that they reached Pune on October 10 and stayed in a lodge near Pune railway station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ghaziabad-duo-held-for-fleecing-techies-with-deals-on-gadgets/articleshow/87318827.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao recently directed the officials to take applications from the people from November 8 to December 8 for giving pattas or rights for cultivating on podu lands on which the forest department has the rights. Both revenue and forest officials along with FRCs should bring awareness among the locals so that they would not occupy the forest lands anymore, the CS said. Somesh Kumar said special officers would be appointed for the districts where podu lands have huge extent such as Asifabad, Bhadradri Kothagudem and other districts. He discussed about the procedure to be followed for accepting the claims and their scrutiny with the officials. “The FRCs will create awareness, receive claims and verify. The villagers should agree to no further encroachment. Similarly, there will be committees at division and district level. District collectors will prepare and submit action plans and schedules,” he said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/form-forest-panels-first-on-podu-lands-cs/articleshow/87319943.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Airport police on Tuesday booked the bus driver on the charge of causing the death of Adesh Kamble, a resident of Lohegaon, due to negligence under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act. The Sassoon hospital in its advance post-mortem report certified the cause of Kamble’s death owing to multiple injuries, police said. Senior inspector Bharat Jadhav said on Wednesday said, “The PMPML bus was heading in the direction of Lohegaon when Kamble riding in full speed came from the wrong side of the road and collided head-on with the bus around 10pm.” Jadhav said, “The impact of the accident was such that Kamble died on the spot. He was not wearing helmet. We have registered an FIR against the bus driver after eye-witnesses recorded statements with the police stating that the driver was at fault because he did not apply the brake on seeing the biker. The driver had a chance to stop, but he continued to ply ahead.” “The victim’s family members have accused the driver of causing the accident. We have seized the bus and issued notice to the driver under the Criminial Procedure Code, directing him to co-operate with the police in investigations,” he added. Kamble’s sister Urmila Ghaimukte claimed that her brother, a labourer, was driving on the right side of the road but the bus driver lost control of the vehicle and hit his bike.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/motorcyclist-dies-in-collision-with-pmpml-bus-in-lohegaon/articleshow/87318829.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Arvind Kejriwal likely to blow AAP’s poll bugle for 2022 UP elections with mega rally in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Aam Aadmi Party is likely to launch its campaign for the UP Assembly polls with a mega rally in Lucknow in November-end which will be addressed by the party’s national convenor and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. Party sources claimed they have received a highly positive response during the recent ‘bijli yatras’ where AAP spoke to people about its poll promises of free power, free education, free health etc. “Our internal surveys are showing a very positive trend in AAP’s favour and it is time that we capitalise on it. Kejriwal was earlier focussing on assembly elections in Punjab and Uttarakhand, both of which are likely to take place around the same time as the UP elections but now, with the kind of response we are getting from the state, Kejriwal is likely to spend a lot of time here as well,” said a source. What boosted the party’s confidence, said another an AAP member, was the response of chief minister Yogi Adityanath to Kejriwal’s declaration that Ayodhya would be included in the list of religious sites for which Delhi government runs a special teerth yatra scheme and that if voted to power, it would also extend to UP. “We were not anticipating the CM to speak about Kejriwal’s recent visit to Ayodhya but the fact that he spent so much time talking about us means that AAP is a strong presence and has managed to rattle the ruling party. The Delhi CM tweeted in response to Yogi Adityanath’s comments as well, asking what his problem was if people from Delhi were given easy access to Ayodhya,” he said. Lucknow will see the launch of the AAP campaign after which several more rallies will be held across the state. A party spokesperson added that the first priority is to issue the list of candidates after which campaigners would be decided and allocated. The election is likely to see most of Delhi’s MLAs with a UP connect camp in the state till at least February, indicated sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/kejriwal-likely-to-blow-aaps-poll-bugle-for-2022-with-mega-rally-in-lucknow/articleshow/87319952.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Nashik||Pvt bus fares go up due to Diwali demand & threat of MSRTC stir||Nashik: The private bus operators have started increasing the fares in response to the rise in demand during Diwali, fare hike by the MSRTC and also the ongoing agitation of MSRTC employees (which, the citizens fear, could potentially turn into a full-fledged strike). The tour operators have hiked the bus fares by Rs 50 to Rs 700 depending on the destination, availability of buses and number of enquiries for transportation. Arun Suryawanshi, the Travels Agents’ Association of Nashik (TAAN) secretary, said, “As the fear of a lockdown has now disappeared, people are eager to travel to various destinations in the north and the south. Since train tickets are already full, the inter-state and intra-state buses are in high demand." According to the tour operators, the fares may increase further. Tour operator Sanjay Patil said, “The demand is higher for destinations like Belagavi, Nagpur, Ahmedabad, Surat, Hyderabad and even Goa. The demand for Pune and Mumbai has also gone up.” The fares for Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad and other areas have increased by Rs 50 over their current price, which is Rs 400. Similarly, the price for tickets to Kolhapur has increased by Rs 100 over its current price of Rs 700. “The fare for Goa from Nashik has increased by Rs 700. The fares have increased destination-wise. Most of the operators will increase the fares further as the vacation starts. The MSRTC agitation is also impacting the fares,” said Rahul Pande, another tour operator. “Earlier, there used to be a guarantee of MSRTC bus services. However, following the MSRTC Diwali-time strike in 2017, the scenario has changed. I have paid Rs 1,000 to book tickets to Goa as per the price applicable earlier and I am told that the fare will not change further,” said Sangita Lande, a Nashik-based businesswoman who has booked tickets for her family.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/pvt-bus-fares-go-up-due-to-diwali-demand-threat-of-msrtc-stir/articleshow/87319946.cms||Abhilash Botekar

District president Sandeep Girhe charged that PWD has already selected a contractor and started the work, even before the e-tender for the work is opened. Girhe said PWD has taken up the repair work — worth Rs16 lakh — of VIP section and general section of the circuit house. He charged that the department began the work through a contractor without issuing a e-tender. When the fact that PWD began the work without issuing an e-tender came to knowledge, Girhe met PWD executive engineer Sunil Kumbe to inquire about it. “Kumbhe gave evasive answers regarding e-tendering of the work. However, its e-tender was published on October 22. Even as the tender is going to be opened on October 29, work has begun,” Girhe said. He shared photograph of the already completed work with the complaint, and has warned of agitation if an inquiry is not conducted. PWD deputy electrical engineer Sanoj Mendhe dismissed the claim of misappropriation. He said the work mentioned in the e-tender has not be initiated, but there were some urgent repairs which have been carried out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/shiv-sena-alleges-misappropriation-in-rest-house-repair/articleshow/87317966.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Delhi||Delhi HC notice to cops on removing barricades||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought the stand of Delhi Police and the Centre on a PIL seeking removal of “unnecessary and hazardous” iron barricades from several roads across the national capital. Chained barricades on the roads have been proved to be fatal many times, the plea claims. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh sought the authorities' replies before November 24. One of the reasons for huge traffic jams in the city is unnecessary barricading of roads, and the mismanagement in the installation of iron barricades on several roads across Delhi causes grave hardship and inconvenience to the safety, security and welfare of the public, claimed the petition filed by Jan Sewa Welfare Society. The organisation said that the guidelines on the installation of barricades on the roads were not being properly adhered to. Several complaints were made to the authorities concerned in this regard, but no action was taken, it claimed. The plea stated that the police’s own standing order stipulates that mobile barricades are important and effective tools to maintain law and order, control crowds, regulate the flow of vehicular traffic, ensure security checking at VVIP functions and also check crime and apprehend criminals. But of late, it has been observed that mobile barricades are being used in a haphazard manner and stolen and a few displaying names of police stations are found in the jurisdiction of another police station, it claimed. Besides direction to comply with the guidelines, the plea sought to set up an area-wise committee, including members of the civil society, to survey, supervise and assess the locality for installation of mobile police barricades and submit its report fortnightly to the police officer concerned. It also sought to fix liability on the officers responsible for the erratic installation of mobile barricades.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/plea-people-suffer-due-to-unnecessary-barricades/articleshow/87319959.cms||---
---||Delhi||90% in Delhi have antibodies against Covid-19: Sixth serological survey||NEW DELHI: More than 90% of those covered under the sixth serological survey in Delhi have developed antibodies against coronavirus, according to a report submitted to the government on Wednesday. This means that Delhi is unlikely to witness a Covid wave as destructive as the second one in April and May, until a new severe variant emerges, a government official said. “However, we cannot say Delhi has achieved herd immunity despite such a high level of sero-prevalence,” the official said. Also, it cannot be said whether vaccination has a role to play in the high seropositivity rate in the capital. “We have found Covid antibodies in more than 90% of the samples collected during the sixth round of the survey,” an official source said. The sample collection under the sixth sero-survey started on September 24. A total of 28,000 samples were collected from all the 280 wards, including New Delhi Municipal Council and Cantonment Board wards, in the capital. The seropositivity rate in every district is more than 85%. More women were found seropositive as compared to men, sources said. “We cannot say exactly if Delhi has achieved herd immunity because there are no studies or data to show that the virus won’t spread after a certain percentage of population is affected,” the official said. “However, the same variant of the virus (Delta) cannot lead to a major epidemic. So, we can say there won’t be another wave of coronavirus as big as the second one, until a new severe variant emerges,” the official added. Also, the antibodies developed will be partially effective against the new variant. This is the first survey to be done after Delhi was hit by a fourth Covid wave in April and May. The fifth round of sero survey conducted in January had shown that 56.13% of the people in Delhi had developed antibodies against Covid-19. In April and May, Delhi battled a brutal second wave of the pandemic that claimed a massive number of lives with oxygen shortage and reduced supplies of essential medicines at hospitals adding to the woes. On April 20, Delhi had reported 28,395 cases, the highest in the city since the beginning of the pandemic. On April 22 the case positivity rate was 36.2 per cent, the highest so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/90-in-delhi-have-antibodies-6th-sero/articleshow/87318853.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Urban local bodies should focus on making cities smart, says UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Pressing for healthy competition between urban local bodies, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said that with the help of town planners, they should prepare a scheme to ensure 'ease of living' for the next 100 years. The CM said this while laying the foundation stone of 76 nagar panchayat office buildings on Wednesday. Encouraging them to increase their income and generate more employment, the CM said that every local body should focus on making their respective cities smart. “UP has done extremely well under the Smart City Mission. While 10 cities have been linked to this scheme by the Centre, the state government has also taken up seven more cities to convert to 'smart' using its own resources. Integrated traffic management systems have been set up there, the benefits of which were seen during the Covid-19 period when they were used as Covid control rooms,” the CM further said. The first condition for urbanisation, the CM added, was to provide basic facilities to citizens. Some years back a large population did not even have a house to their name. In the past 4.5 years, the government has ensured that there is piped water in homes, 2.61 crore toilets were constructed and now, urban areas are no longer dirty, he said. Yogi said nine lakh diyas that are to be lit in Ayodhya on the occasion of Diwali this year are emblematic of the 9 lakh people in urban areas who have been given homes by the government in the past 4.5 years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/urban-local-bodies-should-focus-on-making-cities-smart-says-cm/articleshow/87319979.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat to set up 100 English-medium schools||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat state education department is aiming to set up 100 English-medium schools based on proposals it has received from various districts in the past few months, said sources close to the development. This is perhaps the first time the Gujarat government has undertaken such a massive exercise to change the public perception of government-run schools. The government runs about 33,000 schools in the state and 98% of them are Gujarati medium schools. The local civic bodies run many existing English medium schools in cities. Of the 106 state government-run English medium schools, the civic bodies in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot run 56. The government will set up these new schools using the existing infrastructure at the district or taluka level and by making new teaching recruitments contractually, said sources. The highest demand for English medium schools is from the Aravalli district, where 12 such schools have been proposed, followed by Mehsana where seven schools have been proposed. In the case of Dang, six English medium schools have been proposed. Ahmedabad and Surat have proposed three schools each. “One of the main reasons behind this decision is that a lot of students in Gujarat have moved from self-financed schools to government-run schools in the last one and half years because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of these students, who were studying in English medium schools, had to transfer to Gujarati medium ones as there are very few government-run English medium schools in the state,” said an academician. The hiring of teachers on a contractual basis could prove to be a major hurdle for these schools going further, he added. The state education department had earlier said it aims to give a lifeline to the large number of students who have dropped out of private schools during the pandemic period. In a circular dated September 21, the state primary education department said it will open English medium schools for students who have dropped out of self-financed schools due to the pandemic related issues. Like other government-run schools, education will be free of cost in these schools too. From the time Covid-19 struck the state in March 2020, about 5 lakh schoolchildren in Gujarat have left private schools. According to data maintained by the state education department, 2.82 lakh students left private schools in the 2020-21 academic year. A significant shift from self-financed to government schools can be attributed to the financial crunch witnessed through the pandemic and loss of lives and livelihoods of many across cities and rural areas. In such times, many parents reeled from the pressure of paying an average Rs 15,000 to Rs 30,000 annual fee in self-financed schools.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/state-to-set-up-100-english-schools/articleshow/87317977.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Pune||Pune: Traffic wardens to be back on BRTS corridors||PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) has decided to reinstate traffic wardens in a phased manner at Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) corridors. The decision comes in the wake of Tuesday’s accident in which a motorcyclist died while the pillion rider suffered serious injuries after the two-wheeler they were riding collided head-on with a PMPML bus on the BRTS route in front of Inorbit Mall on Ahmednagar Road. TimesViewThe death of a motorcyclist following the head-on collision with a PMPML bus on the BRTS route on Ahmednagar Road has once again highlighted that the high-speed corridor must not be kept unguarded. Traffic wardens posted to prevent the illegal entry of private vehicles on the BRTS lanes were removed as the transport body explored the project of installing boom barriers. The project is still on paper. The PMPML is now planning to reinstate the traffic wardens. Any flip flop in matters concerning a serious safety issue must be avoided. Unless the proposed new system is in place, the old one must not be discarded.“We are working on the plan and wardens will be deputed on corridors until the boom barrier project is implemented. The corridors on which Pune Metro work is on, like on Ahmednagar Road, will be given priority, and the wardens will be deputed there first,” Satish Gavhane, BRTS manager, PMPML, told TOI.  Before the pandemic, all corridors were guarded by wardens, who were hired on contract. Altogether, 150 wardens guarded the corridors. “Earlier this week, we had a discussion on the boom barrier project and requested both the corporations to approve it without any delay. The Pune traffic police, in a recent letter, requested the PMC to hire people to check illegal entries into the BRTS corridors. Certain points on each corridor, which are prone to illegal entries, will be identified and wardens will be placed there,” the official said. Fire in PMPML busA fire damaged a PMPML bus partially on Wednesday morning. “The incident took place at Phugewadi Bridge after the bus stopped suddenly. As passengers exited, the driver tried to start the bus, which caused a spark. The fire brigade was called, and the blaze controlled,” traffic manager Dattatray Zende said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/traffic-wardens-to-be-back-on-brts-corridors/articleshow/87318846.cms||Joy Sengupta

The decision was taken against the backdrop of the recent report by the Nashik health laboratory that had found the water quality of the hospital was poor and not suitable for drinking. Hundreds of patients come to the 540-bed hospital on a daily basis and almost the all beds are always occupied. The civic administration conducts regular checks of the hospital’s water quality at the district health laboratory based on the premises of civil hospital. On October 6, the water samples was sent to the laboratory and the reports that arrived on October 14 found that the water was not suitable for drinking. Soon after the report arrived, the water tank was chlorinated within an hour’s time. The next water sample was sent on October 22. “The report arrived on Wednesday and it was found that the water was suitable for drinking,” Thorat said. The water from the main tank is supplied on various floors of the hospital where there are smaller tanks. Thorat said against backdrop of the recent incident, they have decided to set up water purifiers on every floor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/water-purifiers-to-be-installed-on-all-floors-of-civil-hospital/articleshow/87319968.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Agra||Dalit man’s 'custodial death': After SSP, IG transferred out||Agra: A week after the alleged custodial death of Dalit sanitation worker Arun Valmiki, inspector general (Agra range) Naveen Arora has been shifted to Lucknow as IG (budget). He is the second senior officer to be transferred in quick succession, following senior superintendent of police (SSP) Muniraj G's transfer to the state election cell in Lucknow. Valmiki, who was accused of stealing Rs 25 lakh from city’s police station ‘malkhana’, allegedly died after police interrogation. Arora was replaced by Nachiketa Jha, an IPS officer of 2003 batch, who was awaiting posting after his return from Central deputation a few months ago. Besides Arora, 11 other IPS officers, including IG Kanpur, were also transferred on Tuesday night. Soon after the malkhana theft, Arora had issued directions to ensure the safety of evidence and records at all police stations under Agra range. These could include “digitisation” of evidence, court orders for depositing valuables in bank lockers, etc. Arora told TOI that he had suggested that digitisation should be implemented by putting barcodes on records of seized goods kept at police stations. He added that he had asked circle officers to inspect thanas in their area and submit their report to the SSP. After Valmiki’s death on October 19, five policemen, including the police chowki in-charge and an inspector of the crime branch, were suspended and an FIR was lodged against “unidentified cops” under IPC section 302 (murder). Earlier, after the theft was first reported, six policemen had been suspended for “negligence”. Family members have alleged that Valmiki’s death was due to “torture” by police personnel during interrogation. The post-mortem report had, however, revealed the cause of death to be "heart attack". The case triggered a political row with opposition parties hitting out at the BJP-led government in the state and demanding justice for the family. The UP police then transferred the investigation of the case to the Aligarh range police for transparency in the probe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/dalit-mans-custodial-death-after-ssp-ig-transferred-out/articleshow/87317975.cms||---
---||Pune||Police probe bid to cheat bank of Rs 93cr over NREGA payment||Pune: The Sinhagad Road police are investigating a complaint by a leading private bank accusing a company and its two representatives of presenting a bogus cheque of a nationalized bank branch in Lucknow for transfer of Rs92.99 to its account here. The police said the company claimed the cheque was issued from a central government account in Lucknow towards works executed under MG-NREGA. After the cheque was presented on August 7, the private bank sent it to the issuing bank in Lucknow for clearance. However, the latter told the bank here that it had never issued such a cheque. It added that the bank here should proceed with legal action for presenting a fake cheque. When contacted, the private bank manager, who lodged a complaint on Tuesday, told TOI, “I am not authorized to speak on this matter.” Deputy commissioner of police (Zone III) Pournima Gaikwad told TOI. “We have identified the company and its two representatives who presented the cheque. The two men named in the FIR had visited the bank to deposit the cheque. We have sought details of the account mentioned on the deposit slip of the bank in Narhe. We will arrest the duo and others after conducting a thorough inquiry into the case.” She said, “The account (with the public sector bank) of whose cheque was forged and was presented to the private bank for clearance belongs to the central government. It is suspected that the company and others involved were aware of the MG-NREGA scheme and its bank account details.” As of now, it is not known from where the company and its officials prepared the fake cheque of the public sector bank having its branch on Ashok Marg, Lucknow. “The suspects thought the bank would clear the check without going through the details. But the public sector bank conducted a thorough inquiry before alerting the private bank here,” Gaikwad said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/police-probe-bid-to-cheat-bank-of-rs-93cr-over-nrega-payment/articleshow/87318857.cms||---

Santosh Jagtap — a criminal on the records of the district rural police — and Swagat Khaire were killed in the exchange of fire between members of rival gangs in front of an eatery at Talawade Chowk in Urali Kanchan along the Pune-Solapur highway on October 22. Gupta said,“The conspirator’s name came to light during the custodial interrogation of Khaire’s two arrested accomplices. The duo told the interrogators that they had shot dead Japtap to avenge the 2011 double murder of the Sonawane cousins at Rahu village in Daund. The conspirator in the present case was an injured victim in that case.” He added, “The assailants told police that they had twice planned to kill Jagtap in Daund and Shirur in rural Pune in September and October last year, but in vain.” A police officer associated with the investigation said, “Jagtap’s private body guard, Shailendra Singh, had handed over his revolver to a known person when he was admitted to a private hospital with injury. The person handed over the firearm to the police on Wednesday. Singh claimed that he had a licence for the firearm issued by the Uttar Pradesh government.

Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav, who is also a director of the NMSCDCL, told the agency to prepare the DPR at the earliest. His instructions came after a presentation by the Nagpur-based company on using ozonation technology to treat the Godavari water at Ramkund.

---||Pune||Cop lens on hoardings in fraud-hit bank case||Pune: The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the city police has started an inquiry into several dubious hoardings that had sprung up in the Shivajinagar and Khadki areas, proclaiming that jailed Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator Anil Bhosale and others had generated money to return to fixed deposit (FD) and account holders of the fraud-hit Shivajirao Bhosale Co-operative Bank. The hoardings and flex boards thank Bhosale and the others for initiating this process. Police said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had canceled the said bank’s license in May this year and appointed an administrator. “Through this administrator, the RBI also gave Rs 270 crore for refunds to FD and account holders with a deposit of less than Rs 5 lakh each in the bank,” said deputy commissioner of police (DCP-EOW) Bhagyashri Navatake, adding, “As soon as the administrator of the bank started distributing money to the depositors and account holders, flex boards and hoardings sprang up in these areas. We have pulled the hoardings down and also initiated an inquiry into the matter. We have taken photographs of the hoardings before pulling them down. They had around 12 names printed on them and we will call all these people to record their statements and question them about the motive .” In February 2020, the EOW had arrested Bhosale and others on the charge of misappropriating Rs 72 crore of bank funds. A case was filed under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. Police also invoked provisions of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act in the case. In March this year, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) took over the custody of Bhosale and others. Since then, Bhosale has been housed at Yerawada Central Prison.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/cop-lens-on-hoardings-in-fraud-hit-bank-case/articleshow/87318866.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Lucknow||‘Dalits framed, terror accused freed by SP’||Lucknow: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday renewed attacks on SP, accusing it of slapping false charges against Dalits and most backward castes (MBCs), while withdrawing cases against those accused of terror strikes on Ramjanmabhoomi. “Aise log aapke kabhi hitaishi nahi ho sakte (these people cannot be your well-wisher),” he said, while speaking at Samajik Pratinidhi Sammellan organised by BJP to reach out to MBC and Dalit communities, including Pal, Baghel and Khatik. “The previous government tried to muzzle voices of the poor and downtrodden,” Yogi said, exhorting people from the backward community to unmask Samajwadi Party. Yogi also invoked Dalit icon BR Ambedkar, calling him a torchbearer of national unity who stood against Partition. He compared Ambedkar with another Dalit leader Joginder Nath Mandal, who opted for Pakistan where atrocities were committed on Hindu minorities. “He fled the neighbouring country and led an anonymous life in India,” he said, adding while society pays respect to Ambedkar, no one takes the name of Mandal “even by mistake”. “Rashtra ke saath hone wala koi bhi vishwasghaat, prakriti kabhi bhi bardasht nahi karti hai (Treachery against nation is not tolerated),” Yogi said. He hailed MBC and Dalit sub-castes for leading a dignified life through hard work and protecting interests of society without fear. Yogi said, his government stood steadfast behind the poor and downtrodden and ensured welfare schemes reached them without discrimination. “BJP has created few models for welfare of society, while executing developmental projects,” he said. Yogi asked representatives from various MBC and Dalit sub-castes to take the message of BJP to every household and help consolidate its position in the assembly elections. “You need to tell people why BJP is important and what it has done for society and the country,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/dalits-framed-terror-accused-freed-by-sp/articleshow/87319984.cms||Pankaj Shah

The sub-lineage accounts for “below 0.1%” of cases so far, said the latest update posted by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) monitoring the emergence of new variants late on Wednesday. AY.4.2 is considered to be the cause for the sudden surge in cases in Europe, especially the UK, but it hasn’t yet been associated with more severe Covid or deaths. Scientists from the UK and Israel have estimated that AY.4.2 spreads 10-17% faster than Delta, which has been considered the most contagious variant so far. AY.4.2 has been dubbed Delta plus as it carries mutations from Delta as well one of the Delta derivatives named AY.4. “There is no AY.4.2 in Maharashtra, but we had AY.4 cases in the state,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health) of the state government. “To avoid the confusion between AY.4 and AY.4.2, it has now been decided to rename AY.4 as AY.33,” he added. In the last two months, the proportion of AY.33 reported in Maharashtra increased significantly. In July, it accounted for 5% and Delta for 82% (1,954) of the total samples. In August, AY.33 and Delta accounted for 42% (779 samples) and 32% (597 samples), respectively, of the samples put through genetic sequencing. In September, almost 75% of the Covid-positive samples had AY.33 while 15% were Delta. Vyas said the nomenclature is not important for public health purposes as the treatment of Covid or public health measures (such as sealing of buildings) would not change for Delta or AY.33. “However, knowledge of variants is important for manufacturing vaccines against Covid,” he added. Dr Nerges Mistry of the Foundation of Medical Research said: “We need to wait and watch before we can say that AY.4.2 is more transmissible or responsible for more severe disease.” On Wednesday, the latest INSACOG report said Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY.x) continued to be the main variant of concern (VOC) in India. “No new VOI (variant of interest) or VOC are noted in India,” the report said. About renaming AY.4 as AY.33, the report said: “It has been noted that due to greater diversity of Delta in India, PANGO (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages) classifications may sometimes be inaccurate, especially for new sub-lineages.” Mistry, who is not connected with INSACOG, said definitions of variants would keep changing as tools of detection change. INSACOG is further examining the data on AY.33.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/no-ay-4-2-cases-in-maharashtra-less-than-0-1-across-india/articleshow/87318880.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Hyderabad||Disha rape and murder case: SC panel fires queries as CI demonstrates gun||HYDERABAD: Circle inspector (CI) Konda Narasimha Reddy, whose pistol was allegedly snatched by Disha rape and murder case accused Md Arif, deposed before the SC-appointed commission inquiring into the alleged encounter with a loaded weapon on Wednesday as ordered a day earlier. The CI was quizzed on whether it was that easy for a lay person to snatch and fire a pistol without prior experience. The CI came with the 9mm standard RFI pistol and with help from liaison officer ex-SP M Malla Reddy demonstrated the magazine load, chamber load and operation of safety catch. While referring to loading and cocking, commission member DR Karthikeyan asked the CI, “It needs some knowledge for a stranger to chamber load and also strength. Don’t you agree?” The CI countered it and said that only little strength was sufficient to chamber load, but he couldn’t comment about knowledge of a stranger. Reddy said that he was digging for Disha’s articles when Arif threw mud in the eyes of head constable Janakriam, who was holding him. Arif then threw mud in his eye too and ran after pulling out the pistol pouch, the CI claimed, adding that while wiping his eyes he saw accused Shiva throwing mud in constable Aravind Goud’s eyes and another accused doing the same to SI Venkateshwarulu. The CI said ACP V Surender cautioned the accused to stop firing and surrender, and later commanded SI Lal Madhar to fire in air as a warning. As the firing did not stop, three cops including SI Madhar, fired in direction of the sound of firing as per ACP’s orders, the CI said. The CI also accused the NHRC team of recording his statements and making him sign by threatening to write against him to the CBI. He claimed that several of his sentences were recorded incorrectly by NHRC. He said that NHRC threats were mentioned to ACP Surender, who informed the DCP, but it was excluded from affidavit before the panel on his lawyer’s advice.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/sc-panel-fires-queries-as-ci-demonstrates-gun/articleshow/87320000.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Agra||No ‘anti-national’ act, says Agra college but J&K youths sent to jail||AGRA: A day after an FIR was lodged against three Kashmiri students following complaints by a BJP youth wing leader that they shouted "anti-national" slogans after Pakistan defeated India in a T-20 cricket world cup match on October 24, the college where they studied, Raja Balwant Singh (RBS) Engineering Technical Institute, said that no such slogans were heard in the campus. College authorities on Wednesday demanded action against the BJP workers for putting pressure on the management after barging into the institute and "misbehaving" with staff. This came even as the three students, 19, 20 and 21 years old, were arrested by the Agra police and sent to jail. Confirming this, circle officer Saurabh Singh told TOI that all of them will be produced in court on Thursday. “The students did not shout pro-Pakistan slogans,” said B S Kushwaha, director (academics), of the college. He added that registering an FIR against the students based on a complaint from an outsider and without consulting college authorities is "incorrect". The college had initially suspended the students, reacting to allegations that they had said and posted things favouring Pakistan on social media. The students have been booked for "promoting enmity, committing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony, making statements conducing public mischief under various IPC sections, and also under relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act at the Jagdishpura police station. According to college authorities, the incident has been brought to the notice of the All India Council of Technical Education, as the students were enrolled under the prime minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme. According to Pankaj Gupta, director (administration), a group of outsiders created ruckus on campus on Tuesday after rumours spread that the three students posted "objectionable" content on social media. “The anti-social elements blocked traffic, burnt tires, raised objectionable slogans, and misbehaved with the staffers,” he said, adding that police were informed about the incident but no action was taken against them. Gupta added: “Such acts will not be tolerated and all academic activities at the nine institutions under the Raja Balwant Educational Society will remain suspended till local authorities take action against them.” When contacted, Vikas Kumar, superintendent of police (city), said that cops immediately took the demonstrators out of campus and resolved the issue. College authorities did not lodge any written complaint, he added. Meanwhile, the Jammu and Kashmir Students Association requested the college administration to revoke the suspension order and also wrote a letter requesting Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to withdraw the FIR. Nasir Khueham, national spokesperson of the association, said that there is nothing wrong in cheering or yelling for any team. “It is the right of an individual to cheer for the sports team or player he/she likes the most and any arbitrary action by college authorities and police against Kashmiri students is unwarranted," he added. "If the three students have written anything provocative on social media and hurt the sentiments of people, it is wrong." “An FIR is a very harsh punishment for the act. It will ruin their future and will further alienate them. The charges ...will have serious consequences for their career,” the letter to the CM said. "The government should give a chance to the students to restore their faith in the Constitution of India.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-college-denies-kashmiri-students-chanted-anti-india-slogans-cops-send-them-to-jail/articleshow/87317999.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Pune||Land survey for Ghorpadi railway overbridge soon, says Pune district collector||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the city survey department office in Yerawada will soon carry out a joint survey of the land at Ghorpadi village required for the railway overbridge (ROB-I) project on the Pune-Miraj-Kolhapur railway line. A decision to this effect was taken at a recent meeting chaired by district collector Rajesh Deshmukh. The collector, who had called the meeting to address the issues that have hampered the project, said, “The survey by the PMC and the city survey officials will enable us to know how many families will be affected by the project. Based on those findings, we will be take further course of action on the project. At this juncture, there is no clarity on this aspect,” Deshmukh said. The bridge is necessary as thousands of commuters living in the area have to wait for a long time at the railway crossing every day to let the trains pass and the frequence of trains is very high. It ultimately leads to heavy traffic chaos throughout the day. As the carriageway at the crossing gate is narrow, the vehicles coming from both directions get stuck for a long time, particularly during peak hours of the day, said residents and activists of the area. The PMC requires a 15,000sqm area to construct the bridge and two approach roads on both sides of the bridge. “The ministry of defence (MoD) had already given work permission to the PMC on August 12, 2016. However, since then, it could not go ahead or execute the project at the site,” said a senior official from the defence estates office of the Pune circle. The PMC’s chief engineer Srinivas Bonala said the general body had approved the project already. It would be executed after acquisition of the required land at the site. An official from the PMC’s engineering department said, “Nearly 150 shops and houses in the project area are occupying land parcels belonging to the Indian Railway and private parties and work on the approach route to the ROB cannot be started unless they are removed.”  PMC officials have been able to prepare a general arrangement design of the bridge, so far. “We cannot start the work unless the land acquisition is completed. Only the defence authorities have agreed to hand over their land, so far,” said PMC executive engineer Abhijeet Ambekar. A resident Sanjay Kawde said, “PMC did not do any work on the project despite getting work permission in 2016. Cost of the bridge will increase by 30-40%.” Wilson Daniel, a working professional from Ghorpadi, said, “Traffic congestion at the railway crossing is becoming worse day-by-day. The number of vehicles has increased over the last few years. Commuters have to wait for at least half-an-hour to cross just a few metres of distance.” Rishi Malhotra, a student, said, “The railway gate closes at least 50 times a day, forcing commuters to stop. Our time goes waste and the situation gets worse in the evening.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/land-survey-for-ghorpadi-rob-soon-says-collector/articleshow/87318878.cms||Sandip Dighe

While the kingpin was identified as Mithun Mandal, his associates Shaon Ahmed, Mominur Islam and Mahendi Hasan were arrested for using forged documents like Aadhaar cards and passports that were prepared with the promise that the three will be sent to South Africa on an Indian passport. They were arrested from Deen Dayal Upadhayay Junction. IG ATS Gajendra Kumar Goswamy told TOI that ATS was working on gangs that used to sneak Bangladeshis and Rohingyas into Indian territory. “Mithun was a native of Bardhaman district and ran a business of travel operations for European countries,” said Goswamy. He also said that Ahmed, Islam and Hasan had changed their names and religion to get Indian identity. “Ahmed changed his name to Pintu Das, Islam to Romi Pal, and Hasan to Bapi Rai to get Aadhaar made. They also used the names to get passports for flying abroad on the pretext of jobs,” said Goswamy. He also said that the gang was well-oiled and so far, it had surfaced that they had illegally got 50 people from across the border into India. “Mithun used to charge a hefty sum from Bangladeshis and Rohingyas. He had 12 bank accounts with transactions in lakhs,” said the IG. Ahmed, Islam and Hasan used to work in a hotel in Madar Ganj in Bangladesh. They had come to India by illegally crossing the border on August 16. “They will be questioned on how they entered India,” said the officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/gang-behind-illegal-entry-of-bangladeshis-busted/articleshow/87320005.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Except for Covid care, maternity and paediatrics, rest of the departments including emergency care have been shifted to the facility from the old district hospital campus. The 450-bed hospital has come up on 31,000 square meters spread over 2.3 acres of land on 10-acre campus at Yedapura. The five-storey building has outpatient services, wards, laboratories, emergency wards, main operation theatre, medical officers’ chambers, teaching hall, administrative services and other big halls and rooms. As most of the medical services was shifted from the old district hospital on B Rachaiah Road to the new facility, people were advised to avail treatment in the new hospital from Monday except for maternity, paediatrics and Covid care. Despite the delay in recruitment of non-teaching staff, Group-D employees, security guards and civic workers, CIMS authorities are running the hospital by using the staff from the old district hospital. CIMS dean and director Dr DM Sanjiv Told TOI that though CIMS has sufficient specialists, doctors and other staff, a proposal has been sent to the state government for appointment of 380 staff including D Group employees, security guards and pourakarmikas. As the hospital has seven entry and exit points, immediate recruitment of security staff is must to guard the entire campus and manage the movement of patients, their relatives, vehicles and hospital staff. Construction of rest rooms for security guards is also pending before the authorities, he said. KSRTC starts bus serviceAs the new hospital is located seven-km from the city, KSRTC has started bus operations from Tuesday. It has a fixed ticket price of Rs 15 per head.

The nonagenarian has appealed to citizens to refrain from visiting him during the course of his illness. “I am doing well at home and recovering. Please do not rush to meet me out of worry. It would be dangerous to contract Covid at this stage as cancer has weakened my immunity,” Adhav said in a social media post. “Adhav has been diagnosed with a mild type of cancer of blood cell a month ago. He is not at all bed-ridden, but needs ample rest,” senior cardiologist Abhijit Vaidya said.

---||Mumbai||Five-year high in chikungunya cases in Maharashtra but count ‘under-reported’||MUMBAI: Chikungunya cases hit a five-year high in the state, even as the medical fraternity believes the count of cases is severely under-reported. Maharashtra reported 2,006 confirmed cases of chikungunya fever from January to October this year, the highest since 2017, when 1,438 cases were reported. In 2018 and 2019, 1,009 and 1,646 cases respectively were detected in the state. In the pandemic year of 2020, like all diseases, chikungunya saw a massive drop to 782 cases. State entomologist Dr Mahendra Jagtap said intermittent rainfall combined with favourable climatic conditions and improved reporting may have contributed to its notable rise this year. The infection is transmitted by the aedes aegypti mosquito that is also responsible for the spread of dengue. Incidentally, dengue too has seen a rise in Maharashtra this year. Nearly 10,000 cases and 22 dengue deaths have been reported till now, a significant jump from 3,356 cases and 10 deaths last year. Although chikungunya fever is self-limiting and non-fatal, the illness in its acute form can cause debilitating pain and difficulty in walking, particularly among the elderly. People sometimes live with the pain for six months to a year during which they have to make multiple doctor visits and take pain medications. Pune district has had the highest count of officially confirmed cases (354) with the corporation adding 215 cases. Nashik rural and corporation put together reported 905 cases. Among other districts, Satara reported 73 cases, Kolhapur 148, Beed 38 and Amravati 29. Mumbai has reported 34 confirmed cases, as per state reports but doctors have confirmed treating several chikungunya cases since July. TOI had reported how data from Metropolis Lab showed an increasing trend of chikungunya in the city over the last three months. In July, 239 samples were positive, which rose to 564 in August and 510 positives till mid-September. A civic official said private hospitals have been told to report cases to the corporation. State authorities are worried that not only Mumbai but even adjoining corporations are under-reporting cases. Since there is no mortality associated with the disease, the seriousness to report cases is often lacking. Like dengue, rapid test results are not accepted as confirmed diagnosis. Serological tests like IGG and IGM are taken as definitive diagnosis. Jagtap said the virus is tricky and can transmit from the pupa to the larvae to the adult mosquito. “If the adult mosquito lays 200 eggs, all of them will be infected with the virus,” he said, adding why vector control was crucial here. Across the state, 25 breeding checkers have been appointed to check breeding of mosquitoes by regular inspections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-5-yr-high-in-chikungunya-cases-in-state-but-count-under-reported/articleshow/87318886.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad cops take steps to curb crime during Diwali||AURANGABAD: To prevent property offences, especially house break-ins, thefts and burglaries during the festive season of Diwali, Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta has issued a list of directives to the police station chiefs. The list of instructions include deploying maximum force for night patrols and carrying out surprise checks and nakabandis. To keep a check on property offences, especially pickpocketing and chain snatching in market places, Gupta has ordered deploying policemen in plainclothes as well as in uniform. Gupta has directed the officers, including deputy and assistant commissioners of police in both the zones, to carry out dedicated drives including to initiate stringent preventive actions against habitual property offenders, convince housing societies and localities to get the defunct CCTV cameras repaired, get the credentials of watchmen, domestic helps, security guards and drivers verified with the local police stations etc. Gupta has also asked the police station chiefs to call meetings of the residential societies, apartments, row houses and upscale localities and ask them to inform the police and neighbours about their visits, while convincing them to keep all their valuables and cash in bank lockers. Authorities maintained that during the festive season of Diwali, people either bring all the valuables and cash at home for Laxmi puja, or the ones hailing from other cities and states return home tp celebrate the festival at home. “Property offenders take advantage of both the situations and target such houses. As a precautionary measure, steps are being taken on war footing including locating the habitual offenders and finding out their current whereabouts,” said crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav. Cidco police station inspector Sambhaji Pawar said, “We have already prepared a list of property offenders who were released on emergency parole during the pandemic and have started keeping an eye on them.” In addition, Gupta has also instructed for the deployment of armed policemen at all the sensitive points, setting up bandobast and increasing patrols in areas that have reported violence during festivals in the past. Day and night patrolling teams will compulsorily cover the homes of the owners who have informed the police and neighbour before heading out of town.To ensure that the police receive all the inputs without any delay, police station chiefs have also been asked to form local coordination groups in respective areas and wards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/aurangabad-cops-take-steps-to-curb-crime-during-diwali/articleshow/87319996.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Delhi||Bedridden elderly professors hang selves in Delhi||NEW DELHI: An elderly couple ended their life on Wednesday by allegedly hanging themselves in their house in Kalkaji Extension in southeast Delhi. The couple left behind separate suicide notes in which they said they were killing themselves as they were fed up of their multiple injuries sustained during an accident over a year ago that had left them bedridden. The duo, aged 74 and 69, had retired as teachers from Delhi University. Police came to know about the incident on Wednesday around 3.45pm when the couple’s daughter called them. The daughter lives with her family in south Delhi. “On Wednesday, the couple’s caretaker came to the house around 2.30pm. He rang the doorbell several times, but nobody responded. He then informed their daughter about it. She arrived there and both of them broke open the door. They found the bodies of the couple hanging from a steel pipe,” said a senior police officer. DCP (Southeast) Esha Pandey said, “Two suicide notes were found on a table. The couple mentioned in the notes that they were fed up with their bedridden life caused due to multiple fractures suffered in an accident. The bodies were handed over to the family after an autopsy.

Pictures of city buses with BJP flags went viral on social media on Wednesday.Additional municipal commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena told TOI, “There is a provision of giving city buses on rent for non-political programmes. City transport manager Ravindra Bhelawe and administrative officer Ravindra Pagey provided 60 buses after recovering the rent. Ideally, the city buses cannot be provided for any political event. I have issued show-cause notice to the two officials and also ordered inquiry.”Clarifying his stand, Pagey told TOI, “BJP corporator Dharampal Meshram, who is also chairman of legal consultative committee, had submitted an application seeking the buses. Therefore, we approved it after recovering the charges. The buses were sent at 9.30am and returned at 3pm.”Pictures available with TOI clearly show BJP flags displayed on many of the city buses. These buses were released from depots and were sent to various locations in the city to ferry BJP workers. Following this, a rally was taken out from RBI Square to zilla parishad to protest against the state government.Pagey said, “Notice followed by necessary action will be taken against the applicant for violating the rules by displaying political flags on city buses.”Meena also said, “The applicant had not mentioned the purpose for hiring the buses. Inquiry will reveal further details.”Considering full relaxation after prolonged Covid-induced lockdown and festive season, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had increased the number of city buses in operation to 361 a few days ago. It is also a norm in the NMC that city buses cannot be given for any other purpose in case scheduling is 100%.Chairman of city transport committee Jitendra ‘Bunty’ Kukde did not respond to TOI’s call and message.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/ignoring-rules-civic-body-lends-bjp-60-city-buses-for-rally/articleshow/87316780.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Campaign over but fake letters have a field day||HYDERABAD: A morphed photo of finance minister T Harish Rao canvassing for the BJP in Huzurabad was doing the rounds on social media. Responding swiftly, the TRS lodged a complaint to the election authorities. Similarly, BJP candidate Eatala Rajender’s office said a fake letter was being circulated that the Election Commission took the decision to stop Dalit Bandhu scheme in Huzurabad based on the letter written by Eatala. While the campaigning for the bypolls ended on Wednesday, confusion over the morphed photographs and fake letters among voters refused to die down. There was half a dozen such incidents involving the contestants, party leaders, morphed pictures and fake letters which have been in circulation in the last two weeks in the run-up to the by-election on October 30. Since Huzurabad by-election has become prestigious for the TRS, BJP and Congress, social media was agog with such fake letters and morphed pictures. Social media teams engaged by the political parties are busy checking them and promptly issuing a rebuttal or deny such claims. TRS MLA Balka Suman alleged that even a road accident occurred in the constituency was linked to him by the BJP. The TRS lodged a complaint with the Election Commission. BJP state president Bandi Sanjay said the ruling party resorted to a smear campaign against his party leaders soon after the EC stopped implementation of Dalit Bandhu in Huzurabad till the election process was completed. Though the election is a three-cornered fight among TRS, BJP and Congress, the main fight on social media is between TRS and BJP. “Even YouTube channels and news websites are also publicising fake news. Complaints have been lodged against such fake news,” incharge of social media wing of a party said. Not just this, all the major parties are targeting their rivals by circulating fake letters and morphed pictures in various WhatsApp groups. “Police should restrict usage of social media in the constituency till the polling is over,” S Narender, a resident of Huzurabad town, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/campaign-over-but-fake-letters-have-a-field-day/articleshow/87318890.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Kanpur||Innovative drones displayed atIIT-K, FICCI ‘Drone Mela’||Kanpur: The technology behind drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is evolving very fast and is now beginning to have a big impact on our lives through applications ranging from spraying of pesticides on our crops, delivery of medicines and vaccines in remote corners of the country, maintenance of law and order through day/night surveillance. Keeping all this in mind, at the behest of ministry of civil aviation, Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) organized a ‘Drone Mela’ on the institute campus on Wednesday. The focus of the event was to create awareness about drones to improve its acceptability among farmers and to encourage young students from schools to get motivated towards study in this fast-emerging area. The event was attended by various drone companies which showcased their products alongside the ongoing cutting-edge research at IIT-Kanpur demonstrated by various students and faculty members. The chief guest for the occasion was commissioner, Kanpur Police, Asim Arun, deputy director, IIT-Kanpur, Professor S. Ganesh, chairman of FICCI Drones Committee, Rajan Luthra and joint secretary, ministry of civil aviation, Amber Dubey. The dignitaries walked around the stalls put up and interacted with students and faculty members of IIT-Kanpur who have displayed their research and innovations related to drone technology. Various drone companies namely EndureAir Systems, VTOL Aviations, Terraqua UAV, Hubblefly Technologies and Pi Drones displayed their wide array of products for applications ranging from surveillance, mapping, seed bombing, surveying, emergency medicine delivery and crowd control. Prof. S. Ganesh welcomed all the dignitaries and participants by highlighting the impact of drone technology and the contributions made by faculty and students of IIT Kanpur, he thanked DGCA for putting faith in IIT Kanpur for the organization of Drone Mela. This was followed by a short 5-minute video presentation that explained ongoing research done by students of IIT Kanpur on unmanned helicopter drones, flapping wing ornithopters, high efficiency Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) systems, perching of drones on walls and drone swarm related technologies. Rajan Luthra explained the role industrial body is playing in supporting start-ups by nurturing them through appropriate networking to help them identify right market and investment opportunities. Amber Dubey encouraged and urged students and in particular girl students to look at drones as their future career option. Police commissioner Asim Arun addressed the gathering and expressed happiness at the state of drone technology being developed within the country and reminded how drones that have such wonderful humanitarian applications can also be misused by rogue elements.

---||Aurangabad||Latur cops being rewarded for timely response to Dial 112 calls||Aurangabad: To ensure that police personnel, especially the patrol team members, beat marshals, Charlie constables as well as the police stations employees get used to responding to emergency calls received through Dial 112, within the stipulated time, Latur superintendent of police Nikhil Pingaleha has started rewarding the policemen and officers. This is the first time in Maharashtra that the policemen are being rewarded for responding to emergency calls within the stipulated time. As per the laid down criteria for rewarding policemen, for the urban areas, the expected response time has been limited to 7-10 minutes after receiving the call. In the rural areas, the distance at which the patrol team was at the time of receiving the call is being considered. Those privy to the initiative said the Dial 112 emergency service number — with command and control rooms in Navi Mumbai and Nagpur — has a live tracking system, which shows the nearest police station or patrol vehicle from the point of origin of the call. The system is advanced and maintains a thorough log — including the time of the call origination, time of receiving the call, the time when the police constable left for the location, the time he reached and took pictures of the spot, closing time of the call etc. In case the nearest police vehicle is not reachable due to any reasons, the call gets transferred to the second-nearest police vehicle or police station. When contacted, Pingale said, “There has to be some incentive for the police personnel to implement the new initiatives. Therefore, we decided to reward the ones who have been delivering their best.” Getting a reward on the service sheet takes the police personnel closer to becoming eligible for the prestigious awards like DG insignia, President Police Medal etc. Recounting the benefits of timely response, Pingale said, “Timely response to any emergency call prevents further spiraling of the situation. This applies to either body or property offence.” Welcoming the move, Nanded range DIG Nisar Tamboli said: “Every job has to be differentiated and rewarded accordingly, so that every policeman’s contribution is not only acknowledged, but also appreciated.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/latur-cops-being-rewarded-for-timely-response-to-dial-112-calls/articleshow/87320012.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Goa||Plan comes together for entertainment village||Panaji: Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) has begun conceiving a master plan for the entertainment and animation village at Mandrem that was proposed a few months ago. A feasibility study of the entire area is also under way. As the project is still in the preliminary stage, other aspects required to determine the exact land requirement will be decided later, an official said. “The project is likely to be developed on a public-private partnership model, which has been followed for a few other projects requiring substantial investment,” the official said. Besides boosting the profile of the coastal village of Mandrem, the tourism ministry feels the project will attract foreign and high-end tourists. “It will be a source of employment and Goa’s talent will also get an opportunity work within the state itself. The main purpose of the project, however, is to attract tourism,” the official said. While Pernem has been witnessing some semblance of development over the past two decades, Mandrem is yet to get its due. “People of Mandrem have to look outside for job opportunities although some youth have been into tourism. We are yet to see real development. Work on the Tuem electronic city project, which was initiated five years ago, is progressing, but at a slow pace,” a local said. The only development Mandrem has seen over the past few years, he said, was a jump in land prices, prompting locals to either sell their ancestral lands or build guesthouses and small hotels to cater to tourists. After the greenfield international airport at Mopa is operational, development in the Pernem taluka will take on a scorching pace, the local said. “Mandrem has so many temples, the entire village is lush and green and ideal for a quiet getaway, provided that a few facilities are developed for tourists. We hope the entertainment village project brings the desired development,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/plan-comes-together-for-entertainment-village/articleshow/87318893.cms||---

Gurwinder is purportedly seen in several videos wearing a white T-shirt with a portrait of a controversial Sikh leader during the farm protest. According to sources, the SIT wants to find out whether he is linked to any banned outfit as he had returned from Punjab and has a "criminal past". His remand starts from Thursday morning. The CJM's court has also granted two days of police custody remand (PCR) of Sumit Jaiswal, Nandan Singh Bisht, Satya Prakash Tripathi and Shishupal - all co-accused in the incident involving the mowing down of four farmers and a journalist by the convoy of Union minister of state (MoS) for home Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish, the main accused in the FIR, on October 3. The bail application of Ashish will be heard by a district judge on Thursday. The SIT also recorded statements of four more witnesses under section 164 of CrPC in the CJM's court and shared their contact numbers in public for the third time. This, sources said, will encourage more witnesses to come forward and record their statements. On Tuesday, the apex court had reprimanded the SIT over the "less number of eyewitnesses" with only 23 reported till Monday. The jail superintendent and Kheri chief medical officer (CMO) meanwhile on Wednesday submitted their reply to the notices served by the CJM's court. The issue of VIP treatment meted out to Ashish was brought to the CJM's notice by the SIT, and the CJM had issued separate notices to both the officers asking whether it was possible for Ashish to be treated at the jail hospital. Notably, a video clip had shown Ashish purportedly walking around under the custody of jail officials at the district hospital in Kheri. In the video, Ashish was neither handcuffed nor were cops holding him. When asked about the reply filed by both the officers, special prosecution officer SP Yadav said, “The officials have submitted that Ashish has been sent back to jail from hospital and the CMO has attached his medical examination report. We cannot share any further details.” Sources meanwhile told TOI that Ashish's medical report at the time of discharge showed the "blood platelet count was 2.25 lakh" (normal range is between 1.5 lakh and 4.5 lakh). His haemoglobin level was 16.4 g/dl (normal count is between 13.8 g/dl and 17.2 g/dl).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-cjm-grants-3-days-remand-to-question-farmer-suspected-of-lynching-bjp-men/articleshow/87318020.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

A special team was set up under the directions of Jaipur IG, Sanjay Shrotriya and led by DSP (Govindgarh) Sandeep Kumar Saraswat. The team intercepted a tanker in Manda area and arrested its driver and owner, Ved Prakash Sharma. “Sharma mixed other oils and passed them off as biodiesel. It can lead to engine problems,” Saraswat said. Police said that they have seized the tanker filled with 6,000 litres of adulterated biodiesel which is worth Rs 5 lakh. “The efforts are underway to track down other accomplices of the accused who ran the entire racket,” Saraswat told TOI, adding that a special team was constituted to keep tabs on the gangs involved in selling adulterated fuel. The Jaipur (rural) police said that the latest action was part of its ‘operation highway’, which was launched to clamp down on adulterated food and fuel products in the region.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/police-clamp-down-on-fake-biodiesel-one-held/articleshow/87318913.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Now, ward offices to authenticate foreign vaccination certificates for local train pass, mall entry||MUMBAI: A week after TOI reported on Mumbaikars vaccinated abroad facing difficulty in getting season tickets to travel by local trains, the BMC’s health department has issued a circular allowing local ward offices to authenticate vaccination certificates of beneficiaries who have got both the jabs in foreign countries. “For travelling through local trains, attending public/ private establishments and to enter in the Mall/Theatres/Restaurants, citizens/employees need to submit vaccination certificate. At present all those who have taken vaccination in India are able to produce the CoWin generated certificate, however there is no provision on CoWin portal to update vaccination status or to generate certificate for those citizens who have taken both doses outside India. MCGM is receiving multiple request from citizens who have taken both doses outside India to consider them as vaccinated and allow them the benefits of fully vaccinated citizens,” states the circular. The October 25 circular addressed to medical officers health of civic wards A to T, has allowed them to authenticate foreign certificates. Such citizens will need to provide a self-declaration document issued by the health authority of the respective country and proof of stay in that country (passport, ticket, visa). Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, health, said in August, the BMC had already written to the secretary of the ministry of health and family welfare to make a provision in the CoWin portal for updating the vaccination status of those who have taken the vaccine outside the country and have a certificate or document from authorities of the respective country. “However, we were keen on allowing the updating to be done directly on the CoWIN so that such citizens do not need to visit the ward offices. But with no response yet, we have decided to start the verification and authentication of it physically through the medical officer health of the concerned ward,” said Kakani. TOI had reported on a US-returned senior citizen couple vaccinated with Moderna who was unable to get railway passes. They got the passes on medical grounds after the report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-now-ward-offices-to-authenticate-foreign-vax-certs-for-local-train-pass-mall-entry/articleshow/87318903.cms||Richa Pinto

The TPCC chief also hit out at chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, accusing him of pushing farmers to the brink of suicide by threatening them that the government would not procure paddy if they cultivated it in the ensuing season. “Did Rajender ever fight with CM KCR seeking justice for the families of Telangana martyrs? The chief minister but never invited the family members of hundreds of Telangana martyrs for a meal in Pragathi Bhavan,” Revanth said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/revanth-launches-attack-on-eatala-kcr/articleshow/87318898.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Bypoll boon for eateries, petrol bunks||HYDERABAD: The bypoll turned out to be a boon to eateries (tiffin centres), selling breakfast dishes like idli, dosa and puri, and petrol bunks and wine shops too being among major beneficiaries in the Huzurabad Assembly constituency. Owners of tiffin centres, petrol bunks and wine shops among other establishments said the rush of leaders and cadre of various parties, and cash flow in Huzurabad resulted in a significant increase in their business, helping them recover from the losses they had incurred during the first and second wave of Covid-19. Though curtains came down on campaigning on Wednesday evening, owners and managements of various business establishments were expecting that good business would continue up to the counting day, November 2. N Shailaja of Gayatri Tiffin Centre in Huzurabad town told TOI that they had suffered huge losses due to the lockdown and fear among the people during the first and second wave of the pandemic. “Our tiffin centre business picked up tremendously in the last three to four months due to influx of leaders, cadre into the constituency and also those going to attend rallies coming to have breakfast at tiffin centres,” she said. While some popular tiffin centres registered a 100% jump in their business, a large number of other eatries saw a jump in the business transactions from 60 to 80%. Another major beneficiary of the bypoll were petrol bunks. Zooming in of expensive cars to budget four-wheelers used for campaigning by top leaders and other party members saw their cash registers ringing in the last three months. R Raju, manager of Sudhakar Service station, a diesel-cum-petrol retail outlet, said there was a jump of 800 litres to 1,000 litres of petrol and diesel every day, thanks to the by-election. Fortunately, bunk never returned the customers empty as there were adequate supplies from oil company. Though the talk in the market is that the liquor stocks were lifted two months in advance and stored in safe houses in villages allegedly by main political parties, owners of wine shops said counter sales picked up due to flow of cash into the hands of labourers. “Daily labourers were paid good money to attend road shows and other poll-related meets. As a result, there was an increase in sales but not as expected during a bypoll. Top leaders were camping in hotels and lodges either in Karimnagar or Warangal because they are bigger towns compared to Huzurabad or Jammikunta. Liquor sales of top brands may have gone up significantly in the neighbouring towns,” said a wine shop owner in Jammikunta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bypoll-boon-for-eateries-petrol-bunks/articleshow/87318908.cms||Roushan Ali

One Mohammed Musharraf was booked in Sitapur district on Wednesday for a social media post in favour of Pakistan and spreading hate messages against India. SHO, Rampur Mathura, Jitendra Ojha, said, “An FIR was lodged against Mohammed Musharraf on charges of criminal intimidation by anonymous communication.” Similarly, one Mohammed Niyaz was booked at Faizganj Behta police station in Budaun district on the charges of sedition for posting the flag of Pakistan. “Niyaz is accused of creating communal disturbance by uploading the flag after India lost to Pakistan,” said SHO, Faizganj Behta, Suresh Gautam. SP, Bareilly, Rohit Sajwan, said one FIR was lodged at Izzatnagar police station under the IT Act against unidentified persons for using foul language against Indian team players and another for supporting Pakistan. “In the one of the cases, the complainant was also threatened so charges of criminal intimidation have also been added,” he said. Both the cases are registered against unidentified persons and efforts are on to trace them, the officer said. In Agra, three Kashmiri students were booked at Jagdishpura police station and arrested on the complaint of a BJP youth wing leader for raising anti-India slogans. The students were sent to jail and will be produced in court on Thursday, said circle officer Saurabh Singh. However, authorities of Raja Balwant Singh Engineering Technical Institute, where they studied, said no such slogans were heard in the campus. They demanded action against BJP workers for barging into the institute and misbehaving with staff.  The college had initially suspended the students, following allegations that they had posted in favour of Pakistan. The incident has been brought to the notice of All India Council of Technical Education, as the students were enrolled under Prime Minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme. Meanwhile, the Jammu and Kashmir Students’ Association requested the college administration to revoke the suspension order and also wrote a letter to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath requesting him to withdraw the FIR. A senior official at DGP headquarters said, “All the district police chiefs have been instructed to keep vigil on social media and keep an eye on developments which may vitiate the atmosphere in the state.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/five-held-for-pro-pak-slogans-after-t20-tie/articleshow/87320021.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Delhi||Amid ‘storm’, Nihang Sikhs decide to stay put at Delhi border||NEW DELHI: From Wednesday morning, Nihang Sikhs began arriving in small groups at Singhu border to decide whether they should continue to be a part of the year-long farmers’ protest there. Many of them carried their weapons, mostly swords, and were also joined by a few women protesters. Outside the assembly venue, there were tables where the names of those who had come to attend the meeting were being listed as were their views on whether the Nihangs should stay or leave the protest site. The lynching of Lakhbir Singh for allegedly desecrating the Sikh holy book on October 15 hung heavy over the conference. He was hacked with a sword and his hand and leg chopped off before his body was tied to the police barricade. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of the farmers’ unions, had distanced itself from the gory incident and said, “We want to make it clear that both the parties to this incident, the Nihang group and the deceased person, have no relation with Samyukt Kisan Morcha.” Later, police arrested four men in the case, all of them Nihang Sikhs. The mixed reactions to the involvement of the Nihangs in the incident propelled the community to hold Wednesday’s meeting to discuss the future course of action. The discussions started around 2pm, and the first speaker, Raja Ram Singh, one of the heads of the Nihang Jathebandis, said that in other similar cases of sacrilege, the Nihangs had caught the suspects and handed them to police without ever getting justice. Gurdeep Singh Bhatinda of the United Akali Dal said sacrilege occurred regularly, forcing the Sikh community to take justice into its own hands. "In my view, this justice is correct,” he said. “We cannot tolerate sacrilege." Jagjeet Singh declared that the Nihangs should stay on at Singhu to provide security to the protesters. "People and organisations have sent letters from abroad requesting the Nihangs to stay here," he said. Sardar Gurmukh Singh from Annadata Kisan Union similarly said that the Nihangs should continue their stay at Singhu, else the farmers’ agitation would be weakened. Baljinder Kaur, an Amritsar resident who reached the protest site with another woman, Amarjeet Kaur, was emphatic about the Nihangs’ role in Singhu. “As soon as the Nihangs leave the Kundli border, the government will remove the other protesters. The Nihangs are the ones who provide security to the agitating farmers,” she said. Almost everyone wants the Nihangs to stay put at Singhu, asserted Jathedar Baba Kulwinder Singh, an important member of the Nihangs groups. "We have received the responses of people across the country and they don't want us to leave the protest site. We will hold a press conference tomorrow where we will share more details," he said. Another Nihang leader, Baba Balwinder Singh, also declared that the community was not going anywhere. "We will not leave this place. It was decided in the meeting," he said. There was another incident on October 21 when a labourer was beaten at the site allegedly by a protester angered by the man refusing to give him a chicken. Police arrested the accused, who claimed he was a Nihang Sikh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/amid-storm-nihangs-decide-to-stay-put/articleshow/87318939.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 31.6k college students get Covid-19 jabs in two days of special drive||MUMBAI: The special vaccination drive in colleges is picking up pace with the first two days seeing a total of 31,672 candidates get inoculated across the state. In a bid to boost vaccination, the Maharashtra government announced a week-long special focus immunisation drive for eligible students across college campuses. The drive—Mission Yuva Swasth Abhiyaan—which is on from October 25 will end on November 2, just before Diwali sets in. While Day 1 saw 12,772 students take the jab, the tally rose almost 30% on Tuesday; the 305 colleges where vaccination camps have been set up saw 18,900 doses being given on Tuesday. “We are seeing a good increase in the number of students from the nearby localities who are not students of our college come for vaccination too,” said Shubha Pandit, principal, K J Somaiya College of Engineering; the science college is running the vaccination drive. Government data shows colleges in Pune recorded the highest vaccination on Tuesday, followed by those in Panvel. A total of 227 higher education institutes and 78 technical education colleges are offering vaccination on their campuses. In case of Mumbai, numbers are fewer. Some colleges that sought preliminary data from students were heartened to know a large percentage of the campus population was already vaccinated. “Responses from our students show 80% of them have taken the first dose and a little more than 50% both. So while we do not have a drive right now, we may consider it at a later date when more students are ready to take the second dose,” said Ruia College principal Anushree Lokur. There are roughly 5,000 colleges under the higher and technical education department, which include polytechnics, ITIs, professional colleges and other affiliated institutions. These cover nearly 40 lakh students who are over 18 old. Higher education minister Uday Samant told TOI preliminary raw estimates state that 60% students in higher education are vaccinated. “The drive will see at least 5-7 lakh students getting vaccinated,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-31-6k-college-students-get-jabs-in-2-days-of-spl-drive/articleshow/87318929.cms||Hemali Chhapia

---||Nagpur||Senate flays NU admn for failing students by marking them absent||Nagpur: Nagpur University’s Senate meeting on Wednesday started on a stormy note with the members cornering its administration on various issues pertaining to the students and slamming it for not acting on their repeated complaints.It was the first offline meeting in the last one-and-a-half years due to the pandemic and also the first for the new administration under vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari and pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe.The members, including Pravin Udapure and Manmohan Bajpayee, raised the issue of exam section failing about 1,400 students by marking them “absent” despite the fact that they appeared for the papers. They said the students were made to suffer for no fault and were demoralized after being declared as failed.On September 3, TOI had reported on the plight of over 350 such students who were shocked after being marked as absent. TOI quoted the case of Zareena Joya, who was awarded a gold medal in last year’s convocation but was declared absent in the MSc (mathematics) paper.Udapure said he himself appeared as a student in NU online exams and faced many technical glitches during papers due to blunders of NU. He said the university had also made some mistakes and should not pass the buck only on the examinees.Countering him, Board of Examination and Evaluation (BoEE) director Prafulla Sable blamed the students for committing mistakes while appearing in online papers despite repeated instructions.“We had clearly instructed the principals and teachers about precautions to be taken during exams. I even made a video and circulated it on the students WhatsApp number on many such instructions. The proctoring software quickly detects any suspicious activity and immediately stops the paper. It led to students being marked absent in the paper and were subsequently declared failed,” he said.Citing an example, the director said a student was appearing in one of the papers with a curtain in her background having the cartoon character Doremon. As it was moving due to the wind, the proctoring software was immediately activated and marked her absent.“The software allows ten calls or notifications from apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and others and then blocks the paper treating it as suspicious activity. Even someone passing from behind the student is instantly detected. We have time and again told the examinees not to take screenshots as it comes under suspicious activity by the software. We’ve all such recordings,” Sable said.After complaints swelled to 1,400, NU had constituted a panel under management council (MC) members to verify the complaints and suggest remedies. “We saw all the footage with the exam section where students committed certain mistakes as they didn’t read the instructions carefully. However, the panel has recommended conducting their re-exams,” MC members Urmila Dabir and Nitin Kongre said.Sable added that NU had smoothly conducted the PhD entrance exam on the same platform but did not receive even a single complaint. “We’ve conducted about 10 lakh papers of which just 1,400 were marked absent.”Members force VC to allow media inside SenateAfter VC Subhash Chaudhari prohibited the media from covering the Senate meeting, members unitedly opposed his decision and warned him that they would not allow the House to function unless journalists are invited. The members, led by Manmohan Bajpayee and Vishnu Changde, strongly protested the VC’s move calling it “undemocratic”.Equating the Senate with parliament and state assembly, the members said the media was the fourth pillar of democracy and its presence was necessary to ensure transparency. They informed the VC that his predecessor SP Kane had also barred media during his last Senate meeting and they had not allowed the house to function that time as well.With no other alternative, the VC, who was initially reluctant, had to bow down to the members’ demand. He instructed the media coordinator to invite all journalists and adjourned the House till then.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/senate-flays-nu-admn-for-failing-students-by-marking-them-absent/articleshow/87316814.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Amount of Rs1.57cr finds no mention in NU balance sheet, claims CA||Nagpur: The Nagpur University’s Senate meeting on Wednesday witnessed some anxious moments when a chartered accountant (CA) made a startling allegation that Rs1.57 crore is missing from its balance sheet for the last fiscal.CA Jagdish Joshi, who is the member of NU’s ‘Finance and Accounts Committee’, alleged that when he told vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari that he would report this big discrepancy during the Senate meeting, “the NU boss spoke in intimidating language”.Joshi’s allegations came during the discussion on the annual audit report and balance sheet that was tabled by the NU administration. He informed the house that when he raised an objection over a big amount of Rs1.57 crore not being reflected in the balance sheet, Chaudhari did not allow him to speak. The CA also alleged that when he told the other committee members that he would raise the issue in the Senate meeting, Chaudhari allegedly threatened him, “stating that he cannot speak on the committee’s internal issues in the public house”. “Even the auditor has clearly pointed out that Rs1.57 crore is missing from the accounts, but the NU administration failed to act,” alleged Joshi. After his direct attack on the NU top brass, the VC and registrar Raju Hiwase, who was previously posted as NU’s finance and accounts officer (FAO), were initially at loss of words.Chaudhari told the house that he had never intended to intimidate or suppress Joshi’s voice and wanted the issue to be resolved at the level of the finance panel. He tried to play down the allegations while stating that the difference in the amount was not a new trend, “as last year’s balance is adjusted in the next year”. The VA said, “NU’s CA has assured us to adjust the difference in the amount in next year’s balance sheet. Many transactions related to the examinations could not be entered into the balance sheet because the exams stretched for a longer period last year due to Covid-19 pandemic.”According to Joshi, NU had failed to make bank entries of Rs1,28,88,842 in the 2020-21fiscal. While the entries of Rs28,64,964, which should have been submitted in March this year, were made in August. “This has resulted in a difference of Rs1.57 crore in the entire balance sheet. Moreover, NU has not submitted its bank reconciliation statement for January, February and March. Therefore, the transaction that took place in the bank and those NU’s records cannot be reconciled,” he informed the house.Earlier, when Joshi asked the members on whether he can raise such an issue in the house, senior members like Baban Taywade came in his support, telling him that Senate was a public house and he can highlight any issue pertaining to the university, as it was a public body run by the Maharashtra government. The veteran member also advised VC to take precautions to avoid such “blunders” in the future.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/amount-of-rs1-57cr-finds-no-mention-in-nu-balance-sheet-claims-ca/articleshow/87316804.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Lucknow||Divorce imminent after mismatch: BJP||Lucknow: Terming the alliance between the Samajwadi Party and BJP’s former ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) as a “mismatched marriage”, government spokesperson and minister Suresh Khanna said it would only end in a divorce. Reacting to the formal announcement of the alliance on Wednesday, Khanna said it lacked cohesion and would crumble like a sand castle in the 2022 assembly polls. “Be it a mismatched alliance or marriage, both have only one fate – divorce. The nature of the alliance between SP and SBSP is exactly the same. In this alliance, the partners have their own motives and interests. They sing their own tunes and want others to dance to it. Alliances do not work with partners having a mindset like this. There is total absence of harmony or cohesion in this alliance,” Khanna said, adding that it would not be surprising if the alliance falls apart even before the elections if the expectations of one of the partners were not met. “If the alliance manages to survive the elections, it will definitely break after that because people are fed up with such dramas. They had not come together for a mahagathbandhan. It is a ‘mahathagbandhan of cheats’ and people will not fall in their trap again,” he said. SP had contested the 2017 state elections in alliance with the Congress and RLD and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with BSP and RLD. Ahead of the mega rally in Mau where SP and SBSP announced their alliance on Wednesday, SP chief and former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav had tweeted that the “Haldharpur ground of Mau will prove to be the Kurukshetra of a great political war”. Reacting to the tweet, Khanna said, “For once, Yadav is right as people have already decided who are the Pandavas and the Kauravas in this fight. SP-SBSP alliance will definitely fail.” Cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh also attacked the alliance and said it appeared that the SP chief was “deeply upset” over Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s action against criminals in the state. “The alliance is a desperate attempt by the SP to return to power so that it can provide protection to mafia and criminals,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/divorce-imminent-after-mismatch-bjp/articleshow/87320037.cms||Neha Lalchandani

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy sought replies from the chief secretary, principal secretary (revenue) and chief commissioner of land administration on the contentions raised in the petition.  PIL was filed by former deputy CM Damodar Raja Narasimha who questioned the new land law that brought in the new digital platform, Dharani portal, but forgot to borrow several key provisions from its parent Act, Record of Rights Act, 1971, which was repealed and replaced by the new land Act, 2020. Arguing the case of the petitioner, his counsel L Vani informed the court the new Act says that a tahsildar can be suspended and punished if he allows any wrong entries in the record of rights by unduly conferring rights to private persons on government land. “If any wrong entry is made in the records, there should be a provision that enables the aggrieved to challenge the error, which is lacking in the new law,” she said. Section 5 of the Act doesn’t provide for registering any other document other than sale, gift, mortgage or exchange deed in respect of agricultural land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-issues-notice-to-t-govt-on-new-land-law/articleshow/87318936.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Consul general of Israel to South India Jonathan Zadka, along with deputy chief of mission Limor Bletter, visited TNAU’s research facilities as part of the dialogue on research partnership in the presence of TNAU vice-chancellor N Kumar on Wednesday. The team had visited TNAU’s sewage treatment plant and water technology centre to oversee the technology being used and explore the possibilities of new technology in the last two days. TNAU VC N Kumar said that farmers are facing challenges including climate change, labour shortage, water scarcity and shrinking arable land. “While TNAU has been carrying out research in these areas, we discussed strategic plans to introduce new technology in some of the key areas. Israeli technologies will be adopted wherever there is scope for intervention in the existing technology used by us,” he said. Emerging areas of interest including sensors for early detection of pests, diseases and nutrient deficiencies, artificial intelligence for plant health monitoring, drone technology for delivery of inputs and robotics in agriculture were discussed. This is not the first time an Israeli delegation visited TNAU. In January 2020, researchable issues of mutual interest were discussed during the visit of the then counsel general Dana Kursh. She had expressed interest to further strengthen the activities of TNAU’s nanotechnology research and development activities. Israel has successfully incorporated nanotechnology, remote sensing and water management in the agriculture sector. Their water management technology is especially way ahead of others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/tnau-seeks-advanced-farm-tech-from-israel-hosts-delegation/articleshow/87318930.cms||---

If approved, Ocugen expects to complete the study during the first half of 2022, the US-based biopharma player said in a regulatory filing. Ocugen said the Phase 3 immuno-bridging study, OCU-002, plans to enroll several hundred healthy adults in the US with the participants being randomized to receive either two doses of Covaxin or placebo, 28 days apart. “The primary endpoint will compare blood-based samples taken from US participants who received Covaxin with samples of the participants in the Phase 3 efficacy trial conducted in India. The secondary endpoint involves testing the vaccine’s immunogenic profile. The study will also evaluate safety and tolerability in the US population,” Ocugen said. “We are very excited to take this next step in the development of Covaxin, which we hope will bring us closer to introducing a different type of Covid-19 vaccine to the American public. We are hopeful that the study conducted under the IND, if allowed to proceed, will help demonstrate that the data from India will be applicable to the US population,” Ocugen chairman, CEO & co-founder Dr Shankar Musunuri said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ocugen-seeks-fdanod-for-covaxin-trial/articleshow/87320044.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: 9 smaller MBC parties vow support to BJP||LUCKNOW: On a day, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav joined ranks with BJP’s ally-turned-rival SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar at a rally in Mau, the saffron outfit on Wednesday received “unflinching” support of at least nine smaller parties with an electoral base amongst Most Backward Castes and Dalit communities in Purvanchal region of UP. They lent support to BJP in the presence of state unit chief, Swatantra Dev Singh, at party headquarters in Lucknow. Of the nine political outfits, representative of seven parties — Bharatiya Suheldev Janata Party, Shoshit Samaj Party, Bharatiya Manav Samaj Party, Musahar Andolan Manch, Manavhit Party, Prithvi Raj Janshakti Party and Bhartiya Samta Samaj Party — were present at the BJP office. The seven parties are part of a ‘Hisseydari Morcha’ formed by Ram Dhani Bind, who has been working among the fishermen and potter community. Two other outfits — Apna Dal (Balihar) and Pragatisheel Samaj Party — also announced their support, marking BJP’s deft move to counter belligerent political adversaries ahead of assembly elections early next year. The most significant among smaller political parties to lend support to BJP included Bharatiya Suheldev Janta Party formed by former SBSP state president Bhim Rajbhar, who split from his parent outfit earlier this year. His inclusion in BJP camp was seen as the ruling party’s stunning punch on SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has been projecting himself as a sole custodian of the Rajbhar community that has a sizable presence in east UP. A resident of Ballia, Bhim Rajbhar, would be tasked to nibble at the very foundation of SBSP and loosen its grip amongst MBCs, sources said. The other Rajbhar dominated smaller party to lend support to BJP was Babulal Rajbhar-led Shoshit Samaj Party. BJP state chief Swatantra Dev Singh said, “people were aware of the gathbandhan formed by rivals, who always professed against the basic tenets of Hinduism and nationalism”. “They will get the answer in the forthcoming elections. People are with PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath,” said Singh, who categorically dismissed speculation that the coming together of OP Rajbhar and Akhilesh will impact electoral prospects of BJP in polls. The Shoshit Samaj Party is led by Babulal Rajbhar, while the Bhartiya Samta Samaj Party is led by Azamgarh-based Mahendra Prajapati. Singh claimed the two parties would together work in more than 60 districts, mainly in Poorvanchal. BJP also received support of Chandrama Vansasi-led Musahar Andolan Manch, which works amongst the most backward amongst Dalits. Likewise, Manavhit Party is led by Kishna Gopal Kashyap, while Prithviraj Janshakti Party is led by Chandan Singh Chauhan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/9-smaller-mbc-parties-vow-support-to-bjp/articleshow/87320039.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Goa||Goa: Santa Cruz farmers set to harvest 6 tonnes of paddy||PANAJI: Despite changing weather patterns, saline water inundation and stray cattle encroachment, 15 first-time community farmers who have cultivated over 33,000sqm of land at Santa Cruz, are set to harvest six tonnes of paddy. Last year, after the Covid-induced lockdown, a group of Santa Cruz villagers got together and started community farming near the village bundh. This season, they have harvested about two tonnes of the Jyoti variety of paddy from the farm there. “Farmers must come together, else community farming is not going to work. It’s cheaper to procure machinery and there is no stress of labour costs. With mechanisation, paddy farming is very profitable in Goa,” said community farmer, Olavio Fernandes. Fernandes, who was part of the farmers’ group, decided to replicate the model at another fallow land in the village. Two varieties – Jaya and Goa Dhan 1 – were planted and the harvest of the Jaya variety began on Tuesday, with 2.5 tonnes of the crop being reaped. They expect to reap six tonnes of both varieties combined. “Changing spells of rain this season affected the crop initially and later, flooding led to the soil turning saline. However, the Goa Dhan 1 is a salt-tolerant variety due to which the crop survived. There were also stray cattle attacks that we tackled by requesting the cattle owners to intervene,” Fernandes said. The farmers have decided to sell the produce after getting the paddy polished, but are awaiting the completion of the Goa Dhan 1 harvest. Buoyed by their success, the community farmers intend to take up growth of rabi crops at the farm. They are contemplating writing to the local panchayat to undertake stray cattle management in the village to ensure their crops are not destroyed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/santa-cruz-farmers-set-to-harvest-6-tonnes-of-paddy/articleshow/87318968.cms||Nida Sayed

A police officer told TOI that on Wednesday evening, hundreds of people, marching under the banner of Hind Mazdoor Kisan Samiti, reached the border from Muzaffarnagar. “They wanted to conduct a havan at the spot where Lakhbir Singh was killed. We told them it was on the Haryana side of the border, but they disregarded this information and tried to remove the barricades," the officer added. When the officer was asked whether a baton charge was carried out to disperse the protesters, he replied that the cops had used “mild force” to control the crowd and that no one had been injured. “The protesters are now sitting at 80 Foota Road," the officer said. When asked if the family and relatives of Lakhbir Singh were also present among the protesters, the police officer said there were a few women and children among the agitators, but the cops couldn't identify whether they were from the deceased man’s family. Meanwhile, there is no respite for commuters who wish to cross the Singhu border from Haryana into Delhi. Though the farmers have been claiming that they are facilitating the movement of traffic, on Wednesday, cars and bikes were moving at a snail’s pace. Between 12.30pm and 1.00pm on Wednesday, a long queue of vehicles had lined up at Singhu village. There was frustration all round, not the least for commuters who were driving to their workplaces. The traffic policemen, as usual, were seen telling drivers to take alternative routes. A few drivers also argued with the road staff about what they called “unnecessary diversions”. At Singhu border near Kundli, the farmers had barricaded one side of the road in the morning resulting in massive traffic snarls. The barricades were removed in the afternoon. Manoj, who runs a shop in Singhu village, sat ruing the “bahuth hi bura haal (the very bad conditions)” at the spot. He said, “I started my business a year ago, and right from that time I have suffered due to the farmers’ protest. Every day, commuters contend with hours-long snarls. There’s no respite for anyone.” Recently, the Supreme Court said that farmers had the right to protest against the three central farm laws even when their validity was being challenged in the apex court. But the court was firm in its view that no one could be permitted to block roads indefinitely and encroach on the right of a citizen to commute without hindrance. According to Singh villagers, there are traffic jams from morning till night with vehicles diverted from the highway to the village road. “The condition of the road has deteriorated due to the movement of big, commercial vehicles," said local resident Kalimuddin. According to a Delhi Police officer, the blocking of the highway by the farmers has forced the cops to provide motorists with alternative routes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-relief-for-commuters-crossing-singhu-border/articleshow/87319009.cms||---

Of 2.8 crore people (above 18) who should have taken two doses of the vaccine (5.6 crore doses), only 3.05 crore doses have been administered so far. That means 2.55 crore doses are yet to be given, while the state has 93 lakh doses available. On Wednesday, Mahbubnagar district collector S Venkat Rao inspected the vaccination drive at Enugonda. “Every individual who is still to take the first or second dose of vaccination has to be identified,” Venkat Rao said. He asked officials to paste stickers on the houses of those who took both the doses. During a video conference with collectors on October 26, Somesh Kumar gave statistics of the new Covid-19 cases being reported in the UK and Russia. “If there were to be a third wave, we should not be affected. That can be possible by ensuring 100 per cent vaccination,” he said. The CS, who went through the vaccination figures in the last two weeks, said this was not encouraging and asked officials to set up multi-disciplinary teams in the villages to identify those who have not taken the vaccine. The collectors provided details of the vaccination in their respective districts. For instance, in Rajanna Sircilla, there are 4.22 lakh who are eligible for the vaccine out of which 3.33 lakh have taken the first dose and 1.33 lakh have taken the second dose, collector Anurag Jayanthi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/slow-vaccination-collectors-shift-focus-to-second-dose/articleshow/87320080.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Bail granted to accused held with 349kg ganja||LUCKNOW: In a recent order, the Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court has granted bail to an accused who was arrested for possessing 350kg ganja illegally. The accused has been in jail since January 18, 2019. The order came from a bench of Justice Siddharth on the bail plea of one Kaleem. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had arrested the accused with heavy contraband in possession and hence booked him under NDPS Act. An FIR had been lodged in this connection with the NCB police station in January 2019 in Ayodhya district. Filing the bail plea before the HC, the accused had pleaded that the recovery was planted due to ulterior motives and as such he was innocent. It was also submitted that there was no independent witness to the recovery of ganja.  “There was no compliance of the provisions of section 50 of NDPS Act asking the accused if he wanted his search from a magistrate,” added the accused. He also abided by the bench if he was released on bail, he would not misuse the liberty of bail. Opposing the bail plea, NCB counsel contended that there was no occasion to plant such heavy contraband ganja with the accused. It was also said that the innocence cannot be adjudged at the pre-trial stage of the case. “If the accused is released on bail, he would involve in similar activity,” added the NCB. Allowing the bail plea, the bench observed, “Considering the plea of bail in view of a Supreme Court ruling, larger mandate of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the nature of accusations, the nature of evidence in support thereof, the severity of punishment, the character of the accused, circumstances which are peculiar to the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial, reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with, the larger interest of the public/ State and other circumstances, but without expressing any opinion on the merits, I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bail-granted-to-accused-held-with-349-kg-ganja/articleshow/87320075.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Bill collectors warm up for Municipal Premier League||COIMBATORE: The city corporation is preparing 52 bill collectors and five assistant revenue officials for the Municipal Premier League (MPL), an initiative to improve tax collections and motivate the officials involved in the same in its 100 wards spread across five zones. MPL would see them competing with one another to collect the maximum tax and the best performers would be rewarded at the end of the financial year. Their performance on collecting property tax, water charges, professional tax and non-tax would be reviewed ward wise every month. While the performance of bill collectors would be evaluated based on the tax collected, assistant revenue officers would be assessed based on the collection efficiency, new assessments and digital collections. The bill collectors and assistant revenue officials are now undergoing a three-day training programme that the corporation kickstarted on Tuesday to prepare for the MPL, which would begin on November 1. Namita Aggarwal, manager, municipal finance, Janaagraha, said the revenue officials were quite excited about MPL. “They have come up with lots of suggestions and ideas to improve the initiative.” A revenue department official said the tax collections at ward and zonal levels would be compared to pick the best performers. “Apart from collection of taxes for the current financial year and arrears, those who improve the number of assessments will get due weightage. Tax officials will also create awareness among the residents to increase tax collection through online mode.” Namita said while improving tax collection was the main objective of the initiative, boosting the morale of tax officials was also an important aspect. “They would have lost morale over the years, as their work may not have been recognised. There will be three types of officials – who are already motivated, who need some push and who are reluctant. We are trying to motivate them all.” Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara would decide on the rewards for the best performers. “They have worked with some of the corporations in Odisha and shown marked difference after the MPL initiative. Chennai corporation has its own programme to motivate tax collectors. It is the first time Janaagraha is joining hands with a civic body in Tamil Nadu,” Namita added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/bill-collectors-warm-up-for-municipal-premier-league/articleshow/87318973.cms||---

Jayaram Nagar, in Telungupalayam, was the first neighbourhood to get water under the scheme. Pipeline works have been completed to provide connection to 2,000 houses and meters will be installed soon. As many as 2,400 connections are required in Jayaram Nagar. While half of the connections can be provided from the overhead tank in the area, the rest will be given only after construction of a new tank. Residents of RS Puram, who were expected to get the connection first, have to wait for another six months as the project is facing some difficulties, an official with the engineering wing of the corporation said. “We replaced the old pipes in RS Puram, but retained cast iron pipes, which are main pipelines. Water contamination was reported from some areas due to leaks in cast iron pipes. We are trying to figure out where the pipes have developed leaks to repair them. As it will be costly to replace all cast iron pipes, we have decided to retain them,” he said. “Also, as old pipelines in RS Puram were extended without documentation, we are finding it difficult to trace them and have to dig up the place. As it is a time-consuming process, RS Puram residents have to wait for some more time for connection,” he said. “The target we had set, to provide 15,000 connections before the end of 2021, now looks daunting.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/cheran-colony-residents-to-get-round-the-clock-water-supply/articleshow/87318961.cms||V Devanathan

They also snatched the chain of another woman from S-4 coach. Wayse-Patil said, “A passenger, Vinayak Shriram (27) of Solapur, got down the train and started chasing the robbers. However, the robbers threw stones at him while he was chasing to stop him.” A senior Railway Protection Force officer told TOI that Shriram and his sister were sitting near the door of the compartment when her gold chain was snatched by the robbers.

During his visit, De Luca also met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray and industrialists Ratan Tata and Anand Mahindra. “I must say that the results of this visit have been beyond any expectation. The message is clear: ‘India needs more Italy and Italy needs more India’. Maharashtra will be a very important platform in this framework. Maharashtra is the most advanced state in India in the field of manufacturing and industrial production, and Italy is the second-biggest country in Europe for manufacturing. It seems natural to me that a closer partnership must be built between us,” De Luca said. About his meeting with the Thackerays, De Luca said, “We discussed the already strong existing presence of Italian enterprises in the state, especially in Mumbai and Pune. We also committed to an even stronger presence of Italian enterprises and investments, especially in the field of automotives, textile machineries, food processing and medical technologies.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-experts-from-italy-to-help-in-temple-restoration/articleshow/87319004.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Initially, the vendors, including their leader Caridade Pereira, were adamant that they wouldn’t move from the old market. MMC chairperson Damodar Kaskar held a meeting with Tari, the contractor and the representatives of fish vendors. The vendors demanded a written assurance from the municipality that they would be allotted a place in the new market and it would be completed in 18 months. Accepting their demands, Tari said he will issue order to the Vasco police inspector to stop wholesalers and street vendors from selling fish within a 2km radius of the market. He has asked the fish vendors to verify all the 300 names submitted with the municipality as old vendors. Tari also said traditional vendors would be considered as old vendors and will be allocated a place in the new market complex once the project is ready. He told them that Rs 8 crore granted under the 14th finance commission will be spent for the project. Sources said that there will be police presence around the market on a daily basis till the matter is resolved. Members of Congress, Trinamool Congress and Goencho Avaaz reached the Mormugao municipal market to support the traditional vendors. Dabolim candidate of Goencho Avaaz Viriato Fernandes said, “Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida has failed to come up with KTC bus stand at Vasco in the last 10 years. There was no hope that he would complete the fish market complex in 18 months.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/vasco-mkt-vendors-agree-to-shift-to-temporary-shed/articleshow/87318995.cms||---

The train is being operated as a special train with thrice the fare and limited stops. It covers a distance of 43km by connecting Coimbatore with suburban areas like Thudiyalur, Periyanaickenpalayam, Karamadai and Mettupalayam. Presently, the Memu conducts only one trip a day, compared to five. “Coimbatore has recorded high vaccination rates compared to other districts, making residents less prone to the infection. Yet the railway has not regularised the Mettupalayam – Coimbatore Memu train,” said M Jai Kumar, member of the Mettupalayam Railway Consultative Committee. Additional divisional railway manager of Salem division P Sivalingam said that train services are gradually restored based on the Covid protocol issued by the government. “Crowd factor is taken into consideration to operate trains, considering the pandemic.

---||Vadodara||Plaint against hospital filed over Covid bill||Vadodara: A major row erupted with a prominent city-based pulmonologist alleging that a leading hospital in the city had overcharged patients for Covid-19 treatment and, at the other end, did not settle her dues. The pulmonologist Dr Sonia Dalal had approached the city police with a complaint. The crime branch of the city police has been asked to probe the matter even as an offence is yet to be registered. Dalal has alleged that she came to know about the excess charges when a patient who had moved the consumer forum also contacted her. She has alleged that the hospital had been charging hefty visiting fee in her name even when this amount had not been paid to her. She moved the complaint in August. “The allegations are completely false. One doctor alone cannot manage Covid-19 at any multi-speciality hospital. There were five doctors, all of whom are superspecialists and they were part of the Covid-19 management team at our hospital,” said Anil Nambiar, an official working for the hospital. “There is also a team of 100-150 medical officers who managed Covid-19 patients apart from the support staff,” said Nambiar, adding that he has given his statement to the cops. “Two other doctors have also recorded their statements. They are also of the same view that it was Covid-19 management team. The charges were as per the notification issued by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation and classification of the rooms also was per VMC’s guidance,” he said. Assistant commissioner of police (crime) D S Chauhan said that the hospital had denied the charges and statements of its officials had been recorded. “We have sought several documents from them to check if there have been any irregularities,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/plaint-against-hospital-filed-over-covid-bill/articleshow/87318111.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Knowledge marketplace to help SMEs address skill shortage||Coimbatore: A city-based SaaS platform is ready to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that face skill shortage to find technical and soft talent by launching a knowledge marketplace. An end-to-end business process technology SaaS platform, Effitrac, which launched the knowledge market place named Effitrac Partner Connect, helps small and medium businesses optimize their time, money and resources. Logesh Velusamy, founder & CEO of Effitrac Solutions, said while working with SMEs they had noticed their struggle to re-engineer business processes and find the right set of talent to yield growth and success. “We understood that with limited resources SMEs could not spend or hire skilled people for a longer period. Their needs are mostly time and task bound, and they often need highly skilled people only for a week or month. That is exactly where we found the opportunity and we decided to rope in people, who are not open to work from office but are ready to render services from home as knowledge partners,” he said. Logesh said the people who have had a career break and were open to full time or time-bound activities could work for their clients. In the pilot programme, he said, they had onboarded 20 partners and trained them. “We deployed them with select customers and saw good results. We have now brought in a framework to onboard knowledge partners to help and educate them through induction programmes, which differ based on skill sets - there are veterans who want to bounce back in their area of expertise. Then comes those who are coming back after a break, ideally women after their maternity break. Then, there are freshers.” Based on the nature of partner resources, he said, knowledge partners were trained in different ways to bring them to a common framework and enable them with a larger customer base. “We are training job seekers in various domains so that SMEs can take the right resources for the right job.” T Krishna Kumar, of Madhampatty Food Services, who was part of the pilot programme, said he was planning to leverage the knowledge partner to increase his production.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/knowledge-marketplace-to-help-smes-address-skill-shortage/articleshow/87318981.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Kolhapur||No income tax on additional payments made by sugar mills||Kolhapur: The threat of income tax over the additional payment made to the farmers has been finally withdrawn. The Union finance ministry on Monday issued a circular stating that as per the suggestion of the Central Board of Direct Taxes, the clause of Income Tax Act, 1961, which mandates the cooperative sugar mills to pay the income tax over on he amount paid in addition to the fair and remunerative price (FRP) fixed by central government or State Advised Price (SAP) fixed by state government has been amended. It now states that the no income tax will be charged over the price paid higher than the fixed price. For last two decades, the sugar mills were fighting to withdraw the clause. The I-T department used to issue demand notices to the mills. The mills have income tax worth of crores of rupees to be paid to the department as per the clause. The I-T officials used to consider the amount paid in addition to the FRP as the profit of the mills. “Usually, the mills pay amount equal to FRP to the farmers. However, if they reap large benefits from sugar and byproduct business during the season, they pay the share to the farmers. It is not profit; rather, those are the expenses made,” said Vijay Autade, sugar industry expert in Kolhapur. Autade said that they fought till the Supreme Court to get the clause repealed. The mills would not be able to operate if the income tax dues worth thousands of crores are to be collected from the mills. They will simply collapse, he said. He added that now that the decision has been taken and government will have to take the decision to the Parliament to amend the Act. As per the circular, the income tax over higher price paid to the farmers has been done away with from 2016. “We are hopeful that the amendment is made such that the decision is implemented retrospectively,” said Autade.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/no-income-tax-on-additional-payments-made-by-sugar-mills/articleshow/87320108.cms||---

The recovery rate of the hybrid varieties is 11-12% as against the 9% of the existing crop and the factory is eyeing an increased yield from the next crushing season. The state’s lone sugar factory had procured the hybrids from Gadhinglaj in Maharashtra and will be distributing the seed setts through the Sugarcane Farmers Facilitation Committee. Committee chairman Narendra Sawaikar said that the seed setts are ready for distribution. Cane yield in Goa has dropped from over 60,000 tonne to below 30,000 tonne.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/sugar-factory-eyes-high-yield-next-yr/articleshow/87319024.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath will make a comeback; if BJP agrees, we will contest in UP: Union minister Ramdas Athawale||LUCKNOW: Rallying for UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale is sure that the ruling BJP will make a comeback in 2022 elections. He spoke to TOI’s Shailvee Sharda on the political situation in UP, Dalit politics and on Aryan Khan. Q1: How do you see the present political canvas of UP?A: It is in favour of incumbent CM Yogi Adityanath who has worked very hard for the people despite odds including the pandemic, under the guidance of our PM Narendra Modi. Q2: Why do you think Yogi will make a comeback?A: The electorate longs for Yogi. He has put an end to goonda raj in UP and established the rule of law. He has spared no one: neither goons nor men in khaki who take their duty lightly. He has created employment and ensured that central schemes reach people. Q3: What reasons make you believe that other parties like Samajwadi Party and Congress will not do well?A: The days of Maya and Mulayam are over. People of UP have lost faith in them. Q4: Both Mayawati’s BSP and your party share a common cause: the welfare of Dalits. Why do you oppose her?A: We do not use Dalits for our gains unlike her party. Republican Party was formed by Babasahab Bhimrao Ambedkar and we have carried his legacy forward whereas Mayawati has lost track of the mission and vision of Babasaheb. She experimented for the sake of power and failed both Brahmins and Dalits. We will urge Dalits in UP to join us and stop letting anyone use them. Q5: Will your party contest elections in UP?A: Talks are underway. If BJP agrees, we will field 8-10 candidates. Q6: What are the issues affecting Dalits in UP?A: The struggle of respect is still on. The situation has changed a lot since 2014. There may have been incidents of Dalit atrocities but governments, especially in UP, have taken prompt action. A lot more can change only when people stand up and fight for their rights. Q7: What do you think is the future of people like Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan?A: He is a local leader from Saharanpur. If he really wants to anchor change, he should leave his comfort zone. Q8: Why do you want to send Aryan Khan to rehabilitation?A: While charges against him are yet to be proved, it is undeniable that anyone in the grip of an addiction is also a victim of the intoxicant. An alcoholic is not sent to jail but to rehabilitation. A drug addict deserves similar treatment. Our ministry is proposing changes in the legal framework to transform the scenario.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/yogi-will-make-a-comeback-if-bjp-agrees-we-will-contest-in-up/articleshow/87320139.cms||Shailvee Sharda

A file in this regard has been sent by the directorate of animal husbandry and veterinary services (AHVS) to the government and is pending approval. “The earlier version of the scheme was not able to garner good response from the tribal community, owing to which, we have now enhanced the scheme. We want members of the communities to come forward and avail of the dairy kit subsidy. The scheme will be profitable for farmers after its revision,” an AHVS official told TOI. The total value of items which earlier did not exceed Rs 5,000, will now have a capping of Rs 30,000. The communities will get 100% subsidy in this scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/dairy-farming-kit-to-get-more-items/articleshow/87319040.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

After conducting the SVEEP (Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation) programme at the taluka level, the South Goa collectorate now plans to reach out to college students. “As most colleges are still largely closed, we are conducting online programmes for the students. Various competitions, like essay writing, painting, etc, are being regularly held for college students,” South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal said. Plans are also in the offing, Katyal said, of organising wall painting competitions for college students across the state by the office of the state’s chief electoral officer. This, she said, will serve a two-fold purpose: the display of messages will generate interest among college students about the election process, and secondly, with the involvement of public in these events, awareness will be created in the community. Katyal has appealed to eligible voters to apply online or through submission of proper application forms if their names haven’t been listed in the electoral rolls or if correction needs to be done in the names. She has also urged youngsters who have completed 18 years to enrol as voters and participate in the electoral process. The office of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) will begin a month-long special summary revision of the electoral rolls of assembly constituencies from November 1 with a month-long period for filing objections and suggestions. The final publication of the electoral roll will take place on January 5, 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/s-goa-officials-aim-to-enrolyoungsters-in-voters-rolls/articleshow/87319034.cms||---

---||Meerut||Rape charges added by UP cops in FIR of girl, 12, unconscious in Delhi hosp for 2 weeks, after DCW prod||Meerut: A day after the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) wrote to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath for prompt action in the case of a 12-year-old girl who was allegedly sexually assaulted by her neighbour in UP’s Bulandshahr, police said on Wednesday that the section of rape has been added to the FIR, initially filed for molestation and attempt to murder. The girl has been lying unconscious for the past 13 days at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. “Doctors have told us that she is critical. Even if she survives, it will take around a year for her to get back to normal,” her father told TOI over phone. SSP (Bulandshahr) Santosh Singh, however, said police were yet to receive any instructions on the DCW letter and that the Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 375 (rape) was added to the FIR “much earlier”. “We didn’t add it initially because the family made no mention of rape. The accused, a 45-year-old man, was booked for attempt to murder and arrested,” he said. The student of class 8 was attacked on October 15 when her parents had gone to work and her elder sister was out in fields to collect fodder. The survivor has two younger sisters as well who were at home with her and witnessed the crime. The accused had allegedly raped her and tried to strangulate her. He then fled from the spot. The parents of the girl took her to a nearby hospital in Bulandshahr, but she was referred to a hospital in Meerut and finally, due to her critical condition, was referred to Delhi. “The accused, Chatterpal, entered their house in the afternoon and raped the girl. When the parents reached home, they found the girl unconscious. Police had already filed an FIR on the basis of the complaint filed by parents,” said Singh, adding that initially section for assault was included in the FIR, but after the medical report confirmed rape, the section of rape was also added in the complaint. Police said they would send a proposal to the government to provide financial assistance to the family under a state government scheme. The rape survivor’s mother said their fight was for justice. “I’m praying for my daughter’s full recovery,” she said. Local residents said Chatterpal had spent 10 years in jail after he was accused of killing his uncle. On Tuesday, DCW chief Swati Maliwal had written to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, asking him to direct police to add sections of rape in the case. In her letter, Maliwal said “the most shocking aspect of the case” was that despite the brutality of the crime, the UP police registered an FIR in the matter but failed to add sections of rape. The DCW has also asked the UP government to ensure that the trial of the case takes place in a fast-track court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/rape-charges-added-by-up-cops-in-fir-of-girl-12-unconscious-in-delhi-hosp-for-2-weeks-after-dcw-prod/articleshow/87318162.cms||Ishita Mishra

Dilip Dalal, who owns a plastic manufacturing factory, and his 43-year-old son Rashesh Dalal died on the spot. Some passers-by spotted the bodies and informed the railway authorities. According to the railway police, Dilip and Rashesh were resident of Alkapuri area. “We have been told that Rashesh suffered from learning disability. On Tuesday night, Dilip and Rashesh left their home and boarded an autorickshaw. The duo reached Makarpura railway station by about 8 pm,” said B M Labana, railway police inspector, Vadodara. The duo then walked about half-a-kilometre and saw a train arriving. “They jumped in front of Kochuveli-Bhavnagar Express. Their bodies were sent for post-mortem and then handed over to Dilip’s wife,” Labana added. When asked about the reason behind their suicide, Labana told TOI, “We are yet to ascertain any reason as Dilip’s wife isn’t in condition to talk. The duo was from a well-to-do family but we are inquiring if the family was in any financial trouble.” “Rashesh wasn’t mentally stable so it is possible that Dilip may be worried as to who will look after him so he decided to end the former’s life too. No note has been left by Dilip so we cannot ascertain the exact reason behind their extreme step,” Labana added. The deceased stayed in Suvarnpuri society and Rashesh was the only son of Dilip Dalal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/bizman-43-yr-old-son-jump-in-front-of-a-moving-train/articleshow/87318193.cms||---
---||Varanasi||IIT-BHU to work with French partners on clean Ganga mission||Varanasi: The Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (IIT-BHU) will collaborate with French international partners in the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), for which a team of French scientists would visit India next year. Besides, to boost this objective, IIT-BHU has collaborated to build solar-plus lithium battery solutions to replace diesel generator (DG) sets on boats. IIT-BHU director Prof Pramod Kumar Jain said, “The recently held conference towards the complete restoration of river health shows our larger contribution towards social and environmental solutions.” He said that Varanasi is located at the bank of the Ganga, and in the last few years, it has been observed that the water has been heavily polluted. The Government of India has taken various initiatives for a cleaner Ganga and that has been an incredible approach but additionally, it is also important to understand the root cause of the pollution. “Therefore, our faculty members, students and various experts came on board to discuss and implement concrete solutions towards the health restoration of the river Ganga. It is imperative to conduct an expert discussion helping the researchers to develop a holistic and viable approach attaining our core objective,” he said. IIT-BHU recently organised a two-day international conference on ‘River Health: Assessment to Restoration’ in hybrid mode. The core objective of the conference was to initiate the dialogue about the tributaries of Ganga — Varuna and Assi — and emphasize the restoration of these tributaries for complete health restoration of the Ganga. In addition, the conference also aimed to collect, compile and comprehend all the facts and figures related to the tributaries which play an important role and will further help in their health restoration. The conference was attended by experts from different institutes such as IIT-Guwahati, IIT-Gandhinagar, IIT-Delhi and BHU. All stakeholders, including government departments, municipal agencies, civil society representatives, French experts along with other international experts were invited for active participation at the conference. Prof. Harvey Piegay and Prof P Gille from France talked about the collaboration between India and France for restoring the river’s health and appreciated the efforts of the Indian scientific community and the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). They spoke about pollutants movement at the confluences of the tributaries. NMCG director general RR Mishra discussed the initiatives of NMCG, and UPPCB chairman JPS Rathore talked about the ongoing initiatives taken for health restoration of the river Varuna. Some of the key points discussed during the conference include identifying the key pollution issues that need to be addressed in Varuna and Assi and to be incorporated in rejuvenation activities, collate and analyze all data, facts and figures that are significant to the health restoration of Varuna and Assi, invite ideas/proposals/concepts from both domestic and international experts to learn about good practices or approaches across the world that may be contextualized and replicated in these tributaries, assess innovative and contemporary technologies for restoration of the two tributaries, and identification of social and administrative pathways towards the purpose. During the conference, the stakeholders and experts suggested different solutions categorized under four segments — industrial water pollution, domestic water pollution, agricultural water pollution, and groundwater. All solutions will be later analysed by experts and implemented based on the inputs and approvals of members of the multi-stakeholder group. Additionally, demonstrations and pilot projects will also be actioned early, potentially replicating and scaling up the issue. Seeking national and international expert advice, the first step to attain the objective is that two ghats — Shashtri ghat on the river Varuna and Sankhat Mochan ghat on river Assi — have been selected and proposed to be developed for bathing purposes. Convenor Prof. Prabhat Kumar Singh said that initiatives of NMCG on the Ganga are remarkable, but now is the time to start initiatives on the tributaries of Ganga to restore the complete health of the river. “We will prepare a detailed report on the outcome of the conference and share the detailed recommendation with NMCG,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/iit-bhu-to-work-with-french-partners-on-clean-ganga-mission/articleshow/87318157.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Under pressure’ VC stops probe into colleges not paying staffers’ wages||Nagpur: The Nagpur University vice chancellor, Subhash Chaudhari, has abruptly stopped functioning of the fact-finding panel inquiring into allegations against private colleges, particularly engineering faculty, not paying salaries to staff since the last one-and-a-half years. The VC has now constituted another panel to probe the same allegations under him, with pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe, and four deans as members, said Senate members. Among ten colleges named by the earlier panel, Chaudhari is directly related to JD College of Engineering, where he was principal before joining NU as pro-VC. Even science and technology dean Prashant Maheshwari was director in the same college earlier. Both of them are part of the VC’s new panel. The first panel under senior Management Council member Rajesh Bhoyar had already submitted a preliminary report in August, where it had named ten colleges that allegedly did not pay salaries to teaching and non-teaching staff, and also harassed them over financial losses due to Covid-19 pandemic and series of lockdowns. The list included eight engineering institutions, one management institution, and one offering general courses. The issue came to fore when Management Council member Nitin Kongre raised the issue during Wednesday’s Senate meeting, asking the VC what action had been taken against the erring colleges. The VC refused to divulge details to him in the house, stating that the issue was pending. TOI had highlighted the plight of employees from two engineering colleges on August 14 while quoting a complaint filed by them with the central and state authorities, including AICTE. According to Kongre, NU had even sent letters to the colleges warning them to either release wages of staffers or face stringent action like disaffiliation, but nothing moved since then, and employees continued to suffer till date. The other panel members told TOI they were shocked by the VC’s decision to end their tenure abruptly, even as they were yet to submit their final report and their investigations were underway. They accused him of succumbing to pressure from private colleges, particularly his own, as hardly any of them had paid full wages. They termed VC’s move as clear “conflict of interest” since both he and Maheshwari were former employees of JD College, which was named by the Bhoyar panel. “After NU’s letters, some colleges had released part wages to aggrieved staffers. The colleges cited the reason of Maharashtra government’s failure to release scholarship dues to them. However, we have come to know that even that was released, still the colleges were reluctant to pass on those funds to their teaching and non-teaching staff,” they said. In its interim report submitted to Chaudhari, the Bhoyar panel recommended NU should issue directives to all colleges not to pressurize their employees. It also recommended that the colleges should release entire pending wages within a week and submit proof, including bank details, to NU. However, hardly any colleges have submitted their details so far. Urmila Dabir, Vishnu Changde and deputy registrar Raman Madane were other members on this panel.

Rajbhar was addressing the ‘Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha Mahapanchayat’ on the 19th anniversary of his party’s foundation at Haldharpur ground in Mau on Wednesday. He was joined by Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav on the dais to announce the formation of an alliance between the two parties for the 2022 election. Enthused by the large crowd, Rajbhar said, “Jo Dalit, pichhade samaj ke logon ko bhaisa bolte hai, wo apni bhains theek rakkhey (Those, who call people of Dalit and OBC sections bull, should keep their buffaloes fit). They think that nobody would react to them for such a remark?” “They should know that I am the heir of Maharaja Suheldev. I say with full confidence, don’t worry. This gathering is only a glimpse while the real game is due,” said Rajbhar, terming the crowd as his strength. Rajbhar said his party would hold a mega rally of women by ensuring participation of over a lakh women supporters of the alliance. The SBSP chief targeted the BJP MLA as on October 24, the latter had compared him with a ‘bhainsa’. “A scientist tried to convert a bhaisa into a human being by giving it ideal care and ambiance, but when it was released the animal jumped into a ditch. We also tried to make this ‘bhainsa’ a human being, but it is not possible as a living being does not change its character,” Singh had said terming Rajbhar’s decision to join hands with the SP “an act of bathing in a pond after taking dip in the holy Ganga”. Rajbhar in his address not only targeted this BJP MLA, but also raised his demand for ban on liquor in UP. “People of my fraternity consume so much liquor in a month which would be more than the money spent by the entire BJP in two months. Therefore, I demand prohibiting liquor,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/rajbhar-hits-out-at-bjp-mla-for-bhainsa-slur/articleshow/87318189.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Goa||Goa: Within 2 years of completion, railings of Galgibaga bridge develop rust||POINGUINIM: The Manohar Parrikar Bypass in Canacona, constructed as part of the highway expansion project, was completed in November, 2019. This 10km-road has cut short the distance between Char Rasta in Canacona to Pollem by 10km. It shortens the times taken to drive across the border to Karwar and beyond. Senior citizens from the area claim that the railings started to corrode within five months of its last painting. A retired government official said that if this is the condition in Galgibaga, one cannot imagine what must have happened to the railings at the Talpona bridge and the Mashem creek. The highway stretch passes through mixed areas, hilly terrain and forested patches. This made the highway widening difficult and, therefore, the elevated expressway of sorts from Char Rasta to Pollem was conceptualised. When the national highway-66 assistant engineer was asked about the corroded railings, he said that now that the monsoon season has ended, it will be fixed as the contractor has to look into the maintenance for the first five years. With over three bridges, the Canacona bypass was opened for traffic a year and a half ago, its maintenance work is being undertaken only to some extent, after protests and gheraos, state Congress general secretary Janardhan Bhandari said. The Canacona bypass was constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 2.9 crore. The bypass, includes three vehicular underpasses, 17 piped culverts and four box culverts and is a four-lane route. Three bridges, namely one each over the Talpona (450m), Galgibaga (500m) and Mashem (130m) rivers, are a part of the 7.74-km-long bypass road.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/within-2-yrs-of-completion-railings-of-galgibaga-bridge-develop-rust/articleshow/87319066.cms||Albert Fernandes

Forest minister K Ramachandran said higher forest officials would take a decision in this regard based on the consent from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) after the tiger recuperates from wounds completely. “The health condition of the tiger is improving day by day and it is eating well. The Mysore zoo has all the facilities of a well equipped rescue centre.” The minister said the state would soon have a wild animal rescue centre. “We have sent a proposal to the government in this regard.” Aged around 13 years, MDT-23 had killed three people and around 10 heads of cattle in the Gudalur division of forests in the Nilgiris in the past two months, before it was captured on October 15 after 21 days of operation. The tiger was subsequently shifted to a cage as per the NTCA protocols and taken to the Mysore Zoo. The animal had several wound marks on its body. Tigers housed in the Mysore Zoo are either captured or rescued ones from Karnataka forests. “In most of the cases, the tigers were either old or severely wounded when captured or rescued. Considering their old age and incapability to survive in the wild, they were retained in the zoo itself,” a source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/tiger-rescued-from-nilgiris-may-be-shifted-to-vandalur-zoo/articleshow/87319052.cms||---
---||Varanasi||UP: Akhilesh Yadav seals poll pact with SBSP, attends mahapanchayat||VARANASI: Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday announced entering into a pre-poll alliance with former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ally Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP). The pact was announced at a Mahapanchayat held to mark the 19th foundation day of SBSP at Haldharpur ground in Mau, where Akhilesh was the guest of honour. Akhilesh also mentioned the SP-SBSP alliance after reaching his parliamentary constituency Azamgarh later in the day. “SBSP had opened its doors for BJP to assume power in Uttar Pradesh in 2017 assembly polls. But, time has come SBSP supporters close this door and we will lock it as it is necessary for the protection of the rights of poor, OBC, SC and minority people,” said Akhilesh while addressing a gathering termed ‘Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha Mahapanchayat’. He said, “Like people in West Bengal taught a bitter lesson to BJP in the recently held elections with the slogan ‘khela hobe’ (game will be played), people of UP will ensure ‘khadeda hobe’ (BJP is ousted).” “Before the rally was finalised for the formal announcement of the alliance between SP and SBSP for 2022 elections, political analysts estimated the number of seats that would be won by different parties in the elections. But, after finalisation of our alliance, all the calculations have failed as they all knew that victory of this alliance is definite,” said Akhilesh, claiming that people will ensure the victory of the alliance on 400 seats. Akhilesh said the upcoming assembly elections will be fought for “brightening the future of the state and bringing back its lost pride, as BJP’s conspiracies and false promises are not going to mislead Dalits and OBC any more”. Cautioning people to remain alert against what he termed as misleading tactics and conspiracies of the BJP, Akhilesh said, “The battle has to be fought for long. Everyone will have to keep in mind the rising inflation, farmers’ woes, unemployed youths, death of migrant labourers during Covid-19 lockdown and people who died for want of oxygen and proper treatment.” Targeting the BJP-led Central and state governments on rising fuel prices, Akhilesh said, “They sold dreams like people in ‘hawai chappal’ (slippers) will board aeroplanes. However, the skyrocketing price of petrol in the regime of double-engine government has compelled the people to stop riding even motorcycles.” He alleged that migrant labourers were left to move on the road on foot and die in the bid to reach home during Covid-19 lockdown, while poor people died in lack of proper treatment and oxygen. “In the name of increasing medical facilities, nine medical colleges were inaugurated recently. However, this was done by covering the incomplete buildings with veils,” alleged Akhilesh. Akhilesh also stirred the sentiments of the farmers by raising the issue of their agitation against the new farm laws. “If the three black farm laws become effective, the farmers will become labourers in their own fields.” Referring to the deaths of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, he said, “Farmers demanding their rights are being crushed under jeeps. Also, justice for them is also proving to be difficult as the killer’s father, who is a Union minister, has neither resigned nor been sacked from the Union cabinet so far.” Mentioning the recent death of a farmer in Lalitpur, allegedly in a queue to buy fertilizer, Akhilesh said that “increased cost of sowing and growing a crop has made farming a loss-making affair in the regime of BJP, which had come to power on the promise to double the income of farmers”. Akhilesh also alleged that the government has done nothing but simply changed the names of old projects and inaugurated completed projects. “It has also failed to complete the Purvanchal Expressway, which was started in SP regime while ambulance and dial 100 police services were spoiled,” he further alleged. In his address, Rajbhar said, “I have joined hands with the SP to make Akhilesh the next chief minister of the state. This will ensure free power supply for domestic consumers, free education up to post-graduation, caste-wise census for OBCs, checking inflation, ending woes of farmers, revival of old pensions for government employees and protecting the Constitution and rights of OBC, SC, minorities and the poor.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/sp-seals-pre-poll-alliance-withsbsp-for-2022-assembly-polls/articleshow/87318171.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Kolkata||Pollution board pins hopes on student power for a clean Diwali||Kolkata: The state pollution control board has pinned its hopes on students to ensure a pollution-free Diwali celebration this year. In the last few years, these students, board officials said, displayed amazing spirit to say no to fireworks of any type and influenced others not to indulge in causing pollution. These students were shown numerous movies on how the existence of our earth is threatened. WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra will address nearly 6 lakh students on November 2, both online and offline, to remind them of their responsibility before Diwali. “The damage caused during Diwali has a lasting impact on the ambient air governed largely by meteorology of this period,” said Rudra. “It is always very difficult to bring sweeping changes in society, particularly when something is happening in the guise of tradition. Only students can bring this changes effectively. I remind them of the Allahabad High court order saying that breathing in clean air is a fundamental right they must not lose sight of,” he added. For years, WBPCB has nurtured these students of 5,600 schools across the state under the National Green School Programme. “These students went back to create a peer group in their locality and became young influencers on local environmental issues. There are some amazing teachers who helped them to grow into an environmentally aware entity,” said Rudra. WBPCB is also meeting all the housing societies on November 1. Last few years, WBPCB managed to identify the key person in each housing as an influencer to ensure that the complex complied with the apex court order. “We slapped a few errant housing complexes with a penalty under the polluters’ pay clause.

---||Kolkata||Extension of rebate window to help sustain growth: Realtors||Kolkata: Real estate developers in Kolkata are confident that CM Mamata Banerjee’s announcement to extend the stamp duty rebate window beyond October 30 will sustain the growth witnessed in the past few months to enable the sector record the best performance in recent times despite the challenging situation posed by the pandemic. The CM had on Tuesday said that the rebate would be extended by three months. The industry though had requested for two additional months. The extension will, however, come into effect once the notification is approved by the state Assembly in November. The 2% reduction in stamp duty and 10% cut in circle rates were offered by the state government as part of this year’s budget sops. It led to a 75% spike in residential apartment sales in Kolkata in the quarter ending September over the same period last year. Between July and September this year, 15,160 apartments were sold, up from 6,842 sold during the corresponding period last year, which is a growth of a whopping 122%. “As the stamp duty cut was only applicable for 22 days in July, the real upward momentum came in August 2021 before slowing down in September due to the onset of the inauspicious Shradh period of 11 days beginning September 20, 2021. Due to a period of heightened momentum in registration of residential sales deeds in August, it constituted 48% of the quarterly total,” an official at the state directorate of registrations and stamp revenue explained. The spike in demand has also led to an increase in launches. While only 756 units were launched in April-June 2021, developers launched 3,128 in the following three months. Compared to last year, when 1,934 units were launched in July-September, the growth is 62%. The Bengal chapter of Credai, had written to the finance minister and finance secretary, seeking an extension of the scheme till December 31, 2021. The current scheme was announced on July 7 and is valid till October 30. “We are really happy that the government has considered the proposal and are confident this initiative will lead to record sales in apartments and reduction in inventory,” said Nandu Belani, president of the Confederation of Bengal chapter of the Bengal chapter of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai). Merlin Group MD Saket Mohta said the move would accelerate transactions. “It will definitely encourage new launches at attractive price points. There was a lot of inventory overhang which has been cleared in the last few months due to these sops,” he added. Primarc Group director Sidharth Pansari and Siddha Group MD Sanjay Jain said the incentives had led to huge off-take of old inventory in 2021. “The overall market sentiment is positive and the stamp duty cut will further help sales during the festive season,” added Jain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/extension-of-rebate-window-to-help-sustain-growth-realtors/articleshow/87318177.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Last week, a number of Congress leaders from the state had met Gandhi in Delhi, even as the party high command is set to announce the names of the new GPCC president and leader of opposition in the assembly (LOP) shortly. “The PCC chief will be decided on the basis of the candidate’s capabilities, age and work experience,” said the source. Over six months ago, Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda and Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader PareshDhanani had resigned from their posts after the Congress’ dismal performance in the local body polls. The crucial assembly elections are scheduled next year. Chavda said, “We have invited Rahul Gandhi to participate in the three-day ‘Chintan Shibir’ that will be held in November and we are sure that he will be present at the shibir and guide the Congress on the party’s stand in Gujarat.” “There are no rifts in the party as is insinuated by some. Today, Rahul Gandhi had a long discussion with us for more than three hours and listened to everybody. He will be meeting many other leaders later and after that the party high command will take appropriate decisions regarding the Gujarat Congress leadership and also the coming state assembly elections,” Chavda added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/sharma-chavda-meet-raga/articleshow/87318172.cms||---

The farmers have been given 50% subsidy for using the harvesting machine, an agriculture officer said. The cost of a harvesting machine is Rs 2,400 per hour. If the weather holds up for the next few days and if harvesting machines are made available in time, harvesting is likely to be completed in the next two weeks. Bicholim zonal agricultural officer Pankaj Pokle inspected the harvesting work at Vargao on Tuesday and Wednesday. Officials estimated that the paddy yield will be good as long as it does not rain. Farmers from areas like Pilgao, Mayem, Vargao, Narvem, Mulgao, Bordem and surrounding areas have undertaken traditional harvesting methods in areas where the soil is marshy as harvesting machines cannot be used here. Farmers alleged that labourers engaged in the work of traditional harvesting are charging them exorbitant rates for their services and that they have no option but to pay them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/paddy-farming-commences-in-full-swing-at-bicholim/articleshow/87319080.cms||---

---||Delhi||Hospitals under pressure as dengue cases soar in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Ten people have died due to dengue at Safdarjung Hospital this season, officials from South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) have confirmed. Of them, the officials added, a woman was a Delhi resident while the rest were from other states. Because the corporation takes into account deaths involving people living in Delhi only, the officials said, the death toll due to dengue in the city stands at two now. This includes a woman who succumbed to the disease at Safdarjung Hospital and another death at a private hospital. Both the deaths took place in September. The officials said they were investigating the reason of death and other details before confirming it. Some other hospitals have also reported to the civic bodies about dengue deaths and, sources said, the details shared by them were being examined. If these deaths are confirmed to be caused by dengue, the toll could increase further, the sources said. In the last two weeks, there has been a serious spurt in dengue cases in the national capital as well as neighbouring towns. This, doctors say, has led to a shortage of beds in many hospitals. Hospitals like AIIMS, Ram Manohar Lohia, Lok Nayak in the public sector and Sir Ganga Ram, Apollo and Max hospitals in the private sector among others say they are constantly increasing the beds for dengue patients. “We have more than 30 dengue patients admitted in the hospital currently. Most of them have severe symptoms,” Dr Ashutosh Biswas, professor of medicine at AIIMS, told TOI. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said they had 41 dengue patients admitted at present. “Total 190 patients having fever visited the OPD on Wednesday. We have sent their samples for testing for dengue,” Dr Kumar said. At Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, chairman of the medicine department Dr SP Byotra said, they had nearly 60 dengue patients admitted at present. “Our dengue ward is full and we are accommodating patients in the flu ward and any other available space,” he added. The occupancy of beds is high at RML, Safdarjung, Max, Fortis and Apollo also. “We have added some more beds for dengue patients in view of the increased rush,” Dr AK Singh Rana, medical superintendent of RML Hospital, said. Data shared by the municipal corporations shows 1,006 people have tested positive for dengue as on Monday and one person has succumbed to it. Doctors say the actual number may be much higher. “We haven’t seen such a rush of dengue patients in the last two years. Also, many patients are coming with severe symptoms, including liver-related complications,” said a senior doctor, who did not want to be quoted. This year, type-II strain of the dengue virus has been found to be predominant in Delhi and nearby areas. It is known to cause more severe symptoms. Dengue is a self-limiting disease. Most patients recover well with symptomatic treatment. But, Dr Biswas from AIIMS said, one should not ignore the warning signs such as pain in the abdomen, bleeding from natural orifices, rapid fall in the platelet count or extreme weakness. “Persons suffering from chronic kidney disease, heart diseases and pregnant women among others should take extra precaution to protect themselves from mosquito bites,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hosps-under-pressure-as-dengue-cases-soar/articleshow/87319102.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Kolkata||Rowers want fountains removed from Lake; KMDA says biodiversity more important||Kolkata: The city’s rowing fraternity is up in arms over the installation of three fountains at Rabindra Sarobar and has called for their immediate removal as they threaten to disrupt the sole competitive rowing course in Bengal. But the CEO of Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) has ruled out any possibility of removing the fountains that have been set up to aerate the water and said the lake’s biodiversity was more important than any sport. Taken aback by the sight of the fountains that were installed without informing the three rowing clubs, their representatives and secretary of West Bengal Rowing Association (WBRA) wrote to KMDA CEO Antara Acharya on Wednesday, urging the agency to remove the fountains that was impeding the rowing course. Seven years ago, installation of another fountain next to an island near the Menoka cinema had already cut short the eight-decade-old course. That fountain installed by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) currently lies defunct. “Unless the fountains are removed, the Bengal selection trials for the Junior Nationals that are scheduled on November 17 will be jeopardised. This will spell doom for the future of the sport in Bengal,” said WBRA secretary Aniruddha Mukherjee. The rowing course at Rabindra Sarobar is currently 900m long. If one goes under the bridge, it gets extended to 1,000m. “We usually hold regatta races up to 800m. “The Junior National Championship was hosted at the lake in 2018 followed by the Asian Amateur Rowing Championship next year,” recounted Calcutta Rowing Club secretary Chandan Roychowdhury. Lake Club secretary Subrata Guha and Bengal Rowing Club secretary Ujaal Dugar are also incensed by the obstacles caused by the fountains. “The fountains can cause an accident, leading to damage of expensive equipment and injury to young rowers,” said Guha. Dugar further pointed out that when a fountain was proposed to be set up in this part of the lake seven years ago, the rowing fraternity had pointed out the problem to Firhad Hakim who was then in charge of KMDA and it had been relocated to the Menoka-end. “We were not even informed this time,” Guha said. While the club authorities and Mukherjee have sought a meeting with the KMDA CEO, the latter told TOI there was no question of removing the fountains as they were meant to aerate the water and save fish. “This has been done in consultation with the fisheries department to raise the oxygen level. Saving the lake’s biodiversity is more important. Rowing can wait,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rowers-want-fountains-removed-from-lake-kmda-says-biodiversity-more-important/articleshow/87318203.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC roots for electrical audit to be made a must||Mumbai: In the wake of last week’s blaze at the 60-storey One Avighna Park at Currey Road, in which one person died, the city fire brigade will write to the state Public Works Department asking it to have a panel of consultants who can conduct electrical audit of fully occupied buildings. Currently, Maharashtra Fire Act does not have a provision for mandatory electrical audits. Civic officials said that while a bi-yearly fire audit of buildings can be mandated, an electrical audit cannot be made compulsory under law and the PWD is the regulatory authority for it. So, the authorities are examining if a provision for the same can be made in the act. A Rs3crore proposal for ‘fire bikes’ which the fire brigade plans to purchase was approved at the standing committee on Wednesday. Officials said that 24 bikes are proposed to be got, one for each civic ward. The bike will act as the first responder as it would have an water tank attached to it. The bikes will help the fire brigade in responding to fire incidents, said Bhide. A senior fire brigade official said that 70% of fires that the city witnesses each year are sparked by a short circuit. The preliminary reason for the blaze at Avighna Park appears to be a short circuit, the official said. At Wednesday’s standing committee meeting, additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide, in charge of the fire brigade department, said currently there is no regulatory mechanism for electrical audits to be done in fully occupied buildings. “We plan to write to the PWD for the same, asking them to empanel consultants and accordingly electrical audits can be made compulsory. The fire management efficiency has gone up but there is the need to control any blaze at the inception stage itself. As a preventive measures, we conduct mock drills and regularly inspect buildings,” Bhide said, pointing out that in case of Avighna Park, its fire-fighting system was operational but did not start when the blaze erupted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-roots-for-electrical-audit-to-be-made-a-must/articleshow/87319098.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Aurangabad||Amendment to Nanded Gurdwara Act challenged, HC issues notices||Aurangabad: The Bombay high court at Aurangabad has directed notices to be issued to the central and the state government seeking their written response on a petition challenging the 2015 amendment to the Nanded Sikh Gurudwara Sachkhand Shri Hazur Apchalnagar Sahib Act 1956. One of the key amendments gives the state government the right to nominate the president of the Gurudwara from amongst the members of its elected board. The petition also comes ahead of the Nanded Sikh Gurudwara Board elections scheduled for March 2022. An HC division bench of Justice SV Gangapurwala and Justice RN Laddha granted 11 weeks time to the respondent governments to reply to the notices while scheduling the next date of hearing of the petition on January 6, 2022. The trustees of the Sachkhand Huzuri Khalsa Diwan, Nanded and former members of Nanded Sikh Gurudwara Sachkhand Shri Hazur Apchalnagar Sahib filed the petition through lawyer Ganesh Gadhe challenging the 2015 amendment introduced by the then Devendra Fadnavis led saffron alliance state government. The petitioners have contended that the 2015 amendment to the Act has changed the democratic set up of the election of the board president and has empowered the state government to appoint the president. Since the introduction of this amendment, the board has witnessed two elections for members as well as president, and on both the occasions, the then state government nominated two consecutive presidents of the board. Lawyer Gadhe pointed out that the 2015 amendment act still does not have an assent of the President of India, making it ultra-virus. The HC bench granted permission to add the Nanded Sikh Gurudwara Board as a party–respondent in the writ petition. "The petitioner is assailing the Nanded Sikh Gurudwara Sachkhand Shri Hazur Apchalnagar Sahib, Nanded (Amendment) Act, 2015. One of the grounds raised is that the Amendment Act does not have assent of the President (of India), whereas the Parent Act of 1956 has assent of the President. The Central Act is already in existence." When contacted, additional solicitor general of India Ajay Talhar said, "Any law or amendment or act enacted, if it is contrary to the constitutional provision, can be challenged at point of time for taking away constitutional rights. There is no time limit for it." Gadhe said, "By enacting a colorable legislation, the state government created a supremacy over the board of a minority religious institute and eventually infringed on the rights of minorities basically guaranteed by Article 26 of Constitution of India. For the last two terms the state government using this amendment has appointed only government nominees as President of the Board and deprived the rights of representatives of five Takhts of Gurdwaras including the Shiromani Parabandhak of Amritsar Gurdwara." Sardar Manjeet Singh, president of Sachkhand Hazuri Khalsa Diwan and one of the petitioners said, "The elections for the next board members as well as for its president are due for March 2022, and as the members of the board do not want their right to be further infringed by using the amendment, so they have challenged it."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/amendment-to-nanded-gurdwara-act-challenged-hc-issues-notices/articleshow/87320172.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation readies ghats for Chhath Puja rituals||KOLKATA: Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarobar will be spared of Chhath revellers for the second consecutive year. Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority has decided not to allow Chhath rituals in these lakes to honour a Calcutta High Court directive. Instead, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is making arrangements at multiple water bodies across the city, including the river, to ensure devotees are able to perform the Puja. A member in the KMC board of administrators (BoA), Debasish Kumar, on Wednesday said all the ghats along the Hooghly are being prepared for the Chhath devotees. “From Princep Ghat to Ratan Babur ghat — all ghats are being decked up for Chhath Puja. We are setting up special platforms for devotees to perform their rituals. At the same time, we need to be extra cautious about maintaining a bare minimum distance keeping in mind a rise in Covid graph,” said Kumar. According to a KMC parks and squares department official, the civic body along with cops will keep a vigil at all major ghats that include Bajekadamtolla ghat, Judges Ghat, Ahiritolla ghat, Doi Ghat (Kidderpore) among other ghats. “We need to keep a special vigil considering a spike in the Covid cases in the past two weeks,” the civic official said. The civic body wants the devotees to use ponds and waterbodies in their neighbourhoods, which will be converted into Chhathh ghats, to observe their rituals without travelling to Hooghly. “We have been creating special platforms at several locations. If need be, we shall add more ponds to the list of waterbodies,” said a civic official. The KMC parks and squares department identifies ponds and waterbodies located along EM Bypass, Behala, Tollygunge, Jadavpur, Cossipore, Dum Dum. The TMC ward coordinators have been asked to explore options of creating artificial ponds in their wards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-readies-ghats-for-chhath-puja-rituals/articleshow/87318216.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Nagpur||Fuel price impact: Construction cost up, builders say homes to get dearer||Nagpur: Diesel prices and a host of other factors have increased the cost of construction by Rs500 a square feet, which is expected to leave properties dearer, say builders.Independent sources in the home loan business say there has already been a 9-10% increase in prices of real estate in upper and upper middle class localities of the city. Another hike is expected if the rates do not stabilize soon.Builders mainly blame it on the fuel costs, which have disturbed the costing. As the situation is normalizing after Covid, the demand has gone up too. Competitive interest rates of less than 7% for home loans has also fuelled the demand. As it has spurred the real estate activities, the requirement of raw material has also gone up leading to a supply gap, said sources.Gaurav Agrawala, secretary of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), Nagpur chapter, shared a note which shows an average increase of 50% in less than a year.The cost of construction ranged from Rs1,300 to Rs1,500 a square feet earlier. This has now reached Rs1,800 to Rs2,200. The hike would be passed on to the buyers of even new units in the existing projects.An increase of Rs500 a square feet leads to a major hike in the final price. The entry level price in Nagpur would go up to Rs3,500 a square feet from Rs3,000-odd earlier, he said.Cement and steel are the two major components in the construction sector. According to the note, steel product rates have gone by 50% and it is 34% for cement.Another builder said prices haven’t been hiked yet, but it has left builders bleeding.Deepak Trivedi, a home loan consultant, said even before the Rs500 increase is fully passed on to the buyers, there has been a marginal hike already.For example rates in Shivaji Nagar are expected to be Rs8,000 to Rs9,000 a square feet, it is Rs7,000 to Rs8,000 in Laxmi Nagar, Rs8,000 to Rs8,500 in Dharampeth and around Rs6,000 in Wardhaman Nagar. The rates were less by 9-10% over a couple of months ago, he said.Manoj Rai of Bharat Parekh Homes, a consultancy firm, said low interest rates have spurred the demand. There are banks which are offering home loan for as low as 6.40%. This has increased the demand for housing, leaving its impact on the input costs.Rai said even the cost of open land, at the minimum level, has gone up touching Rs2,500/ sq ft in some parts of the city and outskirts. It was at Rs2,000 a square feet over a couple of months ago. Constructed property commands as much as Rs12,000 per square feet on the upper end, it had come down to Rs10,000 a square feet during the pandemic slump.Anil Nair of Pioneer Constructions said items across the board have become costlier due to increase in transportation cost. Even items like copper and sundry goods have become dearer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/fuel-price-impact-construction-cost-up-builders-say-homes-to-get-dearer/articleshow/87316935.cms||Shishir Arya

An officer said Goyal is of the view that in most cases lodging of FIRs over petty issues, results into separation of the couple followed by legal battles in family courts lasting for several years and having serious social as well psychological impact in the overall growth and development of their kids. “However, the instructions are clear that in the name of counselling, there should be no burking of work,” he said. When contacted, Goyal, citing Lalita Kumari judgment of Supreme Court, said police are given six week’s time to probe a complaint in cases of domestic violence and to counsel the couple.

---||Delhi||Civic bodies strengthen their infra to fumigate Delhi, RWAs not convinced||NEW DELHI: In the wake of rising dengue cases and intermittent rainfall, the municipal corporations have apparently had to increase the workforce for fumigation and to disseminate information about the vector-borne disease. East Delhi Municipal Corporation has added two more trucks to the pair that was spraying insecticide on wide roads. Fogging machines too have been increased from four to six in each ward. The civic body has redeployed 70 drivers engaged in garbage collection, 100 beldars and six jetting machines from the sanitation department for fogging work, especially at 12 vulnerable spots near the Yamuna river and the Uttar Pradesh border. An EDMC official said, “We requested the sanitation department to transfer the 70 drivers to the public health department to drive trucks mounted with fogging and jetting machines. We also transferred 100 nullah beldars to assist the field workers in the best possible manner.” The civic body also claimed to have ample stocks of larvicide and insecticide. “During the rains, we could not spray insecticides in the drains. We have now engaged jetting machines for the job,” said the official. RWAs, however, questioned the claims about fogging and alleged that it was being done just about twice a month, that too after petitioning the municipal councillors. The president of Medha Apartments RWA in Mayur Vihar I Extension said that the last fogging took place a month ago. “Neither EDMC nor Delhi government are conducting the fumigation drive seriously. We have been forced to get our own machines to spray insecticide at regular intervals,” he said. Jatin Sehgal, joint secretary, Citizens Welfare Association, Mukherjee Nagar, also claimed that fogging was carried out only after a request to municipal officials. South Delhi Municipal Corporation has similarly deployed 2,500 field workers and domestic mosquito breeding checkers in the anti-dengue fight, primarily at 35 sites, including Okhla, Shaheen Bagh, Tajpur Pahari and the areas around the Yamuna. “Because water collection helps mosquito breeding, we are holding meetings with RWAs to request them to prevent water accumulation in their localities,” said an SDMC official. Another official pleaded helplessness at being unable to cover all areas in each ward in a 7-day cycle due to limited staff and machinery. “That is the reason we are concentrating on areas reporting many dengue cases. However, residents can approach us in case they require immediate help,” the official said. In north Delhi, the municipality checks for mosquito breeding at government offices, big buildings and construction sites every Saturday. “We have visited such complexes 29,672 times since June,” a north corporation official claimed. “We have conducted 4,973 meetings so far and issued 51,972 notices to those who have failed to check mosquito breeding on their premises.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/civic-bodies-strengthen-their-infra-to-fumigate-city-rwas-not-convinced/articleshow/87319135.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 4,000 buildings without fire NOC||AHMEDABAD: The state government on Thursday submitted before the Gujarat high court that there are over 4,000 buildings in municipalities and municipal corporations, which are required to have fire NOC but do not possess valid fire NOC. The authorities intensified efforts to ensure fire NOC in buildings, hospitals and education institutes after the high court’s directions to enforce the fire safety norms in strict manner after the fire incidents in two Covid hospitals took toll of total 13 patients last year in Ahmedabad and Rajkot. For enforcing the installation of fire prevention systems in buildings, the government said that it has taken action against 1,285 hospitals in last three months for not having fire NOC. As many as 1,055 hospitals were issued notices, 187 hospitals were sealed and 43 hospitals have been closed till date. There were 1,116 hospitals in municipal corporation areas and 169 hospitals in municipality limits which faced action for not obeying the fire safety norms. The municipal corporations have devised systems to ensure regular renewal of fire NOC for buildings every 11 months. The state government and the corporations have, however, expressed their inabilities to carry out intense drive following certain hindrances, mainly the lack of zeal on part of the occupiers of the buildings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/4k-buildings-without-fire-noc/articleshow/87346043.cms||---

The CM said, “Our government has paved the path of development in the state as before 2017, either the schemes were not implemented or their benefits rarely reached the people.” “Our government not only implemented new schemes but also focused on implementing them so that their benefits could reach the beneficiaries,” he added. The CM also inaugurated/laid the foundation stone of 144 development and medical projects worth Rs 1,123 crore on the occasion. Emphasizing the fact that the state government is working with full dedication to fulfill the goals, the CM said, “We fulfilled our promise of building a grand Ram Temple and now others are claiming to be ‘honest devotees’ of Lord Ram.” “The previous governments neglected development and turned the state into a centre of riots and chaos. Before 2017, curfews were imposed during the festive season as the previous governments did not respect the religious sentiments of people,” he added. The CM said after 2017, poor people got free ration, power supply, education and healthcare facilities. He also highlighted the improved road infrastructure. He said, “Earlier, I used to reach from Gonda to Devipatan in 3.5 hours, but now the distance is covered in only one hour”. Reiterating his resolve to work for the betterment of farmers, the CM said, “Those who pretend to be the ‘well-wishers’ of the farmers should know that the government has made a record payment of Rs 1.44 lakh crore to over 45 lakh cane farmers in the state.” Unleashing a scathing attack on the Congress, the CM accused it of doing nothing despite being in the government for many years. N”o good work was done for the welfare of the people of the state as Congress was only indulged in corruption, “he pointed out. Medical education minister Suresh Kumar Khanna, social welfare minister Ramapati Shastri, minister of MSME Sidharth Nath Singh were also present on the occasion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/cm-lays-foundation-of-gonda-medical-college/articleshow/87318281.cms||Arjumand Bano

But, this noble object is being defeated by some traders and hulling agents,” observed the judge.The court had earlier directed the senior regional manager of the TNCSC, Thanjavur to appear before court to explain the ground realities and to ascertain as to how the traders and others indulge in irregularities by misusing the scheme. The official who appeared before the court placed certain materials explaining the manner in which some traders are misusing the scheme.Taking cognizance of the submissions, the judge gave the direction to the senior regional manager to file a detailed report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/irregularities-affecting-objective-of-pds-hc/articleshow/87319131.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp to ease tax burden for illegal houses below 120 sqm||Thiruvananthapuram: In an unprecedented move, the city corporation has decided to tag residential constructions with variations from permissible norms below 120 sqm as unauthorised and levy normal tax from such constructions which are pending clearance from regional town planner and Kerala coastal zone management authority. The files related to these constructions had come up in the recently concluded adalats which were organised in main office and zonal offices. The officials had reported that some of the applications could not be granted building numbers legally owing to slight variations from permissible norms and such files were considered in the adalat. The corporation council has now decided to give such constructions U/A number and collect normal tax. The usual procedure has been to issue temporary numbers to unauthorised constructions and levy three times the actual tax annually. The corporation officials said that such an exception is being made for constructions under residential category below 120sq.m since the beneficiaries will not be able to bear the huge tax burden. “Many of the applications which came up in the adalat came within the 60 sqm category. Those were small dwellings and to levy three times the tax did not seem fair. That is why we have decided to allot U/A numbers at normal tax rates,” said a corporation official. Mayor Arya Rajendran said the files will be forwarded to the state government for special sanction. “Legally corporations cannot grant such tax relaxations, however, some of these buildings were built either as part of housing schemes or come under buildings with small dimensions. Although there are violations, it cannot be regarded as of serious nature. In order to alleviate the tax penalty for such constructions and to help such beneficiaries with proper building numbers, we will get special sanction from the government,” said the mayor. The council meeting held recently approved the agenda although a discussion could not be held on this owing to the tension that prevailed in the council. The city corporation is compiling building permit applications for residential constructions below 120 sqm which are pending clearance or no objection certificate from other government bodies. The applications which were received at the town planning adalat are being processed this way. The civic body will process such applications in respective zonal offices following the adalat. Awareness for submitting applications will be created among the applicants. A nodal officer will also be deputed for the initiative. The mayor had said that heads of standing committees, officials with the engineering section will directly supervise processing of such files.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-to-ease-tax-burden-for-illegal-houses-below-120-sqm/articleshow/87288938.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The court was hearing the bail petitions of Starwin alias Kumar and his wife Sudha alias Sudharshini alias Kugandhini who were arrested by the Q Branch police in Madurai district on June 30. According to the prosecution, the 23 Lankans came to Tuticorin district on April 28 without any proper documents. Subsequently, they reached Madurai district and were made to stay near the Kappalur industrial estate area. They were staying in Madurai for 40 days and were planning to leave for Canada with the help of a few other agents. Based on a tip-off, the Q Branch police arrested the petitioners and several other people who helped the Lankan nationals. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that they are husband and wife and having a 2-year-old child. He further submitted that Kumar is an Indian citizen and his wife is a Lankan citizen. The additional public prosecutor submitted that Kumar is an accused in the case registered by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) at Bengaluru. His wife is a Lankan national and she does not have any passport. As per the Foreigners Act, if the people are illegal migrants, then the courts shall specifically order to keep them in detention centres, unless the competent authority passes any order under the Act. Taking into account the fact that the couple had a 2-year-old child, justice B Pugalendhi granted bail to the woman. However, the judge directed to keep her in a special camp at Trichy district until further orders, since she is a Lankan national and had entered India as an illegal migrant. The judge had dismissed the bail plea of Kumar since he was an accused in a case registered by the NIA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-grants-bail-to-sl-woman-denies-it-to-indian-husband/articleshow/87319134.cms||---
---||Delhi||Row at SDMC as councillor highlights plight of DBCs||New Delhi: A high drama ensued inside the House of the south corporation on Wednesday when Congress councillor Abhishek Dutt tried to showcase the plight of domestic breeding checkers (DBC) by bringing a fogging machine in the meeting. A minor scuffle broke out between the Congress functionary and the security guards when Dutt was stopped from carrying the machine inside the meeting venue. However, he later did it forcefully. “This machine is an extremely heavy machine making the fumigation process very difficult for DBC workers. Sometimes houses are on different floors and the worker has to carry this all the way up; it is inhuman,” said Dutt, the councillor from Andrews Ganj. Opposition members from Aam Aadmi Party also shouted slogans against the mayor leading to early adjournment of the House. Congress functionaries demanded that the DBC workers be paid Rs 21,060 at par with the north corporation and that more workers be hired and allocated in all the wards under the south corporation. “Misbehaving with any security staff inside the House is not allowed for anyone. We will take action if we get a written complaint in this matter against those who were involved,” said south corporation mayor Mukesh Suryan. Recently, domestic breeding checkers from across Delhi held a protest outside the civic body’s headquarters demanding regularisation of their jobs. The workers have threatened an indefinite strike in case their demands are not met in the next two weeks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/row-at-sdmc-as-councillor-highlights-plight-of-dbcs/articleshow/87319145.cms||---

The police said that she was questioned and her arrest was recorded. The BJP has been on an indefinite strike mainly demanding the arrest of Santhi. Sreekaryam police, Kazhakootam police and Nemom police had earlier arrested a chainman, an office attendant and a cashier following the fund fraud at Nemom, Sreekaryam and Attipra zonal offices. Even after the main accused’s arrest the BJP did not end the strike on Tuesday. BJP councillors said that they would conclude the strike only after the special council which is slated to discuss the fund fraud on Wednesday. However, a few BJP councillors were arrested and removed from the council hall. When the council meets on Wednesday, around 16 BJP councillors would be on hunger strike. Meanwhile, Sunitha, the first accused in the Nemom fund fraud case was granted bail by Neyyattinkara temporary judicial first class magistrate court on Tuesday. Vanchiyoor Sivasankaran Nair who appeared for Sunitha contended that despite police questioning her for two days, they could not come up with any incriminating evidence. He also cited that Sunitha had been in service for eight years and not for once was she reprimanded or served a memo for official misconduct. She has been directed not to leave Nemom station premises and will have to appear in front of the investigation officer on Thursday and Friday between 4pm and 5 pm. In the complaint filed by the corporation secretary to the police, it was cited that revenue income collected over a period of 25 days between January 24, 2020 and July 14, 2021 was missing from the corporation’s bank account. Corporation secretary in his complaint demanded a probe against both Santhi and Sunitha for forgery, embezzlement and cheating.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/fund-fraud-former-charge-officer-arrested/articleshow/87288944.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Schools in Kolkata invite parents to check campus measures||KOLKATA: Some city schools are ready to reopen with new arrangements in place and are now inviting parents to campus to see for themselves if the school is safe enough for kids. Some schools are holding virtual workshops to inform students of the dos and don’ts, and there are some who have sent their own SOPs to parents and students and asked them to prepare accordingly till fresh inclusions and deletions are made when the state and council or board SOPs come. Several private schools have communicated with parents and are planning to circulate an online form before reopening physical classes and some have already started collecting information regarding the health situation of students. South City International School and St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, have called parents to the campuses on Thursday to take a look at things. Parents of kids in classes X and XII at SCIS will visit on Thursday while parents of those in classes IX and XI will visit on Friday. “We have the exam venue ready for the first semester starting on November 22 for ISC and November 29 for ICSE in our auditorium and we will take parents to see that before they move on to classrooms,” said principal John Bagul. The Shyamnagar school with show parents the sanitisation practices and other rules being followed. The Barrackpore branch of the school shared a video with parents and started online meetings with parents and students of classes IX-XII about the protocols, said Janet Gasper Chowdhury, president of the St Augustine’s Education Society that runs the two schools. On the weekend before the actual reopening, students of Rammohan Mission, and their parents, will attend a workshop where the new rules will be explained by principal Sujoy Biswas. “We will ask students to wear double masks on campus and request parents to encourage kids to keep the masks on at home for long stretches so they don’t feel fidgety while in school,” Biswas said. The consent form that many schools have sent to parents may be part of the SOP that the government issues for reopening schools. While CM Mamata Banerjee has announced that schools will reopen from November 16 and classes IX to XII will be the first to have physical classes, schools said they will not pressure parents into sending children to school. In many schools, all the four years will not be called in immediately after reopening. There are some, like La Martiniere for Boys, who will start with classes IX and XI. “Those who are taking the board exams will be called in only for the test because we don’t want to expose them immediately,” said acting principal John Stephen.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/schools-invite-parents-to-check-campus-measures/articleshow/87318287.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Based on the recommendations of the technical committee that was constituted to find the reasons for the outage and suggest measures, the department submitted an action taken report to the cabinet on Wednesday. The committee had submitted its report in November 2020 and mentioned that there was no sabotage involved and that the outage was due to cascade tripping. The department said that the SOPs have been revised to handle outages more efficiently, insulator strings in over 400 transmission lines have been replaced and thermo scanning cameras have been installed to detect hotspots in the lines. “A detailed presentation was made before the cabinet today. The department has also taken steps to scale up the infrastructure to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future,” said an official. The report mentions that the government should employ more advanced systems to detect faults in the network and that the current systems are inadequate. The committee had also suggested that the protocol laid down by the Centre should be followed to avoid attempts of cyberattacks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-sops-revised-to-prevent-oct-2020-like-power-outages/articleshow/87319143.cms||---
---||Delhi||35k parents to act as ‘school mitras’ to aid kids||New Delhi: Not just school management committee (SMC) members, the Delhi government schools will now have 35,000 more parents as School Mitras. They will be part of the Parents Samvaad programme that was launched by the government on Thursday to connect parents and schools so that children can benefit from better education and better parenting. During the launch, education minister Manish Sisodia urged parents “not to treat their children as bosses”. He called the programme the world’s largest and most unique parent outreach programme. The School Mitra and SMC members will directly connect the parents of 18 lakh students with the schools and collaborate with the teachers to improve the children’s learning. Each SMC member and School Mitra will connect with 50 parents in their immediate vicinity monthly through a toll-free number provided by Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights. They will receive theme-based training and interact with the rest about parenting and education, taking up one theme every month. Parents will be advised on how to communicate with their child, how to determine what a child is learning, what support should be provided on a regular basis, and so on. A pilot project was held at 40 schools in Southeast and East districts and the interactions have led to a decrease in dropout rates, an increase in attendance, easy delivery of study materials to students even during the pandemic, monitoring of studies and counselling. On Thursday, a panel discussion was held with the stakeholders who were part of the pilot programme. “People do not understand the true meaning of parenting. In the name of parenting, we treat children as if we are their bosses, expecting them to do what we want. We don’t, on the other hand, do anything in the name of parenting,” Sisodia said at the launch. “This practice will be eradicated through the Parents Samvaad programme. School Mitras will use it to improve communication between parents and school.” Parents will be given a chart to fill up to help them understand their children better. The information will be related to a child’s interests, if parents have checked children’s activities, etc. “I will check during my surprise visits if the parents are properly filling in the details. If even one parent does not fill this chart, I will think the programme is not a success,” said Sisodia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/35k-parents-to-act-as-school-mitras-to-aid-kids/articleshow/87346065.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Allahabad||Learning, memory are enhanced during breeding season in Neelkanth: AU study||Prayagraj: In the backdrop of the fact that the brain of an Indian tropical bird, Coracias benghalensis, commonly known as Indian Roller or ‘Neelkanth”, is quite identical to humans, a team of experts from the Neurobiology laboratory of the department of zoology, University of Allahabad have for the first time revealed that during breeding season, the learning and memory of the bird is enhanced enormously and leads to perfect identification of partner for courtship behaviour and mating, nest building, territorial marking and parental care. The study, led by Prof KP Singh and his co-worker Kirti Ojha, has been published in an international journal “Zoology” (published by Elsevier) having a high impact factor. “This bird has two reproductive phases, breeding (May to July when they lay their eggs and hatch them) and non-breeding (rest of the months of the year). During breeding season, the male bird displays a dramatic courtship dance in mid-air endowed with acrobatic performances to attract females by flying high in the air with stretched wings and it rolls and tends to fall in a circular pattern along with screaming and cacophony sound. This peculiar behaviour is not performed during the non-breeding and resting phase of the bird’s life,” explains Prof Singh. The researchers linked this phenomenon with the learning and memory centre of the bird’s brain, the hippocampal complex, which is similar to the hippocampus of mammals including humans. It was further revealed that during the breeding phase of the life, volume of the hippocampus is increased, additional neuronal connections or circuits (dendrites) of various neuronal types are developed and most importantly “dendritic spines” are substantially increased. “It is these ‘dendritic spines’ which are scientifically referred to as ‘memory molecules’. It is assumed that all connections of the brain activate during breeding season, but a massive change is found in the structure and function of the hippocampus due to which learning capacity is increased many fold and leads towards permanent memory in the form of ‘sexual imprinting’ for mate selection and mating,” said Prof Singh. The present study was performed in the least number of birds after due permission from the higher authorities of the forest department, Lucknow and approval of Institutional Animal Ethics Committee at AU. “We have to understand that since the hippocampal complex of the bird is analogous to the human brain, hence it is postulated that during human pregnancy, substantive changes in the mother’s brain are expected,” explained Prof Singh. At present, Prof Singh’s laboratory is exploring the intricate ambiguity of prenatal learning or learning potential of foetus brain in the mother’s womb.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/learning-memory-are-enhanced-during-breeding-season-in-neelkanth-au-study/articleshow/87318291.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Gatta, batasha & khilone losing taste this festive season, demand low||PRAYAGRAJ: Rising prices of sugar, coal and unavailability of workers have left the makers of traditional Diwali sweets, like gatta (sweet cubes), batasha (sugar candy sweet) and khilone (sugar toys), in a piquant situation during this festive season. Moreover, the demand for traditional Diwali sweets – sugar toys and sugar candy - has also fallen among buyers forcing makers to restrict the production of traditional Diwali sweetmeats. The edible sugar crafted into animal shapes popularly known as khilone, batasha and gatta have always been an inescapable part of the Diwali festival since decades. In fact, these traditional Diwali sweetmeats are must for devotees while offering prayers to Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi. However, makers of traditional sweetmeats in Sangam city claimed that the demand of traditional Diwali sweets has fallen up to 50 percent in the Prayagraj and adjoining markets. Ankit Sharma, owner of the traditional Diwali sweets making unit, told TOI that rising prices of sugar and coal have hit the production of these mandatory sweetmeats hard. "Since the prices of raw materials used for making traditional sweets has gone up, there was less margin for the manufacturers. Secondly, the strength of buyers was also declining by every passing day," he added. “Gone are the days when we had to engage six to eight furnaces to meet the demand of khilone, gatta and batasha, but now, they are using two or three furnaces to make the traditional sweets”. Moreover, shortage of coal has also hit the traditional sweet industry hard. Rajiv Sharma, who runs his sweet production unit at Batashamandi area of the city, says "Since the margin for makers has declined, we are too thinking for other options." He said that apart from rising prices of sugar and coal, the shortage of labourers (workers) has also hit the industry hard. “Now it has become difficult to arrange workers for preparations of sweets as it was very hard work of eight to nine hours to shape and prepare khilone and batasa," said Rajiv, adding, "we are finding it difficult to arrange labourers in the festive season." Moreover, the raw materials used for preparation of traditional sweets including lemon salt and other acids have also become expensive. “While lights are the main attraction of Diwali, the wide array of sweets always seem to steal the spotlight at homes during the festive season," said sweetmeat sellers in the markets "Quintessential festive desserts like ladoo and barfi currently draw the platter of most households, and while they might be associated with prayers and celebrations, but the fact is that none is as significant as heel, batasha, gatta and khilone. However, the sale of these sweetmeats are declining for the past few years," they added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/gatta-batasha-khilone-losing-taste-this-festive-season-demand-low/articleshow/87318298.cms||Kapil Dixit

However, officials and healthcare staff said that vaccine hesitancy is still prevalent at the grassroots level. Door-to-door vaccination for those above 18 years had recently begun to ensure better vaccination coverage in both rural and urban areas. “At all 31 urban primary health centres (UPHCs) in the corporation limits, a team is sent every day for door-to-door vaccination in clusters such that areas in one particular ward is concentrated on,” said a health official. In the past week, around 1,000 of the average 3,000 Covid-19 daily vaccinations were achieved through door-to-door coverage. Some hamlets and panchayats in rural areas are also close to achieving 100% vaccination. Meanwhile, PHC nurses have been providing Covid-19 vaccination by going door-to-door. “It is especially challenging now as there is hesitancy and reluctance as we try to convince someone to take the jab. Because it is not mandatory, not everyone co-operates despite being told how it can help keep them safe,” said a village health nurse. All healthcare staff in city and rural areas have been given daily vaccination targets. Healthcare workers said that despite awareness campaigns, there is some fear of adverse effects of the vaccine. “Few are still insisting on not taking the jab citing misconceptions or what they heard from friends or family. Perhaps, with schools reopening for Class I to VIII, more parents will come forward to get jabbed,” said a staffer. Nurses and healthcare workers said that the support of officials from village panchayat, local bodies and other departments has been helpful in increasing coverage. In Madurai district, 19,57,638 have taken the Covid-19 vaccine as on Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/22-madurai-city-wards-close-to-registering-100-vaccination/articleshow/87319142.cms||---

Monitoring officer for Madurai and principal secretary for tourism, culture and HR&CE, B Chandramohan inspected the spot along with the district collector S Aneesh Sekhar and Madurai Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan on Wednesday. He said that they had decided to construct a food court at a cost of Rs2 crore and the authorities have been asked to work on a revised estimate, which could be a little higher.Allocation of the shops and the types of food would be decided as per the HR&CE rules, he said. Ever since the check dam was constructed across the Vaigai river near the AV Bridge in the city, and water was allowed to flow into the teppakulam through its original supply channels, the tank has been holding water throughout the year. For people in Madurai who have no place to spend their evening except a handful of parks, the tank with water which resulted in a cool breeze throughout the evening, came as a boon.Push carts and vendors selling puttu, vadas, boiled gram, pineapple, samosas, parottas and ice creams are a big hit among the locals. Raman, one of the vendors, said that he makes a profit of not less than Rs 1,000 during the weekends selling a variety of local food items on his push cart. This is said to be the reason why the HR&CE decided to put its empty land into use for the foor court.Chandramohan also inspected the Meenakshi theatre in Madurai, which is a temple property and retrieved recently, where plans are afoot to convert it into a mandapam. The authorities have been asked to study the feasibility.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hr-ce-dept-to-set-up-food-park-near-madurai-teppakulam/articleshow/87319168.cms||---

According to the proposal of SDMC’s Naming and Renaming of Street Committee, the stretch from 40 feet Punjabi Market Road, Shyam Nagar going up to Ravi Nagar 80 feet road in Vishnu Garden will now be named as “Satpal Kharwal Pali Marg”. According to the proposal, the family of Kharwal had urged the civic body to name a street after him as a form of homage to the late councillor. The corporation has the power to decide the name of streets and small roads under its jurisdiction after eminent personalities. As the country is celebrating 75 years of Independence, an intersection in Naseer Pur village has been named after freedom fighter Choudhary Jeet Ram Girsaji who was part of the Azad Hind Fauz led by Subhash Chandra Bose. The length of “Freedom Fighter Choudhary Jeet Ram Girsa Chowk” is 65 metres. Similarly, a proposal has been passed to name another road in the same area as ‘Lieutenant Colonel Gaurav Solanki Marg’. Solanki, who was an Army officer, died while fighting in Congo, South Africa when he was part of the UN Peace Force in 2019, says the proposal. The length of this road is 225 metres. Both the proposals were moved by BJP functionary and former councillor Kamaljeet Sehrawat in 2019 but were awaiting approval since then. Meanwhile, the civic body has also named 31 other infrastructures such as parks, roads and intersections in South Delhi areas. These include christening of 15 roads. According to Mukesh Suryan, the south corporation mayor, this is one of the highest number of naming proposals passed by the House in the last few years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/roads-named-after-ex-councillor-freedom-fighter/articleshow/87319166.cms||---

---||Kolkata||New daily Covid cases in Kolkata since Puja stay over 200; doctors fear further spike||KOLKATA: The number of fresh Covid cases in Kolkata has constantly been above 200 since Durga Puja. Before the festival and the shopping frenzy, daily new cases had been in 100s or lower, and health experts had warned of a surge as revellers threw caution to the wind. Though the the current rising trend in the city is not alarming yet, doctors fear a further rise in cases in about three to four weeks. “Despite the rising cases, we are not witnessing an abrupt spike. But we are yet to see the actual reflection of the kind of congregation there was before and after the festival. We will have to wait for about seven days,” said Anirban Dalui, public health specialist at Swasthya Bhawan. In Kolkata, cases started touching the 200-mark on October 13, which was Ashtami. Since then, the count has been above 200. From 1,591 active cases in Kolkata on October 13, the number rose to 2,087 on Wednesday. “This spike in number was expected because people had violated all Covid rules during the festival. And with Diwali and Kali Puja ahead, we should not be surprised by a further escalation in Covid-positive numbers,” said infectious diseases control specialist Deb Kishore Gupta. On Wednesday, Bengal reported 973 fresh cases, of which 273 were from Kolkata. North 24 Parganas, which had been the epicentre along with Kolkata during the second surge, reported 159 cases. Although the overall positivity rate for the state is still below 2%, a recent sero surveillance report by the health department revealed positivity higher than 3% is four districts. “For districts, we could start seeing a sharper spike post events like Kali Puja and Jagaddhatri Puja due to mixing of people where the vaccinated number is lower than in the city,” said Dalui. The health department had, however, kept up its inoculation drive even during the festival. “We must adopt all Covid-appropriate behaviour even if we have received the vaccine as there is still a population at risk, especially the elderly and children who are yet to be vaccinated,” said Gupta. Healthcare experts hope the vaccine coverage will act as a shield against a sharp surge like the one during the second wave. “We are keeping all our Covid infrastructure ready as we might encounter a further rise not only in the city, but in some districts as well,” said a senior health department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/new-daily-cases-in-city-since-puja-stay-over-200-docs-fear-further-spike/articleshow/87318322.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Bijnor superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh said prima facie, family tiff appeared to be the reason behind the extreme step taken by Punit Kumar, a resident of Thhat Jat village. Singh said they have recovered the pistol and were probing events that could have led to the incident as Punit, who had been with the MLA for 10 years, was under stress. Puneet, who is survived by his wife and two children, was rushed to hospital but could not survive. Police claimed Puneet’s family members have not filed any complaint thus far. Yet to come to terms with the loss, none from his family uttered a single word. Reacting to the incident, MLA’s son Priyankar Rana, said, "Puneet belonged to my village and was like our family member. He worked in our house and was upset over division of property with his brothers. Puneet was with me on Tuesday. We attended a programme at Jaitara village. But he left for his house in the afternoon, saying his wife was unwell. I was to attend a meeting in our public school, where he shot himself dead. I was busy attending a meeting at the time of the incident. He was my confidant.

---||Kolkata||Activists probing EKW bird deaths assaulted||Kolkata: Two nature activists were reportedly assaulted at East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW), when they went to investigate complaints about birds being killed by bheri owners. The activists have lodged a case at the Narendrapur police station and reported the matter to the East Kolkata Wetland Management Authority. The alleged assault took place between Nurtala and Goalbati bheris under Narendrapur police station on October 24, when Meghna Banerjee and Suvrajyoti Chatterjee—members of environment action group PUBLIC—went to check reports of birds being poisoned in the bheris. “We had heard migratory birds were being fed poisoned fish and killed off and went to investigate whether it was true or not. While there, some villagers confronted us and started to assault me. When Meghna recorded the attack, one person picked up a large stone and would have hurled it at her had it not been for our driver, who intervened,” said Chatterjee. It was PUBLIC that had filed a PIL in the 1990s against the encroachment of the wetlands in the belt. This PIL had led to EKW’s protection and subsequent listing of it as a Ramsar site. PUBLIC founder Bonani Kakkar recalled having seen birds being similarly killed six years ago. “When the bheris are drained to remove the siltation and increase the depth, the fish that remain are poisoned. These are then left for birds to consume. The dead birds are collected and their intenstines removed before the flesh is cooked for consumption. We had lodged a complaint at that time, following which three persons were held. But nothing seems to have changed,” rued Kakkar. EKW is home to multiple species of birds and it also attracts migratory birds in large numbers. Though wetland activists have for long been calling for demarcation of the EKW boundary and building a community of friends of the wetlands in the local population on the lines of Van Sahayak or forest support staff, who live in the buffer zone and help protect the forest, there has been no action on these fronts. EKW chief technical officer K Balamurugan said a campaign would be launched to make villagers aware of the law and penalties for violation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/activists-probing-ekw-bird-deaths-assaulted/articleshow/87319208.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Various members of the examination reforms committee said that a definite decision can be taken only after Diwali vacations, looking at the number of Covid-19 cases as well as the vaccination status of students. Mahesh Kakade, director of Board of Examination and Evaluation, said, “As per what the minister (Uday Samant, Higher and Technical Education) said, we are also checking out the feasibility of conducting offline examinations. But the final decision would come after Diwali. We would need examination centres in various places. And it is possible that an alternative to online examination too might need to be given to some students. There is a meeting on Wednesday about the examination where we will discuss various ways, like the possibility of increasing centres, of ensuring the integrity of the exam if it is held in different centres, and the pattern of examination.” Sudhakar Jadhavar, a member of the exam reforms committee at SPPU, also said that among the matters to be discussed is the option of keeping some part of the examination offline while some can be either online or on an assignment basis. “We cannot think of a three-hour examination at the moment. What we can have is some part of the exam to be held offline which consists of descriptive questions. Once the Diwali vacation is over, we will check the Covid-19 cases We will also check the percentage of students vaccinated. If the cases are low and vaccination is high, we can get some part of the exams conducted offline,” he added. Not All Can Attempt In-Person Assessment Most students still want online exams For offline exams, the university must have centres outside its Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar jurisdictions It will assess students staying in their native districts, as hostels have not yet opened Online examinations must also be an alternative, as many students stay out of the state and country Efforts are being made to at least keep some part of the three-hour examination in the offline mode quote I think the best way out will be to keep the exams online this semester and go offline from the next semester. Since all our classes have been held online, and since most students are still in their home cities, international flights are not yet completely functional, and hostels are also closed, best would be to have online exams Krishna Sathe, a student||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/sppu-plans-for-offline-exams-decision-after-post-diwali-covid-situation/articleshow/87290073.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Delhi||At 14.6 degrees Celsius, Delhi sees coldest night of the season||NEW DELHI: There is a nip in the air in Delhi as the night temperature dipped to 14.6 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal, on Tuesday. It was the season’s lowest minimum temperature so far. Met officials said cold north-westerly winds from snow-capped mountains were causing the temperature to drop. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the temperature is likely to touch 13 degrees Celsius this week. Before this, the lowest minimum temperature was recorded at 16 degrees Celsius on October 21 this year. Apart from Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station, the minimum temperature dipped below 15 degrees Celsius at some other stations too. The night temperature was reported at 14.1 degrees Celsius at Mungeshpur, 14.3 degrees Celsius at Ridge and 14.9 degrees Celsius at Jafarpur. The maximum temperature also witnessed a dip as it was recorded at 28.2 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal. A met official said, “The cold winds from the snow-capped Himalayan region led to a drop in the minimum temperature. The temperature is likely to hover around 14 degrees Celsius for the next few days and it may dip further to 13 degrees Celsius on November 1.” Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said, “The night temperature is likely to drop marginally in the next few days. The relative cooler winds are not allowing temperatures to rise. Though a western disturbance is predicted to approach on November 1, its impact would not be much in the region.” Palawat added, “When a western disturbance affects the region, induced cyclonic circulation over northern plains causes winds to rotate in anticlockwise. It results in the change of wind direction from north-westerly to south-easterly or south-westerly, which are warm and humid winds, causing marginal rise in the minimum temperature. After the impact of western disturbance is over, the wind direction is again changed to north-westerly. If the strong western disturbance causes fresh snowfall in the region, cold north-westerly winds cause further drop in the temperature.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/at-14-6-degrees-celsius-capital-sees-coldest-night-of-the-season/articleshow/87319204.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The court has asked AMC to terminate the contract if there are inefficient or unqualified people or technicians in the laboratories and fresh appointments should be made of qualified and efficient staff. The court also noticed that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) was provided faulty data all these years. After perusal of JTF’s report, the high court observed, “It is very disturbing to note that the laboratories of the STPs run and managed by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation were found indulging in manipulation of records.” The court recorded JTF’s observation that the data of analysis entered in the record book indicated number of duplications and a typical repetitive trend. “It is also very shocking to note that all the employees at the laboratories are ill-trained and have no idea about anything,” the court further said, criticizing the insubstantial monitoring mechanism at the STPs. The court said that the laboratories are manned by contractors and the reality caught even the AMC by surprise. It further observed, “It appears that the laboratories are not at all functioning in the manner as the law expects such laboratories to function. “In fact, it is the duty of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to keep a close watch on such laboratories because the board would be relying upon data that the laboratories may be furnishing to it.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/shocked-by-false-data-in-stp-labs/articleshow/87318359.cms||---
---||Mumbai||NCB misled court in Aryan Khan’s remand application: Counsel||MUMBAI: Senior counsel Amit Desai argued in the Bombay high court on Wednesday that the arrests of Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha in the cruise liner drug bust case was illegal given the rules and judgments concerning contraband seizures of small quantities. He cited a Supreme Court ruling that deprecated unwarranted arrests saying they cause “humiliation’’ and a 2014 landmark apex court ruling in Arnesh Kumar which enunciated the principle and sought mandatory enforcement of section 41A for “all offences that attract less than 7 years’ jail term’’. He then cited a Andhra Pradesh high court judgment to say that section 41A applies to cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act too. “We (Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant) are arrested for an offence of consumption that has not been committed,” said Desai, pointing out that they could only be accused of having an intention to consume. Justice Nitin Sambre will continue hearing their bail pleas on Thursday. Desai also pointed to the bail granted to two co-accused Avin Sahu and Manish Rajgaria in the same case following the October 2 raid at the cruise terminal, There was recovery of 2.4gm of charas from one, and none from the other, NCB said. Desai said on principles of parity since it involves a question of liberty, it can be looked at. He said the heart of the case is the conspiracy charge. “NCB misled the court in its first remand application, saying they were arrested for conspiracy though the arrest memo shows no arrest for conspiracy.” He said “conspiracy” defined by jurists requires a meeting of minds prior to an act. For example, he said if two burglars break into the same house independently at the same time, it is not a conspiracy. Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi for Aryan Khan added that in his arrest memo, “there is no mention of any recovery” and a joint possession cannot, in law, be shown. Appearing for Merchant, Desai said the cases involving the trio are “individual and unconnected to others”. He argued that “there can be no case of consumption either. Consume is a verb. Their case was at best of intention to consume which is not an offence under section 27 of the NDPS Act”. He said there should have been no arrest because Aryan had no drugs in his possession; NCB can, at best, establish possession of 6 gm by Arbaaz; and no medical tests were done to show consumption. Desai said the arrest memo was identical for Khan and Merchant. He said in the remand application for Aryan, “they dumped…recoveries from others who were not even arrested at the time”. Desai said Aryan, Arbaaz and Munmun were arrested for identical offences of sections 8(c) read with 20(b) (for possession) and 27 (for consumption). Section 28 (attempt) and 29 (conspiracy) were not on the horizon, which means maximum punishment would be one year. He said there was no case for a conspiracy as they had no agreement. Since these were individual acts of alleged possession and consumption, NCB officers had a duty to first issue notice instead of effecting arrest, he said. “What is recovered?

It directed the Ahmedabad municipal commissioner to implement these measures.  The high court also asked the chief secretary to extend all cooperation and remain in touch with the municipal commissioner in getting the task done “with a view to make a sincere attempt to bring around some better and positive results”. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati passed orders for cleaning and rejuvenating the river after taking took suo motu cognizance of the malfunctioning of the sewage treatment plant (STP), from where improperly treated water is directly discharged into the river. The court’s interim directions have come on the basis of a report furnished by the Joint Task Force (JTF) and amicus curiae, advocate Hemang Shah. The HC has directed the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to immediately identify unauthorized industrial wastewater connections and said it is a must to achieve good results. The court cited JTF’s findings that the mega pipeline, which takes industrial waste from the common effluent treatment plant (CETP) to the river, has few unauthorised sewage connections and AMC’s gutter lines have illegal connections of industrial wastewater disposal. “We direct that the identification and disconnection of all such unauthorized connections be done by the custodian/owner of the respective pipeline network. The actions and the outcome shall be shared among the stakeholders from time to time,” the court ordered. The court also ordered all CETPs to ensure operational OCEMS with connectivity to Gujarat Pollution Control Board’s portal. They will have to list technical reasons for non-compliance. The court has ordered the civic body to ensure scientific operation of all STPs and to explore the in-situ treatment of drains carrying sewage to the river till it makes proper arrangements for sewerage system and STP. The civic body has been ordered to “sincerely explore” provision of neutralization of wastewater received at STPs to prevent disturbance of biological treatment system of STP. “This would also protect the river as well as the plant machinery. This provision will be preventive. The identification and check on unauthorized acidic effluent discharge shall be ensured through coordinated surveillance,” the court said, directing AMC to carry out regular verification and strengthen continuous online analysers for data reliability. The court has posted further hearing on this issue on December 3.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-issues-directions-to-curb-pollution/articleshow/87318397.cms||---

The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was 232 on Tuesday as against 129, in ‘moderate’ category, on Monday. The share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was 16%, the highest so far this season. Track the pollution level in your cityThe AQI was forecast to deteriorate to the ‘very poor’ category by Wednesday. Officials said rain on October 17, 18 and 24 helped in washing out the pollutants and improving the air quality. Air quality has, however, deteriorated mainly due to meteorological factors, including calm wind, low temperature and wind direction. “Calm wind during the night led to accumulation of pollutants and as the minimum temperature dropped to 14.6 degrees Celsius, the low temperature affected the dispersion of pollutants. North-westerly winds are favourable for transport of smoke of stubble burning,” said an official. In this season, the highest AQI was recorded on October 17 at 298 in the higher-end of the ‘poor’ category. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research(SAFAR), the forecasting body under the union ministry of earth sciences, stated: “Effective fire count of stubble burning in the northwest region of Delhi is 656 and its share in PM2.5 is 16% as transport level winds are north-westerly. As predicted by SAFAR, the AQI is now forecast to deteriorate rapidly and slip to ‘very poor’ category by Wednesday and deteriorate further to the higher end of ‘very poor’ category by October 29. Calm local winds combined with highly favourable transport level winds (north-north westerly) at 900-950 mb height enhance stubble burning related intrusion. Any increase in fire counts in the next three days would increase finer particle levels of Delhi.” L S Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said, “Between September 1 and October 26, satellites have spotted 7,000 and 3,060 farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, respectively. The share of farm fires to Delhi’s air pollution remained less than 10% so far. But for the next two days, north-west winds forecast over the NCR region may support the movement of smoke towards the downwind (NCR and beyond). This coupled with factors like falling temperatures and low wind speed could further worsen air quality levels in NCR and the surrounding region.” Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, CEEW, said, “Actions on year-round sources of pollution within Delhi, like transport, road and construction dust, and disposal of municipal waste need to be prioritised to avert poor air quality. The Delhi government should also ensure that insights from the newly developed decision support system are actively used in planning and executing preventive measures, particularly on days when severe pollution levels are forecast.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/farm-fire-share-goes-up-to-16-air-may-turn-very-poor-today/articleshow/87319211.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Aryan Khan drug case: Mere presence on cruise doesn’t prove conspiracy theory, says Court||(This story originally appeared in  on Oct 28, 2021)MUMBAI: Granting bail to two of the accused in the cruise liner drug bust case — Manish Rajgaria and Avin Sahu—a special court for Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) cases said that merely because Sahu was present, he cannot be said to have acted in conspiracy with the other accused. The same court last week had rejected the bail pleas of Aryan Khan and two others. Sahu (30), a Odisha-based jewellery businessman, was accused of consuming ganja twice on board the cruise liner. His lawyer, Sana Raees Khan, had argued that the only material against him is his alleged confessional statement under section 67 of the NDPS Act which is not admissible even at the stage of trial in the light of Supreme Court judgements. The prosecution had argued that it could be used at the investigation stage. However, the court said even if the prosecution’s submissions are accepted, there must be some prima facie evidence supporting the case. In Rajgaria’s order, the court observed that merely because some contraband was allegedly recovered from him, he cannot be said to have acted in a conspiracy with his co-accused. The prosecution had accused Rajgaria (30) of possessing 2.4gm of ganja. However, the court said there is prima facie no cogent evidence of the recovery from him. “Moreover…panchnama states that contraband was handed over to the NCB officers by security officer.” The court said it is pertinent to note that he was not arrested on the first day of NCB’s raid on the cruise on October 2 but when the ship returned to the city two days later. In his statement under section 67 of NDPS Act, “he admitted that he was possessing contraband and he handed it over to Security Officer Gajanan Patil, who produced it before NCB officers. Thus, it is clear that contraband was not directly recovered from the possession of the applicant but it was recovered from Security Officer Gajanan Patil,” the court said. Rajgaria’s lawyer Taraq Sayed had argued that while the NCB had claimed that the chief security officer of the cruise had handed the ganja to the investigating agency, the panchnama did not say from where the ganja was actually recovered. The court said Rajgaria and Sahu had neither disclosed names of any accused or peddlers nor did they have connections with drug peddlers. It said that the prosecution had failed to point out any circumstances which would show a nexus between the duo and their co-accused to prima facie make out the ingredients of a conspiracy. The prosecution had argued that since the bail pleas of Aryan, Arbaaz Khan and Munmun Dhamecha were rejected by the court on grounds that there was an element of a conspiracy and since all the accused are connected by the same thread, the observations apply to Rajgaria and Sahu too. Refuting this, the court said merely because bail pleas of the others were rejected, the same analogy cannot be applied in the duo’s cases. “Thus, no prima facie case of conspiracy and abetment is made out against the applicant as alleged by the prosecution,” the court said in both orders. The prosecution had cited the ruling in the case of Showik Chakraborty, an accused in the drug case linked to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, where it was held that since the accused are part of the conspiracy, each of them is liable for the entire quantity of drugs seized. The court, however, in both orders, said, “In the present case, there is no prima facie material to indicate that the present applicant is part of a larger network. Hence, this can be distinguished from the case of other accused in whose respect there is evidence about conspiracy.” It held that Sahu was arrested under sections of the NDPS Act where the maximum sentence was one year in jail and Rajgaria was accused of possessing a small quantity of ganja. The court said, hence the bar under section 37 of the Act would not apply. Under Section 37, no person accused under 27A (for illicit trafficking and harbouring of offenders) or for offences involving commercial quantity can be given bail unless the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe he’s not guilty and that he is unlikely to commit an offence while out on bail. It was further observed that both were permanent residents of Odisha, had no criminal antecedents and had given an undertaking they would not tamper with evidence. The court said, hence, they were “not likely to abscond” or flee from justice.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-mere-presence-on-cruise-doesnt-prove-conspiracy-theory-says-court/articleshow/87319248.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The state urban development department said the market was built at a cost of Rs 10.8 crore and will house more than 300 vendors. Besides an underground parking lot, the market will house a cafeteria and will be manned by closed circuit television cameras. “We all know what the market looked like a few years ago. It was covered with mud and the buyers and sellers had a tough time. The new market complex will help organize the space and offer a cleaner environment for trade,” Soren said after the inauguration. Besides Soren, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth, Ranchi MLA Singh, mayor Asha Lakra and deputy mayor Sanjiv Vijaywargia attended the meet.

Koda at Chaibasa said after the outbreak of the pandemic last year, the state government had stood by the poor migrant workers. The government utilised all its resources to ensure that workers stranded in various parts of the country are brought back to their native places by train or road. He said the party played an active role in the rehabilitation of the workers after they came back. Later after the first wave of Covid-19, when the workers wanted to go back to their places of work, all kinds of assistance were provided to them. Local party workers ensured proper distribution of foodgrains through PDS to the migrant workers in their native villages, reminded Koda. She said these are the achievements of the Grand Old Party and the common man must be aware of it, so it is the duty of local party workers at the block level to highlight it. The party workers are always available to solve any kind of the civic problems in the remote rural areas, which includes repairing worn-out electric transformers or clearing the drain in front of the house. The MP said for the development of society, more hands are required, so the party will launch a membership drive from October 31, the martyrdom day of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, so that more people can be involved in this noble venture. Blood donation camps will be organised at various places on this day. Congress’ “Gandhigiri”: In an effort to expose the BJP-led government at Centre for taking an anti-poor stand, Congress functionaries along with workers in Jamshedpur distributed roses to motorists at various fuel outlets. Congress leaders said the government at the Centre has made life miserable for everyone by increasing the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG cylinders since it came to power. Demanding rollback in hiked prices of automobile fuel and LPG, they hit the streets by distributing roses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/cong-singhbhum-mp-lists-partys-feats-during-pandemic/articleshow/87317812.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

The entrepreneurs have urged the government to change from its existing method of bidding to a lottery system to enable the small and micro enterprises acquire a plot for themselves. "Big investors quote higher bid for the small and moderate sized plots owing to which small investors don’t get the chance to acquire the plot hence we have sought change in the policy," said Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) president Vijay Anand Moonka. Moonka also suggested that the department must club plots to areas of 10,000 square feet, fix the price of the land and reserve it for micro and small investors. The entrepreneurs have also urged the industries department to introduce DVC power in the Adityapur industrial area. "As of now, JBVNL and TSUISL (read Jusco) supply electricity in the industrial area. Cost of the electricity of both the enterprise is at Rs 5.50 per unit while DVC charges Rs 3.60 per unit," city-based industrialist Manak Kedia said. Kedia added that the rising power tariff is forcing many entrepreneurs to set up units in DVC command areas such as Hazaribag and Ramgarh. The entrepreneurs also demanded a reduction in electricity duty imposed on the factory owners which is at 15% of the total power consumed each month. That apart, Rs 0.15 is being charged on each unit consumed as green cess. "At a time when the small investors are confronting problems in getting the business (work order), different types of taxes under various garbs are not doing any good to the small investors," said a Tata Motors ancillary unit owner on anonymity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/entrepreneurs-seek-change-in-land-allotment-rules-power-tariff-slash/articleshow/87317888.cms||B Sridhar

There is a law for everything and it needs to be followed by all.” The complaint with the Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) stated, “No Covid-19 SOP’s are followed as large number of people were seen sitting inside the tent. There are strict guidelines issued by the tourism department for construction of shacks and tents but here government departments are taken for granted and the trade is carried out in full operation.” The police team patrolling the beach had not reported the violation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/unauthorised-tent-taken-down-at-baina-beach/articleshow/87345597.cms||---

A press statement issued by the state health department said that Gupta raised the two issues during a two-day meeting held by Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya with all the state health ministers in New Delhi. Gupta also discussed the Pradhan Mantri Health Infrastructure Mission, need for an improved management of the pandemic and other issues. Gupta apprised the Centre about the state’s vaccination drive and higlighted the steps taken for preventing the third wave of the virus in Jharkhand. He further requested the Union minister to increase the amount for treatment under Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, which is capped at Rs 5 lakh at present. He added that the honorarium for sahiyas should also be enhanced. Mandaviya assured that he would consider the demands while requesting the state to speed up its vaccination drive. Meanwhile, a 14-year old girl was on Tuesday admitted with Covid-like symptoms to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi. The patient hails from Naya Bazaar in Dhanbad. Sources said that the girl was initially admitted in Guru Nanak hospital with blood infection and lung complications. During treatment, the doctors noticed Covid-like symptoms in her but the RT-PCR test of her swab sample was negative. As a precautionary measure, she has been admitted in the hospital’s trauma centre where a close watch is being kept on her.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/health-min-bats-for-vax-booster-dose-minors-inoculation-drive/articleshow/87318142.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The closure was ordered by deputy commissioner Ramniwas Yadav based on the report of a six-member inquiry committee which was set up on October 23. The patients who complained of vision loss are currently being treated at hospitals in Kolkata and Ranchi. “A detailed investigation against the hospital is still underway. After it is complete, FIRs will be lodged against the hospital administration and the doctors who performed the surgeries,” Yadav told TOI. Yadav said the initial probe found that the hospital did not have requisite equipment and infrastructure to conduct cataract surgeries. The administration apprehended that there could be a rise in such cases as the hospital management also failed to furnish exact figures of Ayushman Bharat who were treated at their facility. Chief minister Hemant Soren who was on a two-day visit to Sahebganj (October 25-26) directed Yadav to take necessary steps to treat the victims and suitable action against the private hospital. The inquiry committee which inspected Jharkhand Sewa Sadan on October 25 has submitted in the report, the copy of which is available with the TOI, that the infrastructural facilities available in the Jharkhand Sewa Sadan Nursing Home of Barharwa did not suit the prescribed standard leading to the deterioration in the vision of cataract patients having undergone the surgery between October 5 and October 7.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/sahebganj-admin-seals-hospital-after-botched-eye-ops/articleshow/87318175.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

---||India||India may face long heat waves, heavy flooding, low agro and fish yield in 15-20 yrs if emissions not controlled: Study ahead of G20 meet||MUMBAI: Ahead of the 16th G20 summit, set to begin in Rome on Saturday, a report by a team of over 40 scientists at CMCC (the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change), a research centre that serves as the Italian focal point for the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has found that in India, heat waves will last 25 times longer by 2036-2065 if emissions are high (leading to a temperature rise of 4°C), over five times longer if global temperature rise is constrained to about 2°C, and one-and-a-half times longer if emissions are very low and temperature rise only reaches 1.5°C. "Even assuming sufficient water and nutrient supplies, not including the impact of climate change on pests or diseases, or extreme events such as floods or storms, and including a strong effect of CO2 fertilization that restricts leaf transpiration in plants, sugarcane, rice, wheat, and maize yields in India will fall as the climate warms. In reality, these conditions may not be met, for example water demand for agriculture is likely to rise around about 29% by 2050 - meaning yield losses are likely to be underestimated," the report stated. "Within 30 years rising temperatures and intense heat waves could cause severe droughts; threatening essential water supplies for agriculture, causing huge loss of human life, and increasing the chance of deadly fires. In India, declines in rice and wheat production could spark economic losses of up to € 81 billion and a loss of 15% of farmers’ incomes by 2050," it warns. "Furthermore, on a pathway to 4°C global heating, agricultural drought will become 48% more frequent by 2036-2065. On a 2°C pathway (the maximum temperature agreed by the Paris Agreement by lowering emissions) this drops to 20% more frequent, and constraining temperature rise to 1.5°C (the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement), agricultural drought will still be 13% more frequent," it stated further. Also, the potential fish catch could fall 8.8% by 2050 if emissions are low, and 17.1% if they are high, the study pointed out. Just under 18 million Indians could be at risk of river flooding by 2050 if emissions are high, compared to 1.3 million today, it added. The European Climate Foundation has funded the report. The report has found that climate impacts are already hitting the G20 nations. Over the last 20 years, heat-related deaths have increased by at least 15% in all G20 countries, while forest fires in the G20 have burnt an area one and a half times the size of Canada. And if emissions keep rising, worse is to come. In India, the report said, the total labour is expected to decline by 13.4% under a low emissions scenario by 2050 due to the increase in heat, and by 24% under a medium emissions scenario by 2080. “The broad suite of indicators presented in this Atlas clearly drive home the message that climate change is impacting all aspects of life – be it our health, our food supply, or our ways of making a living. From here, decision-makers in all G20 countries can begin to zoom in and identify the communities most in need of adaptation investments to combat concurrent heat extremes, sea level rise, wildfire smoke and other climate change threats.” Dr Michelle Tigchelaar, University of Stanford“These estimates are broadly consistent with recent research which finds that even the "non-catastrophic" climate change scenarios are likely to be incredibly costly from a social and economic perspective. Losses of 2-4% of GDP annually by 2050 - those aren't small numbers, especially since we are talking about rich developed economies like the US. They also highlight the tremendous variability in climate change impacts - not only across countries, but also within. Some parts of the US are expected to be hit harder than others, and in different ways.” Dr Jisung Park, University of California, Los Angeles. Dr Anjal Prakash, Research director, Bharati institute of public policy, Indian school of business and IPCC author, said due to growing temperatures the glaciers in the himalayan region will shrink and rainfall or precipitation patterns will drastically change. "Extreme events like a recent flash flood in Uttarakhand wherein a 300-400 mm rainfall lashed within 24 hours will occur more frequently. So India will have to focus on building and maintaining climate resilient infrastructure. All new infra will have to go through a climate scanner . Also the old projects will have to be reevaluated from the climate lense." he said. The recent flash flood in Mukteshwar/Nainital in Uttarakhand killed over 34 people besides a huge damage to human habitations, forests and agricultural land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-may-face-long-heat-waves-heavy-flooding-low-agro-and-fish-yield-in-15-20-yrs-if-emissions-not-controlled-study-ahead-of-g20-meet/articleshow/87321110.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||India||Global inequality: New drugs go the way of vaccines||NEW DELHI: Globally, vaccine inequity is starker than ever before. Around 75% of Covid-19 vaccine jabs have been cornered and even hoarded by rich countries, with not even 3% of the population in low-income countries getting their first jab. To make the disparity worse, a few rich nations are rolling out booster shots for the fully immunised. After vaccines, innovative treatments being tested have now put the spotlight on access to life-saving Covid therapies, some of which may even prove to be prophylactic. An effective antiviral treatment that can be taken orally could be a pandemic game-changer, saving lives and relieving pressure on overwhelmed hospitals, particularly relevant for countries with low vaccination rates. Drug companies including Pfizer, Novartis and Roche are racing to develop new drugs while Merck recently announced 'promising' results of its antiviral pill - molnupiravir. There is apprehension, and rightly so, that many of these drugs may not reach most of the 'needy' population. So far, the only recommended treatments are expensive monoclonal antibodies whose supply is hampered due to monopoly rights of patent-holding corporations. Worse still, these are out of reach of a majority of the world's population. For instance, the antibody cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab by Swiss firm Roche is pegged around Rs 60,000 per patient in India. Why is supply of Covid-related items constrained?At the core of the issue of this inequity lies intellectual property (IP), which companies making drug discoveries aggressively protect. So as the Covid-19 pandemic raged across the world, patients and governments were forced to grapple with IP barriers in accessing essential equipment like masks, testing kits, critical drugs, resulting in shortages, and even deaths. Tragically, the pandemic has taken nearly 5 million lives so far. The health crisis has been exacerbated by a breakdown in global supply chains, again leading to shortages. Stockouts and price gouging have been reported across many Covid-19 hotspots, including in India for Gilead's antiviral remdesivir and tocilizumab manufactured by Roche. The supply of almost every tool to prevent or treat the lethal virus - right from N95 masks, testing materials, technology for diagnostics and ventilator valves to vaccine production - faced huge bottlenecks. But now, with the emergence of 'promising' but steeply-priced treatments, the relevance of foregoing IP on urgently needed Covid-19 medical tools, can't be stressed more. That's exactly what two developing countries, India and South Africa, had sought at the World Trade Organisation. Over a year back, they jointly submitted a landmark proposal seeking a temporary waiver of intellectual property on Covid-19 therapies, diagnostics and vaccines. What are the waiver's implications for Covid therapies?The proposal - backed by nearly 100 countries - is still being stalled by EU, Switzerland and UK. Opposing stakeholders have raised doubts about the practical feasibility of the proposal, arguing it will discourage innovation. But if accepted by WTO members the joint submission, under provisions of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on October 2 last year, would facilitate technology transfer of Covid-19 therapies, leading to innovators sharing technology and IP of vaccines and drugs, and assist global supply chains in ramping up wide-scale manufacturing. With IP barriers removed, biotech companies and generic producers could mass produce life-saving Covid-19 therapies and vaccines in India and other countries such as South Africa, Brazil and Bangladesh. India, also called the 'pharmacy of the developing world' because it supplies affordable quality generics globally, could play a dominant role as it did two decades back during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. After wealthy nations stockpiling and pre-booking vaccines, now countries like the US are reserving potential Covid-19 pills like molnupiravir. This illustrates why the TRIPS waiver is so desperately needed. What is the prescription for Big Pharma?Health activists have continued to urge MNCs to share the 'recipe', regulatory dossiers and other manufacturing information of life-saving medicines, and technology and processes for vaccines. This is critical for an immediate scale-up by generic manufacturers in developing countries. Compulsory licensing on a critical patented drug also leads to pressure from trading partners and legal harassment. This can be prevented if IP on Covid medicines is suspended, nullifying the monopoly of a company, opening up the field for generic producers and governments to quickly ramp up manufacturing of therapies, without protracted negotiations, legal tussles and inordinate delays. This has been the most disruptive pandemic in a century, but the next one could be worse. Hence it must serve as a turning point towards more global collaboration and commitment to thwart the next health threat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-inequality-new-drugs-go-the-way-of-vaccines/articleshow/87322029.cms||---
---||India||Schools in Delhi can reopen for all classes from Nov 1||NEW DELHI: All schools, colleges and other educational institutions in the capital have been allowed by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to reopen for all classes from November 1 due to significant improvement in the Covid situation. However, no more than 50% of the strength of a class will be allowed at a time, attendance will be voluntary and parents will not be forced to send their children to school with both online and physical classes to be conducted simultaneously. Currently, students of only Class IX and above are allowed to attend school. The Delhi government schools, from nursery to Class XII, will be opening on November 1 but many private schools have decided to open only after Diwali. Universities and colleges had got the go-ahead for re-opening in September when students of Classes IX and XII were allowed to return to school. Parents eager on new 'beginning' Nitisha Gaur is relieved that she can now send her son back to school after such a long gap. After the Delhi Disaster Management Authority decided at a meeting on Wednesday to allow schools to open, many schools have decided to open after Diwali, though online classes will continue for the time being. Gaur, a public relations professional whose kid studies in Bhatnagar International Foundation School in Vasant Kunj, said, "I will definitely send my son to school. Though the school notice says attendance is not mandatory, it is important for children to get a break from screen education. out of the screen." The school notice said, "Parents too should have their Covid vaccination certificate available. To give parents and children time to prepare, the school will begin classes after the Diwali break." Another parent, lawyer Tanya Agarwal, added, "This is a long-awaited decision that will help our children return to a normal life just as adults have. Symptomatic cases should be dealt with as required with minimum disruption for the rest of the children." She hoped that families would act responsibly in the Diwali season to avoid a spurt in infection. Mohit Goel, whose kid is a nursery student at Bal Bharti, Pitampura, also felt that a start had to be made. "I feel the situation is under control and we have to make a new beginning," he said. "Besides, the older students from Class IX upwards have been attending school for the past few months and everything seems okay. However, the government should keep a keen eye on the situation." Goel's elder child has been attending his Class XI at St Columba's School. There, of course, are some parents who aren't keen. Harjinder Singh's older son, a Class IX student, is attending classes, but he doesn't want the younger one to return to school. "If the institution provided proper hybrid teaching, I wouldn't send my children to school," the south Delhi resident said. Abhishek Jha makes no bones about his reluctance on the issue. He declared, "There can be no school without vaccination for the children."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/schools-in-delhi-can-reopen-for-all-classes-from-nov-1/articleshow/87322059.cms||Alok K N Mishra
---||Chandigarh||Ellenabad: Farmer ‘assault’ resonates on last day of campaigning||Sirsa: The campaigning for the Ellenabad byelection came to an end on Wednesday on a high-octane note with INLD and Congress mounting an attack on the BJP-JJP government over an alleged incident of assault with a farmer at Jamal village during the road show of deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Tuesday. While INLD complained about the incident to the chief electoral officer (CEO) while accusing the government of creating fear among voters, the Congress also termed the incident as government hooliganism. Although a total of 19 candidates are in the fray, Abhay Chautala of the INLD, Pawan Bainiwal of the Congress and Gobind Kanda of the BJP-JJP combine are being considered as key candidates. District election officer (DEO) Anish Yadav said according to the order of the Election Commission of India, no campaigning can be done inside the constituency. He requested no processions, rallies and road shows should be organized after the end of the election campaign period. Among the star campaigners, chief minister Manohar Lal held an election meeting, while Kumari Selja campaigned for the Congress candidate. Abhay Chautala campaigned for himself. Egoists did only politics of plunder in 17 years: CM Without naming Abhay Chautala, chief minister Manohar Lal said in an election meeting in Dholpaliya village of Ellenabad assembly that arrogant people did politics of plunder only in the last 17 years. The government got done development works worth Rs 700 crore in the constituency, while Abhay Chautala did not raise the voice of the people. “I have come to ask for your participation in the government, so make a dent in this stronghold of arrogance,” the CM said. Earlier, CM participated in many other programmes including businessmen conference, SC and OBC Morcha events in Ellenabad city. Kurukshetra MP Nayab Saini said the development of your area could not be done because of your MLA. CM’s announcements only poll hoax: Abhay INLD candidate Abhay Singh Chautala said the chief minister had made big announcements during the Baroda assembly elections in Sonipat district as well, but after the defeat, no attention was paid to those announcements. Similarly, now people are being attracted by the announcement to build a medical college here, which is only an election hoax, Abhay said. He said that the incidents of assault on the peaceful protesting farmers and later apologizing to them are shameful. Meanwhile, founder of Apna Bharat Morcha and former MP Ashok Tanwar announced his support to Abhay Chautala. Govt acting as hooligans: Bainiwal Strongly condemning the “assault” on the farmers protesting peacefully at Jamal village, Congress candidate Pawan Bainiwal said the BJP-JJP combine has come down to hooliganism and wants to suppress the agitators in view of their possible defeat, which the people of the area will not tolerate. “INLD and BJP are now fighting the battle of number two. There is fear in the ruling coalition about the decision taken by the people, so it is bent on oppressing the farmers. Congress has supported the farmers’ movement from the very beginning. From the road to the Parliament, the voice of the farmers has been raised, while the INLD leader resigned from the assembly for a show-off,” Bainiwal said. CM brought a bag of lies: Selja Congress state president Kumari Selja said chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has brought a bag of lies to mislead the public, but the people here are aware and are not going to fall under any of his guise. The CM has now come here also to show big dreams, promising to make Baroda a Paris. After losing the Baroda byelection, the CM and none of his associates have taken care of that constituency, Selja said. Selja said the CM should answer as to why the government is not buying farmers’ crop at MSP. Who is to be blamed for the delay in giving compensation for the destroyed cotton crop? Due to rising inflation, it has become difficult to keep the stove of the poor burning, she claimed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ellenabad-farmer-assault-resonates-on-last-day-of-campaigning/articleshow/87320410.cms||---

Under the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign, the government and local administrative bodies will pursue those who have not taken the second dose of the vaccine even after the protocol-recommended interval is over. Besides, it will also identify people who have not yet sought to be vaccinated and try to address issues including hesitancy. The move comes in the wake of more than 10.3 crore people ‘overdue’ for their second jab despite the availability of over 12 crore doses with states and UTs. Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya urged states to implement innovative strategies to encourage people to come forward to take their pending jabs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/door-to-door-vax-drive-next-month-to-up-coverage/articleshow/87322172.cms||---

Of them, the officials added, a woman was a Delhi resident while the rest were from other states. Because the corporation takes into account deaths involving people living in Delhi only, the officials said, the death toll due to dengue in the city stands at two now. This includes a woman who succumbed to the disease at Safdarjung Hospital and another death at a private hospital. Both the deaths took place in September. The officials said they were investigating the reason of death and other details before confirming it. Some other hospitals have also reported to the civic bodies about dengue deaths and, sources said, the details shared by them were being examined. If these deaths are confirmed to be caused by dengue, the toll could increase further, the sources said. In the last two weeks, there has been a serious spurt in dengue cases in the national capital as well as neighbouring towns. This, doctors say, has led to a shortage of beds in many hospitals. Hospitals like AIIMS, Ram Manohar Lohia, Lok Nayak in the public sector and Sir Ganga Ram, Apollo and Max hospitals in the private sector among others say they are constantly increasing the beds for dengue patients. "We have more than 30 dengue patients admitted in the hospital currently. Most of them have severe symptoms," Dr Ashutosh Biswas, professor of medicine at AIIMS, told TOI. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said they had 41 dengue patients admitted at present. "Total 190 patients having fever visited the OPD on Wednesday. We have sent their samples for testing for dengue," Dr Kumar said. At Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, chairman of the medicine department Dr SP Byotra said, they had nearly 60 dengue patients admitted at present. "Our dengue ward is full and we are accommodating patients in the flu ward and any other available space," he added. The occupancy of beds is high at RML, Safdarjung, Max, Fortis and Apollo also. "We have added some more beds for dengue patients in view of the increased rush," Dr AK Singh Rana, medical superintendent of RML Hospital, said. Data shared by the municipal corporations shows 1,006 people have tested positive for dengue as on Monday and one person has succumbed to it. Doctors say the actual number may be much higher. "We haven't seen such a rush of dengue patients in the last two years. Also, many patients are coming with severe symptoms, including liver-related complications," said a senior doctor, who did not want to be quoted. This year, type-II strain of the dengue virus has been found to be predominant in Delhi and nearby areas. It is known to cause more severe symptoms. Dengue is a self-limiting disease. Most patients recover well with symptomatic treatment. But, Dr Biswas from AIIMS said, one should not ignore the warning signs such as pain in the abdomen, bleeding from natural orifices, rapid fall in the platelet count or extreme weakness. "Persons suffering from chronic kidney disease, heart diseases and pregnant women among others should take extra precaution to protect themselves from mosquito bites," he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hospitals-under-pressure-as-dengue-cases-soar-10-deaths-at-safdarjung/articleshow/87322210.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Four major Kolkata roads to receive ‘pollution-free’ mastic makeover||KOLKATA: A number of prominent roads in the city are set to be repaired using a technology that promises to make the process completely pollution-free. Next month, the state public works department (PWD) will re-pave the battered and cratered VIP Road, along with Red Road, Hospital Road and Mayo Road, using ‘mechanized mastic asphalt’, a method that will be used for the first time in the city. Track the pollution level in your cityPWD engineers claimed that the technology could be a “game-changer” in road building. The “Gussasphalt machine” being imported from Germany, they said, will also make the work five times faster than existing methods. Mastic asphalt, for long favoured by road engineers because of its durability, proved to be problematic because the method used to manufacture it is highly polluting. Following a National Green Tribunal ruling banning mastic asphalt “baking” by the roadside, the state gov-ernment, too, in 2018 had pushed for an end to the method, suggested the use of concrete or bitumen in road-building. But bitumen is not an ideal choice in a city prone to waterlogging, as it wears out faster; the presence of utility services, such as power cables, beneath city roads, raised accessibility problems in case of concrete roads. “Considering the amount of rain Kolkata receives, nothing but mastic asphalt can make roads last long,” said a senior PWD official. “After the NGT and state government orders, we started to look for ecologically sustainable alternatives. In India, only Mumbai roads have been constructed using this technology. We will be among the first ones to use it in eastern India. Once the trial succeeds, more roads in and around the city, along with bridge surfaces, can be re-layed, using the technology,” he added. The technology allows for mastic asphalt baked in a plant away from the city to be carried in a large boiler attached to a truck, where a temperature of more than 200°C will be maintained to keep the mastic in perfect shape. The vehicle will also be attached with a separate scraper, mixer and paver, which will scrape the top and re-lay it with mastic asphalt. “While the current manual job can barely cover 100 metres per night, the new technology will help us repave around 500 metres to 700 metres a night. It will make repaving road surfaces much faster and completely pollution-free,” the official said. “After a series of talks with the government, we called a tender last year and found a bidder, who agreed to buy the German machine and adapt the new road re-laying technology. We have awarded the contract to the agency, which is waiting for the machine, worth around Rs 26 crore, to reach the city. It is in transit and should reach by the end of this month, following which work can start,” he said, adding that preparatory internal repairs were already going on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/four-major-city-roads-to-receive-pollution-free-mastic-makeover/articleshow/87319460.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||India||PM calls for free & open Indo-Pacific||NEW DELHI: Participating in the 16th East Asia Summit, which saw discussions on Indo-Pacific, South China Sea, UNCLOS and terrorism, PM Narendra Modi underlined the significance of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. While reiterating the principle of Asean centrality in the region in his virtual address, Modi said India remained committed to strengthening "respect for shared values of multilateralism, rules-based international order, international law and sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations". The summit saw participation by a US President for the first time since 2017 with President Joe Biden reiterating the US commitment to the international rules-based order and expressing concern over threats to that order. Japanese PM Fumio Kishida expressed reservations over China's conduct in East and South China Sea and also raised issued related to human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. Both leaders were also said to have expressed concerns over the situation in Taiwan Strait because of China's "coercive action".

---||India||Modi to address COP26 next week, launch international solar grid with UK PM||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the leaders’ summit at UN climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow on Monday and along with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson jointly launch the ambitious trans-national solar grid initiative — One Sun One World One Grid — the next day while taking forward India’s multi-pronged strategies to decarbonise energy sector. India’s ambitious 450 GW renewable energy goal by 2030, its hydrogen mission, plan to move Indian railways to ‘net-zero’ emission by 2030, land degradation neutrality and massive programme to increase forest cover (natural carbon sink) would be the key points the country will seek to drive home at COP26. Giving final shape to its strategy for next week’s leaders’ summit and COP26, the prime minister’s office (PMO) on Wednesday held an inter-ministerial meeting on key issues. It was decided that India would stick to its position of strictly adhering to principles of the UN convention and the Paris Agreement such as ‘equity’ and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC) to ensure ‘climate justice’ for everyone across the globe. The climate negotiations from the Indian side will be led by environment minister Bhupender Yadav and environment secretary R P Gupta during the COP26. "Issues of climate finance and technology transfer from developed to developing countries would be the mainstay of negotiation, keeping principles of equity and CBDR-RC at the front," said an official. Modi will be visiting Glasgow, UK on Sunday after attending two-day G20 summit in Rome, Italy. “Besides meeting Johnson, the Prime Minister will have a couple of more bilateral meetings during the leaders’ summit at COP26,” said an official. It is expected that the Prime Minister would urge more and more countries to actively take part in three key multilateral institutions/efforts – International Solar Alliance (ISA), Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) and Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT) – to strengthen mitigation and adaptation goals of the Paris Agreement. All these three multilateral efforts are being spearheaded by India with France being a major partner in the ISA and Sweden in LeadIT. Besides launching Green Grid Initiative (GGI) of trans-national solar grid through ISA, India, UK and Australia will on the sidelines of COP26 on November 2 launch a dedicated initiative - Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) - through CDRI to support small island developing nations. Except Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, most of the world leaders will attend the leaders' summit in-person which has been convened by the host UK to give a momentum to the COP26 to arrive at a positive outcome. Securing global ‘net-zero’ by mid-century to keep 1.5 degree Celsius within reach, mobilising climate finance to support developing countries for adaptation measures, building consensus for 'loss and damage' (compensating poor and vulnerable countries for their loss due to natural disasters) and finalising the Paris Agreement implementation guidelines by working out rules for carbon markets would be the main goals of the negotiators from over 190 countries during the COP26 (October 31-November 12).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-to-address-cop26-next-week-launch-international-solar-grid-with-uk-pm/articleshow/87322353.cms||Vishwa Mohan

We are ready to go to higher secondary schools and colleges to get students vaccinated,” director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said. Teams from health services have also been going out to vaccinate the house bound, persons with disabilities, and those in old age homes. “We are willing to have more special programmes for any institution and even for housing societies if they can ensure that there are at least 10 persons who require the vaccine as one vial of the vaccine contains at least 10 doses,” she said. The health department hopes to complete administering the second dose of the vaccine to its target population by the end of November and it will soon integrate the Covid-19 vaccination programme into its routine immunisation programme. As 2.15 lakh persons are yet to take their second dose of the vaccine despite the mandatory 84-day gap between doses lapsing, the department is especially appealing to this group to take advantage of the mega vaccination drive on Sunday where they can walk into 219 health centres and sub centres between 9.30am and 5pm to get their jab. It is important for people to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible due to the state opening for tourism and since schools are starting, the department stated. Till date almost 105% of the target population has received the first dose of the vaccine and over 70% are fully vaccinated. According to statistics with the health department, 92% of those who died in the second wave of the pandemic hadn’t received even a single dose of the vaccine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/heath-dept-reaches-out-to-colleges-trains-eyes-on-students-turning-18/articleshow/87318923.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Congress says time for all parties to unite against BJP||PANAJI: Congress continued to send mixed signals to “like-minded parties” about a pre-poll alliance with party functionaries continuing to officially reiterate that Congress will contest all 40 assembly seats in the 2022 assembly elections. However, sources within the party suggest that it appears to be a step closer to a pre-poll tie-up. Congress party open for an alliance with all like-minded parties, but the decision will be finalised by the party high command, former power minister and working president Aleixo Sequeira told a press conference on Wednesday. “We have not finalised anything,” he said when asked if Congress had arrived at a decision regarding an alliance. Congress central leadership had convened a meeting in Delhi to discuss the poll strategy for the five states that will go to polls early next year.  Leader of the opposition Digambar Kamat, state Congress president Girish Chodankar, working presidents Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco and Sequeira along with Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao were present for the meeting. “We have conveyed or inputs and now they will approve the strategy. We look at BJP as the target that we would like to hit and whoever would like to walk along with us, yes we could talk to them,” Sequeira said. Former All India Congress Commitee president Rahul Gandhi is expected to arrive in Goa on October 30 for a day-long visit. He will meet fishermen and those affected by the double-tracking project at Velsao, sit with mining-affected individuals at the International Centre Goa and address Congress workers at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Stadium in the evening. Congress insiders expect discussions on the pre-poll alliance to move ahead during Gandhi’s visit. “We have already decided to unite all parties against BJP. We are not going to take any names. We are here to fight against BJP,” Curtorim MLA Lourenco said. The senior state Congress functionaries remain tightlipped about the back channel talks that are on. Sequeira said that Congress has not approached Trinamool Congress (TMC), Goa Forward Party (GFP), Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) or Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). “Until Delhi is clear on the stand that we should take, we cannot approach anybody. Once we are clear from Delhi, we will move about. We have told them that in the forthcoming election scenario, we have BJP, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), TMC, GFP, MGP and NCP and we also have Revolutionary Goans,” he said. At the same time, the former power minister said that Congress is preparing to contest all the 40 assembly seats in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/congress-says-time-for-all-parties-to-unite-against-bjp/articleshow/87318938.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa govt sets new deadline of November 15 for 100% vax coverage||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday set a new deadline of November 15 for Goa to achieve 100% coverage of both doses of the vaccine. Earlier, Sawant had set October 31 as the target. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the state for having completed 100% coverage of the first dose of the vaccine. We need cooperation from the youth to achieve 100% coverage of the double dose of the vaccine. We had kept the target of October 31, but surely we will achieve it by November 15,” Sawant said, after inaugurating the Swayampurna Yuva programme organised by the commissioner for labour and employment and the regional employment exchange at DM College, Assagao. He said the idea behind organising the Swayampurna Yuva programme was to make the youth aware of the opportunities available in Goa and the facilities and schemes of the state government available to them. “Many are not aware of the schemes and facilities being offered by the Goa government and do not want to make an effort to learn about them either,” said Sawant, adding that 25 departments were present at the programme to explain their respective schemes to the participating youth. He said that the state government has reduced 50% tuition fees for all general stream graduate programme students. To incentivise students’ enrolment for engineering degree programmes, his government had reduced the fees heavily under the DJ-GIFT scheme. “No other state offers as many opportunities for youth as Goa — right from the pharmaceutical sector to shipbuilding. India’s first maritime cluster is also taking shape in Goa,” Sawant said. He said that more than 60 companies had been brought together to boost recruitment in the state. “We have passed the bill to enable private universities to establish campuses in Goa and the process is already on to establish three private universities in Goa.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/govt-sets-new-deadline-of-nov-15-for-100-vax-coverage/articleshow/87319001.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Raiganj MLA is fifth from BJP to join Trinamool||KOLKATA: BJP’s Raiganj MLA Krishna Kalyani, who was served a show-cause notice on October 1 for his alleged anti-party remarks, returned to Trinamool Congress on Wednesday. Kalyani is the fifth BJP legislator to switch allegiance. A former North Dinajpur district president of Trinamool, he had joined BJP ahead of the assembly elections earlier this year and was fielded from Raiganj. He returned to the TMC fold in the presence of party secretary-general Partha Chatterjee and MLA Vivek Gupta. Kalyani had been at odds with the saffron brass for quite some time with former Union minister Debasree Choudhury running the BJP’s affairs in North Dinajpur. “No self-respecting person can work freely in BJP. If someone wants to do good as an MLA, he is not allowed to do it in BJP. There is always a conspiracy and I am a victim,” he told reporters at the TMC headquarters here. The MLA said he was also upset with the “anti-people” policies of the Centre, which “has not taken a single step” to check spiralling fuel prices. “I increasingly felt I could not be a part of BJP any longer. If I did not speak in favour of Mamata Banerjee’s welfare policies before the assembly polls, I made a mistake, which I wish to rectify now,” he said. Reacting to the development, BJP state president Sukanta Majumder said Kalyani should explain how he suddenly “woke up” to the policies of Mamata Banerjee. “He will get a befitting reply from the people of Raiganj in the future,” Majumder said, adding that Kalyani joined TMC to serve his personal interests. Kalyani had quit BJP earlier this month, but did not resign as an MLA. Earlier, BJP’s Krishnanagar North MLA Mukul Roy, Bishnupur MLA Tanmay Ghosh, Bagdah MLA Biswajit Das and Kaliaganj MLA Soumen Roy joined TMC, besides Asansol MP Babul Supriyo. The turncoat MLAs are yet to resign from the assembly or be disqualified under the anti-defection law. Supriyo though has put in his papers. Trinamool had won 213 seats in the assembly elections in April-May and bagged Samserganj and Jangipur in the bypolls earlier this month, taking its tally to 215 in the 294-member House. BJP had won 77 seats in the assembly elections. Dinhata MLA Nisith Pramanik and Santipur MLA Jagannath Sarkar later resigned to retain their MP seats.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/raiganj-mla-is-5th-from-bjp-to-join-trinamool/articleshow/87319558.cms||---
