In a mark of protest against non-fulfilment of their demands, Punjab Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA) has threatened that its members will curtail the operation timings of their pumps for fifteen days (November 7 to November 21) from 7am to 5pm. This was stated by PPDA state president Paramjit Singh Doaba at a meeting of association’s members which was held on Saturday night in Ludhiana. During the meeting, several association members from different cities including Moga, Jalandhar, Ropar, Patiala and Mohali were also present. Addressing the members, Doaba said, “Several meetings have taken place with the central government and despite flagging our concern about increasing expenses and shrinking savings, nothing has been done by the government because of which we have to think of the ways to make ourselves heard." "The first step in this direction will be a silent protest by operating petrol pumps for limited hours (7am to 5pm) for at least fifteen days which will be started from November 7 and will continue till November 21. In case this protest of ours fails to yield any result, then we will go on full-day strike and next course of action will be decided thereafter.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/punjab-petrol-pump-owners-threaten-to-curtail-operation-timings/articleshow/87244502.cms||Mohit Behl

Emphasising that users and dependents caught with small quantities of drugs and their families should be treated as “victims” and not culprits of substance abuse, the ministry of social justice and empowerment has suggested compulsory rehabilitation and treatment instead of jail and penalties. Read AlsoWitness’ PSO’s affidavit claims Rs 8 crore payoff, NCB zonal chief denies chargeThe seizure of contraband from a cruise liner on October 2 night leading to the arrest of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan has become murkier with the personal bodyguard of a witness filing an affidavit levelling serious allegations of a payoff to a Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) official.The recommendations are in response to a request by the revenue department for possible modifications to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985. Times ViewThe ministry is absolutely right when it argues that users should be viewed as victims rather than as culprits. Criminalisation of usage, particularly of soft drugs, only helps in pushing the entire business into a murky, dark zone and ends up creating a convergence of interests between users and drug peddlers, which is the last thing law enforcement should be aiming at.The MSJ&E has suggested modifications that such users should be referred to a mandatory deaddiction and rehabilitation facility for a minimum period of 30 days after which they may also be made to provide mandatory community service for one year. Read AlsoAryan Khan deserves bail, not hatredThe entire case has brought the spotlight on whether an accused deserves bail or not. What it fails to address, however, is how society should look at what the arrest means for individual rightsIt has made these suggestions in a recent letter by the revenue department which had sought views of different ministries including home and health on the provisions of the law and if they would want to suggest any changes. It is also recommended that in the section that deals with the national fund for control of drug abuse demand reduction with special programmes in schools and colleges may be added. In the section of offences and penalties the ministry has proposed changes so that while pronouncing the punishment a distinction can be made between those who have been caught with small quantities for personal consumption and those who are caught with large quantities beyond what would be defined as “small quantities”. In one of the clauses that talks of immunity from prosecution to addicts volunteering for treatment, the ministry has suggested that the voluntary component be deleted as it is recommended that for all such users treatment should be mandatory for a minimum period followed by a mandatory period of community service.

The issue of small quantities of drugs with individual consumers has gained spotlight in the wake of Khan’s case. Underlining its working motto that drug addicts are victims and not criminals, the social Justice ministry in its suggestions tries to make the point that the law needs to make a distinction between traffickers and individuals who are drug addicts found in possession of drugs in small quantities for personal use. The department of revenue of the finance ministry is examining amendments to the stringent law which governs the illegal drugs trade and seizures, with provisions that impose non-negotiable jail sentence and heavy fines. As part of the exercise, the finance ministry, which governs the NDPS Act, recently sought the opinion of individual ministries that are stakeholders in the debate.

Addressing the 60th Raising Day event of the mountain-warfare-trained ITBP, Rai said the government had last year sanctioned 47 new border posts and a dozen staging camps (operational bases for troops undertaking border patrol) to the force. “Deliberations for providing new manpower and battalions for the ITBP are in the last stages,” he revealed. A PTI report quoting officials said the force is expected to get a sanction of seven new battalions comprising about 8,000 personnel for its new border posts that will mainly come up in the Arunachal Pradesh sector of the LAC on India’s eastern flank. The proposal for sanctioning new ITBP battalions and a sector headquarter in the northeast has been under the consideration of the home ministry for a couple of years now. After last year’s sanction of the new border outposts and staging camps, the proposal is expected to get approval soon. Rai lauded the ITBP for their bravery and for giving a “befitting reply” to their opponents during the clashes between Indian and Chinese forces in Ladakh last year. He also decorated 20 ITBP officers with police medals for gallantry awarded to them on Independence Day this year, for displaying courage during the clashes and resisting the incursion attempts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lac-hot-new-battalions-for-itbp-likely/articleshow/87244785.cms||---

The price of petrol in Delhi rose to its highest-ever level of Rs 107.59 a litre, and Rs 113.46 per litre in Mumbai, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers. In Mumbai, diesel now comes for Rs 104.38 a litre, while in Delhi it costs Rs 96.32 per litre. While petrol has already hit the Rs 100-a-litre mark or more in all major cities of the country, diesel has touched that level in over one-and-a-half dozen states and UTs.

---||India||‘EWS income criteria linked to Sinho panel’||NEW DELHI: Amid strong criticism by the Supreme Court over the manner in which income eligibility criteria for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) reservations was fixed, the government is linking the decision to peg it at Rs 8 lakh, just as for Other Backward Classes (OBCs), to the Sinho Commission report which had examined welfare measures for the general classes. A senior official said the Sinho Commission report indicates the eligibility ceiling to qualify for EWS for any reservation measures be linked to the ‘creamy layer’ for the OBCs who avail 27% Mandal reservations. The income bar for OBCs to qualify for the Mandal quotas is Rs 8 lakh, while the non-reserved classes (mostly forward castes) are dubbed EWS if their annual income is up to Rs 8 lakh. The parity between OBCs and EWS has raised the hackles of the Supreme Court, which has in a case questioned the government if it was not making “unequals, equals” and has asked it to submit the exercise done to arrive at Rs 8 lakh for the EWS. A social justice ministry official said the ministry will file an affidavit in the apex court for the next hearing. The failure to file the affidavit on the issue at the hearing last week drew negative reaction from the bench seized of the case. “The affidavit is being processed by the law ministry,” the official said. According to sources, the social justice ministry is relying on the Commission report to substantiate its decision to lay down the income criteria for the EWS, and is confident that its argument will find favour. Backing the decision, the ministry sources said the Sinho Commission held detailed discussions with states on the issue and came up with its recommendations. Thus, an official said, its views have been given the due weightage in arriving at the decision on the EWS qualifying criteria. The 27% Mandal quotas in central jobs and educational institutions were instituted in 1993, while the Centre made a constitutional amendment to create 10% EWS quota in 2019. A legal challenge questioning the constitutionality of the EWS reservations is also pending before the Supreme Court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ews-income-criteria-linked-to-sinho-panel/articleshow/87244830.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Laxman, whose iconic ‘Common Man’ offered a social and political commentary of the times and regaled readers of The Times of India and other publications for over nearly seven decades, died in January 2015 in Pune at the age of 93. “On his 100th birth anniversary, remembering the versatile RK Laxman. Through his cartoons, he beautifully conveyed the socio-political realities of the times,” Modi tweeted. Along with posting a tweet in Laxman’s memory, Modi also shared a video featuring his speech made in 2018, when he released the book ‘Timeless Laxman’, in which he had said Laxman’s cartoons were no less than a lesson in sociology. “Laxman was not just an individual. He was the idea dwelling inside crores of common men,” Modi had said. At the event, the PM had also suggested that a university in Maharashtra should conduct a research or a case study on the impact of Laxman’s ‘Common Man’ on society and minds. The legendary cartoonist often referred to as the ‘Pied Piper of Delhi’ and India’s independent conscience keeper, was famous for creating artwork that included sketches from the TV show ‘Malgudi Days’ written by his brother RK Narayan. His career, spanning seven decades, began as a cartoonist doing part-time jobs for local newspapers and magazines. Later he began his daily comic strip ‘You Said it’ for The Times of India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-pays-tribute-to-laxman-on-artists-100th-birth-anniversary/articleshow/87244890.cms||---

---||World||China passes new land border law amid military standoff with India||BEIJING: Asserting that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China are "sacred and inviolable", the country's national legislature has adopted a new law on the protection and exploitation of the land border areas, which could have a bearing on Beijing's border dispute with India. The law, which becomes operational from January 1 next year, stipulates that "the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China are sacred and inviolable", it said. The Land Borders Law will not necessarily change how border security is handled, but it reflects China's growing confidence in its capability to manage its frontiers. The state shall take measures to safeguard territorial integrity and land boundaries and guard against and combat any act that undermines them, the report said. Chinese military and military police — the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police Force — are responsible for guarding the border against any "invasion, encroachment, infiltration, provocation". The law stipulates that China can close its border if a war or other armed conflict nearby threatens border security The state shall, following the principle of equality, mutual trust and friendly consultation, handle land border-related affairs with neighbouring countries through negotiations to properly resolve disputes and longstanding border issues, it said. The law states that the Chinese military "shall carry out border duties", including "organising drills" and "resolutely prevent, stop and combat invasion, encroachment, provocation and other acts". A significant aspect of the new law includes state support for the construction of border towns, improving their functioning and strengthening supporting capacity for the construction. Members of the standing committee of the National People's Congress approved the law at the closing meeting of a legislative session on Saturday, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The law also stipulates that the state shall take measures to strengthen border defence, support economic and social development as well as opening-up in border areas, improve public services and infrastructure in such areas, encourage and support people's life and work there, and promote coordination between border defence and social, economic development in border areas, it said. China in recent years has been strengthening border infrastructure, including the establishment of air, rail and road networks. It also launched a bullet train in Tibet which extends up to Nyingchi, the border town close to Arunachal Pradesh. Besides that, China also began constructing a number of villages close to the border with proper infrastructure in Tibet which have become an essential and effective part of border defence, state-run Global Times reported on October 19. "By the end of 2020, Tibet had built more than 600 well-off, high-standard border villages. The roads connecting border villages are also quite accessible. At least 130 border roads have been newly built or reconstructed with a total length of 3,080 km," it quoted a report by the state-run Xinhua news agency. The new law calls for the establishment of trade areas and border economic cooperation zones at the borders. It also calls for improving the ecological environment along the border besides epidemic control and maintaining flood and fire control. India and Bhutan are the two countries with which China is yet to finalise border agreements. On October 14, China and Bhutan signed an MoU firming up a three-step roadmap for expediting the boundary negotiations, which Beijing said will make a "meaningful contribution" to speed up the border talks and establishment of diplomatic ties. Last week, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said the developments along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh have "seriously disturbed" the peace and tranquillity in border areas, and this has obviously had an impact on the broader relationship too. The foreign secretary, in his remarks at a seminar on October 21 on "Leveraging China's Economy", also referred to foreign minister S Jaishankar's remarks that the ability of India and China to work together will determine the Asian century. "For this to materialise, peace and tranquillity in the border areas is a sine qua non. He (Jaishankar) has also clearly articulated that development of our ties can only be based on mutuality — mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests should guide this process," Shringla said. "We hope that the Chinese side will work with us to bring a satisfactory resolution to the current issues so as to make progress on our bilateral relations keeping in view each other's sensitivities, aspirations and interests," the foreign secretary said. While India-China border disputes cover 3,488-km along the LAC, the China-Bhutan dispute covers about 400 km. The new land border law was adopted amid the continued stand-off between the Indian and Chinese militaries in eastern Ladakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-passes-new-land-border-law-amid-military-standoff-with-india/articleshow/87245014.cms||---

The country recorded just over 1,08,500 fresh cases in the week ending Sunday (October 18-24), a drop of just 1,200 over the previous week’s tally of 1,09,760. In each of the preceding six weeks, India had seen double-digit fall in cases. Last week, infections had declined by over 27% while the week before had seen an 18% fall. States that witnessed an increase in infections include Bengal, where the numbers were up 41% over the previous week, Assam (42% rise) and Himachal Pradesh (25%). There has been a slight uptick in cases in some states of south India. Kerala reported a 2.5% rise in weekly numbers, with 61,010 fresh cases this week as opposed to 59,521 in previous seven days. Karnataka saw infections increase by almost 4% over the preceding week. Several other states where daily numbers have been very low saw a slight rise in infections during the week. In Delhi, there was a 9.2% rise in cases. Cases were up by nearly 60% in Chhattisgarh, by 9.4% in Punjab, 8.9% in Jammu & Kashmir and 6.7% in Bihar. In absolute terms, these states continue to report a low number of daily cases. Bengal is clearly in the midst of a spurt in infections. It reported 5,925 fresh cases during the week, the highest seven-day tally in over three months since July 11-18. There was a 60% rise in death toll this week, with 2,419 fatalities reported during the period as opposed to 1,515 in the preceding week. The rise is due to a large number of old deaths being added to the toll in Kerala as part of data reconciliation exercise.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-post-festive-week-decline-in-indias-covid-cases-slows-to-1/articleshow/87245092.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

And this is coming not only on the back of pent-up demand but also new opportunities opening up across sectors like green & renewable energy, electric vehicles, education, foodtech, aerospace, defence, consumer space and startups. Executive search firms said C-suite hiring mandates have gone up by around 30% over pre-pandemic levels. For some, placement mandates have nearly doubled. Accord India managing partner Sonal Agrawal, who is also global chair at AltoPartners, said companies are beefing up their management teams in the race towards funding and listing, prompted by the buoyant stock markets. “This includes startups and young companies that did not traditionally use executive search,” said Agrawal. While describing the current executive hiring scenario as “boom time” for search firms, Claricent Partners managing partner Jyoti Bowen Nath said hiring mandates have increased by over 20% from what the firm witnessed in the pre-pandemic period. Other than IT services, Nath said opportunities have emerged even in manufacturing, which executives are keen on lapping up. Executive Access India MD Ronesh Puri said there’s “hyper activity” on the C-suite hiring front in India. “This year has been a year of resignations and candidates are armed with multiple options on the job front. The placement mandates we receive have more than doubled,” said Puri. Page Executive India head Anshul Lodha echoed similar views. Lodha said the mandates the firm receives has gone up by 100% since a year ago. “In addition to other sectors where executive hiring has gone up, a number of traditional businesses are also looking to bring in new professionals at the top. As we move into the last few months of the calendar year, many companies are planning for the future and want to bring in new leadership, which complements their business,” said Lodha. Agrawal of Accord India said many companies have used the pandemic to review costs and pivot their business models and are now hiring as they implement new strategies. Even mid- to lower-levels are witnessing a cycle of resignations and replacement hiring. “Traditional companies have been disrupted by technology and have a demand for digital and tech talent. The ‘great resignation’ is causing churn, specially at mid and lower levels, driving replacement hiring,” said Agrawal. Industry sources said harried companies that are losing good talent are being forced to shell out more for new candidates. Puri said, “Some companies are said to be offering higher variable portions — many a times 30% higher than pre-pandemic salary levels.” Lodha said, “What we are seeing in the job market are new opportunities and bigger responsibilities which are being offered by companies. These make for an attractive proposition for candidates. Many are also offering equity in addition to cash components in salary.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/executive-hirings-up-30-over-pre-covid-levels/articleshow/87245121.cms||Namrata Singh

In his monthly radio address ‘Mann ki Baat’, Modi referred to the data from Bureau of Police Research and Development which shows that the number of women in police forces by 2020 has risen to 2.15 lakh from 1.05 lakh in 2014, the year he took over as PM. “...And I am not talking just about numbers. Today, the daughters of the country are performing even the toughest duties with full force and zeal,” the PM said, giving the example of how many women are currently undergoing training to become ‘specialised jungle warfare commandos’. “They will be a part of our Cobra Battalion... Today when we go to airports, metro stations or see government offices, brave women of the CISF are seen guarding every sensitive place,” he added. The PM said while gender diversity has a positive impact on the police force, the presence of women security personnel instils a sense of confidence among people, especially women. “They naturally feel connected to women security personnel. Because of the sensitivity in women, people tend to trust them more. These policewomen of ours are also becoming role models for lakhs of other daughters of the country,” Modi said while urging women police personnel to visit schools in their areas once they open and talk to the girls there. The PM also appreciated health workers for their “tireless hard work” to make the country’s vaccination drive an exemplery success. Highligting the country’s crossing of the 100-crore vaccine milestone on October 22, Modi said this is a result of the hard work of lakhs of health workers. In his radio address, he spoke about the new ‘Drone Policy’ highlighting how the government has done away with too many restrictions and regulations. “The new drone policy is already showing great results. India is one of the first countries in the world that is preparing digital records of land in its villages with the help of drones,” Modi said. He said the technology can be used in several fields, including in agriculture, and be used to save the lives of fishermen. The PM also urged people to get rid of “single use plastic” and to buy local items for Diwali to bring cheer and happiness to the poor, artisans and weavers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-police-no-longer-all-male-bastions-modi/articleshow/87245162.cms||---

While the absolute number of patients still remains low, many hospitals have reopened their Covid wards with some seeing even 20-25% more patients this week, as against a week ago. A doctor reported that while there were five cases in his hospital in the past two months, the previous week saw the same number.

---||India||Priority list being drawn up of kids with comorbidities for vaccine rollout||PUNE: A comprehensive priority list of children with comorbidities is being worked out for the combined launch of ZyCoV-D and Covaxin in India, according to a senior official from the Centre’s Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI). The two Covid vaccines meant for immunisation of children in the 2-17 age bracket are likely to be introduced together under the country’s Covid immunisation programme once this broader priority list is ready, the official said. “In addition to ZyCoV-D, we will also be looking at Covaxin data once the Drug Controller General of India gives emergency use approval. The plan is to bring out a comprehensive list of kids with comorbidities for priority,” the official said. DCGI has yet to approve Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for emergency use in children (2-17 years), despite a recommendation from the subject expert committee earlier. The regulatory body is seeking additional technical inputs on the vaccine. The SEC is part of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation. Zydus Cadila got emergency use approval for ZyCoV-D (12-17 years) from DCGI in August. DCGI’s approval is mandatory for the vaccine to be included in the government’s Covid immunisation programme. Experts, however, have been emphasising that there was no immediate need to vaccinate all children. This is because children have been largely spared of severe Covid disease. “The focus is on vaccinating the adult population at high risk. Vaccinating children, especially healthy ones, is not an immediate priority. Eventually, the government will have to vaccinate everyone, but there is no pressing need to inoculate all kids,” said Pramod Jog, a member of Maharashtra’s paediatric Covid task force.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/priority-list-being-drawn-up-of-kids-with-comorbidities-for-vaccine-rollout/articleshow/87245295.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||India||Surgeons question clearance for ‘made in India’ ear implant||It is touted as the first cochlear implant to be manufactured in India. It was approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in May 2021. However, several cochlear implant surgeons and their largest association have raised questions regarding safety and effectiveness as the new device has no publications on its performance or safety in any peer reviewed journal and does not have approval in any other country. The new implant called Neubio Bold is supposed to be the product of a technology transfer from a Swiss company called Neubio AG set up in 2017 to its Indian arm SwitzNeubio set up in 2019. Though it is a Swiss company, its product is used neither in Switzerland nor anywhere in Europe. One of the company directors, Parveen Khurana, in response to TOI’s queries, said that the company has applied for approval in Europe. According to the CDSCO’s classification of devices based on risk, a cochlear implant is a class D device, which are high risk surgically implanted devices that would remain in the body for at least 30 days and can be removed only through medical or surgical intervention. Such devices have a higher regulatory barrier and the approval can be given only by the central regulatory authority. The CDSCO when contacted said they had well defined medical rules in place and that medical devices were approved subject to compliance of these rules. The company admitted to the Cochlear Implant Group of India (CIGI), the largest association of cochlear surgeons, that its implant has been approved only in India. CDSCO approval to a device can be given without clinical investigation if it is based on an approved device already in the market with similar intended use, material of construction, and design characteristics. The company has to establish substantial equivalence with such a “predicate device” with respect to intended use, chemical composition, manufacturing process, performance, safety, effectiveness (a much higher barrier than efficacy, as efficacy is how a device works in controlled/ideal conditions while effectiveness is how well it works in the real world), biocompatibility etc. However, in this case, none of these are available in the public domain or to surgeons and the approval certificate for manufacturing of the new implant does not mention which predicate device it claims substantial equivalence with. Switz Neubio has claimed that the implant components are manufactured in Switzerland and shipped to India to be assembled, with only the electrodes being made in its Gurgaon unit, which has been inspected and approved by the CDSCO. It claimed to the CIGI that around 300 of its devices were implanted in Pakistan and Iraq. Anecdotally, the outcomes have been very good, stated the company in response to questions about surgical outcomes in these countries adding that that there were no adverse events or complications. The company stated that it intended to collect data from these countries and do studies and generate data to be published in peer reviewed journals. The CEO of Neubio AG, Jay Chang, was behind the South Korean company that launched the IES brand cochlear implant, which was implanted in children in India about ten years back. The company folded up leaving children who got the implants without any support system. Some even had to have the implant surgically removed and replaced by an implant from another company. “Well-structured clinical trials are performed in most countries for new medical devices, newer drugs, etc. Even the government’s own DRDO-researched cochlear implant system, Sravan, is undergoing DCGI approved clinical trials, as we speak. When we are so by-the-book with our own product, how did this new device, with supposed transfer-of-technology (TOT) from Switzerland, receive licenses for manufacturing, sale and export from CDSCO? There have been no trials or sales in Switzerland or anywhere else in Europe with this CI system,” pointed out CIGI President Dr Sunil Narayan Dutt. Senior cochlear implant surgeon Dr JM Hans, who is supporting the new implant “as it has been approved by the government”, accused CIGI of trying to keep out a cheap implant which could benefit poorer children, instead of facilitating it. However, the current price of the implant is Rs 5.35 lakh, just a few thousand rupees less than the cheapest of the cochlear implants being sold in India by large multinationals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/surgeons-raise-questions-about-clearance-given-to-made-in-india-ear-implant/articleshow/87245323.cms||Rema Nagarajan
---||India||Congress ‘convinced’ Captain Amarinder trying to wean away Hindu voters||NEW DELHI: With Amarinder Singh finally announcing that he will launch a party and ally with BJP, Congress is convinced that he is angling to wean away Hindu voters in urban constituencies to dent the party in the Punjab assembly elections in early 2022. The idea behind the Congress renegade’s plan, as articulated by him, is what the party always suspected when it alleged that ‘Captain’ as Punjab chief minister was in league with BJP and Akali Dal. According to Congress sources, Singh is looking to polarise Hindu voters against the party. His idea is to provoke the key demographic against Congress by playing up the “Pakistan” and “security-terror” threats. Singh is expected to focus on his nemesis and Punjab Congress president Navjot Sidhu’s visit to Pakistan and his embrace of the Pakistan army chief. The former Congress satrap has been citing Sidhu and his Pakistan trip for a while now. The Hindu voters comprise an important segment in cities and towns of Punjab. Given Singh’s focus, many believe that Congress will have to assure the urban voters about its “mainstream leanings” to neutralise the Captain’s attempt. The general belief is that Singh is not concerned about gaining Sikh voters and his caveat for joining hands with BJP — protests over farm laws should be resolved — is more to provide him a cover to join hands with the saffron party. BJP has become a red rag for the Sikh-rural populace and Amarinder cannot think of joining hands with it without a resolution to the farm protests. In view of the challenge that may arise if Amarinder’s yet to be launched party brings about an aggregation of votes in league with BJP and splinter Akali outfits, Congress is expected to announce its election related committees to face the task. Many believe that the party will be putting as the head of the “campaign committee” and in key positions going into the elections, leaders that are well positioned to appeal to the urban voters. According to a leader, Congress faces a stronger challenge among urban and Hindu voters from AAP than from the possible front to be floated by Amarinder Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-convinced-captain-amarinder-trying-to-wean-away-hindu-voters/articleshow/87245327.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The NCB has arrested eight people, including actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan, after the cruise ship raid. “Main witness in the case has made starting revelations. I will meet both chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Monday. In my opinion, the government should set up a special investigation team to probe the involvement of organised gangs in collaboration with NCB officials,” Malik told TOI. “All raids conducted by the NCB under the leadership of Sameer Wankhede were fake and fabricated,’’ he claimed. Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole endorsed Malik’s demand for a high-level probe into the new evidence. “From the statement of the witness [Sail], it appears that Rs 25 crore was demanded to close the case against Aryan Khan. There is a question mark over the credibility and integrity of the NCB, which is targeting the film industry. In the recent past, central agencies are making all-out efforts to destabilise and defame the MVA government,” Patole said. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the state police should take suo motu cognisance of the disclosures made by Sail. “It was an attempt to defame the MVA government. The CM had observed that NCB raids were for defaming the state; Mumbai police had done more work and seizures,” he tweeted. But Pravin Darekar from BJP, the opposition leader in the legislative council, claimed Malik has planned an elaborate programme to frame the Centre and central agencies in the cruise case. Reacting to Raut’s tweet, he said it is all being done to prove that the NCB and zonal director’s actions are false. It is for this reason that a video would have now been made viral, said Darekar. Malik was the first politician to raise doubts about the integrity and credentials of Kiran Gosavi, another independent witness of the NCB. Later, it was found that he was wanted by Thane and Pune police in a cheating cases. After Malik’s disclosure, Gosavi is absconding and Pune police have issued a lookout notice against him. Malik had found that besides Gosavi, BJP activist Bhanushali too was a witness. Also of the 14 persons detained, eight were arrested and three were released, including a relative of a senior BJP leader. “The entire operations of the NCB are suspicious. Fletcher Patel, a family friend of Wankhede, was witness in at least four cases. It is against the guidelines prescribed by the Supreme Court,” Malik said.

Following talks with forest officials, the pup was later safely released back to the same location it had been picked up from.  “I was rather surprised to learn from my contacts in Igatpuri that a puppy was forcibly put inside a trap-cage to lure and catch a leopard. The puppy was left alone in that camouflaged cage for over two days, so its plight was noticed by some locals, who also tried to give him water and food. I spoke to the forest officials, and told them it is wrong to use a puppy like this,” said the Navi Mumbai head of PFA, Vijay Rangare. A video clip purportedly shows a black puppy locked in a cage as leopard bait in Igatpuri. According to Rangare, there have been some incidents of man-animal conflict in the town.

The law shields the existing illegal structures built on public land and will not allow any new religious structures or construction in public place without permission.  However, the law will not protect structures if the case is pending in court. The law comes one and a half months after Mysuru district administration started demolition of shrines which had come up on public land without authorisation. Demolition of Mahadevamma temple evoked strong reaction across political spectrum, forcing government to hurriedly come up with a bill to protect such shrines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-law-for-shrines-on-public-land-kicks-in/articleshow/87245418.cms||---
---||India||Ahead of Bihar bypolls, Lalu questions Congress utility as ally||PATNA: RJD president Lalu Prasad on Sunday questioned the utility of Congress as an ally in assembly election and drew sharp reaction from the grand old party as well as the NDA leaders for calling AICC in-charge for Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, a ‘Bhakchonhar’ (imprudent person). “Should we cede assembly seats to Congress for losing and even forfeiting the deposits?” Lalu asked while responding to media queries in New Delhi before leaving for Patna. He was referring to the assembly byelection in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur in Bihar on October 30. RJD refused to cede Kusheshwar Asthan to Congress, which had finished runner-up there in the 2020 assembly polls. Now, RJD and Congress are contesting from both the seats against JD(U). “What is it about an alliance with Congress,” Lalu retorted when asked about a virtual collapse of their alliance in Bihar. When asked about Das’s allegation that RJD and BJP had reached a secret deal and that Congress would contest all the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar in the parliamentary polls, Lalu said, “Bhakta Charan is a ‘Bhakchonhar’ (imprudent person).” Lalu, in fact, reminded people about Congress’s poor strike rate in the 2020 assembly polls in Bihar, which paved the way for the return of Nitish Kumar-led NDA government to power. Congress was allotted 70 seats as part of seat-sharing among the grand alliance partners, but could win only 19 seats. Reacting to Lalu’s remarks, Congress MLA Shakeel Ahmed said his derogatory statement for Das exhibited his anti-Dalit mentality and autocratic attitude towards the depressed sections of the society. Congress state spokesperson Asit Nath Tiwari said Lalu’s statement was not against Das, but the Dalit community. “Lalu should apologise from the members of Dalit community,” he added. BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said Lalu spoke his mind and showed his frustration that he had to suffer for years together due to Congress. Lalu was booked in fodder scam cases during Congress regime at the Centre. CBI filed chargesheet against him during the same regime and he had to go to jail for the first time at the behest of Congress, BJP’s OBC Morcha national general secretary said. Former deputy CM and BJP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi also condemned the RJD chief’s statement. In a tweet, SuMo, however, said that it would not affect the relationship between RJD and Congress as the latter would continue to suffer humiliation at the behest of the former.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-bihar-bypolls-lalu-questions-congress-utility-as-ally/articleshow/87245446.cms||Madan Kumar

Dismissing the father’s contention that he is unable to raise the maintenance amount, as he has to look after his old mother, divorced sister and her daughter, the bench also held that “children must be the first priority of a parent in the matter of maintenance”. “Before the petitioner’s birth in 2001, his parents had separated and he has been residing with mother. Both of his parents are serving as teachers, each earning a salary of over Rs 48,000. It is, therefore, apparent that both are equally responsible to share maintenance as well as education expenses of their son,” a division bench comprising Justice Atul Chandurkar and Justice GN Sanap said. “Even if it is assumed, for the sake of argument, that there are some other persons dependent on the father, the child must be his first priority in the matter of maintenance. If he fails to share the maintenance and expenses, then the mother would be required to bear the unnecessary burden,” the bench added, while asking the father to enhance the monthly maintenance to Rs 7,500 from Rs 5,000, with effect from October 27, 2015, the date on which the student had filed the petition. The youngster, scoring 93% in Class X exam, had moved the HC after he was finding it difficult to pay the fees of the course at IIT Dhanbad. Till now, his education and other expenses were shouldered by his mother, while his father used to pay him Rs 5,000 a month, as fixed by a court. The petitioner had prayed for enhancing the maintenance to Rs 15,000, so that he could pay the college fees. “It is seen that the petitioner, who happens to be a meritorious child, has been made to face this unfortunate situation. Considering his plight and needs, he was constrained to knock the judiciary’s doors,” the judges observed. The parents were granted divorce on July 21, 2009, through mutual consent. The petitioner contended that his father, teacher at a zilla parishad school, did not bother to maintain him nor took care of his well-being, after his birth. On the other hand, his mother faced difficulties while bringing him up with her meagre salary, the petition said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/both-divorced-parents-equally-responsible-for-childs-education-bombay-high-court/articleshow/87245480.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Bangladesh law minister has been quoted in media reports as saying, “There are provisions in the speedy trial tribunals to accept CCTV footage as evidence.” The cases, he said, would be sent to trial as soon as police investigations are concluded On October 21, Bangladesh police identified a Cumilla resident Iqbal Hossain as the culprit of the incident that sparked off the riots. According to reports, Hossain was arrested by the authorities in Cox’s Bazar where he had fled. While there have been political protests in India, the Modi government has maintained a studied silence, reposing faith in the Sheikh Hasina government publicly. PM Sheikh Hasina said at an event on Sunday, “Certain quarters with vested interests are disseminating propaganda aimed at creating a communal divide.” She, however, did not name any one. “No matter how much good work we do, there is a quarter that is occupied with discrediting Bangladesthey want? They don’t want the normal democratic process to continue in this country,” she said, urging people to be wary of the attempts to destabilise the country. Meanwhile, Hasina reached out to Modi to congratulate India on crossing the 100-crore vaccine milestone. In her letter, she said, Bangladesh had also administered around 60 million vaccines. Thanking India for resuming vaccine exports to Bangladesh, she hoped this would remain uninterrupted. India had stopped exports when the deadly second wave hit in April-May this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-plans-speedy-trials-in-temple-violence-case/articleshow/87245509.cms||---

While there is a lag in capturing trends, insurers say that there has been a significant jump from September in non-Covid hospitalisations. “We are seeing an increase in hospitalisations due to dengue, respiratory diseases and other non-Covid claims. The size of these claims has also gone up, perhaps due to the additional protection that has to be taken by hospitals. We will watch this to see whether the increase is temporal or structural,” said ICICI Lombard General Insurance MD & CEO Bhargav Dasgupta, following the company’s results. Policybazaar, one of the largest distributors of individual health covers, has been seeing an increase in the number of non-Covid calls. The calls are for infectious diseases, dengue and other viral fever. “We are also seeing an increase in accidental injuries,” said Amit Chabra, chief of health business at Policybazaar. According to Dr Dev Pahlajani, head of interventional cardiology at Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai, incidences of acute coronary syndrome, sudden heart attacks and cardiac arrest have gone up 40% in the last six to eight months. “There is a surge in circulatory conditions which warrants a close evaluation,” he said. He added that even patients who have been stable for years are coming in with acute heart emergencies. The trend is visible in most cardiac departments, he said. According to Niva Bupa Health Insurance director (underwriting, products & claims) Bhabatosh Mishra, Covid brought down health claims last year as people were locked in, avoided hospitalisation and delayed elective surgeries. “There is no major change in the number of emergency procedures like appendicitis, but cases like gall bladder surgeries, which can be delayed, are going up,” said Mishra. He added that given the higher than usual monsoon in places, there has been a spike in dengue including Bengaluru and Hyderabad, in addition to Mumbai and Delhi. “People have lost jobs, their source of income and probably sat idle at home for months. Those factors combined with lack of exercise can build up the stress levels, putting them at risk of heart conditions,” said Dr Pahlajani. He added that people have been missing out on routine checks on sugar and blood pressure levels due to the pandemic. Covid survivors too may see symptoms of inflammation after months. In Mumbai, hospital beds are largely occupied by dengue, malaria and chikungunya cases and not Covid at present, said Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital. Mishra expects cases to remain elevated as the monsoon is not over yet. Also, many of the elective surgeries are usually scheduled for winter as, given India’s weather, surgical wounds heal better and risk of monsoon infections are lower.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/health-insurers-see-huge-surge-in-non-covid-claims/articleshow/87245762.cms||Mayur Shetty

The move comes within days of private equity firm TPG Rise Climate announcing plans to pump in $1 billion into Tata Motors’s passenger electric vehicles division at a valuation of $9.1 billion. Shailesh Chandra, president of Tata Motors’s passenger vehicles business unit, said the company has a strong product launch plan for electrics, with expectations of 20% sales coming from green powertrains over four to five years. “With just two green products right now (Nexon and Tigor EVs), we are getting bookings of 3,000-3,500 units per month. However, we are able to supply only around 1,000 units… We are now lining up new investments to the tune of $2 billion just for electrics and this would be used to add 10 new green vehicles, boost production capacity and charging infrastructure, and create IP (intellectual property),” Chandra told TOI here. In September, the company had said that cumulative sales of electrics had crossed 10,000 units, with main contribution coming from Nexon. It recently launched an upgraded Tigor electric sedan, and is hoping that demand for EVs will remain strong as central and state governments offer benefits to promote green technologies and vehicle charging network gets dense. While it remains tight-lipped about future product plans, the company is understood to be considering electrifying some of its existing petrol/diesel products that may include the Altros hatchback and the newly launched Punch mini SUV. Chandra said 10 new passenger vehicles will be a mix of cars and SUVs. Asked whether these would also include all-new ‘electric only’ products, he said, “This will surely include the ‘born electric’ products, which would be exclusively developed EVs.” Tata Motors has also seen a surge in sales of its broader passenger vehicles business, with good demand for models such as Nexon SUV, Tiago and Altros SUVs, and premium off-roaders Harrier and Safari. Notwithstanding production constraints due to semiconductor shortages, the company is averaging monthly sales of around 30,000 units over the past few months. Chandra said that the Punch — a mass-selling product — will add further strong inflows into its domestic volumes. It is expected that with Punch, Tata Motors’s monthly volumes may cross 40,000 units, almost challenging Hyundai’s position as the second-largest car seller in India. “We are not chasing ranks. We are fully focused on our products and their success.” He said that a larger share of SUVs into the company’s portfolio, which could go up to 60% in the coming years, will aid profitability.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tatas-motors-to-invest-rs-15000-crore-in-electric-vehicles/articleshow/87245794.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Bengaluru||Projects on slow track, Bengaluru may see power outages till August 2022||BENGALURU: Coal shortage aside, the projects of Bengaluru Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) to replace overhead cables with underground 11 kv lines have created a serious power outage problem. It is expected that the power outages are likely to continue in some parts of the city till August 2022 because of the ongoing work. Data shared by Beccom suggests that as of September 30, only 60 per cent of the underground work has been completed in the city. The areas which are likely to see continued power cuts over the next six months to one year are mostly the IT corridor areas, such as parts of Whitefield, Bommanahalli, Mahadevpura, Jalahalli, Koramangala, Madiwala, Bellandur and KR Puram. The progress of the projects in these areas is between 5 to 47 per cent only. Maximum progress has been seen in the Malleswaram and Jayanagar sub-divisions with only 15 to 20 per cent of the work pending. While the serious shortage of coal availability in the country has created a panic, the frequent power outages are said to be doubled in Bengaluru on account of these projects on the streets of the city. Multiple energy department officials TOI spoke to suggested that the government has stopped all ongoing underground projects as it was creating a serious panic among Bengalureans and industries regarding restarting of business at full scale after the Covid-19 pandemic. This apart, the continued heavy rain has also hampered progress. There is expected to be a further delay in completion of the projects by Bescom that may lead to an “artificial scarcity” of power in the city. Of the 52 major underground cabling projects, 13 are scheduled to be completed by August 2022 and 39 by October 29, 2021. “Most of the projects have overrun the time schedule due to Covid-19 second wave and delays in contractors embarking upon them. It will take us some time to compensate for the loss of time and complete the work,” said an energy department official. However, Bescom managing director P Rajendra Cholan said the electricity supply company was confident that the projects would be completed at the earliest. “On account of the coal shortage, there was a serious confusion that Bescom was embarking on power cuts. However, this had nothing to do with the power cuts. Our primary reason for cutting power in select areas at different times is the UG cabling. We expect this to be completed in the coming months,” Cholan said. Overall, the cabling work is spread across 7,085 kilometres of the city, of which 2,829 kilometres of work is to be completed. The state faced serious power cuts for three days on the trot between October 6 to October 9 during the evening. On those three days, due to a shortage of coal, the Karnataka government apprised the Centre in an internal communication that it had to cut 600 to 700 MW every day and load shedding had taken place.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/projects-on-slow-track-bluru-may-see-power-outages-till-august-2022/articleshow/87245820.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

None was injured in the incident.Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation (BMRC) sources said the accident took place at 6.15am on Sunday near the Udupi Garden signal while the launching gantry standing close to 40ft above was auto-launched. Instead of taking support on its own leg, the heavy machine collapsed, resting on the piers of the rail pillars and stood atop. While many workers were present at the site, all were safe. A BMRC team found that a mechanical failure had caused the accident. The authorities said the launching girder will be taken down safely and further action will be carried out as per contract provisions.Anjum Parwez, managing director of BMRC, said the girder slipped from the supporting platform. “All the workers and engineers were at the ground level at the time of the accident. The girder will be brought down using a crane by afternoon,” he added. The mishap site is part of Phase 2 of Namma Metro where the BMRC is building an elevated line (yellow) from RV Road to Bommasandra, including a Metro rail-cum-flyover for motorists from Ragigudda to Silk Board, sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/launching-gantry-collapses-none-hurt/articleshow/87245826.cms||---

It’s not yet clear from where Muhammad Tauqir Mahmood, a dentist from Bismillah Colony, near Gurappanapalya, Bengaluru, was picked up. Mahmood is accused no.1 in a case registered against four Bengaluru youths on September 19, 2020. Others in the FIR are Zuhab Hameed alias Shakeel Munna, a computer application specialist from Tilak Nagar, Irfan Nasir alias Irfi, a rice merchant from Fraser Town and Shihab from Gurappanapalya. Earlier, NIA had arrested two accused Ahamed Abdul Cader and Irfan Nasir. Mahmood is the third person arrested in the case. “Probe revealed Mahmood, in association with co-accused, raised funds, radicalised and recruited Muslim youths of a Quran Circle group and illegally sent them to Syria to join IS. In 2013, Mahmood and his associate had visited Syria illegally to liaise with Daesh leadership and had offered the support of Indian Muslims,” NIA officials said in a statement. The NIA sleuths learnt about Mahmood and associates after they arrested Abdur Rahman, an ophthalmologist from Bengaluru, on terrorism charges in another case. Rahman reportedly revealed he had travelled to Syria in 2013-14 with the help of Mahmood and Munna.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/nia-arrests-bengaluru-man-in-terror-case/articleshow/87245827.cms||---

Inaugurated on October 23, the exhibition with 172 displays will be open to the public till November 13. The exhibition witnessed a footfall of over 100 fans of the cartoonist on Day One. The exhibits include 50 photos of Laxman and 72 cartoons and illustrations by him. They include his political cartoons and illustrations, unpublished doodles, his sketches of Tenali Rama, Wagle Ki Duniya, a TV comedy show based on Laxman’s quintessential common man. “Laxman was very fond of crows. We have also displayed some of his crow cartoons and also the Koravanji cartoons,” said VG Narendra, cartoonist and managing trustee of the Indian Institute of Cartoonists. Narendra recalled that Laxman was an inspiration to many. “I grew up appreciating and imitating him, to begin with, before I discovered my own style. He supported us when the IIC was founded in 2001. The gallery was established in 2007. Laxman had visited the gallery in 2009 and was appreciative of the efforts. He was so happy about the first and only cartoon gallery in India,” Narendra said. “Laxman stood alone as an artist caricaturing life’s important moments, simple humdrum moments, moments that passed by us which he brought back the next morning for a revision. He stood alone as a raconteur and weaved stories around incidents that we had no time to see or hear and brought a smile to our lips every morning,” read the IAC’s statement. The expo is open from 10am to 6pm at Midford Garden House, Trinity Circle, MG Road.

I have announced a scheme to build 5,000 houses in Sindgi taluk under Basava housing scheme and another 2,000 houses under Amrut Grameen Yojna,” Bommai said. He said his government has plans to upgrade the roads across the taluk and introduce an irrigation scheme to provide water to the lift irrigation schemes of Chimmalgi, Mulawadi and Gutti Basavanna. Countering the allegations levelled by the Congress that BJP had a tacit understanding with JD(S), Bommai said: “We have no understanding with any political party. Our understanding is with the farmers, youths, women, Dalits and people of Sandgi.” Accusing the Congress functionaries of making baseless allegations that the BJP is distributing money among voters, he said it’s an indication that the opposition party is losing. Union minister for coal and mines, parliamentary affairs Pralhad Joshi campaigned in Hangal assembly constituency for BJP candidate Shivaraj Sajjanar and slammed leader of opposition Siddaramaiah and other Congress functionaries for their comments on the achievement of administering 100 crore doses of Covid vaccine.  Meanwhile, KPCC president DK Shivakumar criticised the BJP’s manifesto, which was released by Bommai and former chief minister BS Yediyurappa. “The BJP has a double-engine government but why have they not yet implemented the schemes mentioned in the manifesto?,” he questioned while addressing the media in Haveri. Siddaramaiah attended a convention of Koli community and reiterated the “commitment of the Congress for the welfare of backward classes” as he sought votes for party candidates Ashok Munaguli (Sindgi) and Srinivas V Mane (Hangal).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/at-sindgi-cm-promises-7000-houses-and-water-for-1l-acres-of-farmland/articleshow/87245835.cms||---

The boy was counselled and reunited with his parents. South Western Railway sources here said the incident unfolded on Friday evening after a man approached the ‘Nanhe Faristeh’ team of the RPF at the KSR Bengaluru City railway station entrance and informed them that his nephew, a 16-year-old boy, was missing from home. The man told the officers that the boy had sent a video on the cellphone and he appeared to be contemplating suicide. The video showed the boy under a train. The team identified that the teen was on the premises of the City Railway station; photographs of the boy and the video were circulated on WhatsApp to RPF staff at the station. The staff split into six teams to locate the boy, who was soon found under a coach of Bengaluru City-New Delhi Express Special train. The boy was counselled and handed over to his parents.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Holding on to minority vote is Congress’s challenge||BENGALURU: The opposition Congress’ greatest fear is whether the JD(S) will split the minority votes, which are essential for its candidates to win both the seats. It stems from the party’s defeat in the Basavakalyan bypoll held in June. JD(S) candidate Syed Yasrab Ali Quadri had secured over 10,000 votes and helped BJP’s Sharanu Salagar to win Basavakalyan. The bypoll became necessary because of the death of Congress’ B Narayan Rao who had won the seat in 2018. The Congress has fielded Rao’s wife hoping to ride the sympathy wave. “This is the reason we are attacking the JD(S) by calling it the ‘B’ team of the BJP. We want to send across a message to Muslims that their votes to JD(S) will help the BJP,” said a senior Congress functionary. While the JD(S) has little presence in Hangal, it has some presence in Sindgi, considering that it had won the 2018 election. The byelection to Sindgi was necessitated as the seat fell vacant following the death of party legislator MC Managuli, whose son Ashok Managuli is now the Congress candidate. Both former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and former CM HD Kumaraswamy have been campaigning in Sindgi for some time now. They want to pump up votes for JD(S) candidate Naziya Shakeel Angadi and cut into the Congress vote bank to send out a message that anyone who ditches JD(S) won’t taste victory that easily. The Congress has been in talks with 5-6 JD(S) MLAs. This has irked Kumaraswamy the most. His recent attack on the RSS is also a part of his strategy to appeal to the Muslims, a JD(S) leader said. “JD(S) might get some Muslim votes because of its candidates, but beyond that, I don’t think the party has the capacity to alter the poll outcome,” said Gangappa, a political observer in Sindgi . While Hangal has around 40,000 Muslim voters, Sindgi has around 35,000. “No doubt, Muslims are big in number in both the constituencies. But how many of them will vote for the JD(S) because it has fielded a candidate from the community is a big question. If it gets more votes, then the Congress will be in trouble,” said Basavaraj Patil, another political observer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/holding-on-to-minority-vote-is-congs-challenge/articleshow/87245837.cms||Anil Gejji
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Bandh in Kolar Gold Fields today over SP office shifting||BENGALURU: Reports that the office of the Superintendent of Police (SP), Kolar Gold Fields (KGF), will be closed down to make way for the creation of an SP’S office in the newly formed Vijayanagara district and the KGF police force will be merged into the Kolar district police have sparked protests . The protests escalated after the government on Wednesday transferred the SP, KGF, Ilakkiya Karunagaran, without announcing a replacement. An apolitical federation of pro-people organizations has called for a bandh from 6 am to 6 pm on Monday in KGF and Bangarpet taluks in protest the move. Local people fear Karunagaran was the KGF’s last SP. “Senior IPS officers, in a bid to save money for the government and make politicians happy, are sacrificing the KGF SP’s office,” a police official from KGF told TOI. “If the news is indeed real, it is unfortunate. The biggest challenge for the cops in KGF is to protect the 12,000-acre land belonging to Bharat Gold Mines Ltd (BGML) and the closed gold mine. There are still valuables in the closed mines. Many persons, who had sneaked into the mine to steal, have died of suffocation. There should be an SP post to handle all these issues. A deputy superintendent cannot handle the KGF. If that happens, the land of BGML will be a cakewalk for realty sharks,” a former SP of KGF said. The SP’s office is one of the oldest SP offices in Karnataka. Established during the British Raj, the colonial hangover is apparent in the names of some stations. KGF police has 965 personnel on its rolls. The KGF police district covers two taluks, KGF and Bangarpet, of the Kolar revenue district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bandh-in-kgf-today-over-sp-office-shifting/articleshow/87245840.cms||---

The accused is Ramanjalu, a resident of Chinnappanahalli, near HAL. Head constable Mubaraq Ali sustained a leg fracture in the incident. Police said a traffic police team was on drunk-and-drive checks duty on HAL Main Road and stopped Ramanjalu’s SUV for inspection. The alcometer showed that the suspect was drunk. Ali asked Ramanjalu to park his vehicle on the roadside. But Ramanjalu allegedly abused Ali and tried to run over him. Ali sustained a fracture in his left leg and Ramanjalu hit his car to a compound after ramming Ali. Traffic policemen caught him and handed him over to law-and-order police. While traffic police have booked Ramanjalu for drunk driving, HAL police booked him for attempt to murder, criminal intimidation and obstructing a policeman from discharging his duty. Ramanjalu told police that he mistakenly pressed the accelerator instead of the brake. Further probe is on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bank-manager-held-for-trying-to-knock-down-traffic-cop/articleshow/87245842.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Many vehicle owners switching to CNG due to high petrol, diesel prices||BENGALURU: Skyrocketing petrol and diesel prices are forcing many vehicle owners in the city to switch to compressed natural gas (CNG). The number of vehicles running on the cleaner fuel in the state has gone up by 16% in the last 50 days. The rise is sharper in Bengaluru: At least 20%. On Sunday, petrol was sold at Rs 111.34 per litre and diesel at Rs 102.23. GAIL Gas officials said their scheme launched on September 10 to promote CNG-run vehicles has been receiving good response in the city. “A total of 1,690 new CNG vehicles across the state, including 1,300 in Bengaluru, were added since the launch of the promotional scheme. They include autorickshaws, cars, LCVs and HCVs,” said a GAIL Gas official. Karnataka now has 12,300 CNG-run vehicles, including 1,690 newly migrated vehicles, under the GAIL Gas scheme. The total number of CNG-run vehicles now in Bengaluru is 8,000. GAIL Gas statistics show average daily CNG sales too have increased from 16,000kg in August, 20,000kg per in September and 23,500kg in October. There are 39 CNG filling stations across the city. Another 50 stations are expected to come up by 2022-23. “A prepaid CNG fuel card ranging from Rs 14,000 to Rs 25,000 is being offered to customers so that they can fill free CNG anywhere in the city for that amount,” said an official. Many motorists in the city admitted to considering switching to CNG. “Fuel prices are being hiked on a daily basis. I cannot afford to purchase an electric vehicle for now. But my major concern is shortage of CNG filling stations in core city areas. But we hope that the government won’t increase CNG prices,” said Anand T, a resident of Kengeri. A GAIL Gas official said: “We have taken a decision not to hike CNG price in Bengaluru despite the increase in input cost of gas by 62% and have kept it at the same level at Rs 53/kg.” “The CNG promotional scheme is providing double savings to the public, which has been currently bearing the burden of an increase in fuel prices in the country. People opting for CNG vehicles are contributing towards the betterment of the environment,” said an official. In Bengaluru, CNG stations are being planned at Banashankari, Lalbagh, Koramangala, KH Road, Nagarbhavi, JP Nagar, Ramamurthy Nagar, Mahadevapura, Kanakapura Road, Mysuru Road, Vijayanagar, Singhasandra, Rajarajeswari Nagar, etc. “Most vehicle manufacturing companies are offering company-fitted CNG vehicles through their dealers in Bengaluru. Customers can also convert their existing auto, car or taxi through retro-fitment centres to avail the benefits. Once CNG kits are installed, vehicle owners need to complete the endorsement in RC book after visiting the RTO,” said an official. On the affordability front, an official said the running cost of a CNG auto is about Rs 1.1/km compared to Rs 2.6/km on LPG auto, resulting in savings of about 55%. The running cost of a CNG car is about Rs 2.6/km compared to Rs 7.5/km (petrol) and Rs 5.90/km (diesel), resulting in savings of about 65% and 55%, respectively. In the case of CNG LCVs, HCVs and buses, savings is around 44% compared to diesel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/many-vehicle-owners-switching-to-cng/articleshow/87245844.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

It must be re-examined and re-evaluated with the changing environment,” he said at the conclusion of the three-day conclave celebrating the golden jubilee of the 1971 Indo-Pak war victory at the Air Force station-Yelahanka here.Stating that risk was inherent in international relations, Chaudhari said informed management of this risk must drive our decision making. “From a bipolar to a unipolar to a multipolar world, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution. Our geostrategic outlook needs to be refined accordingly. Our vibrant diversity as a nation, gives us the inherent flexibility and we must leverage this across the region,” he said.Delivering the closing address, he emphasised the need to be future-ready to meet the dynamic changes in the nature and scope of modern warfare along with the need to synergise planning processes and objectives. He also pointed out the significance of an “all of nation approach” in pursuing national interests.“In 1971, our cause was just and the ends justified well the ways and means. While it was true that an “all of nation approach” was used to attain our national objectives then, we cannot afford to rest on our laurels. As brought out by the chief of defence staff and the defence secretary, the nature and scope of warfare has changed dramatically and we need to be certain that we are future ready in this aspect,” Chaudhari said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/geopolitical-ties-need-continuous-re-evaluation/articleshow/87245846.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||IISc study: Defects in 2D materials predicted to modulate water flow||Bengaluru: Researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) have, in a recent study, published what they call “unexpected results” that throws light on how two-dimensional (2D) materials can modulate water flow.Two-dimensional materials, which consist of a few layers of atoms, are currently being explored for various applications, including seawater desalination, oil-water separation, and osmotic power harvesting. “These materials often contain imperfections or defects, which can alter the properties of the material. Although defects in materials are usually thought to increase frictional forces, computer simulations show a notably different picture,” the researchers said.The IISc said that these results have been recently published in the journal Nano Letters by Ananth Govind Rajan, assistant professor in the department of chemical engineering at IISc and Aniruddha Seal, an undergraduate student from NISER. “The team combined quantum-mechanical calculations of the charge distribution in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a 2D material, with classical molecular dynamics simulations of water interacting with hBN. Molecular dynamics simulations allow researchers to model the trajectories of atoms and molecules and to make predictions regarding frictional behaviour at the nanoscale,” the IISc said.It added that surprisingly, the researchers found that certain defects — such as the nitrogen vacancy (where a nitrogen atom is missing from the hBN lattice) and the Stone-Wales defect (where a boron-nitrogen bond is rotated by 90 degrees in the hBN lattice — led to a reduction in water-hBN friction. “On the contrary, a boron vacancy increased water-hBN friction almost threefold,” IISc said, adding that the researchers quantified these predictions in terms of the “slip length”, a quantity that determines to what extent water molecules “slip” on the hBN surface.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/iisc-study-defects-in-2d-materials-predicted-to-modulate-water-flow/articleshow/87245849.cms||---

The Delhi high court order setting aside directors’ appointments by the Banks Board Bureau (BBB) on the grounds of jurisdiction has thrown into question the appointment of the chief executives too. The erosion of capital has made it difficult for them to grow business or implement an overdue wage revision for employees. Also, the government announcement of privatising some even as an earlier plan to merge them hangs fire has added to the uncertainty. In addition to appointing general managers and directors, the BBB had recommended the names of Inderjeet Singh and Suchita Gupta for the position of chairman and MD position at United India Insurance and National Insurance respectively this year. Earlier, Anjan Dey was chosen to head the Oriental Insurance Company. The bureau had also recommended Siddharth Mohanty, Mini Ipe and B C Patnaik as MDs in LIC. Earlier this month, the Delhi HC, in response to a writ petition filed by National Insurance general manager Ravi, said that appointments made pursuant to that of directors challenged in the writ petition are liable to be set aside. “Liberty is with the respondent No.1 to make selection and appointments of general manager/directors in accordance with law,” the order said. In January 2020, the boards of the three non-life companies had approved a proposal to merge. However, following the outbreak of the Covid pandemic, the merger process was put on hold. But in the Budget speech for FY22, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government would move ahead with the privatisation of two public sector banks and one general insurance company in FY22. Meanwhile, with their finances in a precarious position, the three non-life companies have been shutting offices to cut costs. All three companies have seen their solvency ratios — the insurance industry equivalent of capital adequacy ratio for banks — shrink below the mandated level. The companies can continue doing business because of government ownership. Senior officials in the industry feel that, given the state of finances and liabilities, it is unlikely that the government would be able to privatise any company. A merged entity too would not be strong. The only feasible option might be to transfer the operations to New India Assurance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/state-non-life-insurance-companies-face-uncertainty/articleshow/87245839.cms||Mayur Shetty

The fund requirements of CPSEs are being worked out and the third tranche of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be launched by December, the official added. Bharat Bond ETF invests in debt of public sector companies. The ETF currently invests only in ‘AAA’-rated bonds of public sector companies. The funds raised through the debt ETF helps in smoothening borrowing plans of the participating CPSEs or public sector banks. It also helps them in meeting their capital expenditure needs. The second tranche of the Bharat Bond ETF, which was launched in July 2020, was oversubscribed more than three times, collecting about Rs 11,000 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bharat-bond-government-eyes-over-rs-10000-crore-by-december/articleshow/87245912.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Cracker prices take spark out of Diwali||Vijayawada: After essential commodities and fuel prices, it is now the turn of crackers and fireworks to irk the public with skyrocketing prices. The cost of unbranded crackers has increased by 18 per cent this season and the prices of branded ones in the city’s markets are up by as much as 23 per cent. Diwali is an important festival where fireworks play a significant role. But due to the increase in prices of fuel and chemicals such as sulphur and phosphorus, the cost of firecrackers has gone up significantly this year. Wholesale fireworks traders in Bhavanipuram say they are witnessing poor sales due to the price hike. “Diwali is approaching and we have procured huge quantities of stocks. People had to scale down the celebrations last year due to Covid-19 restrictions. We anticipated a huge sale this year as the situation has improved. But the sudden hike in the prices of crackers has affected us. Buyers are cutting short their lists after comparing the prices of crackers with that of last year,” said N Mallikarjuna Rao, a wholesale firecracker trader. On the other hand, retail traders are staring at uncertainty over the allocation of shops. When TOI contacted the estates department of Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC), officials said they were making arrangements to set up fireworks shops at Swaraj Maidan (PWD grounds), Makineni Basavapunnaiah stadium and the Gymkhana grounds in the city. “We are receiving a number of requests from the traders regarding fireworks shops. Swaraj Maidan is centrally located and we have requested higher officials to allow stalls there this year. A final decision will be taken in a couple of days,” said Dr Nuthalapati Sridhar, estate officer at VMC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/cracker-prices-take-spark-out-of-diwali/articleshow/87243893.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Vijayawada||Man held for stealing cheques, encashing them in fake accounts||Vijayawada: In yet another case of bank fraud, Prakasam police arrested a man who was following a unique modus operandi to steal money from bank accounts. The man identified as Gali Chetan Chowdary, a resident of Tirupati, used to steal signed cheques from courier boys. He would then open bank accounts with the same name and encash the cheque by depositing the cheques in the account. He committed multiple offences with this modus operandi in Hyderabad, Coimbatore, Chennai and Ongole and has stolen about Rs 50 lakh so far, the police said. The issue came to light after a bank manager at Kandukur lodged a complaint stating that out of the three cheques he sent for clearance to another bank, one cheque for Rs 2 lakh was credited into the wrong account. Kundukur inspector Velamuri Sriram said during the course of investigation, they found that the cheque that was credited into the wrong account was stolen from a courier boy a week before it was encashed. Upon investigating, cops zeroed in on Chetan Chowdary. The entire modus operandi was unravelled after he was arrested. Sriram said Chetan Chowdary used to follow courier boys from their offices. Whenever they would stop to handover a package by leaving the bag with other parcels on their vehicles, Chetan used to grab some of the envelopes from the bag at random and run away from the spot. His target was to steal signed cheques sent for delivery. Once he caught hold of signed cheques, he would open bank accounts with the same name on the cheque in multiple banks. After raiding his place, the cops recovered a large number of fake Aadhaar cards that were used to open bank accounts, PAN cards stolen from courier boys and cheque books. The police even recovered the ID card of a Navy officer that was stolen from a courier boy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/man-held-for-stealing-cheques-encashing-them-in-fake-accounts/articleshow/87243940.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Delhi||Work on Dwarka Expressway to resume in November after 7-month break||GURUGRAM: Seven months after construction on the main carriageway of the Dwarka Expressway was halted when a section of the under-construction elevated road collapsed, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said it was likely to resume work on the project next month. On Sunday, a senior NHAI official told TOI that the authority has already given a go-ahead to the contractor to start the pending work. “We hope construction will start again within the next month. It will take around six to seven months to complete a substantial part of the work. Thereafter, the finishing work will require another two months. Overall, we expect that the entire work would be completed in around eight to 10 months,” the official said. During a visit to Gurugram last month to inspect the work on the Delhi-Mumbai expressway, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had said the Dwarka Expressway was expected to be ready in 2022. The Rs 9,000-crore expressway, first conceptualised in 2007 as a northern ring road between Gurugram and Delhi, promises to not only decongest traffic on the existing Delhi-Gurugram expressway but also ensure better connectivity between Dwarka and parts of south Delhi. Of the 29-kilometre-long expressway, connecting Mahipalpur in Delhi with Kherki Daula in Gurugram, 18.9 km is located in Haryana and the rest in Delhi. While construction in the Haryana section commenced in 2019, it remained overwrought with factors ranging from litigation to compensation for land acquisition. Ban on construction to curb pollution and a subsequent lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic further affected the work. On March 28, work on the expressway was suspended after an “under erection span and adjoining span”, located between piers number 107 and 108, and piers number 108 and 109, collapsed leaving three labourers injured. The stretch is located near Daultabad Chowk. An expert committee was subsequently constituted by the NHAI to ascertain the factors leading to the incident. “(The) authority has viewed the incident seriously and pending the outcome of the investigation by the committee, the concerned key personnel of the contractor M/s L&T and Supervision Consultant M/s AECOM have been suspended as per Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of NHAI,” a statement issued by the NHAI had stated. In September, after perusing the investigation report, the NHAI had issued a show-cause notice to the contractor and supervision consultant of the project. Officials stated that “overall” it had been found that there was a need to “improve workmanship” on the project with multiple aspects, “from material quality to costing to operation”, that led to the mishap.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/work-on-dwarka-e-way-to-resume-in-november-after-7-month-break/articleshow/87244997.cms||Sakshi Dayal

---||Kolkata||Covid case rise sharper in south Kolkata: Beckbagan, Tollygunge and Jadavpur under watch||KOLKATA: An analysis of the fresh Covid cases recorded in the past 10 days shows that south Kolkata has reported a larger number of positives — parts of Karaya and Beckbagan along with added areas of Tollygunge, Jadavpur, Mukundapur and Patuli reporting most of cases in the city compared to north Kolkata. According to Kolkata Municipal Corporation and Kolkata Police sources, a few wards in the south are reporting seven to nine cases daily. The findings tally with those of the KMC urban primary health centres which have recorded a rise in Covid cases over the past 10 days. According to KMC health department, large parts of south Kolkata under three boroughs — 10 to 12 and a stretch of Tollygunge, parts of Jodhpur Park, Jadavpur, Baghajatin, Mukundapur and Patuli — have shown a sharper rise in Covid cases so far compared to other spots. The ward-wise data of Covid positive cases show a sharper spike in wards 65, 69, 92, 93 and 101. TOI found that maximum single-day cases were reported in wards 65 and 69 between Wednesday and Friday. While Ward 65 reported nine cases on Wednesday, Ward 69 reported eight cases on Thursday. These areas have parts of Ballygunge, Park Circus, Beckbagan and Tiljala. About seven cases have been reported from Ward 101, while six each from wards 92 and 93, all lying close to Mukundapur, Dhakuria, Garfa and Jodhpur Park. “We have reasons to worry about a slight spurt in Covid since these areas — restricted under three boroughs — have reported multiple cases even in the first and second waves. We are keeping a strict vigil and taking all sorts of measures to prevent the infection from spreading into larger areas,” said a KMC health department official. However, there is some comforting news, too. In none of the KMC’s 144 wards are daily figures averaging more than nine fresh cases per day. In the second wave, the three boroughs (10-12) had even witnessed 658 cases on a single day during the month of May-June. “We need to add more swab collection as we have decided to ramp up the Covid testing,” a civic official said. “We need to ramp up our Covid testing process so that citizens in large numbers can avail of the opportunity to get tested for Covid-19,” said a KMC Board of Administrators member Atin Ghosh. The Kolkata Police said it has increased number of night nakas across the city with an emphasis on the south and EM Bypass. The cops said the past three days have seen over 300 violations. The cops have also decided to concentrate on the markets in these areas where they will hold special campaigns. Sixteen markets including Behala, Simultala, Behala Chowrasta, Thakurpukur, Haridevpur, Jadavpur, Bansdroni, Garia, Baghajatin, Bijoygarh, Sree Colony and Pallisree are under police watch.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cov-case-rise-sharper-in-s-kol-beckbagan-tollygunge-and-jadavpur-under-watch/articleshow/87244377.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Patna||Lalu, Rabri visit Tej Pratap’s residence after high-voltage drama||PATNA: RJD first couple — Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi—finally had to budge before their elder son Tej Pratap Yadav when they visited his residence after a high voltage drama late Sunday night. Earlier, Tej sat on a dharna in front of his residence apparently in a bid to exert pressure on Lalu and Rabri to visit him. He told the media that he would continue his sit-in till his parents visited him. Later, both Lalu and Rabri visited Tej Pratap’s Strand Road residence. Tej cleaned his parents’ feet with water before they went inside. “Welcome my father,” reads one of the welcome arches erected near the entrance gate of the bungalow allotted to Tej, the Hasanpur MLA. RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan confirmed the visit of Lalu and Rabri to Tej Pratap’s residence. Earlier, Tej and his younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav reached the Patna airport to receive their parents on arrival from New Delhi in the evening. Later, they went to Rarbi’s 10, Circular Road residence, where hundreds of supporters were waiting for them. Though the car carrying Lalu, Rabri and their daughter Misa Bharti went inside, Tej stopped near the entrance gate. Tej alleged that he was misbehaved at his mother’s residence at the behest of senior leaders, including state chief Jagadanand Singh, RJD MLC Sunil Singh and Tejashwi’s adviser Sanjay Yadav. He also accused some party leaders of holding ‘Lalu ji’ captive. Later, he left for his residence and sat on a dharna with the activists of his newly floated Chhatra Janshakti Parishad. The strained relationship between Tej Pratap and Tejashwi is no more a secret. Lalu has returned to Patna after more than three years. Though he was granted bail by the Ranchi high court in fodder scam cases, he was shifted to AIIMS-Delhi for treatment. He went to his daughter and Rajya Sabha member Misa Bharti’s house after being released from the hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/lalu-rabri-visit-tejs-residence-after-high-voltage-drama/articleshow/87243877.cms||Ramashankar

So far so good, but what was even heart warming was the gesture by the café owner, who melted with the confession of kleptomania and buried the hatchet over an invite for a cuppa and a return gift — the potted plant of champa! All well that ends well, and the video too was removed from its social media profile. Mental health is a condition anyone can succumb to so we should be of help to anyone who needs support,” said Kashyap Jain, owner of Brew 13 café. “After the video became viral and the incident grabbed a lot of attention in the city, the person approached us and apologized. As I had expected, he told us that he has this condition so we are not holding any grudges against him,” said Jain and adding, “I had mentioned earlier too, that if that person will come forward to return the plant, we will offer him a coffee, but we also offered him to keep the plant too, as a small gesture if it makes him get over the condition of kleptomania.” Since the SUV driver realized his mistake, the café not only removed the CCTV camera’s video from their social media profile but also put up a post stating that they have accepted his apologies with open arms and invited him for a cup of coffee. The café has also appealed to social media users to pull down the viral video and not to share it further to respect the man’s privacy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/pot-jacking-driver-confesses-kleptomania-returns-plant/articleshow/87243661.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Vijayawada||TDP delegation to meet President Ram Nath Kovind today||VIJAYAWADA: The main opposition TDP has decided to take its fight with the ruling YSRC to New Delhi. A five-member delegation led by party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu will meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday with a request to invoke President’s rule under Article 356 in Andhra Pradesh. The delegation is also planning to meet Union home minister Amit Shah. A detailed representation has been prepared alleging that there is a “deterioration” of law and order. It also highlights the attack on TDP offices at Mangalagiri and in some parts of the state. TDP sources said that the appointment with the President has been fixed at 12:45 pm on Monday. Though the appointment was given for five members only, an 18-member team including senior functionaries and politburo members headed for New Delhi on Sunday. Naidu and his team will stay in Delhi for two days as the appointment with Amit Shah is yet to be confirmed. Speaking to TOI, TDP politburo member Payyavula Keshav, who has been coordinating with the appointments, said that they will explain the prevailing situation in Andhra Pradesh. “We will seek the Government of India’s intervention by way of invoking Article 356,” he said. While the appointment with the President has been confirmed, there is no clarity on the appointment with Amit Shah. Though the TDP leaders are tight lipped over the meeting agenda with Amit Shah, it is not clear whether the meeting would bring the TDP and the BJP together once again. The parties had parted ways just before the assembly polls. Naidu is touring Delhi after more than two years and it is the first time that he is meeting Amit Shah (if confirmed) after he snapped ties with BJP in 2018. Speculation is rife that TDP is looking to form an alliance again with BJP and Jana Sena. Keshav said that they have asked for Amit Shah’s appointment. “However, as Amit Shah is in Jammu, we will get clarity on his appointment only after he returns to Delhi,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/tdp-delegation-to-meet-president-today/articleshow/87244020.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The acquisition process will be completed by February 2022 to pave way for the construction of ISBT metro station and Patna Metro Rail Depot in Ranipur and Pahadi areas. The state government has sanctioned around Rs1,000 crore to the district administration to acquire land for the depot and ISBT metro station. District land acquisition officer Pramod Kumar told this newspaper on Sunday that any objection regarding land acquisition can be filed by the interested person within 60 days from the date of publication of the notification, as provided under Section 15 of the Act. “After which hearing will be held and then the amount to be determined as compensation under Section 19 of the Act will be published. Compensation will be given to the landowner based on the rate,” he said. The officials of urban development and housing department (UDHD) said as the government proceeding has started for land acquirement near Patliputra ISBT, Patna Metro Rail Corporation (PMRC) will initiate the process of loan from Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) in the next few days. Patna metro rail is an ambitious project of the Nitish Kumar-led government. It would be developed at an estimated construction cost of Rs9,201.22 crore, excluding the land acquisition cost to be borne entirely by the state government. The Centre and the state each will bear 20% of the project cost while the remaining 60% amount will be borrowed as loan from the JICA. A PMRC official said once they get the loan from JICA, work on underground stations and network will begin. “Initially, the construction of twin tunnels, underground ramp at Rajendra Nagar and six underground stations from Rajendra Nagar to Akashvani (which is a part of Corridor II) will begin. Work is already in progress on a 6.1km elevated stretch of Corridor II from Malahi Pakri to ISBT. It includes five stations -- Malahi Pakri, Khemnichak (an interchangeable station), Bhootnath Road, Zero Mile and ISBT. This stretch is also known as priority corridor,” he said. According to officials, 101 pillars have been created from Malahi Pakri up to Bhootnath while altogether 210 pillars will be developed for elevated network for Corridor II. Te piling work has also commenced from the Zero Mile to ISBT. The elevated section is likely to be ready by December 2022. The Corridor I will be 17.9-km-long, from Danapur to Khemnichack via Meethapur, of which 7.3km will be elevated and 10.5km underground.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/metro-stn-process-to-acquire-land-begins/articleshow/87243676.cms||Faryal Rumi

The DM assured the family of all possible assistance. The district administration has already ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident. At least three rifles used in firing by the police personnel have been seized for ballistics analysis. A violence had broken out at the village when police attempted to stop an unauthorised panchayat election campaign of a mukhiya candidate, Surendra Sah. Police said some villagers fired at the cops, forcing them to retaliate in self-defence. “Villagers had also pelted stones targeting the police team. Altogether 14 police personnel were injured,” they said. While Rohit was killed, Bijendra Kumar, Neeraj Kumar and Milan Kumar sustained bullet injuries in the police firing. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said three rifles of home guard jawans have been seized for procedural investigation.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Vegetable prices soar ahead of Diwali, traders blame it on rising fuel costs||JAIPUR: There has been continuous increase in the prices of vegetables ahead of the festive season. Tomatoes are showing a rising trend for the past one week as its prices are now Rs 60 to Rs 80 per kg in the retail market. Similarly, prices of onions and other vegetables too have gone up. Traders at the Muhana Mandi in Jaipur stated that the rising prices are mainly due to the increased fuel prices, crunched supply and extended monsoon rainfall. Traders expect that rising trend will continue till Diwali. TOI on Sunday spoke to the wholesalers at the Muhana mandi about reasons behind the rise in the prices of the vegetables. “Firstly, the extended monsoon spoiled the vegetables in the local farms which is the reason why we are still dependent on other states and distant districts to get the vegetables. Also the increased fuel prices too have attributed to the increase in the prices. Hopefully by the first week there is a possibility of dip in the prices,” said Abdul Sagir, a wholesale dealer at the Muhana mandi. Tomatoes have shown rising trend in its prices in the past one fortnight. “In September, the prices of tomatoes were Rs 25 to Rs 35 per kg which have now gone up to Rs 60 to Rs 80 per kg. Tomatoes from the local farms were damaged during the rainfall is the obvious reason why the prices have gone up,” said Radheyshyam Agarwal, another wholesale dealer at the Mohana mandi said. Also, the ladyfinger which was available in Rs 25 to Rs 35 per kg in the month of September has now available in Rs 50 to Rs 60 per kg. Likewise, the prices of onions are also increasing gradually. “Every day there is a rise in price of onions which is Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg in the wholesale. Presently the prices of onions are Rs 50 to Rs 60 per kg and the prices are increasing. In the next one week the prices will further go up,” said Shiv Shankar Sharma, another wholesaler at the Muhana mandi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/veggie-prices-soar-ahead-of-diwali/articleshow/87244985.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Help! My girl left home for a virtual friend’||AHMEDABAD: A resident of Chandkheda called Abhayam 181, state government's helpline for women, earlier this month. The distress call was to report the phone addiction of their 14-year-old daughter who was reportedly spending at least 10 hours online. “The parents were highly distressed as the girl was spending less time in ‘reality’, would not focus on online studies and demonstrated major mood swings related to her online friendships and likes she got on social media. The parents worried were that the smartphone which they had bought for the daughter's online classes threatened to completely derail her. The family was connected to a psychologist for counselling,” said an Abhayam 181 counsellor. Falguni Patel, coordinator of the helpline in Ahmedabad, said that majority calls involved girls in the age group of 12 to 18 years who were first-time mobile phone users for online schooling. Patel said apart from phone addiction, parents’ distress calls also concerned 14-15-year-old girls leaving their homes to unite with their virtual friends. “One family was distraught when their 14-year-old left home for a virtual friend she had made online. The girl was given a phone for the first time for studies,” said Patel. These are not isolated calls. While adverse fallout of Covid pandemic and online education among teens and young adults is well-documented, an analysis by 181 has helped see the issue from the gender lens. According to the helpline officials, the number of distress phone calls related to young girls grew by an alarming 74% from 140 between October 2019 to September 2020 to 243 in the same period in 2020-2021. The data covers Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot. Majority parents confessed they had not exposed their girls to smart-phones until mandated by the online education. “Parents get more worried by rising exposure of girls to online friendships due to growing cases of online harassment, stalking and even getting into relationships at a very early age. They have serious safety concerns for daughters over virtual friends who may have the potential to jeopardize their real lives” she said. “We counsel parents not to blame it only on gender or phone, but make the girls aware of the pros and cons of cyberworld.” Dr Hansal Bhachech, a city-based psychiatrist, echoed the sentiment. “Screen addiction shot up three to four-fold across the age groups during and after the lockdown months. But when it comes to gender, we must delve into possible reasons, too. The girls that generally reported dependence on screens had anxieties and peer pressure. They tried to find emotional solace in the virtual world when it was not possible to meet friends and family,” he said. “Fear of missing out (FOMO) is also the reason for ‘doom scrolling’ among teenagers especially on sites like Instagram.” City-based experts said that the phenomenon is also reported in medical settings. “In one of the cases this year, a teenage girl was chatting with 4-5 youths simultaneously on a social media site. The chats would continue throughout the night. She was counselled on the nature of the relationship and why the time she spent on multiple partners might not be worth it,” said Dr Nehal Shah, a city-based psychiatrist. “I actually took phones of 5-6 girls at my clinic after the consent of their families to put them on digital detox for a week.” Dr Ramashankar Yadav, another psychiatrist, said that the parents blame the phones for elopement of girls or undesirable relationships. “We ask them not to do so. The teens at large do know what to do, but don’t know what not to do or where to stop in the lure of the digital world. Thus, right from a reasonable amount of screen time to the perils of social media should be taught. Not all teens go through the same phase, but isolation caused by the pandemic aggravated the condition,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/help-my-girl-left-home-for-a-virtual-friend/articleshow/87244676.cms||Parth Shastri

Based on preliminary findings, the police suspect it to be a case of suicide as they have recovered injection and distilled water vials from near the body. Body of Jigisha Patel, second-year gynaecology student, was found in the K block of a hostel for students in SMIMER hospital campus in Varachha. Her room-mate alerted others in the hospital and later cops were informed. Patel was from Vaheval village of Mahuva taluka in Surat district. Police sent the body for post mortem and preliminary findings showed that she died due to overdose of the drug injected. The deceased injected herself with a mixture of two sedative drugs which are normally used as anaesthesia purposes. “We found a written note in the room in which she claimed that she is responsible for her extreme step. The exact reason will be known only after detailed investigation,” said a police officer in Varachha police station, adding that investigation was started after registering a case of accidental death. Door of Patel’s room was locked from inside when her room-mate returned on Sunday after her morning shift ended. Despite knocking multiple times when Patel did not open the door, the room-mate called the security guards who broke it open and to their horror found her lying dead, the police said. “So far no major issue has come to our knowledge which could be the possible reason for her suicide. We are checking the possibility of any relationship issue,” said cops.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/resident-doctor-gives-herself-lethal-injection/articleshow/87243802.cms||---

The drive is also aimed at keeping chikungunya and other vector-borne diseases at bay. The number of dengue cases in the district has increased to 98. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh said to spread awareness about dengue, chikungunya and vector-borne diseases, six e-rickshaws will hit the streets on Monday. “The e-rickshaws will make rounds of all the circles of Patna Municipal Corporation. A detailed plan has been made with the help of the civic body to contain spread of viral diseases in the vulnerable areas. As dengue cases are mainly being reported from urban areas, we are targeting the urban population,” she said. Dr Singh added people would be asked to keep their premises and neighbourhoods dry by removing open sources that collect freshwater and stagnant water. “Stagnant water turns into breeding ground for mosquitoes that spread diseases like dengue, malaria and chikungunya. During the week-long awareness drive, we will also make people aware about the symptoms of vector-borne diseases. Most dengue cases have been reported from Bankipore, Patliputra, Digha, Punaichak, Anisabad, Jakkanpura and Shahganj areas.” The civil surgeon has also directed the officials concerned of primary health centres, sub-divisional hospitals and referral hospitals to make arrangements for dengue test kits. Four dengue patients were undergoing treatment in 50-bed special ward at Patna Medical College and Hospital on Sunday. Two patients were admitted on Saturday. Dr Kaushal Kishore, head of medicine department at PMCH, said around 15-20 patients have so far been treated at the hospital. “The average recovery time of dengue patient is 5-6 days. Several dengue positive patients do not require hospitalization as they recover at home with medical help,” he said. Three dengue patients, on the other hand, were undergoing treatment at AIIMS-Patna. Dr Ravi Kirti of the hospital’s medicine department said post-monsoon is the peak time for dengue. “Most patients come with symptoms like fever, headache, body-ache and gastronomical problems. Fortunately, we have not seen any patient visiting the hospital with dengue shock syndrome this time. Most patients have mild to moderate symptoms and they recover in four to seven days,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/number-of-dengue-cases-mounts-to-98-in-patna-district/articleshow/87243663.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Gurgaon||Work on Dwarka Expressway to resume in November after 7-month break||GURUGRAM: Seven months after construction on the main carriageway of the Dwarka Expressway was halted when a section of the under-construction elevated road collapsed, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said it was likely to resume work on the project next month. On Sunday, a senior NHAI official told TOI that the authority has already given a go-ahead to the contractor to start the pending work. “We hope construction will start again within the next month. It will take around six to seven months to complete a substantial part of the work. Thereafter, the finishing work will require another two months. Overall, we expect that the entire work would be completed in around eight to 10 months,” the official said. During a visit to Gurugram last month to inspect the work on the Delhi-Mumbai expressway, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had said the Dwarka Expressway was expected to be ready in 2022. The Rs 9,000-crore expressway, first conceptualised in 2007 as a northern ring road between Gurugram and Delhi, promises to not only decongest traffic on the existing Delhi-Gurugram expressway but also ensure better connectivity between Dwarka and parts of south Delhi. Of the 29-kilometre-long expressway, connecting Mahipalpur in Delhi with Kherki Daula in Gurugram, 18.9 km is located in Haryana and the rest in Delhi. While construction in the Haryana section commenced in 2019, it remained overwrought with factors ranging from litigation to compensation for land acquisition. Ban on construction to curb pollution and a subsequent lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic further affected the work. On March 28, work on the expressway was suspended after an “under erection span and adjoining span”, located between piers number 107 and 108, and piers number 108 and 109, collapsed leaving three labourers injured. The stretch is located near Daultabad Chowk. An expert committee was subsequently constituted by the NHAI to ascertain the factors leading to the incident. “(The) authority has viewed the incident seriously and pending the outcome of the investigation by the committee, the concerned key personnel of the contractor M/s L&T and Supervision Consultant M/s AECOM have been suspended as per Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of NHAI,” a statement issued by the NHAI had stated. In September, after perusing the investigation report, the NHAI had issued a show-cause notice to the contractor and supervision consultant of the project. Officials stated that “overall” it had been found that there was a need to “improve workmanship” on the project with multiple aspects, “from material quality to costing to operation”, that led to the mishap.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/work-on-dwarka-e-way-to-resume-in-november-after-7-month-break/articleshow/87254394.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Patna||Bihar: 60.79% voter turnout in fifth phase of panchayat election||PATNA: An overall 60.79% voter turnout was recorded in the fifth phase of the ongoing panchayat polls in 845 panchayats under 58 blocks in 38 districts on Sunday. A few sporadic incidents of clashes, stone pelting and firing were reported from a few panchayats. Reports said one Sanjay Yadav received bullet injuries in a clash between two groups of people outside polling booth number 107 of Sahuria Paschim panchayat in Saharsa district. He was rushed to the Sadar hospital at Saharsa for treatment. Yadav told the police that he came to the firing range while returning home after casting his vote at the polling booth in the village under Saur Bazar police station area. He suffered injuries in his belly and around his neck. His brother Anil Yadav, who is contesting for the mukhiya post, said Sanjay was attacked by his rival Dayanand Yadav and his supporters. The polling, however, continued due to deployment of armed forces. Saharsa DM Kaushal Kumar and SP Lipi Singh visited village Indarwa following indiscriminate firing by members of two rival groups near a polling booth under Rautakhaim panchayat. Earlier, reports of disturbances by antisocials were received from polling booth numbers 200 and 201. A clash broke out at a polling booth located at village Shitalpur under Bidupur block in Vaishali district after a polling agent was reportedly thrashed by security personnel over the use of mobile phone. The situation was brought under control after the intervention of senior police and administrative officials. A contestant for the mukhiya post was stabbed and seriously wounded by some antisocials near Mokimchak village under Bidupur block in Vaishali district. In East Champaran, a polling officer identified as Banshidhar Ram (56) died due to cardiac arrest. He was deployed at a polling booth at Bakhri under Patahi panchayat. In Sheikhpura, complaints of loot of ballot papers were received from polling booth number 21 of Gawai panchayat. Reports of skirmishes between supporters of contestants for the mukhiya post also poured in from several districts, including Arwal and Munger. In a statement, the state election commission said altogether 14,186 duplicate voters have been identified. Action would be initiated against the offenders, a senior official of the commission said.

Andhra Pradesh is one of two states in the country, alongside Kerala, to set up a dedicated State-Designated Agency (SDA) for energy conservation and efficiency. Addressing a national-level review meeting, organised by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency with all the states, Union minister of power, new and renewable energy R K Singh, said as per the United Nations Climate Change Conference, India announced to achieve 40% of cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuels as per the nationally determined contributions by 2030. “India has established 147 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity out of the total established capacity of 388 gigawatts, amounting to 38% at present,” said RK Singh. The minister stressed the need to introduce a National Carbon Market for large-scale promotion of clean energy technologies, leading to de-carbonisation of the economy and mobilising international finance for greenhouse gas mitigation in India. Secretary (power), Alok Kumar, appreciated Andhra Pradesh and said AP has become a role model by setting up a dedicated State Designated Agency for energy conservation and efficiency and appointing chief secretary as the chairman of the Agency. “Out of the 36 State Designated Agencies, only two states, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, have formed standalone SDAs. The Union ministry of power is going to amend Energy Conservation Act, 2001 to make establishment of state energy efficiency agencies mandatory for all states,” said Alok Kumar. Director general of BEE, Abhay Bakre, presented the energy transition roadmap and said the Union government recently issued regulations to all discoms to conduct annual energy audits and periodic energy accounting on a quarterly basis. “The audits enable discoms to quantify actual energy consumption/losses (consumer category wise) and Identify areas of leakage, wastage or inefficient use to reduce transmission and distribution losses,” said Bakre. State energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli gave a presentation on best practices undertaken by AP State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM).

While there is a lag in capturing trends in claims, insurers say that there has been a significant jump from September in non-Covid hospitalisations. “We are seeing an increase in hospitalisations due to dengue, respiratory diseases and other non-Covid claims. The size of these claims has also gone up, perhaps due to the additional protection that has to be taken by hospitals. We will watch this to see whether the increase is temporal or structural,” said ICICI Lombard General Insurance MD & CEO Bhargav Dasgupta, following the company’s results. Policybazaar, one of the largest distributors of individual health covers, has been seeing an increase in the number of non-Covid calls. The calls are for infectious diseases, dengue and other viral fever. “We are also seeing an increase in accidental injuries,” said Amit Chabra, chief of health business at Policybazaar. According to Dr Dev Pahlajani, head of interventional cardiology at Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai, incidences of acute coronary syndrome, sudden heart attacks and cardiac arrest have gone up 40% in the last six to eight months. “There is a surge in circulatory conditions which warrants a close evaluation,” he said. He added that even patients who have been stable for years are coming in with acute heart emergencies. The trend is visible in most cardiac departments, he said. According to Niva Bupa Health Insurance director (underwriting, products & claims) Bhabatosh Mishra, Covid brought down health claims last year as people were locked in, avoided hospitalisation and delayed elective surgeries. “There is no major change in the number of emergency procedures like appendicitis, but cases like gall bladder surgeries, which can be delayed, are going up,” said Mishra. He added that given the higher than usual monsoon in places, there has been a spike in dengue including Bengaluru and Hyderabad, in addition to Mumbai and Delhi. “People have lost jobs, their source of income and probably sat idle at home for months. Those factors combined with lack of exercise can build up the stress levels, putting them at risk of heart conditions,” said Dr Pahlajani. He added that people have been missing out on routine checks on sugar and blood pressure levels due to the pandemic. Covid survivors too may see symptoms of inflammation after months. “Incidences of strokes and heart conditions have been reported following exposure to Covid. Some patients have also come with complaints following vaccination. A rise is evident,” he said.Dengue cases in Maharashtra have more than doubled to 5,944 cases till mid-September, from 2,029 cases for the whole of last year. Similarly, chikungunya cases are up 300% in the state. “People had stayed indoors and testing too was low for these diseases in 2020,” said a state official, adding that vector-control activities took a hit as manpower was diverted to control Covid. In Mumbai, hospital beds are largely occupied by dengue, malaria and chikungunya cases and not Covid at present, said Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital. Mishra expects cases to remain elevated as the monsoon is not over yet. Also, many of the elective surgeries are usually scheduled for winter as, given India’s weather, surgical wounds heal better and risk of monsoon infections are lower.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/health-insurers-see-huge-surge-in-non-covid-claims/articleshow/87244714.cms||Mayur Shetty

Aarti, who was associated with modelling industry, had succumbed to the bullet injury at IGIMS here on October 17. Police sources said Yadav was arrested from Bhagwatipur village under the Udwantnagar police station area in Bhojpur district. “Bhim is new to the crime world. Aarti’s murder was his first contract. However, his brother Arvind Yadav is accused in bike theft and scuffle cases,” the police sources said, adding Bhim was hired to kill Aarti at Rs 5 lakh. “Of the promised amount, Rs 1.5 lakh was already paid to Bhim,” they said. Bhim had borrowed a bike from one of his friends to commit the crime. The bike was later seized by the police. SHO of Rajiv Nagar police station, Saroj Kumar, said builder Raju Kumar’s wife Sharda Devi’s name has cropped up in the case after Bhim’s arrest. “It has come to light that Sharda had hired Bhim to kill Aarti. It seems Aarti had an illicit relation with Sharda’s husband,” he said. Police had first raided the flat of the builder at Chandrakutir Apartment on Ambedkar Path under the Rajiv Nagar police station area on October 13 following suspicion of his involvement in the case. However, nothing had surfaced then. However, police found a beer can inside a refrigerator in the builder’s house and arrested him.

Rahim Ali converted a sixth-minute penalty and then Vikram Partap Singh (37th minute) doubled India’s advantage to give Stimac’s side an impressive start. Waleed Salim Al Musalmi scored a consolation goal in the closing minutes, but the heavyweights couldn’t do much else. “I have asked the players to forget this game as quickly as possible,” the India coach said after the win. “It’s not important how you start this tournament but how you finish. We will focus on the next game and take this one match at a time.” India will take on UAE in the next clash on Wednesday after the hosts were stunned by Kyrgyz Republic 2-1. The top team qualifies automatically for the U-23 Asian Cup 2022. “All credit to the boys. They didn’t have any proper preparation but showed togetherness and were disciplined tactically. That’s what makes be the happiest coach in the world,” said Stimac. The India coach was forced to leave out injured midfielder Lalengmawia Ralte, whose partnership in defensive midfield with Suresh Singh -- named captain for the qualifiers – was the highlight of India’s SAFF Championship triumph last month. Deepak Tangri stood out for India with an impressive performance in central defence, and even though they were pushed back for most part, it were Rahim and Vikram who made heads turn at the start. India won a penalty in the sixth minute after Vikram got at the end of a terrific through ball from Suresh and drew a foul from Yousuk Nashr Al Malki, who desperately tried to stop him. Rahim stepped up and beat the goalkeeper, despite guessing correctly. India doubled the advantage after Rahim and Vikram combined again. This time, the scorer of the opening goal picked up a ball from Akash Mishra just outside the box, rounded off his marker, and passed it on to an unmarked Vikram inside the box. The youngster kept his cool and slotted it past the onrushing goalkeeper. Oman enjoyed a lion’s share of the ball and kept pushing for a goal, but Tangri and Narender Gahlot gave a good account of themselves in defence. When they were outwitted, goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh stood firm. The West Asian side tasted success only in the 89th minute through Salim, but that proved to be a mere consolation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/india-must-quickly-forget-win-against-oman-stimac/articleshow/87266056.cms||---

The accused Mhaske has been booked under section 302 of the IPC for punishment for murder. Ankur Shelar, police sub-inspector of NRI coastal police station said that after arresting the accused, the murder motive was revealed. Mhaske claimed that on Friday around 7.30 pm, he and friend Rupesh Thakur were consuming liquor in an unused school bus parked on the service road near Kendriya Vihar complex in Seawoods, when in a drunken stupor, Thakur sought sexual favour from Mhaske by insisting to indulge in sodomy with him. “Mhaske objected to his demand, when Thakur turned furious and forced himself on Mhaske,who retaliated by assaulting him. As they exchanged blows, Mhaske picked up a cement block from near the bus and smashed it on Thakur's head, when he was inebriated under influence of liquor,” said police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-labourer-arrested-for-killing-friend/articleshow/87245691.cms||George Mendonca
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Two held with mephedrone||AHMEDABAD: City crime branch officers nabbed two men with 250 grams of mephedrone worth Rs 25 lakh in the illegal drugs market, said officers on Sunday.  Acting on a tip-off, crime branch personnel apprehended Tahirhussain Qureshi, a resident of Bhoivas near Ameri Bazar in Bareja and Tarik Sheikh, a resident of Dariapur, who told police they had received the consignment from a peddler identified as Afsar Khan in Jodhpur in Rajasthan, an official said. Cops got the input that Shaikh had bought the drugs which he gave to Qureshi to bring from Mount Abu to Ahmedabad in an ST (state transport) bus. Qureshi was apprehended when he was getting down near Nana Chiloda Circle to catch a vehicle for Bareja. Inspector H M Vyas had laid a trap and caught him with the drugs. Later, Shaikh was also caught from his residence in the Dabgarwad locality in the Dariapur, said officers. Police said that Shaikh has been selling the drugs in the Walled City area for long from a shop. “They took separate state transport buses to Ahmedabad to evade arrest. Both have been charged under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act,” he said. The mobile phones of the two accused have been confiscated and probe was underway to unravel the peddling network they were part of, he added. Crime branch officers said that Shaikh was booked in 2003 under the POTA — which was repealed later. Apart from that, none of the accused were earlier booked under the NDPS act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/two-held-with-mephedrone/articleshow/87244383.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||It’s a battle of wives as TRS, BJP spar in bypoll||Hyderabad: The two women are not in the fray, yet they are right on the front line at the hustings. Eatala Jamuna is all fire and brimstone as she steps out for her husband Eatala Rajendar (BJP), once a prime mover in the TRS and now arch foe. For TRS candidate Gellu Srinivas Yadav’s wife Swetha it’s her first poll challenge, but she has been quick to find her way through the campaign maze, never forgetting to remind the crowd that her husband is the man chosen by the big man (KCR) himself. It is now a matter of prestige for both as they battle it out to get their man past the poll hurdle. With TRS having shown the door to her husband, necessitating the bypoll, Eatala’s wife has since unleashed her fury on the pink party. “In the past, KCR described Rajendar as his brother. Told the people how fortunate they were to have him as their representative. This is the same Rajendar who got a certificate from KCR, but he is now being vilified by the TRS. He will continue to serve you like he did earlier,” Jamuna tells the crowd. Eatala’s wife has marched straight to voters’ homes — knocking on doors and personally requesting them to elect her husband. While Gellu began his campaign after being picked by TRS, Eatala has been in the constituency campaigning even before BJP name him officially. Hence, Swetha, though a late entrant to the hustle and bustle of politics, has stepped out to campaign separately to cover more ground for her husband. And she is not just asking for votes, but also making them take an oath. Quick to establish rapport with the crowd, she walks briskly, pressing the right buttons to impress why her husband would be the right choice. “My husband has been given an opportunity and he will serve you to his fullest capacity,” she says. Congress’ Venkat Balmoor, a bachelor, has mother as his source of strength. But he has support elsewhere too, Mulug MLA Seethakka, whom he considers his sister, has been sparing no effort to garner support in the constituency.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/its-a-battle-of-wives-as-trs-bjp-spar-in-bypoll/articleshow/87245001.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Pune||1L farmers pay dues for agri power policy||Pune: As many as 1.15 lakh farmers in Pune district have paid arrears for agricultural pump electricity bills amounting up to Rs 191.24 crore so far. A rebate of Rs 313.56 crore has been provided to these farmers. The state power utility, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), has appealed to the farmers concerned to avail themselves of the scheme under the new agriculture pump policy announced on December 18, 2020. Under the scheme, farmers can get a rebate of up to 66% on past dues depending on how they choose to clear the arrears. According to a statement, agricultural pump consumers paying arrears in the first year will be given a 50% discount on revised basic arrears and interest, and delay charges will be waived, which eventually means the consumers who pay all the arrears in the first year will get a 66% discount. Consumers who pay arrears in two years will get a 30% rebate on revised principal arrears and those who pay arrears in three years will get a 20% discount, officials said. MSEDCL further said around 30,033 farmers in the district have no arrears due after paying clearing earlier and past dues. The statement further said that earlier, Pune district’s 3.12 lakh farmers had arrears amounting to Rs 3,096 crore, but with the introduction of the agricultural pump policy and the rebate it offered, the revised dues stand at Rs 2,342 crore. The MSEDCL said the amount recovered will be utilised to strengthen its electricity infrastructure and to improve services in the rural areas. Of the amount paid by agriculture consumers under the agricultural policy 2020, 33% of the amount will be used for strengthening electrical infrastructure in their own gram panchayat areas. Also, another 33% of the amount paid will be used for strengthening electrical infrastructure in the respective district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/1l-farmers-pay-dues-for-agri-power-policy/articleshow/87244384.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Post-Puja week spike lower than last year’s in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The post-festival Covid case spike has been smaller this year compared to last year during the week following the Pujas. Vaccination and herd immunity have combined to keep the numbers down this time, said experts. Asymptomatic cases, however, could proliferate over the next few weeks, they warned. In the week after the festival, Kolkata has seen 1,382 Covid cases and 19 deaths. In 2020, the post-Puja week had witnessed 7,133 new Covid cases and 122 deaths in Kolkata. Last year, 3.4 lakh samples were tested across Bengal in the week after the Pujas while this year, 2.1 lakh samples have been tested during the corresponding week. It had taken over two months after the festivities last year for the Covid spike to taper off. This year, however, 28.3 lakh people are completely vaccinated and another 47.4 lakh have received their first dose in Kolkata. In Bengal, over seven crore people have received at least one vaccine shot, while around 1.9 crore are fully vaccinated. The effects of the festive gatherings will probably be evident in another week’s time when numbers could rise more sharply, felt CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “But this time we will have a lot more asymptomatic cases due to vaccination and herd immunity which will keep the number of cases down. There have been numerous cases of asymptomatic patients testing positive in mandatory Covid tests prior to surgeries in the last few weeks. Those getting tested for travel, too, have been found to be positive without symptoms. Even if the numbers keep climbing this year, moderate to severe cases will be fewer,” added Dhar. Vaccination has played a significant role in preventing a spread, said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. “The lower number this post-Puja week reflects a drop in symptomatic cases. We have managed to vaccinate around 60% of the eligible population in Bengal and the results are evident. Since the second wave, mutations, too, have not been active that has prevented severe infections. So, this year we will see a lot more mild cases that will remain undetected,” said Sarkar. Last year on Dashami, Bengal’s Covid case load was 3,53,822 with 37,190 active cases. Kolkata had 76,808 Covid cases with 7,253 active cases. The positivity rate in Bengal was around 8.1% and the fatality rate was 1.8%. A week later, on November 3, Covid cases spiked sharply in Bengal to 3,85,589 and to 83,941 in Kolkata. This year on Dashami, Bengal’s total Covid cases stood at 15,79,463 and Kolkata’s cases were 3,18,775. Bengal’s positivity rate is 2.1% and fatality rate is 1.2%. After a week, on Friday, Bengal’s Covid case load touched 15,84,492 and Kolkata’s, 3,20,157.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/post-puja-wk-spike-lower-than-last-yrs/articleshow/87244385.cms||Saibal Sen

The police identified the accused as Thomas, 55, and Biju, 35, of Vamanapuram. The police said the two men were arrested on charges of alleged theft of valuables from Kadalukanipara temple under Kilimanoor police station limits. The loot include gold and bronze ornaments used to decorate the idol and cash worth Rs 7,000 that was kept in the drawer of the table in the office of the temple trust. The police tracked down and arrested the accused following an investigation involving examination of surveillance camera footage in the surrounding regions as well as the activities of scrap shops in the Kilimanoor locality. The police found some of the loot in a scrap shop near Kilimanoor following which they were able to track down the accused. Following the arrest, the two men admitted committing similar thefts in other temples in and around Kilimanoor. They were arrested by a team led by Kilimanoor station house officer inspector S Sanooj and sub-inspector Vijith K Nair under the supervision of Attingal DSP D S Suneesh Babu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/two-arrested-for-stealing-valuables-from-temple/articleshow/87244386.cms||---

---||Jaipur||No traces of leopard found at Moti Doongri||Times News Network Jaipur: The forest department on Sunday failed to trace the whereabouts of the leopard that strayed from Jhalana Forest Reserve and took refuge in Moti Doongri foothills. The team had installed trap cameras and cages in the area to rescue the animal. However, traces of the animal could not be found. Jhalana ranger Janeshwar Chaudhary said, “We believe the wild cat has gone back to the forest. As there is no disturbance in the area, the leopard must be visiting here frequently. The team will wait for one more day.” Around 4pm on Saturday, the leopard was first spotted close to populated area near the Ganesh Mandir by a tourist. Following this, locals informed the forest officials. Forest officials said the leopard chose the foothills as the private fort owned by the erstwhile royal family is surrounded by rich green vegetation and rocks. The operation was initiated as there are many populated areas out the fort premises. The forest department could not identify which leopard took a refuge at Moti Doongri, though it is believed that it could be leopardess Pooja. “The leopardess has made its territory near Smriti Van and forest area surrounding Rajasthan University campus. We are hoping the wild cat had returned to forest at night since no traces were found,” a forest official said. Leopards are known to stray into the city from the nearby Jhalana Forest Reserve. On December 12 last year, a leopard entered the posh Kanota Bagh Colony on Takht E Shahi Road and SMS School. Smriti Van on the JLN Marg had to be closed to the public for weeks after a leopard was spotted and feared to be hiding in the area. Two years ago, a similar incident was reported at a residential area on Jawaharlal Nehru Marg.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/no-traces-of-leopard-found-at-moti-doongri/articleshow/87245004.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Diesel in Kolkata at Rs 99.43 per litre, races past century mark in some districts||KOLKATA: The diesel price on Sunday inched closer to a century mark by rising to Rs 99.4 a litre. However, diesel prices crossed the century mark at the threshold of the city -- Rs 100.37 at Krishnanagar, Rs 100.31 at Berhampore. On Friday, for the first time, diesel price crossed Rs 100 mark in Bengal as it hit the century run at multiple petrol pumps across Purulia, being sold at Rs 100.14 per litre. Since the entire transport fleet -- both goods and passenger vehicles -- runs on diesel, the cost of both the edible essentials and fare for movement will be higher. The demand for bus fare revision went stronger on Sunday and so did the fare of cabs and ferries. Already the prices of every essential item be it edible oil, pulse, rice and species reached record high. “The never ending rises of diesel prices have sent our budget heywire. We have stopped taking out our cars. I go to my workplace on a scooty. But the petrol price is now steadily inching towards Rs110, giving me a little solace,” said Gopinath Chakraborty, a banker. The diesel price pinched a lot for the common man who travels by public transport like bus and cabs. “In absence of a government sanctioned fare chart, buses are now demanding often Rs5 more than the old fare per stage. I can’t blame the bus operators. They just cannot run buses at the old fare. But daily rises of diesel prices made even that fare often unviable. So buses just go off the road forcing us to opt for more expensive modes like auto and cabs. So I am ending up paying almost four times more for commuting compared to pre-Covid time,” said Jayanta Ghosal, a private insurance company employee, who suffered a salary cut last year. “At the current rate of rise, the diesel will cross Rs100 a litre on Monday or latest by Tuesday. Now the bigger question is where it would halt eventually. The steady rise is quite troublesome and fearful. Government must give us an alternative to diesel. Where is CNG? Why is not the government a bit more proactive to bring diesel to Kolkata faster,” said Anik Ghosh, transporter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/krish-diesel/articleshow/87244398.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Delhi||Directors of realty firm granted bail in cheating case||New Delhi: A Delhi court has granted bail to the directors of a real estate company accused of duping an associate professor of Rs 10 lakh after promising to give him a flat in one of its housing projects that had no approval from authorities. Metropolitan magistrate Dev Saroha on Saturday granted bail to the directors of Parsvnath Developers — Pradeep Kumar Jain, Rajeev Jain and Sanjeev Kumar Jain — after they appeared before the court in pursuance to summons issued against them earlier in the case of cheating and criminal breach of trust. Dr S K Goyal, an associate professor in Delhi University, had alleged in his complaint, filed by advocate Namit Saxena, that the accused duped him into giving money for a real estate project in Delhi, for which the Parsvnath Group had no sanction. The court granted relief to the accused on sureties of Rs 50,000 each on the ground that they were not arrested during investigation. Following investigation, Delhi Police filed a chargesheet before the court against the company and its directors. The accused, who were summoned by the court after the judge took cognisance of the chargesheet, moved bail application after appearing before it on Saturday. The application was opposed by Saxena, who alleged that the accused have duped other people as well of crores of rupees.

According to the OU estate cell, the land parcel has been under dispute for a few years now.  “The case was filed by us with the police a few years ago after we were informed about the encroachments by various student organisations. The housing society has no office. They engaged in fraudulent methods by producing some fake papers of which we are never aware of,” said professor Srinivasa Kumar, director, estate cell at OU, adding that internal inspections were held by the registrar among other officials after the matter was brought to their notice. Even three years after TOI reported massive encroachment over Rs 800 crore worth land in OU, nothing has changed as officials continue to fight various cases in the court. More than 56 acres of OU land is encroached upon and cases regarding them are pending in the court. Students have squarely blamed the university administration for the rampant land encroachment within the varsity.  “The inability of the legal procedures being followed by the university has led to blatant encroachments within the university. For the last seven years, no executive council meeting has been held to discuss such non-academic issues. Why do students have to intervene in matters that purely need to be monitored by the university administration,” questioned Prabhakar Chouti, a research scholar from OU. Many of the encroachers have not only grabbed the university land but are also using other utilities such as electricity and water, the costs of which are borne by the varsity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ou-lost-56-acres-land-to-encroachers-cases-stuck-in-court/articleshow/87244387.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bigwigs from Maharashtra govt demand SIT probe into ‘fake’ NCB raids||MUMBAI: NCP minister Nawab Malik on Sunday tweeted “Satyamev Jayate” after Prabhakar Sail, the personal bodyguard of K P Gosavi and an independent witness in the cruise drug seizure case, made startling revelations on the NCB raid on October 2. “I will meet both CM Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Monday. In my opinion, the government should set up a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the involvement of organised gangs in collaboration with NCB officials,” Malik told TOI. “All raids by the NCB under Sameer Wankhede were fake and fabricated.” Endorsing Malik’s dema-nd for a high-level probe into the new evidence, state Congress president Nana Patole said: “From the statement of the witness [Sail], it appears that Rs 25 crore was demanded to close the case against Aryan Khan. There is a question mark over the credibility and integrity of NCB, which is targeting the film industry. In the recent past, central agencies are making all-out efforts to destabilise and defame the MVA government.” Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut demanded that the state police take suo motu cognisance of the disclosures made by Sail. “It is an attempt to defame the MVA. The CM had said the NCB raids were to defame the state and this seems to be coming true; Mumbai Police has done more work and seizures,” said Raut, who shared a video of Aryan talking to private detective and Gosavi while in custody. “Khan was made to sign blank papers, quite shocking,” said Raut. BJP leader Pravin Darekar, however, claimed that elaborate plans have been made by Malik and his associates to put NCB and Wankhede in the accused box. “Accusations are being hurled daily through press conferences and now to prove the Centre or the central agencies as guilty, all these false attempts are being made. It is from these attempts that this video clip would have possibly surfaced,” Darekar said on Sunday. Criticising Raut, who has called for a police probe into Sail’s statement, Darekar said it was wrong of him to base his assumption on a social media video. “Only after the video clip is proven to be authentic should he have commented,” he said. Malik had earlier raised doubts about the credentials of Gosavi, who is wanted in a cheating case, and Manish Bhanushali, a BJP worker. Also of the 14 persons detained, three were released, including a relative of a BJP leader. “Fletcher Patel, Wankhede’s family friend, was a witness in four cases, which is against SC norms,” Malik said. Describing as false NCB deputy director general Gyan Prakash’s claim that all witnesses are independent, he said: “It’s a big extortion racket.” (Inputs by Clara Lewis)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-mva-bigwigs-demand-sit-probe-into-fake-ncb-raids/articleshow/87245422.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Pune||High rates of veggies for next fortnight, say APMC officials||Pune: Citizens may have to shell out more money for vegetables, at least for the next few days, as there was no intake of vegetables from the states outside Maharashtra in the Gultekdi Market Yard on Sunday. The APMC and commission agents were expecting the arrival of vegetables from states such as Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, but it did not come on Sunday, they said. APMC officials said the total intake of vegetables in the market was 9,953 quintals on Sunday. The rates of okra, cluster beans, cucumber, bottle gourd, brinjal and capsicum had increased in the range of Rs20-Rs30 per kg in the Market Yard. The rates of most of the vegetables were above Rs100 per kg in the retail markets across the city. “Tomato, potato and onion were being sold in the Rs60-Rs90 per kg range. One kg of drumstick, cauliflower, cluster beans, bottle gourd and brinjal are being sold above Rs100 per kg at many retail markets in the city,” an official from the APMC said. “The rates of coriander have reduced a little bit, compared to the last few weeks. A bunch is being sold in the range of Rs 40-60 against Rs 60-80 in the last few days. However, the rates of shepu (dill), fenugreek and spinach still remained in the bracket of Rs40-Rs60 per bunch in the retail markets,” the official added. “This intake is significantly less, considering the present requirements in the market. We need arrival of around 1,400-1,500 quintals in the current scenario to stable the prices in the retail markets in the city,” said Dutta Kalamkar, head of the vegetable section of the Market Yard. Vilas Bhujbal, president of the commission agents’ association, said, “The rates of all vegetables, including leafy vegetables, were auctioned at high rates on Sunday as there was limited arrival in the market. We were expecting arrival from the other states in large quantity. But, it did not come as the crops in these states had also been hit badly by the rainfall in October. This means citizens would have to buy vegetables at such high prices at least for the next two weeks at retail markets in the city.” However, many buyers claimed that the high rates had severely impacted their monthly budget. “We are buying vegetables in half quantity than the usual nowadays owing to the very high prices,” said Sangeeta Lakde, a resident of the Vishrantwadi area. “We have stopped buying leafy vegetables for the last two weeks as it is beyond our budget. How can one afford a small bunch of coriander at Rs100? Same in the case of other vegetables,” said Santosh Chavan, a resident of Shivajinagar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/high-rates-of-veggies-for-next-fortnight-say-apmc-officials/articleshow/87244393.cms||Sandip Dighe

The decision comes after the recent heavy rains in the Konkan region, resulting in a landslide which buried the Taliye village in Raigad district. A circular issued by the state revenue and forest department said the sub-committee will be headed by relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar. Other members include public works minister Ashok Chavan, rural development minister Hasan Mushrif, water supply and sanitation minister Jayant Patil, and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. The committee will study dangerous areas and recommend preventive measures to be taken. The state has already set up a council of ministers for climate change. Five sectors have been identified as major contributors to the carbon footprint energy (50%), industry and transport (15% each), agriculture and urbanisation (10% each). The council will hold its first meeting after Diwali. A technical committee also seeks to ascertain the cause for the Taliye landslide, as there was no mining or construction activity carried out in the vicinity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-to-study-areas-prone-to-landslide/articleshow/87245697.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Hyderabad||Bitter exchange: TRS-BJP war of words intensifies||Hyderabad: As the campaigning has entered the last leg, leaders and contestants cutting across party lines are indulging in a bitter war of words in the high-stakes Huzurabad by-election battle. Leaders like Eatala Rajender, Bandi Sanjay, T Harish Rao and Gangula Kamalakar, to name a few, have gone full throttle in hurling accusations against each other. Taking the verbal war to another level, BJP state general secretary G Premender Reddy has threatened to end his life if the ruling TRS establishes that his party was to blame for the Election Commission’s decision to halt Dalit Bandhu scheme in Huzurabad. In fact, even before the EC stopped the scheme, it became a fodder for BJP and TRS to trade charges and counter-charges. Responding to a purported letter in circulation in his name which showed that he had requested the EC to halt the scheme, Eatala asked the TRS to prove it, saying he was ready to face any challenge. Eatala said he was ready to walk down to Pochamma temple in Huzurabad in wet clothes to show his innocence and take a vow. Eatala challenged CM K Chandrasekhar Rao and finance minister Harish to enter the contest from Huzurabad. Eatala was reacting to Harish’s remarks that he had failed to complete construction of 2BHK units in Huzurabad. Sanjay too joined the issue as he dared the TRS leaders to come down to Yadadri temple and take a vow or prove that the BJP had asked the EC to stop the scheme. Harish Rao challenged the BJP leaders for an open debate at Ambedkar chowrasta in Huzurabad to prove that tax on gas cylinders does not go to the Centre. “I am prepared to quit from my post if the BJP proves otherwise,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bitter-exchange-trs-bjp-war-of-words-intensifies/articleshow/87245125.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Holding placards that read ‘Tella Poor’ roads, residents from over 32 gated communities raised slogans against civic authorities for their failure in repairing the roads. Many residents came out on the streets demanding the GHMC to build the four-lane road that they rue has been in progress for many years now. “For almost three years, the condition of the road has been bad. Multiple representations and protests have yielded no response from the authorities. Thousands of residents living in the neighbouring areas are finding it difficult to commute,” said Ramana Eshwaragari, president of Tellapur Neighbourhood Association (TeNA). Residents rue that the Gopanpally flyover work has progressed very slowly, resulting in massive traffic snarls. Many fear that with the IT companies in Financial District and neighbouring areas reopening, this road may emerge as a major choking point. Officials said the delay is due to delay in release of funds by the state. “Almost Rs 30 crore is to be paid to the contractor to repair Tellapur roads and another Rs 8 crore is pending to acquire land for the flyover. Unless that happens, we cannot go ahead,” said Venkateshwara Rao, executive engineer, R&B department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/tellapur-locals-decry-poor-roads/articleshow/87244395.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||People can get justice with free legal aid: Supreme Court judge||HYDERABAD: Stating that not even one per cent of people fighting criminal cases are availing free legal aid, senior judge of the Supreme Court and executive chairman of National Legal Services Authority, Justice Uday Umesh Lalith on Sunday said there is an urgent need to send across the message that people can gain access to justice through free legal service on one hand and to keep available to them quality legal assistance on the other hand. He was addressing people and legal professionals at Sangareddy after inaugurating, along with Telangana Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma, a camp module meant for training legal services authorities (LSAs) for the huge legal awareness outreach programme started all over the country that was commenced on October 2 and would culminate on November 14, Children’s Day. He also released the visual theme song made by the state legal services authority’s advisor D Sai Prasad that attempted to spread the message of free legal aid far and wide. Apart from requesting the senior advocates to do some free legal service through LSAs, the senior judge of the apex court also informed the audience about his efforts and deliberations with the top leaders of the Bar Council of India to indoctrinate the concept of free legal service in the minds of young lawyers. “Let the legal aid be the Raj Marg to enter the temple of justice. But to achieve this we must generate confidence in the minds of people that they get equally good legal service even if they come through a free legal aid structure”, Justice Lalith said while disclosing to the audience the pathetic story of a Delhi businessman who turned a pauper after paying hefty fees to a team of Bombay lawyers for just six adjournments. We must give the people the chance to opt for legal aid and they should not later repent for being unable to utilize the free service, he said. He inaugurated the rally of the physically-challenged persons and appreciated the efforts of Sangareddy district legal services authority chairman B Papi Reddy who arranged wheelchairs, mobile phones and laptops for the physically and visually-challenged persons. “This is inclusive justice and the beneficiaries will have the feeling of availing their share of entitlements this way. These are not doles to them, they are great enablers,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/sc-judge-people-can-get-justice-with-free-legal-aid/articleshow/87244389.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

This incident is second of its kind to be reported from the school in the last few days. A case has been registered against the accused under Section 354 (using criminal force to any woman, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The SHO of Ashok Nagar police station, Vikram Singh Rathore, said, "The girl had written to the DCP South office and we registered the FIR. The girl is a 2019-20 batch pass out. She was in class 12, when the teacher took such steps. She did not complain then as her session was about to end. However, when another teacher was arrested on the similar charges, she gathered courage to speak up." "We are investigating the matter and will talk to the girl soon," he said. As per the FIR, the girl is 21 years old. When she had informed her parents about the harassment by the teacher earlier, they decided not to proceed with the matter. Sanyukt Abhibhavak Sangh spokesperson Abhishek Jain said, "This is such a shameful matter that two teachers from the same reputed school are now under scanner for molesting girl students. Our children are not safe in schools even after we pay such hefty fees. The government must take immediate action against the teachers and the cases should be completed soon." Earlier, a girl had lodged an FIR against teacher Nikhil Jose, who was later on arrested and later released on bail.

Santosh Jagtap, a criminal on police records, and one of his assailants, Swagat Khaire, were killed, while two others injured in the incident. The two men arrested on Saturday night are Khaire’s accomplices. “The seized pistol will be sent to ballistic experts for to determine if it is the same weapon that was used in Friday’s firing,” a police officer said. Contrary to the initial impression that there were five assailants, including the car driver, the police have now concluded that there were only three people, including Khaire. “We have arrested Pavan Gorakh Misal (29) and Mahadev Balasaheb Adlinge (26), both residents of Dattawadi in Urali Kanchan, on the charge of murdering Jagtap. Both of them are criminals on police records. Adlinge is involved in murder and an attempt to murder cases while Misal has been involved in two cases of the Arms Act in the past,” said Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta. “We are not ruling out the possibility of some more men backing Khaire, Misal and Adlinge. We will arrest them in due course once we establish their role,” added the commissioner. Referring to Khaire’s death due to the firing by Jagtap’s bodyguard Shailesh Singh, the police commissioner said, “We will verify Singh’s claim that his firearm was licensed by the Uttar Pradesh police.” As of now, Singh is undergoing treatment for a bullet wound sustained on his hip in the shootout. The police are yet to collect documents relating to his firearm, which Singh claims got misplaced during the firing. Citing preliminary investigation, additional commissioner of police (crime) Ramnath Pokale said, “The attack on Jagtap can be traced to the November 2011 murders of the Sonawane cousins, Ganesh and Rambhau, at Rahu village after a dispute over lifting sand from Khamgaon in Daund. Jagtap was a prime suspect in the double murder case. One of the arrested duo, Misal, is a close friend of the Sonawanes’ relative, who survived the 2011 attack.” According to Pokale, apart from a fierce rivalry in the sand mining business in and around Daund, there could be other reasons too such as financial disputes and area dominance. “Jagtap and his men were active in areas along the Pune-Solapur highway between Urali Kanchan and Daund,” said Pokale.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/cops-arrest-two-seize-pistol-in-shootout-case/articleshow/87244404.cms||---

According to the report, of the 46.86 lakh target beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group, 44.69 lakh have received their first shot. At the same time, 41% of the beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group are fully vaccinated, the lowest among all age groups. Health officials said the most vulnerable age group of 60+ has a vaccination rate of 88% as 11.70 lakh of 13.27 beneficiaries have received their first shot while around 8.69 lakh are fully vaccinated. Sanjay Patil, chairman of IMA’s hospital board of India, said it takes at least two to three weeks for antibodies to develop and build up after taking the shot. Hence, the administration should prioritise the second shot ahead of Diwali and possible crowding in markets and other areas. According to Patil, the waning of immunity due to earlier doses in February and March is being discussed among the experts and for now, the administration must focus on ensuring full vaccination. The district on Sunday recorded vaccination of 13,585 beneficiaries across over 200 government and private vaccination sites.

The man, Sohail Kathuria, was booked and arrested after a video of a traffic cop on the bonnet of his car went viral. A constable had registered the FIR, alleging that when he asked the driver to stop his car, he accelerated, tried to “run away’’ and as he was standing in front, afraid of being hit by the car, he sat on the bonnet and held on tightly. Arguing for Kathuria’s bail before both courts, his counsel Nusrat Shah had said the charges were “concocted, false” and “exaggerated’’. He questioned which law permits a traffic cop to jump and sit on the bonnet of the car of private citizens when his directions to stop car are allegedly being disobeyed. Shah said he knows of no law which permits a public servant to behave in this manner. The Andheri metropolitan magistrate, while rejecting his bail plea, said there was “self-speaking” material against the accused. The Sessions court order granted bail on a surety of Rs 25,000 and permitted release on cash bail with conditions. Kathuria was released from Arthur Road jail on Saturday said advocate Kevin Gala who assisted advocate Shah.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-20-days-after-arrest-traffic-cops-assaulter-gets-bail-from-court/articleshow/87245707.cms||Swati Deshpande

As a result, he could not take normal food, until he was referred to a camp in 2001 run by plastic surgeon Dr Bharatendu Swain, who was then with a corporate hospital in Hyderabad. Shankar underwent a free reconstructive surgery and his woes came to an end. Like Shankar, many, who required surgeries but couldn’t afford them, were being referred to Dr Swain. The yearly camp become a monthly feature until Dr Swain quit his regular practice in 2008 and set up Aakar Asha Hospital. Located near Kukatpally, the hospital gets a lot of industrial accident cases. “Also, a lot of cases of children born with cleft lips and other deformities of the limbs are referred to us. We are trying to rope in more NGOs which are working in rural areas to identify cases and refer them to us,” the doctor added. While at the beginning of this year, Dr Swain started doing all surgeries completely free of cost, now he has achieved a milestone of completing 4,500 reconstructive surgeries. In a bid to do so, a Recon mela and an NGO seminar was held recently to enhance outreach for physical disability in the post Covid times. “It was aimed at giving them a lowdown into intricacies of reconstructive surgeries in order to help them partner in the initiative,” he said, adding that the plan was to reach out to as many patients as possible.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/asha-for-people-with-birth-defects/articleshow/87244403.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Ahmedabad||3 south Gujarat districts account for 57% of monthly Covid cases||AHMEDABAD: Between September 23 and October 24, Gujarat recorded 595 Covid-19 cases. Out of total, 341 or 57% were from just three districts of south Gujarat – 173 from Surat (including city), 125 from Valsad, and 43 from Navsari. To put the figure in perspective, even Ahmedabad (including city) recorded less cases than Valsad at 121. Valsad and Navsari had recorded only 9 cases each in the preceding month, recording nearly 14-fold and 5-fold rise. Compared to that, Surat recorded 29% rise from 134 and Ahmedabad 12% rise from 108 in the preceding month. Overall, Gujarat recorded 23% spike in monthly cases from 484. The cases in two other major districts remained low – Vadodara recoded 47 and Rajkot 18 cases in the past 30 days. Moreover, out of five deaths recorded in Gujarat in the past one month, three were recorded from Valsad. Valsad in fact has the highest active cases in Gujarat with 45 compared to 26 in Surat and 25 in Ahmedabad. Why the southern districts are more vulnerable? Experts pointed at comparatively higher movement of people across border. A senior state health department official said that close to 50% of the positive persons had either direct travel history or they had come in contact with someone who had travelled outside the state. “Similar is the case with a city like Ahmedabad that witnesses relatively higher passenger volume compared to other cities. While vaccination has brought down the number of daily positive cases and deaths drastically compared to the second wave,” said a senior health department official. “The emphasis is also to ensure that the screening at the entry points is done diligently and contact tracing of every case is done to ensure that there is no surprising spike,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/3-south-gujarat-districts-account-for-57-of-monthly-cases/articleshow/87244417.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Pune||Full vaccination for Pune district only by March 2022||PUNE: Lakhs of citizens in Pune district are unlikely to be fully vaccinated by December, rough estimates by senior health department officials show. Officials told TOI that the entire eligible adult population in Pune district would be fully vaccinated only by March 2022. The 84-day gap between two Covishield shots rather than the vaccine supplies is the reason. As per statistics from the health department, nearly six lakh citizens have yet to get their first doses which the authorities aim to achieve by October-end. These citizens will be eligible for their second doses only in second fortnight of January even if all of them were to get their first shots during the next few days. A majority of them are likely to get Covishield as it is more widely available. Add to this number the remaining who would be due for second doses, those who received their first doses earlier this month, and those who would opt for it anytime after October. As of Saturday, over half the district’s eligible adult population is yet to be fully vaccinated. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that those who would get the first dose this month will have to wait for 84 days for their second shot. “It is thus likely that we may achieve full vaccination for the entire target adult population in the district by March 2022. By the next few days, we would be able to achieve double vaccination of half of the total projected adults in the district, almost 42 lakh,” he added. Pune Zilla Parishad CEO Ayush Prasad said, “There are several reasons it may take beyond December 31 to achieve double vaccination for the entire adult population of Pune district. We believe that 14-15% population may be the district’s floating population and hence, that will also have to be taken into account before arriving at the fully vaccinated numbers.” Prasad said that some beneficiaries in a few rural pockets are hesitant to be vaccinated. “Getting them to start the vaccination schedule will be a challenge, but we are working with NGOs and political leaders to address this,” he added. There are nearly 3 lakh people left to get their first doses in Haveli, and one lakh in Daund. “In Haveli, some may have already got their first shots from the city. Some may also be disconnected, for which we are closely monitoring vaccination status of population in rural areas by checking for their vax certificates. In Daund, we are planning to organise a special vaccination drive to push the remaining people to get their first shots as soon as possible,” Prasad said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/full-vaccination-for-pune-district-only-by-march-2022/articleshow/87244402.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Highrises get going on rainwater harvesting, residents still skeptical||NEW DELHI: The work, while slow due to initial resistance and confusion, has begun on installation of rainwater harvesting systems in highrise housing societies. Delhi Jal Board has made it mandatory for existing and new buildings measuring 100 sq metres and above to install such systems. The RWAs had all along argued that it was not technically feasible to create water harvesting pits in already built-up areas on their complexes for fear of weakening the foundations. They also scorned the state government’s Rs 50,000 incentive as being too little for something that could cost many lakhs of rupees. At Medha Apartment in Mayur Vihar I, construction of the RWH system is in full swing. Promod Aggarwal, RWA president, said it would be operational in a month’s time. “Our members were supportive and approved a project budget of Rs 12 lakh. They agreed it was our responsibility to conserve and help increase groundwater level,” said Aggarwal. “But DJB hasn’t given us any assistance till now.” A consultant was asked to review the apartment complex structure, which was erected in 1982-84. “We were apprehensive about the foundations getting affected,” said Y P Tyagi, RWA secretary. “The consultant assured us that the collection pits could be built in one of the three parks without risks. We have had two pits constructed now.” Nirman Cooperative Group Housing Apartment in the same area has also initiated the process. “We will construct three pits because ours is a big society over four acres. The project will cost us Rs 33 lakh and we will seek approval in the annual general meeting soon,” said Sanjeev Jayaswal, president of the society. He, however, added, “We don’t see the point of spending so much money when our society is 30 years old and has completed 60% of its expected life. Implementing the project also means postponing other important works, such as CCTV cameras and replacement of old water pipelines.” The high-rises have till December 31 to comply, DJB having recently extended the deadline from the earlier September 30. A DJB official said, “It is aimed at conserving natural water. The feedback so far is satisfying but we will start acting if the big properties do not meet the norms after the deadline.” Gagan Batra, secretary of Kirti Apartments, Mayur Vihar I, said it was debatable whether some societies required such systems since they were constructed near riverbanks with high groundwater. “I think that if the government is genuinely working to conserve water, it should construct water harvesting pits in public parks at their own expense,” said Batra. In Dwarka, some societies wondered about the unnecessary expenses on installing new RWH systems because the policy now stresses on conserving terrace water. “Otherwise we already have water harvesting systems in all societies,” said Sudha Sinha, president, Federation of Cooperative Group Housing Societies, Dwarka. “So many queries on the process and requirements remained unanswered because DJB officials aren’t ready to meet us offline. They insist on online work.” A DJB official, however, denied these allegations and said that the water utility’s RWA cells were providing all assistance and answering any query related to the issue. “Our RWA cells as well as the Jal Shakti Kendras are conducting physical meetings. Their contact details are all available online,” said the official.

The two Covid vaccines meant for immunisation of children in the 2-17 years age bracket are likely to be introduced together under the country’s Covid immunisation programme once this broader priority list is ready, the official said. The government is going to prioritise vaccination for children with pre-existing illnesses (comorbidities). “In addition to ZyCoV-D, we will also be looking at Covaxin data once the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) gives emergency use approval. The plan is to bring out a comprehensive and consolidated list of children with comorbidities for priority,” the official said. DCGI has yet to approve Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for emergency use in children (2-17 years), despite a recommendation from the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) earlier this month. The regulatory body is seeking additional technical inputs on the vaccine. The SEC is part of the central drugs standard control organisation. Zydus Cadila got emergency use approval for ZyCoV-D (12-17 years) from DCGI in August. DCGI’s approval is mandatory for the vaccine to be included in the government’s Covid immunisation programme. Experts, however, have been emphasizing that there was no immediate need to vaccinate all children. This is because children have been largely spared of severe Covid disease. “The focus is on vaccinating adult population at high risk. Vaccinating children, especially healthy ones, is not an immediate priority. Eventually, the government will have to vaccine everyone, but there is no pressing need to vaccinate all children,” said Pramod Jog, a member of Maharashtra’s paediatric Covid task force.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/broader-priority-list-a-must-for-combined-launch-of-kids-vax/articleshow/87244423.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Hence, we appeal to all the parents to send their children to schools,” said senior paediatrician Pramod Jog, who is also a member of the state paediatric Covid task force. Covid immunisation of 472 million children under 18 years in India involves logistic issues like vaccine supply. “About 7-8 months may be required for the immunisation of all the children in the age group. Their schooling cannot be withheld for so long,” Jog said. Parents should weigh the risks and the benefits of keeping their kids at home and sending them to school, experts said. Though vaccination is undoubtedly an effective and safe measure, there is no reason for parents to use it as a parameter for sending their kids to school, unless the child has some comorbidity, Jog said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said, “Parents should understand Covid has always been asymptomatic or mild in the majority of kids. School authorities are fully aware of the guidelines in the event of a child testing positive for Covid.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/do-not-delay-school-attendance-over-jab-covid-task-force-member/articleshow/87244414.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Aurangabad||Many skip health department examination in Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: Unlike a few other centres in Maharashtra, the public health department’s staff recruitment examination was held smoothly in Aurangabad, amid considerable absenteeism.  A total of 30,973 candidates had registered for examinations for both the sessions in Aurangabad. Of them, as many as 14,022 candidates did not turn for the tests. The examinations, meant for recruitment of around 160 posts of Class C employees in the Aurangabad division, were held across 63 centres in the city during morning and afternoon sessions. Aurangabad district civil surgeon Dr Pradeep Kulkarni attributed around 45% absenteeism during the examinations to candidates who had applied for the same post from different divisions. “Such candidates appeared for the examination from one division only, leading to absenteeism at other centre,” he said. As a special arrangement, few candidates who had difficulties in downloading hall-tickets were offered necessary on-spot help by the authorities. Kulkarni said logistics van carrying examination-related material was sent to Nashik with escort for further formalities. The recruitment examination, which was earlier mired into controversy for multiple reasons including postponement over technical issues, will witness the next round for filling Class D posts on October 31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/many-skip-health-dept-exams-in-aurangabad/articleshow/87243276.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Waqf properties rented out for a pittance, board gets poorer||HYDERABAD: The Madina building, located in a prime commercial area, earns a pittance to the state Waqf board. With 500-odd shops, the Madina building would have easily contributed a monthly rental of not less than Rs 6 crore. But, the rental from the building complex is a mere few lakh rupees. Many tenants do not pay the rent, which over a period has accumulated to about Rs 28 crore. The rental value collected from tenants was fixed long ago and it has not been renewed despite the board promising to increase the rent way back in 2017. Caught in court cases, the Waqf board is not able to either evict the defaulters or enhance the rent to mop up its revenues. Madina building, which was built to help the poor in Madina in Saudi Arabia before the petrodollar boom took over the Arab world, sums up the state of affairs in the state Waqf board, one of the richest Muslim endowment bodies in India. With 33,929 Waqf institutions with a total landed property spread over 77,538 acres worth at least Rs 5,00,000 crore, the board could have easily taken care of the destitute and met the educational needs of the principle minority community. But, with 57,428 acres under encroachment, the riches of the Waqf board are limited to just official documents. The board hardly earns Rs 5 crore as revenue per year from these Waqf institutions. The board has actual control over 20,110 acres. The case of Madina building is just the tip of iceberg. Most of the Waqf institutions located in prime commercial localities in the state do not contribute any significant revenue to the board. Mostly, the board depends on the state government for funds to take up welfare or development activities. Waqf properties including Aneesul Gurba and the building next to the Haj House remain half-complete though the construction work was taken up several years ago. These buildings could have contributed at least Rs 15 crore towards goodwill amount and a monthly rental of about Rs 2 crore. Sources in the Waqf board reveal that the board has only seven district Waqf officers while there should be 33 officials for 33 districts. Some officials in the board are said be undergraduates. Each officer is forced to look after five districts. Pending court cases, many custodians or mutavallis continue to remain in their posts. Some of them have been accused of swindling crores of rupees of Waqf funds. Recently, shops were built on graves in a famous dargah though it is against the Waqf rules to convert graves into commercial or residential structures. The state government has ordered a CID probe into the irregularities in the board. This is not the first such probe. Investigations earlier led to nowhere and the corruption continues. Waqf records were seized by the state earlier but the probe did not progress further. State Waqf board chairman Mohammad Saleem told TOI that the income of the board had increased after he took over. Rubbishing the allegations as “opposition sponsored”, Saleem said the board now has Rs 60 crore in its bank account and deposits. “We will evict the encroachers. Notices were served on them. We will revise the rental value once legal hurdles are cleared,” he said, promising to generate revenue from the half-complete building adjacent to Haj House.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/waqf-properties-rented-out-for-a-pittance-board-gets-poorer/articleshow/87244419.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Delhi||Puzzle parking finally falls in place at Adhchini village||NEW DELHI: After a long wait, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) finally inaugurated the automated puzzle parking lot at Adhchini village on Sunday. The facility, which has a provision for six floors, is spread over 467.8 square metres and can accommodate 56 vehicles. SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan said they had been working to improve the parking system in all four zones and minimise vehicular congestion. “The parking lot will cater to users of both rural and urban areas. It has been constructed on less space than traditional parking lots,” he added. Puzzle parking is a fully-automated system featuring a combination of pallets that enable horizontal and vertical movement of spots to park and retrieve cars. At least one parking space on each floor is kept vacant to allow swift movement of vehicles. The first such parking lot in the city was made operational near Green Park Metro Station. The foundation stone of the Adhchini project was laid in March 2019 with a deadline of six months. However, it was delayed due to the pandemic, among other reasons. The facility was inaugurated by MoS external affairs and culture Meenakshi Lekhi and Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta. “There will be no human interference in the operation of the system and no one will be allowed inside the main parking facility. A green wall has been developed by the horticulture department on the rear of the parking lot facing Adhchini village,” said an official. SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said the parking lot had two modules with six levels in each. “Around 31 cars can be parked in the first module and 25 in the second. The structure is made of steel and is pollution-free. The response time will be very less. Fire fighting and other arrangements have also been made there,” he added. Puzzle parking lots are planned at GK-I with an estimated space for 399 vehicles, at Amar Colony for 81 vehicles, at Nizamuddin and Punjabi Bagh for 86 and 255 vehicles, respectively, and tower parking at GK-II with a capacity for 238 vehicles. “Tenders have been invited for the GK-I parking lot. The project will take 18 months to be completed. For GK-II, Amar Colony and Punjabi Bagh projects, some approvals are pending after which the tendering process will start. Digging work for the Nizamuddin parking lot was stopped due to 11kVA cables. Once the cables are shifted, the project will be completed within three months,” said a senior SDMC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/puzzle-parking-finally-falls-in-place-at-adhchini-village/articleshow/87245051.cms||---
---||Delhi||Over 1,400 criminals in Delhi come under fresh police lens||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana has directed the DCPs of the 15 districts to launch a special drive against criminals living in their jurisdiction and open their history sheets. The officers have been asked to make over 1,400 criminals involved in 10 cases or more history-sheeters. Data shows that 267 such criminals were identified by Northeast district, whereas 198 criminals were found in Shahdara, 154 in Outer and 136 in East district. While 116 criminals with 10 or more cases lodged against them were identified in West district, the number in Northwest was 115 and 86 in South. “About 320 criminals were found living in the remaining districts,” the data showed. Police sources told TOI that in a recent meeting with the top brass, Asthana said, “Whenever criminals are arrested and they also have previous involvements, their history sheet should be opened by the police station concerned.” The reason behind opening the history sheet is to keep track of the criminal. They would be called to the police station or a beat officer would visit their house at frequent intervals. “Their involvements will be kept in a separate register. The history sheet will be shared with cops of other states if we get information that the criminal has left Delhi and is residing in that state,” said an officer. Senior officers have also been asked to take up special drives and mount surveillance on habitual criminals in their area. “The DCPs were asked to review the history sheets of criminals and upgrade, downgrade or close them based on current activities,” the officer said. The top cop was told by the officers that 712 criminals were found fit for opening their history sheets. Out of 548 criminals whose history sheets were opened, 113 were from Shahdara district, followed by 86 from Northeast and 73 from Outer. While 299 were found unfit, 391 criminals were being examined for opening their history sheets. “After the history sheet is opened, the criminal is declared a bad character of the area. Such criminals are mostly involved in street crime, gambling, extortion and liquor trafficking,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/over-1400-criminals-in-delhi-come-under-fresh-police-lens/articleshow/87245061.cms||Abhay Singh

A preliminary post-mortem report confirmed that the baby was smothered to death before being dumped in the river, police said. “We are registering a case under IPC sections 302 (murder), 201 (attempt to destroy evidence) and 34 (common intention) as the woman confessed that she smothered the baby, while her son dumped the body in the river on Friday,” senior inspector Younus Shaikh of the Yerawada police said. “The girl was born of an illicit relationship,” he said. Shaikh said, “The woman, who is a school dropout, told police that she was married to a man from Karnataka and stayed with him there for 14 years before he left her two years ago. The couple had a son out of wedlock. She returned to her native place in Buldhana and got into a relationship with another man. She gave birth to the girl three months ago.” He said, “Initially, police questioned the boy suspecting that he might have killed the child. However, after the post-mortem report, they started questioning his mother too.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/woman-son-detained-over-death-of-infant-girl/articleshow/87244438.cms||---

Travel agents said that nearly 40% travellers had chosen to reschedule their trips from Pune rather than re-routing them via Mumbai. Santosh Gupta, owner of Shree Vinayak Holidays, said that the airport was expected to be extremely busy before Diwali. “A lot of people who were to travel between October 14 and October 29, have opted for rescheduling. Close to 40% travellers, who have rescheduled, plan to travel right after the airport opens up. The crowd and the rush at the airport will be huge for sure,” Gupta told TOI. Several passengers are still facing issues with refunds, but re-routing of trips from Pune has been fairly less, travel companies said. “Re-routing of trips have happened but the numbers are not big. We took care of around six re-routings while more than 50 chose to reschedule their trips after October 30. The issue with re-routing lies is that flyers have been put on flights from Mumbai at odd hours. Many realized this would happen and rescheduled their flights. A large number of flyers now have started to book tickets via travel agents rather than doing it themselves,” the representative of another city-based travel company, added. “I was booked for the travel to Lucknow with my family on October 22 for a marriage in the family. I rescheduled my journey and will now travel on November 2. The relatives understood the problem and now we will celebrate Diwali with them,” Dhanori resident Keshav Dhan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/heavy-crowd-after-airport-reopening-likely-as-travellers-reschedule-trips/articleshow/87244434.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Thane||Thane private hospitals see more return for jab 2||THANE: The volume of vaccine beneficiaries opting for the second dose in private facilities and hospitals is higher than those in corporation centres, reveals Thane municipal corporation data. A cursory glance through the October 22 statistics reveals that only 49 per cent of those 7.6 lakh beneficiaries who had taken the first dose at municipality run vaccination centres between January 16 and October 22 returned to take the second jab. In contrast, private facilities that started operations after June recorded nearly 64 per cent of the 2.6 lakh beneficiaries taking the second jab. Nonetheless, the volume of those preferring government facilities is higher with 11.47 lakh beneficiaries (both doses) as compared to 4.27 lakhs in private facilities in Thane city. the city has recorded a total 15.7 lakh doses till October 22. While experts claimed sustained flow of vaccine stock and ambience provided at private facilities coupled with regular follow up could be the reason for the good numbers while in contrast many municipal centres had faced vaccine shortage recently and coupled with shortage of staff may have left many off the follow up chain for the second jab. The Smt Sulochanadevi Singhania School and Jupiter Hospital had recently jointly conducted a drive at the school premises inoculating over 50,000 citizens. Revathi Srinivasan, Principal of Smt S Sulochanadevi Singhania School said the school offered their expansive space as they didn’t want citizens to come with a fear of vaccines. “The ambience made a big difference,” said Manisha Shah of Jupiter Hospital. A beneficiary from Uthalsar who had taken both doses from a private hospital said he received follow up calls and reminders from the facility for the second dose. Municipal officials maintained the numbers of second jabs is likely to be higher as volume of beneficiaries from few centres including the Civil hospital was to be collated in the TMC numbers. “We have a dedicated team that follows up with the beneficiaries for the second dose. The delivery of doses was affected in between due to shortage but the gap has now been bridged now and based on the response we are also mulling to start 24x7 vaccination,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/mumbai-thane-pvt-hosps-see-more-return-for-jab-2/articleshow/87245444.cms||Manoj Badgeri

---||Delhi||EOW arrests CA for diverting Rs 27.3 crore of employer’s money||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing has arrested a chartered accountant for allegedly diverting Rs 27.3 crore from his employer’s account to his personal account. Police said the accused has been identified as Kamal Kumar who worked as the general manager (finance) at a law firm. The cops began an investigation after receiving a complaint from the firm, J Sagar associates, informing about the alleged fraud. The firm’s partners claimed that the accused had made several bogus or forged entries in firms’ accounting software and these transactions were made on the false pretext of payments for taxes of certain clients. “After a preliminary enquiry, a case was registered. The probe revealed that during the Covid pandemic, the accused Kumar diverted Rs 27.28 crore in his personal bank account and misappropriated these funds during last one and half year. It was also revealed that accused had invested this money in share market and booked losses in option trading,” additional commissioner R K Singh said. After his role was confirmed, a team led by DCP K Ramesh was formed to apprehend the accused. The suspect was nabbed using technical surveillance and intelligence inputs and taken on remand for interrogation. “Kumar created bogus entries in the accounting software of his employer either though himself or through his subordinates. Being competent to authorize the approvals for the payments up to Rs 1.5 lakh, he approved more than 2,300 entries in last one and half year. He diverted the funds of the firm into his personal bank account on the pretext of withholding tax payments on behalf of clients or stamp duty payments,” the EOW official said. Kumar, cops said, was a qualified CA (Charted Accountant) and was working with the complainant firm as general manager at a monthly salary of Rs 4.5 lakh. Further investigation with regard to the roles of other accomplices, if any, is in progress. “The companies, firms and other entities having heavy financial flows in day to day dealings are hereby cautioned to keep a close watch on the transactions and the employees authorised in this regard through regular internal audits and thus not allowing development of autonomous power centers,” the EOW official appealed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/eow-arrests-ca-for-diverting-rs-27-3-crore-of-employers-money/articleshow/87245079.cms||---
---||Pune||Study finds easy prey slowing down leopards close to villages in Junnar||Pune: Experts from the Wildlife Institute of India (WIA) and the Junnar forest division have found that the five radio-collared leopards in the Junnar forest division are staying close to human habitats in villages. Their movement is ‘slow’ as they get enough food in their surroundings, they said. Bilal Habib, scientist at WIA who is heading the project, told TOI on Saturday, “These animals seem to have adopted their strategy to stay in a human-dominated landscape. Because their behavior is in complete contrast to the leopards living in the wildlife sanctuary in Maharashtra. Leopards in wildlife sanctuaries usually cover 2-3 km distance in a day in search of prey. They get scared of loud sounds and leave the area for their safety. However, the animals in the Junnar division are moving only 400- 00 m distance in a day. They are living in sugar cane fields and do not even get scared of loud sounds.” Two WIA researchers are monitoring their movements and living patterns closely. Habib said,“We have got permission from the state government to radio collar 15 leopards. We are in the process of collaring the rest.” Jayram Gowda, deputy conservator of forest, Junnar division, said, “Studying each aspect of the animal’s behaviour is key. We will then have a concrete standard operating procedure for the entire division to address the human-animal conflict. The findings have, so far, proved that the animals in the division are staying close to the human habitation.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/study-finds-easy-prey-slowing-down-leopards-close-to-villages-in-junnar/articleshow/87244445.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Govt agencies unlikely to get road digging discount||Pune: Government agencies will have to bear the same cost for road digging and restoration as that of the private companies once the new proposal is cleared by the Pune Municipal Corporation standing committee. Government agencies currently pay only 50% of the total charges. The PMC is contemplating doing away with the discount for government bodies. On an average, Rs12,000 is charged per running metre from private firms, while government agencies pay around Rs6,000. The move is aimed at generating the civic body’s revenue and meeting the increased cost of road restoration. A proposal regarding the same has been tabled before the standing committee. The PMC had offered a special discount to the government agencies in 2015. “This resolution should be scrapped. Agencies like the Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited, state electricity department and other government agencies should be charged the prevailing rates,” stated the proposal. Civic data shows that nearly 200km of roads are dug up on an average every year for providing various services. “Factors like increased material costs have been considered for the proposal. The revenue generation has been affected due to the pandemic. The civic body has to find ways to increase revenue,” said a senior PMC official.  “The decision regarding the proposal will be taken after due discussion. It will be declared accordingly,” said Hemant Rasane, chairman, the PMC standing committee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/govt-agencies-unlikely-to-get-road-digging-discount/articleshow/87244442.cms||---

The accused has been identified as Sarwan Singh, alias Colonel, alias Pradeep Singh, of Nurpur Bet. Charan Singh of Phallewal said in his police complaint, “I met the accused after he visited my acquaintance to get his driving licence made. He introduced himself as an Army officer. He told me that he helps youth get jobs in Army and charges a fee for it. He demanded Rs 3.5 lakh from me to help me get a job.”Police said, “The accused gave Charan and other youths Army uniforms and shoes and took money for these. On July 16, he called them to Halwara Army Station from where, he said, they would be taken to an Army centre in buses.” Charan Singh said, “When we reached Halwara Army Station, the accused and his accomplices were not there. As their cellphones were switched off and there was no trace of them, we realized that we had been cheated.”Jodhan police station SHO inspector Hira Singh said the accused was yet to be arrested. He would claim to be an Army Captain. He was with the Army, but was not an officer, he added. A case has been registered under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code.‘Got job on brother’s documents’Police said the accused had cheated 27 persons of Rs 23.70 lakh on the pretext of helping them get jobs in the Army. “The accused uses two names, Sarwan Singh and Pradeep Singh. He had used the documents of his elder brother to get a job in the Army. His brother had lodged a complaint against him. This has been confirmed by his family member.”Police said most of the youths the accused duped are from Ludhiana district and a few are from Sangrur district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/fake-army-officer-booked-for-duping-27-youths-on-job-pretext/articleshow/87243862.cms||---

He was intercepted by soldiers at the gate of the Mechanised Infantry Regimental Centre around 11.30am. Police said Mahesh Jagtap hails from Rahata tehsil and is in the second year of his BCom degree course at a private college in Ahmednagar. “During questioning, he said his girlfriend had asked him to get a job in the Indian Army within six months if he wanted to marry her. Following this, he got an army uniform stitched from a private tailor shop in Ahmednagar,” explained assistant inspector Shishir Kumar Deshmukh of the Bhingar cantonment police station. “Jagtap made a forged Army I-card and an appointment letter. He then told his parents and relatives that he had joined the Indian Army and even distributed sweets. However, his girlfriend asked him to send pictures of his unit in uniform,” said Deshmukh. “On Sunday morning, he wore the uniform without medals and emblem. The soldiers at the MIRC gate intercepted him. He showed them the identity card but could not give correct answers to the subsequent questions. Thereafter, the personnel from the Southern Command’s Military Intelligence (MI) detained him for questioning. After confirming his identity and motive, they handed him to us,” he added. The police have registered a case against him under sections 140 (wearing garb or carrying a token used by a soldier, sailor, or airman - whoever, not being a soldier), 420 (cheating), and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating). Police said Jagtap comes from a humble background and was working as a clerk with a private firm while simultaneously pursuing studies. His parents are farmers.

Large number of patients from Mansarovar, Walled City and Vaishali Nagar areas are reaching hospitals and clinics with symptoms of dengue. Post rains, Mansarovar has reported 167 cases of dengue, Walled City 112 and Vaishali Nagar 111. Dravyavati river in Mansarovar is also turning into a breeding ground of mosquitoes. Health department officials are conducting anti-larvae operations along the river banks. “We have intensified our survey and anti-larvae operations across the city,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). In rural areas, Kotputli has reported 299 cases till date. Kotputli has always been a high risk area for dengue as it has a history of outbreak of vector-borne diseases. Sanganer, which is also among areas which are worst-hit due to dengue, has reported 174 cases. Spread of dengue is more in urban areas than in rural belt While 922 persons have tested positive for the ailment in urban areas so far, 795 cases have been reported from Jaipur rural areas. The health department is preparing a daily record of dengue cases as it was declared as a notifiable disease in the state two years ago. “We send daily area-wise list of those who tested positive for dengue to Jaipur Municipal Corporation, which then conducts fogging on the basis of areas witnessing a spike in cases,” said a health department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/dengue-spike-continues-in-city-mansarovar-kotputli-worst-hit/articleshow/87245095.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

This will not only help in staying healthy but also in keeping the environment clean. I request all the people present here to plant medicinal plants in their homes and stay healthy,” Jain said at the event organised before the upcoming Ayurveda Day. “Ayurveda, which is called the science of life, plays an important role in maintaining our physical well-being and disease resistance. Ayurveda and yoga are such discipline, which teaches you to live in a healthy and right way,” Jain said. He stressed that more and more people are living an unhealthy lifestyle and encouraged everyone to practice a healthy way of life to maintain a good physical and mental well-being. The walk started from Central Park, Connaught Place and ended at Ayurvedic and Unani Tibbia College and Hospital, Karol Bagh, where medicinal plants were distributed to the participants. Jain congratulated the directorate of Ayush for its contribution to the healthcare system through ayurveda and applauded the college for its contribution during the first wave of Covid-19 and said that he is awaiting more contribution in the future. “In today's comfortable lifestyle where all the work is done by robots and artificial intelligence, we do not do any kind of physical exercise. This Ayurwalk event is a reminder that we should walk every day,” he said. “According to ayurveda there are many benefits of walking. In ayurveda, the right way to initiate physical activities or go for a walk has been told. After lunch, it is told to walk ‘Shatpadi’ i.e. a hundred steps,” he said. “The purpose of ayurveda is to take care of the physical and mental well-being of a healthy person and to treat the disease of the patient,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/as-jain-kicks-off-ayurwalk-he-urges-people-to-take-up-physical-activity/articleshow/87245097.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Bookings explode at dog boarding centres||AHMEDABAD: Kanika Lakhera, an Ahmedabad-based professional, has two pet dogs. Keeping them at home during Diwali often becomes a nightmare because the two are edgy due to the loud fireworks. “We usually travel a day or two before Diwali and check them into a dog boarding centre on the outskirts of Ahmedabad where there’s hardly any disturbing noise,” said Lakhera. “This year, when we travel, we will send the two to the boarding centre for a few days.” Lakhera plans to travel with her dogs to the mountains next year. Dog boarding centres in Ahmedabad are flooded with calls, inquiries, and bookings for the Diwali week as people plan to travel out this festive season in droves. These centres were booked to 80% capacity already for the October 30 to November 10 period, and some up to November 14. “We already have bookings for about 25 dogs at our facility for the festive season and I have started turning down requests for certain dates as we’re fully booked,” said Richa Singh, who runs a dog boarding facility near Sanand. Singh added: “During their stay here, the dogs are fed non-vegetarian meals in accordance with their diet plan and are walked and groomed.” Singh’s facility has a limited number of kennels where the slightly aggressive dogs are housed. The friendly ones are free to roam in a gated space. Dog boarding centres charge typically between Rs 500 and Rs 1,250 per night per dog, depending on the size and the breed. The bigger and exotic dogs — such as St Bernard, Great Dane, and German Shepherd — usually attract the highest charges. Suhani Gehlot, co-founder of a boarding centre along Nalsarovar Road, said: “This time, as more people are travelling, the inquiries have increased.” Gehlot added: “We will be forced to turn down requests for accommodating dogs over the next couple of days. This Diwali, we’re clearly seeing more inquiries unlike last year when fewer people travelled because of the pandemic.” Diwali and Christmas holidays are the busiest periods of the year for dog boarding centres, and bookings are typically made well in advance. It is not just people from Ahmedabad but also those from other cities including Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Bhuj, Gandhidham, Anand, and Nadiad who avail of the boarding facilities in Ahmedabad. With a limited number of such facilities in the city, the traction is usually high. “Often, people leave their dogs at the facility because they don’t want to keep them at home where it is utterly noisy during Diwali and pets tend to get scared,” said Gehlot. Several others who are not travelling are turning to other measures to keep their dogs calm. “There are several playlists available online which render white noise. This helps mask the outside noise to a great extent. We let the pets be wherever they’re comfortable and keep the festivities quiet,” said Aarohi Chauhan, a city-based professional. “Usually, we do escape the city’s madness but this time, due to pressing work schedules, we’re pretty much in Ahmedabad.” Why do dogs get restless during Diwali? According to animal behaviour experts, dogs tend to perceive the noise and unpredictable sounds of fireworks as a threat which often triggers a fight or flight response. “This means a dog will typically either bark at the sound or simply run away and try to hide,” said Salomi Gupte, an Ahmedabad-based canine behaviourist. “Other common symptoms include anxiety, shivering, and restlessness.” Remote destinations: Hit with pet parents In this festive period, pet owners often leave for destinations where they and their furry babies can have some peace and quiet! For instance, Piyas Choudhuri, an Ahmedabad-based professional, leaves town with his wife, their son, and their pack of dogs every Diwali. “Travelling during Diwali holidays was always fun and we used to find less crowded places to unwind,” said Choudhuri, who is headed to Uttarakhand with his big family. He added: “After we got the dogs, we realized that it is a nightmare for them as they’re scared and anxious all the time. Some people throw firecrackers in the direction the dogs are walking — just for fun.” Travelling out of the city became even more necessary in such circumstances, he said. “We find the remotest of places such as a hill station or a seashore not frequented by tourists,” Choudhuri said. “Last year we went to Jibhi in Himachal Pradesh.” Arpit Pandya, an Ahmedabad-based businessman, often finds it difficult to handle his dog, Caesar, during Diwali. Therefore, Pandya travels out around Dhanteras and returns only on Pancham. “Caesar is extremely sensitive to loud sounds of fireworks and immediately hides under the table and doesn’t come out for hours and even stops eating,” Pandya said. “It takes a long time to pacify him. We travel to Dharampur near Olpad in Surat to our relative’s place which is at a remote location.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bookings-explode-at-dog-boarding-centres/articleshow/87244492.cms||Niyati Parikh

Many returned ho-me after selling the horses to bada sahibs (British offici-als), rajas, maharajas and nawabs. But others stayed back, living a nomadic existence. Some of these Iranians came to Maharashtra too and, post-Independence, settled down on the outskirts of cities and towns, including Mumbra, Kalyan, Pune and Sangli. Now Iran-origin, owner of popular restaurant Café Irani Chaii at Mahim and documentary filmmaker Mansoor Showghi Yezdi has made a documentary depicting the story of these Iranians in India. The 17-minute, non-commercial film in Persian, Khaneh Be Doosh (The Nomads), with English subtitles, maps the over 500-year journey of these erstwhile gypsies who have settled but are marginalized. “A decade or so ago I was at a programme where I met a group of people who spoke Persian and looked a bit different from Indians though they were Indians,”says 64-year-old Yezdi whose grandfather father had come to India from Yezd in Iran in 1890 on foot. “Further research showed they are among the most neglected Indians. I decided to make a film.” Yezdi's grandfather came to Bombay in 1890 walking all the way from Yezd in Iran and began selling tea from a coal-heated kettle at Apollo Bunder. His father followed in the footsteps of his grandfather and prospered as he set up several restaurants and canteens, including the one at V Shantaram’s Plaza Cinema at Dadar. It is here that Yezdi saw countless movies and decided to become a filmmaker. “The spelling Chaii with double ‘I’ in Café Irani Chaii is deliberate, denoting friendship with India and Iran,” he says. Today most of the descendants of Iran-origin nomads or gypsies are in dire straits. Leading a sedentary life, these Persian-speaking Indian citizens possess passports, Aadhaar cards and other documents. With little or no education, many of the youths are drug peddlers, addicts and in jails for crimes like chain snatching, vehicle thefts and drug smuggling. Around 150 Iranian families are settled at Ambivli in Kalyan. Many of them have earned notoriety with some boys jailed for months. “The biggest problem is lack of education. Manyof them work as police informants even as drug peddling and addiction are rampant,” says Maryam Jaffer Hussain, a social worker. But she is all praise for former DCP of Zone 3 (Kalyan) Sanjay Jadhav who tried to make a difference among the Iranians of Ambivli. “I held a meeting with the community leaders and parents at their mosque. Many children were put to civic schools while the youths were given vocational training. Many found jobs and the case of chain snatching dropped after sometime,” says Jadhav who is SP (Highway Traffic) in Pune. Sympathetic attitude to them, says Shabbir Moham-med Ali Jafri, a member of the Iranians at Rashid Compound in Mumbra, can lift them out of poverty. Yezdi’s documentary may help create awareness about them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-docu-on-iranians-in-india-maps-pitiful-condition-of-ex-nomads/articleshow/87245448.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

The report says 36,200 metric tonnes of construction and demolition (C&D) waste lying on floodplain has been removed and a compensation of about Rs 1.5 crore has been imposed from 2018 to July 2021 for dumping of malba and illegal parking on the Yamuna floodplain. DDA is the land-owning agency. National Green Tribunal had earlier ordered demarcation of the floodplain. Another order of the tribunal banned dumping of any kind of waste or construction or demolition debris in the floodplain. Anyone who is found violating the order is liable to pay an environmental compensation up to Rs 50,000. The report said, “100% work for demarcation of floodplain completed. 591 bollards (marked with GPS coordinates), 375 flag posts and 27 sign boards for the entire stretch from Wazirabad barrage to Dhobighat Jaitpur have been installed.” It added that 36,200 metric tonnes of C&D waste lying on the floodplain has been lifted or is utilised for development of Yamuna project by DDA. As dumping of construction waste and garbage and parking of illegal vehicles are prohibited on the floodplain, a total of 457 challans have been issued from 2018 to July 31, 2021. Of the total Rs 1.5 crore fine imposed on the violators, Rs 21.2 lakh has been recovered. The report stated that Rs 21.3 lakh compensation was levied in 2020, but Rs 36.4 lakh fine was levied from January to July this year. For ensuring no illegal dumping of C&D waste and to prevent encroachment on the floodplain, DDA has deployed 125 security guards round the clock in three shifts at vulnerable points along with four patrolling vehicles between Wazirabad Barrage and Okhla Barrage. “GPS monitoring of security guards and patrolling vehicles is being done. 81 CCTV cameras have been installed at 27 locations to check the illegal dumping of malba in the floodplain area. 15 CCTV cameras at five new locations are to be installed,” said the report. DPCC also stated that DDA retrieved 477.8 hectares of area from encroachments in the floodplain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/floodplain-from-wazirabad-to-jaitpur-demarcated-36k-mt-of-waste-cleared/articleshow/87245112.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

With the completion of the expedition, Bharaj's name will be added to the World Ultra Cycling Association (WUCA) record in the 65-70 years age category. Bharaj has titled his expedition ‘Race Against Age’. He intends to spread the message about the importance of fitness for people across all age groups so that they live independent and happy life. Bharaj will start his ride from Srinagar and pedal through Udhampur, Ludhiana, Delhi, Gwalior, Nagpur, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru before reaching Kanyakumari. This will be the first record in this age category as no one has done this before. Om Mahajan, an 18-year-old from Nashik, holds the current record in the open category for WUCA. He took 8 days and 7 hours to complete the journey. Bharaj, who works as a technical expert in an engineering firm with a specialty in dyes and moulds, said, “I love fitness and want everybody to be fit. I am not the one to conduct fitness sessions. Instead, I love setting examples to inspire others. That is why I have planned this expedition.” When asked if he would like to challenge the youngsters to compete in a race, Mohinder said he is only interested in challenging himself. However, he urged people in the 40-55 age group to take up more fitness activities. “Earlier, I used to run. However, the doctors have asked me to stop. Hence, I started focusing on cycling for fitness. I am challenging myself for the record. I would urge the younger population to take up any exercise so that they could become fit. That way, they will not have to be dependent on their family members in the future. Be an asset to the family, not a liability,” added Mohinder.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/67-yr-old-nashik-man-aims-to-cycle-from-srinagar-to-kanyakumari-in-12-days/articleshow/87243321.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Ludhiana||Hike in rates of chemicals, dyes makes city industry see red||Ludhiana: Rates of chemicals and dyes imported from China have shot up by 100% to 350%. Increase in prices is due to drop in production and hike in ocean freight rates. According to businessmen, the rates have been increasing for the past six months, but the biggest jump was registered in the past one month. The traders and importers are worried as not only their investments have shot up manifold, but there is also no surety if the rates will not increase any further. Chanmeet Singh, an importer and trader of chemicals, said, “The rates of chemicals have increased exponentially in the past six months with maximum hike seen in the past thirty days. This is happening because production by Chinese companies has dropped due to the internal factors in their country. Besides, there is a huge rise in ocean freight rates that has increased prices of chemicals in India by almost double. Some rates have shot up by more than 350%. Today’s rate of acetic acid, which was available for Rs 45-50 per kg six months ago, is Rs 115-120 per kg. The rate of caustic soda has reached Rs 3,200 per 50kg bag from Rs 1,500 six months back.” Chanmeet added, “Similarly, the rate of sodium hydrosulphite right now is Rs 160 per kg and six months ago it was in the range of Rs 82 to 85 per kg. Glycerine’s rate has reached Rs 230 per kg from Rs 40-50 per kg six months ago. Besides these, other two commonly used chemicals phosphoric acid’s and silicon’s rates have jumped to Rs 240 per kg and Rs 300 per kg from Rs 70-80 per kg and Rs 150 per kg, respectively, six months back.”According to Neeraj Kumar, another chemical and paints trader, “Massive volatility in the rates of chemicals has dealt us a severe blow, as our investment in the business has more than doubled. Six months back, to buy 10,000kg of glycerine, one had to invest Rs 4,00,000, but now one has to shell out Rs 23,00,000. What is even more dangerous for traders and consumer industry is that there is no guarantee when the rates will stabilize, forget any reduction.”Rohit Gupta, president of Importer Exporter Club, Punjab, said, “Importers of chemicals are in big trouble and so are dyeing, garment, casting and electroplating industries, who are main consumers of these products. Besides the increase in rates by Chinese companies and short supplies, the biggest factor responsible for this situation is the unbelievable hike in ocean freight rates. The Centre must take notice of this situation and take corrective measures to bring the freight rates in control to give us some relief.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/hike-in-rates-of-chemicals-dyes-makes-city-industry-see-red/articleshow/87243872.cms||Mohit Behl

On a day when former TPCC president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy and former MP V Hanumanth Rao along with other senior party leaders hit the campaign trail in Huzurabad, Congress candidate Balmoor Venkat launched a verbal attack against TRS and BJP candidates respectively. “Finance minister T Harish Rao is acting like he is the contesting candidate while Gellu Srinivas Yadav is playing the role of a dummy. Eatala Rajender has earned crores of rupees while neglecting development of the constituency and for all his leftist ideology, he has joined BJP to save his skin,” Venkat told the voters in Gaddivanipalli village during a roadshow on Friday. Hanumanth Rao said TRS is not filling up two lakh government vacancies and Modi-led BJP government is not depositing Rs 15 lakh money into the bank accounts of poor. Uttam charged CM KCR with not being sincere on Dalit Bandhu implementation. “If KCR was committed for development of Dalits, he would have not gone back on his promise of making a Dalit as CM or take up distribution of three acres land to poor SC families,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cong-in-attack-mode-against-trs-and-bjp-in-huzurabad/articleshow/87245132.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Ludhiana||Hike in rates of chemicals, dyes makes city bizmen see red||Ludhiana: Rates of chemicals and dyes imported from China have shot up by 100% to 350%. Increase in prices is due to drop in production and hike in ocean freight rates. According to businessmen, the rates have been increasing for the past six months, but the biggest jump was registered in the past one month. The traders and importers are worried as not only their investments have shot up manifold, but there is also no surety if the rates will not increase any further. Chanmeet Singh, an importer and trader of chemicals, said, “The rates of chemicals have increased exponentially in the past six months with maximum hike seen in the past thirty days. This is happening because production by Chinese companies has dropped due to the internal factors in their country. Besides, there is a huge rise in ocean freight rates that has increased prices of chemicals in India by almost double. Some rates have shot up by more than 350%. Today’s rate of acetic acid, which was available for Rs 45-50 per kg six months ago, is Rs 115-120 per kg. The rate of caustic soda has reached Rs 3,200 per 50kg bag from Rs 1,500 six months back.” Chanmeet added, “Similarly, the rate of sodium hydrosulphite right now is Rs 160 per kg and six months ago it was in the range of Rs 82 to 85 per kg. Glycerine’s rate has reached Rs 230 per kg from Rs 40-50 per kg six months ago. Besides these, other two commonly used chemicals phosphoric acid’s and silicon’s rates have jumped to Rs 240 per kg and Rs 300 per kg from Rs 70-80 per kg and Rs 150 per kg, respectively, six months back.”According to Neeraj Kumar, another chemical and paints trader, “Massive volatility in the rates of chemicals has dealt us a severe blow, as our investment in the business has more than doubled.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 108 ayurveda doctor posts vacant||AHMEDABAD: While the state government has been promoting ayurveda in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, there are as many as 108 posts of ayurvedic doctors which are vacant in various government hospitals across the state. While most of the posts have been vacant for the past five to seven years, there are some posts which have been vacant since 2007. The vacancies are spread over ayurvedic colleges of 23 districts of Gujarat. Stating the reasons for the vacancies of ayurveda practitioners in government hospitals, the state government said that some of the reasons for the vacancies are transfer of persons, medical officers not reporting for duty, non-recruitment on posts, completion of ad-hoc period of duty and retirement of personnel.  Kapadvanj, MLA, Kalabhai Dabhi, asked the government in an unstarred question about the vacancies in ayuvedic colleges. He also sought information on the reasons for the vacancies and when these will be filled. In a written reply in the Gujarat assembly, the government said these vacancies will be filled once administrative procedures are completed, but did not provide any timeline for filling the vacancies. Gujarat has over 2,300 Ayurveda medicine seats According to official statistics, there are 2,392 ayurvedic medicine seats in colleges of Gujarat. Despite this, there are vacancies in several ayurvedic hospitals across the state. Sources said one reason is that that the government has for the past few years, been practising the fixed pay system of recruitment, and ayurvedic doctors do not find this lucrative enough. Moreover, n many cases,they do not want to be posted in hospitals located in rural areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/108-ayurveda-doctor-posts-vacant/articleshow/87244513.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Made-in-Kutch salt tablets help Europe get pure water||RAJKOT: What was once the dragon land’s sweet monopoly, Kutch manufacturers are now giving their Chinese counterparts a run for their money in the business of salt tablets, also known as sodium chloride tablets, that softens hard water and makes it potable. Ironically, salt tablets, per se, is the monopoly of three Kutch manufacturers in the entire country and though they hardly have any demand in the domestic market, their export figures are impressive. The trio exports around 7,000 tonne salt tablets annually to UK, France, Germany, Italy in Europe and Gulf countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Dubai which are some of their major importers. While Chinese tablets cost $180 to 200 per tonne, Indian salt tablets fetch $120 per tonne. There is a decent demand for the tablets in some countries of South America too. Salt tablets need the highest quality, premium double refined salt as a raw material, while each tablet weighs between seven and 15grams. European, Gulf and South American countries have water that has a high concentration of dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium. Hard water may cause skin problems and hair fall. It also leaves stains on sinks, dishes and bathtubs while it also reduces the working capacity of laundry detergent, body soaps and shampoo. Majority homes and also hotels in these countries are fitted with water softening machines which involves dissolving the salt tablets in brine tanks at regular intervals to make water potable. Also, in many countries, treatment of hard water is mandatory to avoid industrial accidents like chances of boiler blast. Anjar-based Vinod Soni, who pioneered the salt tablet production in India, said that high sea freight charges are hampering the sector’s growth. “When we are now competing with China and exporting around 7,000 tonne tablets per year, high sea freight charges don’t make it feasible for us to export more. If it remains in control we will be able to export more,” Soni said. A recent study has predicted that the water softeners market in Europe will reach $849 million by 2026. Another tablet manufacturer, Gandhidham-based Inderjit Singh, said that though low, there is demand in the domestic market too. “This tablet enjoys a huge market in foreign countries, but slowly, Indian consumers in metro cities are awakening to the benefits of using water softeners to avoid hazards of hard water,” Singh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/made-in-kutch-salt-tablets-help-europe-get-pure-water/articleshow/87243922.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Fireworks are expected to happen between the two saffron camps of the syndicate members — one which has alleged serious irregularities in the recruitment process and the other that enjoys the majority. Ahead of Monday’s meeting, the controversy spilled onto the streets on Sunday when a group of five syndicate and senate members reached the residence of a dean and syndicate member in Ellora Park area where the majority group was holding a “pre-syndicate meeting”. “In the last six syndicate meetings, I never asked any questions. So, I was always invited for the pre-syndicate meeting. But after we started questioning the recruitment process, they did not call me for the meeting. This shows how the university system is functioning,” said Hasmukh Vaghela, who along with his group held placards outside the residence of dean of Faculty of Education and Psychology professor R C Patel. The university officials have included the agenda of expert assessment for Monday’s meeting. But the university officials themselves and the group having a majority are against making the expert assessment public. “We have never put the expert assessment of the interview process in public domain since 1949. Let the syndicate members take a final call on the issue,” MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas had told TOI on Saturday. The group of syndics belonging to BJP-RSS camp have alleged irregularities in teaching as well as non-teaching appointments for which representations have been made even before Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel and state education minister Jitu Vaghani. The officials on the other hand have maintained that all the appointments made before September 1 have already been verified and scrutinized by the top brass of the state education department which has found nothing objectionable. “If there is nothing wrong in the appointments, what is the need of maintaining such secrecy,” said Vaghela. On Sunday, the group alleged irregularities in the appointment of engineers at the university.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/stormy-syndicate-meeting-on-the-cards-at-ms-university/articleshow/87243695.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The centre has life-size statues of wild animals including leopard, tiger, hyena and others depicting their natural habitat in the background. Inaugurating the centre, Bhujbal lauded the efforts of the forest department in raising such an awareness centre which will pave way for man-animal coexistence. The coexistence between human and animal appears to be inevitable for various reasons. “The wild animals are now making their way towards a human settlement for their prey because of dwindling forests. This is resulting in man-animal conflict. The centre will play a major role in understanding the wildlife and help the human beings deal with the situation in a better manner,” said Bhujbal. Such a centre would also play a major role in increasing tourism in Nashik. “We will have jungle tourism along with religious and nature tourism that is already flourishing in the district. This will further help in employment for local youth,” he said. The centre spread across one hectare of land boasts of information centre about snakes, leopards relation with nature, prey and humans, the bird sanctuary of Nandur Madhmeshwar, Mamdapur Reserve and Butterfly garden, medicinal plantation and much more. The visitors can not only spend their time at the centre but help in enriching themselves about details of the natural habitat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/man-animal-coexistence-awareness-site-in-niphad/articleshow/87243351.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Nashik||Health dept starts vaxx campaign in rural areas||Nashik: The district health department has decided to step up the vaccination drive in rural areas by carrying out door-to-door campaign for administering doses. “The number of people who got the first dose is much higher when compared to the situation three months ago. Now we are targeting the segment of people who are unable to find time for vaccination or are still hesitant to get vaccinated. Hence, the door-to-door campaign,” Dr Shailesh Nikam, taluka health officer of Nashik who is also in-charge for rural vaccination, said. The health teams along with local officials are now scanning houses in villages and hamlets for those who have got the first dose and no dose. The teams have been asked to identify the number of such people after which a team will go to that particular village or hamlet and carry out the vaccination drive on any given day. “Vaccination first began at primary health centre (PHC)-level and then it was conducted at sub-centre-level of the PHC. We are now taking the vaccination drive to the village and hamlet-level,” Nikam said. This would ensure 100% first dose vaccination of all the beneficiaries in villages. The drive will also ensure that those eligible for the second dose should get it administered so that number of fully vaccinated people also increases accordingly. Across Nashik district, 45.68 lakh vaccine doses have so far been administered. Out of these, as many as 12.40 lakh people have been fully vaccinated, while 20.87 lakh have the first dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/health-dept-starts-vaxx-campaign-in-rural-areas/articleshow/87243349.cms||---
---||World||‘Baldwin film set had previous accidental gun discharges’||ALBUQUERQUE: There were at least two accidental gun discharges on the set of an Alec Baldwin movie being filmed in New Mexico days before he fatally shot the cinematographer, according to three former members of the film’s crew.  The discharges occurred on October 16, the former crew members said, prompting a complaint to a supervisor about the safety practices on the set. The crew members, who asked not to be named out of fear that their future employment in the industry could be affected, were among several workers who quit, just hours before the fatal shooting, over complaints about unpaid work and working conditions on the production. The disclosures are focusing scrutiny on concerns over loosely followed protocols and labour strife between producers and crew members during the production of the film, “Rust”. Larry Zanoff, who works on as an armourer — a position that involves instructing cast members on the safe handling of firearms — and was not involved in “Rust,” said if a firearm went off on a film set, there would immediately be an inquiry into whether the firearm was defective or was mishandled. If the determination was that it was mishandled, he said, the production would undergo a reinforcement of safety protocols and possibly disallow the handler from using firearms. It was unclear whether such an investigation took place after the October 16 incidents. The movie’s producers, who include Baldwin, contended in a statement on Friday that they had not been told about the safety issues. “Though we were not made aware of any official complaints concerning weapon or prop safety on set, we will be conducting an internal review of our procedures,” the movie’s production company, Rust Movie Productions LLC, said. According to the affidavit by a detective in the Santa Fe County sheriff’s office, the gun used in the shooting was set up by Hannah Gutierrez, the production’s armourer, and handed to Baldwin by Dave Halls, the assistant director. Neither Gutierrez nor Halls responded to requests for comment. In addition to Zanoff, five other experts in the use of firearms on film and TV sets said it was against usual protocol for an assistant director to hand a gun to an actor. One of the experts, Mike Tristano, a veteran armourer, said that typical practice on a set would be for the armourer to hand the gun to the actor and the chain of events described in the affidavit struck him as a “red flag”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baldwin-film-set-had-previous-accidental-gun-discharges/articleshow/87245996.cms||Simon Romero

Mehboob had told his kin to lodge a missing complaint and fled to Rajasthan, but police used electronic surveillance and tracked down Mehboob in Jaipur from where was nabbed. Superintendent of police, Bahraich, Sujata Singh said the accused Mehboob Ahmad ran ponzi schemes promising high returns to investors and fled with the money. An FIR was lodged against Mehboob on March 15 after which we launched a manhunt to nab him, Singh said. A cop privy to the probe said Mehboob, who had taken Rs 1 crore from one Mohammed Imran, first escaped to Gorakhpur and from there he sneaked into Nepal. “From Nepal, Mehboob made a call to the complainant Mohammed Imran saying he was coming back with the money but was being threatened by a gang. Thereafter, he asked his kin to lodge a missing complaint about him,” said the cop. From Nepal, Mehboob moved to Luniyawas in Jaipur and set up a steel shop with the money he had swindled, police officials said. During the probe, cops detected a mismatch of records. While his location was traced in Nepal, he had claimed that he was in Gorakhpur. His last location was Jaipur,” said officials. Moreover, after lodging the missing complaint no one from hi9s family came for follow up or met senior officials for expediting the probe, which raised suspicion. It also surfaced in the probe that a hefty amount had been transferred into the bank accounts of Mehboob’s kin which led us to the accused, said officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/swindler-gets-missing-plaintlodged-to-evade-arrest-held/articleshow/87245134.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Bhujbal — who is also the state food and civil supplies and consumer protection minister and represents Yeola assembly constituency — conducted a meeting to review the Covid situation in Yeola and Niphad talukas. During this meeting, he directed the health officials to focus on getting everyone vaccinated. “The health department should take help of religious heads to carry out vaccination drives — just like what is being done in Malegaon that was earlier plagued by vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine is the best form of defence against infection which is why the health department should ensure every person gets at least the first dose immediatly,” Bhujbal said. Top officials and officers from the health, revenue, police and other departments were present at the meeting. “There was a marginal drop in the active cases in both the talukas that border Ahmednagar district which has been reeling under high numbers of active cases. While the number has gone down, people and authorities should not let down their guard,” the minister said. HE asked the health department officials to increase testing for Covid during the festivities as people would be coming together for celebrations.  Meanwhile, Bhujbal also asked the agriculture and revenue officials to expedite the process of carrying out the assessment of crop damage in the region due to heavy rains in the recent past. Guardian minister helps accident victims Bhujbal also rushed to help victims of a car accident that took place at Dhulgaon Fata near Vinchur on the Yeola-Niphad route.

This number has dropped to just seven in the area. The overall encounter rate of IGFS in the state, as reported by a study, was 0.14 individuals/km at present.  The research paper “Distribution and relative abundance of Indian Giant Flying Squirrel (Petaurista philippensis) in Gujarat, India,” by Nisha Singh and Nishith Dharaiya of the Wildlife and Conservation Biology Research Lab, department of life sciences, Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University, Patan, has for the first time estimated using field surveys that the flying squirrels were encountered only 33 times at 14 sites, predominantly located in the protected areas.  “Fifteen sites were in the protected areas, while 18 sites were present outside or at the periphery of protected areas. The highest number of IGFS sightings were recorded in central Gujarat, having two wildlife sanctuaries, Ratanmahal and Jambughoda and a few patches of non-protected forests, followed by the southern part of Gujarat and the least in north Gujarat,” the paper states. Singh told TOI, “There are no past records of sightings, or even a census available and hence one cannot compare the current sighting data with past official records. But based on the field interviews, it was sure that the number has reduced and sightings have gone down. The majority of IGFS sightings (76.19 %) occurred in protected areas, and only 23.81% of sightings occurred in reserved forests. Even in protected areas, the squirrels were found confined to small patches. During one of the field interviews in Ratanmahal we were told that earlier a group of 50-odd IGFS were sighted in a small village ,but now it is rare, and one could hardly find seven to eight individuals.” “During the research, mostly solitary Indian giant flying squirrels were observed, with exceptions being females with young ones or mating pairs. The sighting of a couple of IGFS was made during the study in April (breeding season) in central Gujarat,” she said. The research paper states “Hunting practices to be a reason for the patchy distribution of IGFS in the Eastern Ghats. Habitat extent, forest fragments, forest connectivity, vegetation, tree species, and elevation play an essential role in distributing arboreal species.” The IGFS occupy a wide range of habitat (moist and dry deciduous forests) and a relatively small home ranges varying from 0.46 to 5.16 hectares depending upon the distribution of food and nesting sites. Suggestions and findings Indian giant flying squirrels were confined to the eastern belt of Gujarat, with a denser population in central Gujarat than in other regions of the state. Tree species that provide food and nesting grounds for breeding can affect the distribution of IGFS. Lack of hunting practices along suitable habitat has helped the IGFS population to grow in central Gujarat. During the survey, it was felt that people were not much aware of the flying squirrel's presence and ecology because of its nocturnal and cryptic habits. “These situations also stand as a challenge before the policymakers to educate the tribes, generate awareness and prepare species-specific management plans. Intensively increasing human population, interference, and encroachment in the forest areas are disturbing squirrel habitats. Looking at their low reproductive rate and abundance in this study, hunting, and habitat modification will play a significant role in deciding the future of this species in Gujarat,” the paper stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/sightings-of-giant-flying-squirrels-dive-in-gujarat/articleshow/87244539.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The 31-year-old woman lodged a complaint against Chatur Bhadja on Saturday. After the rape survivor filed the complaint, the accused confronted her outside the police station building and threatened to kill her if she tells anyone about the crime. The woman said that Bhadja called her to his workshop for some cleaning work on October 21. While cleaning Bhadja’s office within the workshop premises the woman was alone and there were no other employees present at the workshop. Taking advantage of the situation, Bhadja hugged the woman and later raped her. After committing the crime, Bhadja threatened the woman not to tell anyone about the incident. The woman, however, gathered courage and went to C Division police station on Saturday to lodge a complaint against Bhadja. After registering the offence of rape, when the woman walked out of the police station, Bhadja met her right outside the building and again threatened to kill her and also made some caste-based slurs. After Bhadja left, the woman told the cops about the threat and the abuses. Since the C Division police station building falls under the jurisdiction of B Division police station, an offence under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was lodged there.

The Ayodhya visit by Kejriwal, who stated he would seek Ram Lalla’s blessings ahead of Diwali, assumes significance as his party plans to contest over 400 seats in the 2022 UP polls. Talking to TOI, state president of Aam Aadmi Party, Sabhajit Singh, said, “BJP doesn’t hold a patent on Lord Ram. If they are reacting aggressively to Kejriwal’s visit, they should know Ramjanmabhoomi is not owned by Hindutva preachers.” Barring frequent visits by Sangh and BJP leaders, those from the secular political fraternity who are now making a beeline to Ayodhya include Satish Mishra of BSP, a party which once driven by anti-upper caste and anti-Hindutva ideology. Mishra’s July visit was followed by Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and AAP MP Sanjay Singh’s Ayodhya tryst in September. The train will not stop here and top sources say, as electioneering picks up pace in Uttar Pradesh, senior Congress and Samajwadi Party leaders will follow suit. Talking to TOI, state vice-president of Samajwadi Party Jai Shankar Pandey, said, “Socialist icon Ram Manohar Lohiya had first tried to connect people with Ram by organising a Ramayan Mela in Chitrakoot.” Dropping hints about top SP leaders’ imminent visit to Ayodhya, he said, “When our party leaders come to Ayodhya, they will seek visit Ramjanmabhoomi and seek blessings of Ram Lalla.” State Congress spokesperson Gaurav Tiwari said, “The Gandhi family has age-old ties with Ayodhya. Whenever any member of the family, including Indira Gandhi, Rajiv, Rahul and Priyanka came to Ayodhya, they visit the temples. Ram is omnipresent in Ayodhya and our senior leaders will soon visit the temple town.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/kejriwals-ram-tryst-tommorow-ayodhya-now-electoral-launchpad-of-secular-parties/articleshow/87245137.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The complainant Bipin Radadiya approached police after the cops appealed to the people to come forward if they had any complaints against the history-sheeter Nasir Metar. Metar and four others were earlier booked under Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organized Crime (GUJCTOC) Act as well. Radadiya told police that Metar had threatened him against using the land which he had purchased in 1992. The seller of the land had originally purchased the land from Metar’s father Rahim when Metar was in jail in connection with a murder case. When Metar came out of the jail and learnt that Radadiya was claiming to be the owner of the land, he threatened him. Since then, Radadiya, although he has the sale deed and other ownership documents, was not able to carry out any farming activity on the land. On Saturday, after the complaint was filed, deputy superintendent of police Pradeepsinh Jadeja visited the farm along with Radadiya and helped the farmer conduct a religious ceremony on the land. Following a warning by the cops, Metar apologized to Radadiya and on Sunday an offence was registered against him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/case-registered-for-threatening-farmer/articleshow/87243992.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: 24 new Dengue cases surface from hotspot areas, tally at 853||LUCKNOW: Dengue cases continued to pour in from the hotspot areas of the city on Sunday. At least 24 residents of Aliganj, Turiyaganj, Alambagh, NK Road, Chinhat and Indiranagar areas were diagnosed with vector borne disease after confirmatory ELISA test. These localities are the part of 15 hotspots areas from where around 20 cases are being recorded every day for the past over the week. Among those tested with dengue, 12 were admitted to various hospitals of the city following depletion of platelets below 25,000, while others were recuperating at home. Hospitals also got many fever cases, but refused to share details of suspected dengue cases citing an order from higher ups. “We have been told not to release information till a case is confirmed through the confirmatory test,” said a hospital superintendent. Pathologies in several hospitals, both government and private, use card test methods to find out possibilities of dengue in a patient suffering with high fever. Since the card test can be done in a short time, it helps in starting the treatment of a patient early, while fresh samples are sent for the confirmatory test, informed a health officer. However, since there is a possibility of error in the card test, revealing information about suspected cases might lead to panic among people, he added. The spike in dengue cases over the past week has been triggered by the rainfall which left behind water puddles in vacant plots, troughs, gardens, flower pots, desert coolers and abandoned objects. These places provide a conducive environment for mosquito breeding, particularly the Aedes aegypti, which is the carrier of dengue virus. Health department officials said that extensive anti-larval spraying and source reduction activities are being carried out in the hotspot areas, but locals say the measures are not enough. Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said, "Our teams are visiting every household from where a case surfaces. Besides, a door to door awareness campaign is running. Situation is under control." “Dengue mosquito larvae were found in eight houses during the drive, he added. Until now, 853 people have been diagnosed with dengue this year. Of these, 779 cases have been recorded since September 1. A teenager also lost life due to the disease.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/24-new-dengue-cases-surface-from-hotspot-areas-tally-at-853/articleshow/87245140.cms||---

Officials who already started door-to-door vaccination have now decided to carry out ‘on-road’ vaccination drive. A total of 6,84,000 people in Krishna district are yet to take the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine as per the records of the health wing authorities. A majority of them are from Vijayawada city and hence the health wing authorities have started focusing on mass vaccination. Auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) and health care workers are arranging street camps and enquiring the pedestrians about their status of vaccination. Officials are convincing the public who are reluctant to take the vaccine shot.“A total of 3,95,110 people in the 18-44 age group are yet to receive vaccination. Similarly, as many as 2,89,220 people above the age of 45 years are yet to be vaccinated. As the ICMR is hinting at a possible third wave of Covid-19, we have decided to speed up the vaccination. Door -to-door vaccination is giving best results. Volunteers and health secretaries are working hard along with ANMs to complete the vaccination process on time,” said district collector J Nivas. Meanwhile, officials have been focusing on strengthening the oxygen supply system and intensive care units at government hospitals. Area hospitals are upgraded with oxygen supply and ventilators to handle emergencies. Joint collector L Siva Shankar directed the health wing authorities to inspect the corporate hospitals across the district and enquire about the infrastructure available there.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/street-camps-to-strengthen-vax-drive-in-krishna-district/articleshow/87243981.cms||Venu Lanka

What is Eatala’s sin?” he questioned. Expressing support for Eatala, Sanjay stated that the BJP candidate would support the people. “TRS is concerned about its failure in the by-election, so it is staging the drama, plenary, but the people will teach that party a lesson,” he said. The TRS leadership has not changed since its inception, he observed. Despite the fact that the Centre was funding free Covid-19 vaccine, Sanjay claimed that “right from funds for paddy procurement to planting trees, construction of graveyards, and many other things, the state is getting funds from the Centre, but TRS is campaigning as if the state government is spending the money.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trs-staging-plenary-drama-says-sanjay/articleshow/87245157.cms||---

They said the amount should be spent on a scheme of public interest. The rally had traversed through Maharashtra and Gujarat. Litterateur Prakash Shah said that in the existing structure, the governing and executive councils of the project are led by the chief minister and the chief secretary respectively, and it is an indication of direct ‘interference’ of the government in Ashram affairs. “This matter is not meant to be tossed between the Sabarmati Ashram Trust and the state government. Gandhi belongs to each one. I urge them to be transparent, include members of the civil society before initiating the project.” A press release by the 15-odd Gandhian institutions has urged Gandhians and Gandhi lovers that “their silence and inaction has done a lot of damage to the country and society. They need to be active in Gandhiji's direction and raise the voice of truth boldly”. Ramchandra Rahi, president, Gandhi Memorial Fund, New Delhi, said that Gandhi’s Ashram should not be projected as a tourism or entertainment zone. Among those who joined the protest include Gandhi Peace Foundation, National Water Fraternity, National Gandhi Sangrahalaya, Sarva Seva Sangh, Sevagram Ashram, Nai Talim Samity and the Rashtriya Yuva Sangatan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/use-rs-1200cr-gandhi-memorial-fund-on-scheme-of-public-interest/articleshow/87244555.cms||---

The accused, Mohammed Rafiq aka Allu Miyan of Gosainganj, is a native of Sultanpur district. Police said Rafiq was on the run for the last few months after an FIR was lodged against him. He was arrested after the court issued a non-bailable warrant. In a statement, the Congress alleged that Rafiq was being framed by the police at the behest of the state government. ADCP, west zone, Chiranjeev Sinha said, “Rafiq used to introduce himself as an active member of the Congress party. He used to extort money from builders and was also involved in the purchase of land which was stuck in legal dispute.” On May 8, Vaibhav Srivastava of Kali Badi in Kaiserbagh had lodged a case against Mohammed Rafiq, his wife Mehrunnisa and their son Mohammed Adil Rasheed, all of Gosainganj, accusing them of forgery, extortion and tampering with government documents. Vaibhav said he worked as a builder in partnership with Mohammed Mazin Khan of Chowk. “Vaibhav and his partner got a land registered in their names and started work in Khargapur. However, Rafiq and his son showed them a fake registry of land (number 154 signed in 1990) in the name of Meharunnisa. The registry was done by Mamta Sahkari Grih Nirman Ltd, Khurram Nagar.

Acid attack survivor told to remove scarf during Uttar Pradesh PCS exam||LUCKNOW: An acid attack survivor, who was the winner of the national bravery award in 2015 and was honoured by the President and Prime Minister, alleged humiliation at the hands of officials during the UP Combined State/Upper Subordinate Services (Prelims) examination on Sunday. However, in response to the verbal complaint lodged by the candidate’s family with the district administration, the examination centre supervisor has written to the UP Public Service Commission (UPPSC) denying allegations of harassment. He accused the candidate of not complying with the rules and alleged that a member of her family misbehaved with officials. TOI has a copy of the letter. Resham Fatma (24), who appeared for the examination at a centre in Para, told TOI that she had been using a scarf after the acid attack on her. “Like all candidates, I was also frisked by women personnel before entering the examination hall. Even the invigilator did not object to it. However, in the middle of the examination, a male official asked me to remove the scarf. He relented when I told him about my problem but returned after 15 minutes with the college principal. They forced me to remove the scarf,” she claimed. “After the first shift of examination got over, my father took up the issue with the college officials. Instead of apologising, they threatened to call the police on the pretext of stopping a government servant from discharging duties,” the candidate added. “It was insensitive on the part of officials to force her to remove the scarf,” said Fatma’s maternal uncle Irfan Ahmed Siddiqui. Meanwhile, in his status report to the UPPSC, the centre supervisor said the candidate refused to remove the scarf during mandatory matching of the photograph on the admit card. “After the first shift, a member of her family entered the prohibited area and misbehaved with officers. The CCTV footage of the incident has been attached,” the letter said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/acid-attack-survivor-allegesharassment-during-pcs-exam/articleshow/87245169.cms||---
---||Lucknow||PM to open Siddharthnagar medical college named after Jan Sangh neta, BJP bid to woo Brahmins||Lucknow: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurates a medical college named after Jan Sangh leader and RSS pracharak, Madhav Prasad Tripathi, in Siddharthnagar on Monday, the move could potentially position BJP to consolidate the crucial Brahmin community that is being aggressively wooed by SP and BSP in run-up to assembly elections early next year. Popularly known as ‘Madhav Babu’, Tripathi was, in fact, the first state president of BJP after it was formed in 1980. Born in 1912 in a Brahmin-dominated village Tiwaripur village in district Basti — now in Siddharthnagar — Tripathi joined the Sangh during his student days in Banaras Hindu University after meeting RSS founder KB Hedgewar in 1937. He became a full-time RSS worker in 1942 and was later appointed ‘pracharak’ while being tasked to work in Lakhimpur Kheri district. He was subsequently elevated as joint prant pracharak (regional organiser) for UP in 1955. He was then nominated to UP legislative council in 1958. In 1962 assembly elections in UP, he contested as a Jan Sangh candidate from Bangana west assembly seat in Basti and defeated Congress candidate Prabhu Dayal by a margin of 7,000 votes. He again defeated Prabhu Dayal — this time from Bansi seat — by a margin of around 9,000 votes in 1969 state elections. Tripathi’s stature continued to grow and in 1977, he won the Lok Sabha election from Domariyaganj seat on a Janata Party ticket. He had then defeated Keshav Deo Malviya of Congress by a huge margin of over 1.65 lakh votes. BJP leaders fondly remember him as ‘Ajaatshatru’ (one without enemies). “Opening a medical college in his name in his karmbhoomi, Siddharthnagar, is essentially a mark of respect for him. It is not a question of invoking him for political gains or losses,” said senior UP BJP leader and party spokesperson, HC Srivastava. He affirmed Tripathi was a “widely accepted” personality in the then political arena. BJP’s Siddharthnagar district president Govind Madhav Yadav said, inaugurating a project in the name of Tripathi will certainly send out a strong message in the politically crucial east UP region. “He turned Siddharthnagar into a stronghold of Jan Sangh, when Congress was strong,” he said, while speaking to TOI on phone. Yadav, however, maintained that BJP stood for all communities and not just for Brahmins. Siddharthnagar, he said, has around 16% Brahmins, 12% Yadavs who are “closely associated” with BJP ideology. “The district also has a substantial number of Kurmis and around 20% Dalits, who have been gravitating towards BJP,” he said. Political experts, nevertheless, were quick to interpret it as a move to counter the Opposition, including BSP chief Mayawati who whipped out the Brahmin card to replay her tried and tested social engineering formula that propelled her to power with absolute majority in 2007. The SP too has been reaching out to the upper castes, while projecting the BJP dispensation as “anti-Brahmin”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/pm-to-open-siddharthnagar-medical-college-named-after-jan-sangh-neta-bjp-bid-to-woo-brahmins/articleshow/87245176.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh is on the cusp of economic transformation||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh is one of the largest markets in the world. It has over 8% of the nation's purchasing power and is blessed with a variety of resources and raw material. It’s ranked first in seven out of over 10 major lines of agri-production. Any production facility located in UP has access to over 50% of the nation's market (including neighbouring states). For long, UP has strived to find a place of glory but in vain. Of late, however, a story of structural shift seems to be scripting itself. It’s not merely about new-found buoyancy; rather it is more about inherent resilience that is clearly discernible. The emerging scenario is fraught with possibilities and cannot be allowed to go unnoticed. Something relevant is happening in the state which seems to be facilitating the emerging opportunities such as Fiscal Consolidation and Ease of Doing Business. Over the years, UP has been able to achieve fiscal consolidation. In recent times, in line with the global scenario of negative growth where India itself suffered a negative growth of nearly 25% for a while; a fall in tax collection in the state was only expected. However, unlike most parts of the world, UP shows exceptional tax buoyancy in these difficult times. Almost all taxes showed high buoyancy which may be reflective of the extraordinary resilience that the state demonstrates. Consumer State Advantage is UP’s USP and this may have played to UP’s advantage. However, the taxes where the state had complete control show phenomenal buoyancy. Hence, the effort that goes to make this possible cannot go unnoticed. Similarly, as a result of ease of doing business, the state recorded a quantum jump from rank 12 to 2 in the past four years. It is no surprise that more industries are vying to set up their shops here due to the conducive working environment. Samsung has moved its large display unit from China to Noida, footwear giant Von Wellx shifted production from China to Agra, and Adani shut its Logistics Park in Punjab and is now investing in Noida’s data centre. During the Investors Summit in 2018, a total 1,045 investment intents worth Rs 4.28 lakh crore were filed. So far, nearly 43% of the leads generated at the summit worth around Rs 1.84 lakh crore are under various stages of implementation. Recently, Tata & Airbus signed a Rs 22,000 crore deal to manufacture C-295 aircraft in the state. Investing in rural communities is also an idea whose time has come. The state has transferred Rs37,388 crore to more than 2.54 crore farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana along with hiking the MSP rates. So far the government has paid over Rs4.72 crore to farmers as crop loans. ‘One District One Product’ initiative launched in 2018 is an interesting attempt at creating a framework for sustained engagement of artisans, mostly in rural areas. Today, millions of people have got employment through ODOP. According to the MSME department, 8.67 lakh new units were started in the state in the last eight months, which were given loans to the tune of Rs 30,840 crore by banks. Over 1.5 crore employment opportunities were created by banks by providing loans totalling more than Rs 2,12,000 crore. In the past 3 years, ODOP has helped raise UP’s exports to 38%. The initiative which has given employment (direct and indirect) to more than 25 lakh people is now being replicated throughout the country. While the initiative is outstanding it may be useful to align the initiative with nine agro-climatic zones of the state. Such realignment is likely to transform the initiative into a potent engine of economic transformation. Fiscal transformation and ease of doing business seem to have prepared the field enabling the state to anchor development. Many of the interventions seem to be falling in place and are certainly working for the state. With an improved economic environment, the state needs to take a lead in initiating second generation reforms anchored around rural development (including MSME) and Human development (primarily health and education). We have begun to tread the path and UP is transformation ready. Unleashing of these engines of transformation woven into second generation reforms will transform this potential into economic reality.

A fare hike proposal is likely to be drafted this week and will be submitted before the MSRTC board. It’s possible the proposal may be not just for the ordinary ST buses, but also for the semi-luxury buses and the AC Shivneri buses that are popular from Mumbai to Pune. MSRTC’s diesel expenses per day is around Rs 8.8 crore, which comprises 38% of the total expenditure (Rs 21 crore daily), sources said. Income, on the other hand, is 12.9 crore on an average daily in October. “The ridership is 27 lakh commuters across the state daily which is just 41% of pre-Covid times. Our total fleet is 18,000 buses of which 12,500 are plying daily now. During the pandemic, we have witnessed a huge dip in ridership and incurred tremendous losses,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-msrtc-may-hike-bus-fare-due-to-rising-diesel-costs/articleshow/87245511.cms||Somit Sen

Reject both parties and vote for Balmoor Venkat of the Congress who will stand by you for another 40 years,” Revanth appealed to the people of Huzurabad constituency. Referring to KTR’s comment on why Revanth was not campaigning, he lashed out at CM KCR, minister KT Rama Rao and MLC K Kavitha. “I came to Huzurabad during the nomination filing by Balmnoor Venkat. I have been here for almost two days now. I will come again before the campaign ends.

---||Vijayawada||Parking woes in Vijayawada continue despite various initiatives||VIJAYAWADA: Parking of two and four-wheelers has become a major problem in the city, thanks to the surging vehicular population and lack of effective mechanism to address the issue. Many arterial roads have turned into parking lots in the absence of a proper paid parking system. In a bid to ease congestion of city roads due to unauthorised parking, Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) had inked an MoU with Smart Parkings India Limited, a Chennai-based company, in 2018. The plan was to provide mobile app-based smart parking facility. The civic body allocated Rs 2.25 crore to implement the project. The smart parking system was initially a big hit as motorists could book their slots at busy areas like Kaleswara Rao Market, One Town, Governorpet and Bhavanipuram. But the initiative turned out to be a failure due to the high parking fees and technical glitches in its implementation. As a result, the agency pulled out of the project. Later, the estate wing of VMC allocated tenders to contractors to maintain the parking system in the city, which is failing to yield any result. Major roads in the city such as MG Road, Museum Road, Tikkle Road, Five Route, JD Hospital Road, and NTR Complex Centre are getting congested with the haphazard parking of vehicles. In this context, VMC and the traffic wing of city police said they are taking measures to construct multistorey parking lots in busy commercial areas. Police said a special drive will be conducted to curb the illegal parking and encroachments on the roads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/parking-woes-in-vij-continue-despite-various-initiatives/articleshow/87244035.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Education dept official nabbed for issuing fake job letters||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh special task force (UP STF) on Sunday arrested a suspended accounts officer in the education department who was accused of issuing fake appointment letters to teachers. The accused, Jagdish Prasad Srivastava, was on the run and carried a bounty of Rs 25,000. STF said three FIRs were lodged against Jagdish in Deoria since 2018. Till now, 30 fake teachers have been arrested. The STF took up the case on July 19, after senior block education officer, Birbal Ram, lodged an FIR regarding missing record books of 1987-1989 and 2010-11. He claimed that pages were missing from the record books of 2015-16. Ram had claimed in the FIR that he had lodged a complaint about the appointment of teachers through fraudulent means in two aided government schools in the district. Inspector (STF) Satya Prakash Singh, who led the operation, said Jagdish was arrested from traffic trisection in Gorakhpur in the wee hours of Sunday. Singh said Jagdish was employed in the BSA office in Deoria since 2010. “Jagdish is accused of tampering with the record books. He used to tear the pages of records and then fed wrong entries on those missing pages,” said Singh. Soon after Jagdish’s name surfaced in internal probe, he was suspended. The record books contain details of all teachers deployed in a district. Sources in the STF said Jagdish made Rs 4 crore by issuing fake appointment letters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/stf-nabs-education-dept-official-forissuing-fake-job-letters-to-teachers/articleshow/87245179.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Union minister’s son tests positive for dengue, moved to hospital||BAREILLY: The police custody remand of Union minister of state for home, Ajay Mishra’s son, Ashish Mishra, ended a day early after Ashish was found positive for dengue and shifted by the special investigation team (SIT) to a hospital for treatment on Saturday night. His custody with the police was supposed to end at 5 pm on Sunday. He is now under judicial custody. Under police custody, he was detained in a lock-up, and the police had power to interrogate him to collect more evidence to further their investigation. Under judicial custody, Ashish will be placed in a district jail and would be under the custody of the magistrate. The case will now proceed in accordance with the evidence collected so far. Ashish is the main accused in the killing of four farmers and a journalist during the October 3 violence in Lakhimpur Kheri. He was remanded to police custody by a chief judicial magistrate on October 22. He complained of fever and was admitted to a hospital in jail at midnight on Saturday, where his sample was taken for a dengue test. His counsel, Avdhesh Singh, has requested treatment at a higher medical centre in the state capital. A team of three doctors are monitoring his condition after sugar levels in his blood shot up and his blood pressure started fluctuating, according to Kheri’s chief medical officer, Dr Shailendra Bhatnagar, who is monitoring his condition. A rapid test indicated that he was positive for the disease and his samples were sent for confirmation to Lucknow, Bhatnagar added. He also said that there was no need to shift him to a higher centre in Lucknow and that he was in a stable condition. Notably, the bail application of Ashish is pending with a district judge and will be heard on October 28. Experts say that bail has been granted in many cases on medical grounds. Back in June 2001, Ashish’s father had managed to secure bail in a murder case after he was admitted at the hospital, immediately after he surrendered in the court. So far, 13 people, including Ashish, have been arrested in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and the SIT has also recovered firearms used by the accused after they allegedly mowed down farmers. Various videos have been recovered by the SIT that indicate that all the three vehicles of Ashish’s convoy were over-speeding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/lakhimpur-violence-union-ministers-son-and-main-accused-found-dengue-positive-moved-to-hospital/articleshow/87244067.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Lucknow||Covid leaves behind gastric troubles months later||Lucknow: If you have had Covid in the first or second wave and even after several months you face one or the other stomach related issue, chances are that the impact of Covid is still messing up with your gastroenterology system. Doctors continue to see patients with Covid history who have inflamed liver and gut, upset stomach or abdominal pain. Many of these patients are being diagnosed with post-infection irritable bowel syndrome. “All viral diseases have a tendency to leave behind gastrointestinal issues like rotavirus, dengue, etc. A similar pattern is seen in patients of novel coronavirus,” said Dr Anil Gangwar of SGPGI’s gastroenterology department. “Many of these patients showed a pattern of over-consumption of herbal and Ayurvedic drinks like kadhas which caused inflammation of their liver and gut,” he added. Covid patients with no history of gastrointestinal (GI) issues are now visiting hospitals with trouble in their gut, loose motions, stomach fullness, abdominal pain and allied symptoms. Head of gastroenterology department at King George’s Medical University Dr Sumit Rungta said, “Initially, majority Covid patients in ICU had accompanying GI problems. We are still getting patients with persistent GI troubles even after months of having contracted Covid.” “We have not correlated if these GI troubles are a new development or related to Covid. It could be because of the virus or because the new normal has become more of a sedentary lifestyle. Patients without any history of GI but who had had Covid are also turning up at the OPD,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/covid-leaves-behind-gastric-troubles-months-later/articleshow/87245190.cms||Yusra Husain

The institute of national importance conducted several special vaccination drives on the campus itself to accomplish this feat. The health centre of the institute took up the mass inoculation initiative. The latest vaccination drive was inaugurated by coordinator (administration) Prof Neena Pandey, in the presence of IIM-V medical officer Dr V Bhaskar Ram and nursing sister Latha. Speaking on occasion, Dr Bhaskar Ram said; “In the present scenario, it is important for everyone to receive both the doses as it will greatly reduce the risk of getting Covid-19, which will in turn prevent the spreading of the infection to others. It will also build immunity to face the challenges, if and when the future waves or their variants surface”. He thanked the members for coming forward and participating in the drive, in large numbers, without any hesitancy. IIM-Vizag director Prof M Chandrasekhar said that a total of four vaccination drives were organised by the institute in May, July, August and October. “About 300 people had already received their first and second doses in the earlier drives. About 80 people got the jabs in the latest drive,” said Prof Chandrasekhar. IIM-Vizag director complimented the Health Centre on achieving the very important milestone of 100% vaccination coverage. Highlighting that all these drives were conducted at free of cost to beneficiaries, he described the endeavours as a modest contribution of the institution to the national mission of fighting the pandemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/iim-vizag-hits-100-vaccine-coverage/articleshow/87244058.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Library on wheels to woo screen-tired kids||Books, in all sizes, shapes and eye-catching colours, are now on wheels to wow toddlers in suburban Mumbai. A smart tempo traveller, loaded with nearly 1,500 tomes, gently threads its way through the criss-cross lanes of Dahisar, Borivli and Kandivli in north Mumbai every evening to spread the magic of the printed word. Knee-high toddlers, with anxious parents in tow, make a beeline to the all-white vehicle to lay their hands on the treasure trove: fairy tales and fables, poems and proverbs, endearing stories of adventure and animals all free of cost. “The concept is to help the young ones discover the pleasure of reading,” said Chintan Dagli, a 30-something electronic engineer, on Saturday. Having worked for nearly 16 years in a US corporate giant, Dagli, on returning to Mumbai in December last year realised, to his dismay, that children were fiddling with mobiles and laptops for too long the screen time lasting several hours at a stretch chiefly because of online classes and urge for quick entertainment. Dagli and his wife Nidhi thought of a mobile library which would reach out to children. “There is no profit motive,” he added. Not only did his two kids wholeheartedly back Papa’s ‘Gyan Library’ project, they got down to help him shortlist books. There is a steady trickle of young readers besieging the van as the evening wears on. Many parents have donated books. Meanwhile, Dagli roped in school mates Tejas Patil and Siddhesh Patange as he put final touches to the plan. A Kandivli dealer helped them with the bulk purchase of books at a reasonable rate. Next, Dagli bought a tempo traveller and fitted it with wooden rakes to stockpile the booty. Sudha Murty sat serenely between Geronimo Stilton and Cupcake Diaries. “Much time went into working out the details,” said Patil, a tax consultant. “We colour-coded for varying age-groups. Also, the entire distribution process is digitised,” added Patange, a banking professional. A weekly itinerary has been drawn up to cater to various enclaves in the three populous suburbs. For instance, a reader from Mahavir Nagar, in Kandivli, will get his share of books once a week. The van boasts a formidable collection of English books; but Dagli is eager to acquire Hindi, Marathi and Gujarati titles following growing demand. The tempo begins to zoom and vroom after the three friends are done with their daily work-from-home grind. “Evenings are set aside for the ‘baba log’ brigade,” laughed Patil. Paucity of funds has compelled the troika to put on hold its expansion plan. Some have suggested crowdfunding as a viable option, though. “Children scramble onto the tempo and want to rummage the entire collection. The atmosphere reeks of raw energy,” said Dagli. “I am an Iron Man,” screamed Krishna Harite, all of four, straining his vocal chords as if to buttress Dagli’s claim, and gladly flaunting a copy of his favourite Marvel comic book. “I quit my job to spend quality time with my son. We all are passing through troubled times. It’s time we went back to books to heal ourselves and Mother Earth,” said Gayatri, Krishna’s mother.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-library-on-wheels-to-woo-screen-tired-kids/articleshow/87245522.cms||Ambarish Mishra
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: 100 reasons to celebrate the life of hockey legend KD Singh Babu||LUCKNOW: Who is the G.O.A.T. of UP sports? Two names instantly come to mind -- unsurprisingly, both from hockey. Major Dhyan Chand and Kunwar Digvijay Singh Babu. Dhyan Chand was one of the greatest ever with stories abound about the magic that his stick wielded. But no other player has impacted UP's hockey -- or entire spectrum of sports for that matter – like Babu did. After his best years went into the World War-II, he played the livewire in India's two successive gold medal feats at London and Helsinki Olympics. In 1953, he was awarded the Helms Trophy. That meant the best sportsman of Asia and best hockey player of the world. That was unprecedented. And no Indian player has been able to do it since then. In 1959, he bid adieu to the national team. But never retired as a player. His second innings in the last 20 years of his life were no less productive for the game. As a coach, he was a strategist par excellence and the first coach who used blackboard to explain the moves, says his student Olympian Sujit Kumar. In the bronze medal match at Munich Olympics in 1972, Babu asked centre-forward BP Govinda to play outside-left. Govinda eventually scored the all-important equaliser for the team. The hockey nursery that he developed in UP, apart from NIS, Patiala -- two sports hostels and three sports colleges -- has produced over 2,000 national-level players. At least 100 of them have donned the national colour at various levels. His most important legacy, however, is a legion of followers that he has left behind -- hockey players who try to emulate him to pass on their skill to the next generation. On February 2, 2022, Babu would have turned 100. It would be a momentous occasion for his devotees warranting a befitting celebration. Starting Monday, October 25, Babu’s disciples and fans, led by the KD Singh Babu Memorial Society, would kick-off a 100-day hockey extravaganza which would reach a grand finale on February 2. While preparing for special features to pay our tribute to the legend, when we requested people close to him to come out with their story of Babu, a floodgate of emotions opened. His fairytale debut as a 15-year-old LYA rookie in Delhi against Olympian Mohammmad Husain in 1937; folklores about his magical stickwork and dribbling; how he hosted the national team in Lucknow as it was preparing for the 1948 Olympics; how children of his sports hostel remained his extended family till his last breath. One of his disciples recalled a match between Indian Airlines and UP XI. Babu was the coach of IA and most boys in the rival team were from his stable -- sports hostel. His tips to the UP boys that he passed on during the half-time won them the match. Some narrated his penchant for picking young talents from small matches in remote places -- he spotted future Olympian Syed Ali at a local match in Nainital. The list of reminiscences is endless... Forty-three years after his tragic death, the titan of UP hockey keeps inspiring. Next 100 days would give us thousands of reasons to celebrate his life.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/a-100-reasons-to-celebratethe-life-of-kd-singh-babu/articleshow/87245198.cms||Pravin Kumar

Earlier, cops identified over 250 youngsters who were using drugs including ganja. Vizag city police launched the Marpu (change) programme a few months ago. It aimed at identifying drug users and giving counselling to them to change their lifestyle and preventing drug-related crimes in city. Initially, Marpu was launched to counsel the rowdy-sheeters, but, later extended to cover the drug addicts. Speaking to TOI, assistant commissioner of police, D Sravan Kumar said so far 254 people have been counselled. “Of them, around 10 per cent were drug addicts. Those who were counselled have stopped using the drugs,” he said, and added, “We will continue the Marpu programme to identify drug users and save their life.” A counselling centre comprising one officer each from social welfare, police and medical and health departments has been set up in the city. The officers are assisted by a counsellor or a psychologist. City police chief Manish Kumar Sinha said their teams have been nabbing ganja smugglers and suppliers in various parts of the city. “Our aim is to break the supply chain between the ganja suppliers and users,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/anti-drug-programme-by-city-cops-proves-a-hit/articleshow/87244080.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Meerut||UP: With 65 dog bite cases daily, Saharanpur govt hospital short of anti-rabies vials||SAHARANPUR: Six children were injured when a pack of stray dogs attacked them at Hangawali village in Saharanpur on Friday. The incident was a rerun of a similar event at Padli Grant village on August 7, when a 12-year-old boy succumbed to excessive bleeding due to multiple bite wounds.  In June, dogs picked up a five-month-old infant from her sleeping mother’s cot at night in Behat area’s Dayalpur village and mauled her to death. Stories are aplenty about stray dog attacks, especially on children. What is worrying is that while the number of cases of dog bites are increasing, government medical facilities do not have sufficient anti-rabies vials that are essential for treating a person suffering from a dog bite. Ashutosh Sharma, pharmacist handling the dog bite case department under the Saharanpur Civil Hospital, said, "We receive at least 65 dog bite cases a day." Chief medical officer, Saharanpur, Dr Sanjeev Manglik explained, “The human rabies immunoglobulin which must be used in combination with a rabies vaccine is not available here. Each injection costs about Rs 5,000-6,000 and should be provided by the government to all the hospitals treating dog bites.” The authorities blamed mushrooming of illegal slaughterhouses in rural belt for the sudden aggression in dogs. An official who did not wish to be named said, "The stray dogs consume leftovers strewn after slaughtering animals. When these dogs are deprived of meat, they attack humans, especially children.” Saharanpur municipal commissioner Gyanendra Singh said efforts were on to curb the problem of stray dogs Assistant health officer Dr Kunal Jain blamed animal lovers for preventing the authorities from relocating street dogs, who must be sterilized and vaccinated as per a Supreme Court order. Holding negligence by officials for the burgeoning problem, animal rights activist Surbhi Tripathi suggested,“ A viable solution for this issue is community fed dogs, regulation of slaughter houses and an effective Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme.” Jain said the construction of an animal birth control centre is underway where stray dogs would be sterilized and collared.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/with-65-dog-bite-cases-daily-saharanpur-govt-hosp-short-of-anti-rabies-vials/articleshow/87244094.cms||Ridham Ahuja

All between 7 and 17, the under-trainee boxers hail from marginalized backgrounds with parents of a few working under MNERGA or selling vegetables. All between 7 and 17, the under-trainee boxers hail from marginalized backgroundsThis makeshift boxing facility in rustic Malihabad, nearly 43km away from Lucknow, has brought out at least 10 district level boxers and one national level under the junior category in recent years. Apart from taking on the ring for professional achievement, as many as 87 boxers, primarily girls, have learnt to safeguard themselves from attacks and assaults. “I started off with the intent to teach boxing as a self-defence sport to girls but over the years dozens of my teenage boxers have brought medals,” said coach Mohammad Saif Khan, 47. Hailing from a farming background with family primarily engaged in mango business, Khan has competed at state level in Uttarakhand once. However, a heart wrenching incident around 15 years back forced this former heavyweight boxer to shift focus from mango farming to training self-defence techniques to girls. “A young girl in my neighborhood was raped and I couldn’t do anything to bring justice for her as her family feared that revealing information about the sexual assault will bring bad name to the family,” said Saif, who now ‘empower girls’ of the area. One of his students, Kamna Rawat, 15, has won two district level gold medals. Youngest among six sisters, she joined Saif’s boxing center this January. “After completing my intermediate this year, I want to continue with boxing and reach at national level. Boxing empowered me and also made me confident to stand against bullies,” said Kamna, whose mother Ramshri took to MNERGA working after her husband Mohan Rawat died a decade ago. Similarly, Anamika, 17, the only girl to reach national level to play in quarter finals in a championship organized at Nagpur in 2018, said, “Within five months of joining Saif’s sir coaching I reached the national level game. My parents are daily wage labourers and can’t afford the diet which is required for boxing, but I’ll continue to play as I want to be selected for the Olympics.” Impressed with Saif’s intent, the ChildLine unit of Lucknow has joined hands with him and often holds camps in rustic belt to teach teenagers about sexual abuses and ways to raise voice against it. “Saif has been doing a wonderful job with under-privileged children in the rustic belt of Malihabad which is famous for mangoes. We hope he gets funds to continue boxing,” said Sangeeta Sharma, ChildLine coordinator of Lucknow.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/nestled-in-mango-belt-this-nurseryis-transforming-girls-into-boxers/articleshow/87245218.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Developmental work has started on Seawoods plot: Greens||NAVI MUMBAI: Environmentalists have complained to state authorities that on Sunday, heavy machinery, like a JCB, were seen inside the Seawoods plot in Nerul’s Sector 60, which they claim to be a wetland. Last week, TOI had reported that a MahaRera certificate for the Seawoods plot was recently acquired, although the legal dispute is ongoing in the SC. Cidco had given building permissions to the developer in 2018. Based on these permissions, MahaRera registered the project. “Besides MahaRera, I have also complained to the Bombay high court-appointed wetlands grievance redressal committee that no work commencement should take place inside the 2.7 hectares of pockets D and E at Seawoods as this is a wetland, and the matter is currently pending in the SC. The builder had somehow taken the MahaRera certificate without disclosure of pending litigation and showing an earlier Cidco approval document (before October 2018),” said Sunil Agarwal. “On Sunday, heavy-duty machines were seen doing work inside the plot. Earlier, in January 2020, nearly 700 trees were cut on this site, which we had objected to.” Environmentalist and member of the wetlands protection panel, D Stalin, said: “I have seen Agarwal’s fresh complaint on the Seawoods plot, which is part of the 35.6 hectare land where a golf course and realty plots were planned. I will place this matter before the wetlands panel on Monday so that action can be taken to stop further developmental work.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/devpt-work-has-started-on-seawoods-plot-in-mumbai-greens/articleshow/87245536.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Hyderabad||DCGI nod for device-aided therapy for Parkinson’s patients||Hyderabad: Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has given licence for new device-aided therapy for Parkinson’s disease. London-based researchers and Nizam’s Institue of Medical Sciences (NIMS) doctors’ research paper has revealed that personalised treatment could be done with device-aided therapy using wearable sensors in advanced Parkinson’s disease. Dr Vinod Metta, one of the lead researchers, said, “Parkinson’s disease is a movement disorder affecting about 12 lakh people in India. Currently, only oral medications are available in India, and they are not effective in treating the symptoms.” “Oral medications are helpful in the initial years, but as the patient ages, their disease progresses, leaving them crippled and compromising their quality of life. Technology-driven device-aided therapy with apomorphine medicine given as subcutaneous injections and pumps has been a proven therapy for advanced stages of Parkinson’s disease and been successfully used in the West,” he added. Multiple studies have demonstrated the high efficiency of apomorphine in treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. “Apomorphine is delivered through devices as an intermittent therapy or continuous infusion therapy. Intermittent therapy is delivered using a pen device similar to that of an insulin pen. Continuous therapy is delivered using a pump which is similar to an insulin infusion pump,” Vinod Metta said. “Apo pen injections works within 6-10 minutes and last for 90 minutes, these can be used as a rescue injections whereas Apo pump with continuous infusion is able to help patients as long as infusion in place, ideally most of the patients were given wakeful hours so that they no need to keep pump overnight,” the researcher said. Around 40% of current Parkinson’s patients were believed to be eligible for device-aided therapies. Apomorphine injection & infusion should be considered before even referring Parkinson’s patients to more conventional deep-brain surgeries say experts. Drug Controller General of India permission was given to Hyderabad-based Celera Pharma Private Limited along with Germany-based EVER Neuro Pharma.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dcgi-nod-for-device-aided-therapy-for-parkinsons-patients/articleshow/87245224.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Scientific revamp of centuries-old structure in Guntur on cards||GUNTUR: After long deliberations and discussions, the villagers of Modukuru have consented not to go for the reconstruction of historic Sri Veerabhadra Swamy temple. The villagers have also agreed to take support from the technical teams from Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach). The villagers, who initially wanted to bulldoze the 900-year-old temple to build a new one, finally relented after a team from Intach visited the village on Sunday and held discussions. The team comprising Intact district convenor SVS Lakshminarayana, heritage conservationist Srinath Reddy Pamulapati, Red Cross vice-chairman P Ramachandra Raju and Ravi Srinivas held discussions with the villagers and explained to them the need to protect such precious heritage structures.  Sri Veerabhadra Swamy temple was constructed in 12th century AD in Chalukya-Chola architecture. With structures with higher elevation coming up in the neighbouring areas of the temple, it went below the earth level. This resulted in rainwater from surrounding areas flowing into the temple. After seeing the pathetic condition of the temple, locals decided to build a new temple in modern style after completely demolishing the present structure.With several rich farmers coming forward to bear the reconstruct cost, the locals started preparations to demolish the old temple.  On information, Intact member Srinath Reddy who is also a native of Modukuru rushed to the village and consulted the temple committee. Though he made his best efforts to convince the locals that bulldozing the structure is a big loss to the culture and heritage, the villagers did not relent saying they could not watch the Lord drowning in the rainwater. Later, Intach district convenor SVS Lakshminarayana spoke to chairman and apprised him of the situation. “Intach chairman Gupta has assured to depute a technical team comprising architects and archaeologists to assess the structure and suggest a scientific plan to renovate the temple,” said Lakshminarayana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/scientific-revamp-of-centuries-old-structure-on-cards/articleshow/87244092.cms||Samdani MN
---||Goa||North Goa farmers’ plans for winter crops affected due to Tillari canal burst||Bicholim: After water supply from the Tillari reservoir to Goa was cut off, farmers from Pernem, Bicholim and Bardez areas like Sal and Ibrampur have been severely affected. Farmers here had already begun work to start cultivation of winter crops and the cut-off has come as a further blow as the water supply may not be restored soon, as the repair work in Maneri has come to a halt. Two days after the canal on the left river bank of Tillari burst on October 21, the repair work had been taken up using excavators. However on Thursday, a joint meeting of the Tillari irrigation authorities was held along with locals, at which, it was decided to stop the repair work and to continue only after conducting proper inspection of the entire Tillari dam area. This decision was taken as frequent cases of the canal bursting have been reported in recent years. Officials from Maharashtra have decided to find out the quality of work and plan the future course of action to ensure proper supply of water to Goa and the border villages of Maharashtra. The decision comes after irate locals from Maneri and surrounding areas stopped the canal repair work and informed authorities to undertake any repairs only after the site inspection of the area is completed. Due to this development the preparatory work of farmers on the Goa border who used to cultivate winter crops has been severely affected. Meanwhile no inspection of the Tillari irrigation project area has been taken up by Maharashtra officials as promised and locals have accused officials of being hand-in-glove with the contractor. Locals believe that poor maintenance at the Maharashtra-end of the Tillari water supply network is causing frequents bursts in the canal. This affects drinking water supply to Bardez, Bicholim and Pernem talukas. It may be recalled that on October 21, the main left canal of the Tillari irrigation project that supplies water to the Assonora water treatment plant in North Goa had burst. The farms from the areas of Maneri and vicinity were flooded with water prompting Maharashtra counterparts of the Tillari irrigation project to cut off the water supply to entire North Goa.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/north-goa-farmers-plans-for-winter-crops-affected-due-to-tillari-canal-burst/articleshow/87245239.cms||---

ISA has launched several initiatives to create greater awareness about stroke. The association is observing October as ‘stroke awareness month’ and has organised dozens of programmes and events to spread general awareness about stroke and reduce its burden. An extensive social media campaign with hashtag #ProtectYourBrain – KnowAboutStroke is being run since October first week. “Stroke is a brain attack and is the leading cause of disability and second leading cause of death in India. One person has a stroke in India every 40 seconds, and one-fourth of the patients are less than 50, including a large number who are in the age group of 19-30,” said Dr. Jeyaraj Pandian, president, ISA.  Addressing the media through virtual conference the other day, Dr Pandian said stroke cases put a tremendous financial and social burden on personal, family, and community levels but awareness is the key to reducing the burden. A sedentary lifestyle, smoking, obesity, and lack of regular exercise are the key factors that lead to stroke. It is estimated that 80% of stroke cases can be prevented with lifestyle and behavioural changes, said Dr Pandiyan.  “Stroke can happen to anyone, at any age and anywhere. It is estimated that one in every four persons will have a stroke during their lifetime. The risk can be reduced by regular checks for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, etc. Exercising regularly, maintaining the right weight, quitting smoking, and giving up alcohol consumption can also help reduce the risk of stroke,” said ISA secretary Dr Arvind Sharma.  He said stroke fatality rate in India is much higher than in developed countries due to lower awareness about prevention and treatment. ISA national executive committee member and renowned neurologist Dr P Vijaya said the fatality rate in northeastern states and coastal states is as high as 42%, among the highest in the world, which is attributed to higher salt intake.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/lifestyle-changes-can-prevent-80-of-stroke-cases-experts/articleshow/87244099.cms||Samdani MN

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra seeks feedback from schools on offline exams||MUMBAI: With education boards like CBSE and CISCE-- holding two board exams this academic year, going offline for the semester one class X and XII papers next month, the state is seeking feedback from schools and colleges on conducting the March-April 2022 SSC and HSC exams in the physical mode. After last year’s Covid-19 crisis led to closure of schools, cancellation of exams, and results based on internal assessment, CBSE and CISCE decided to hold two exams, each covering 50% syllabus. With fear of the third wave waning, CBSE decided to conduct offline exams. CISCE, which was also set to conduct the first board online next month, switched to offline to have parity with the central education board. While the state education board has not come up with any plan for SSC and HSC students, schools and colleges are being consulted on whether a pen-and-paper exam (covering the entire syllabus) can be held next year. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Friday interacted with teachers, professors, principals, and academicians in a virtual meeting. The consensus was to hold offline board exams. Schools and junior colleges are holding the first semester exams for class X and XII students online. The marks will have to be taken into account if a physical board exam is not held next year, said a principal. Academicians said that like their CBSE and CISCE counterparts, the state too should have broken down the syllabus into two parts. “The first of the two boards’ exams could have been held now when the Covid situation is under control. It is too early to judge what the situation will be next year,” said a teacher. Gaikwad took stock of the preparedness of schools, junior colleges, and students for a physical board exam. Principals said students have been told to prepare keeping a physical exam in mind. Students and parents too are keen on an offline board exam. The state managed to conduct the supplementary exams for SSC and HSC in September-October in offline mode. Both CBSE and CISCE have allotted respective schools as exam centres for students. CBSE is even working on accommodating outstation students to centres other than their respective schools. CISCE will be issuing guidelines to schools on conducting offline exams.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-seeks-feedback-from-schools-on-offline-exams/articleshow/87245538.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Supply steady but pricey fuel sets vegetable markets on fire||KOLKATA: Despite steady and increased supply to markets, the spiralling prices of vegetables refuse to come down, thanks to the never-ending rise of diesel prices. Bengal’s entire transport fleet runs on diesel. The carrying costs have increased over three-fold in one year, inhibiting a plunge in the prices of vegetables when there has been an adequate supply in the markets. With train services being restricted, vendors have to rely on road transport to ferry goods to the markets. The post rain vegetable production did not take time to swing back to normalcy. But the transportation costs prevented a dip in the prices of essential commodities like vegetables. The prices of vegetables like beans and capsicum coming all the way from Karnataka are still hovering above Rs 200. The price of tomato that rose above Rs 130 a kg has now cooled off a bit to Rs 80 a kg due to local produces reaching the markets. Price of tomatoes was Rs 30 a kg even one month ago. During the Puja, the prices of vegetables went through the roof, burning holes in the pockets of buyers. The restriction on the movement of goods vehicles as well as the damage of standing crops before the Puja pushed the prices of vegetables so high. “The plunge in the prices of vegetables is insignificant compared to the yields. If the farmers could bring vegetables by train, the price would have fallen sharply. By road, the transportation costs are nearly 10 times compared to the cost of booking in trains,” said Kamal De, member of market task force and president of West Bengal Farmers & Vendors’ Association. De said that Bengal’s yield is expected to be good this year and prices are likely to plunge when beans, capsicum, tomatoes, cabbage and cauliflower will start flooding the retail markets from the districts. If farmers and vendors are allowed to carry their produce in the vendor compartments of trains, the buyers will be hugely benefited with a dip in the prices of vegetables. “Now, a 15-20 tonne goods vehicle from Bangalore is charging us Rs 1.3 lakh. Even a year ago it used to be hovering around Rs 60,000-70,000. The local goods carriages are costing us even greater. Thus, a basket of cauliflower from Ranchi is costlier by Rs 70. The commodities coming from Pune get costlier by Rs 10 per kg at wholesale market. Once it reaches the retail market, the price gets manifold after sorting,” said Gopal Sonkar, a wholesaler at Koley Market. It is due to the sky high transportation cost that two ends suffer the most — farmers and consumers. “Thanks to middlemen in the markets, the farmers never get the price of their produce. The farmers often have to make distress sales. The consumers, who have no other way but to buy, are left in the lurch to afford the rising prices,” said De.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/supply-steady-but-pricey-fuel-sets-veggie-mkts-on-fire/articleshow/87244634.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The order came in the backdrop of the killing of five workers in a blast at an illegal manufacturing unit in Shamli recently. Besides, a stock of illegal firecrackers was also found in Muzaffarnagar. “With Diwali round the corner, illegal activities like stocking and manufacturing of sub-standard firecrackers begin to take place. The police stations have been directed to hold special drives to check such activities,” said Kumar. The Meerut police range comprises Meerut, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Hapur and Ghaziabad. “Not only the stocking of sub-standard firecrackers is dangerous for the region, but it also hurts users,” he added. On October 1, a massive blast in a building where an illegal firecracker manufacturing unit was being run in Kairana razed it to the ground, claiming four lives and injuring several others. According to sources, more than two dozen men were working in the factory at the time of the accident. On October 7, Muzaffarnagar police seized illegal crackers worth lakhs of rupee from a house in the city. The seizure also included equipment and raw material used for manufacturing crackers. According to police sources, two persons — Saddam and Sanawwar — were arrested from the site.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/shos-to-be-held-responsible-if-illegal-stock-of-firecrackers-found-ig/articleshow/87244106.cms||Sandeep Rai

Along with VNIT the other members of the consortium include, Thammasat University (Thailand), University of Dhaka (Bangladesh), University of Danang – University of Technology and Education (Vietnam), Royal Thimphu College (Bhutan), University of Indonesia, Ateneo de Manila University (Philippines) and Institute of Forestry of Tribhuvan University (Nepal). VNIT is the coordinating institute for South Asian cities under the initiative. During the signing ceremony organized on a virtual platform, Prof Kazuhiko Takeuchi, president of IGES, Japan highlighted the need and importance of regional circulating and ecological sphere (R-CES) in the context of rapidly emerging challenges for managing urban and rural environments. “With continuing pre-Covid era challenges from climate change and various natural hazards together with emerging challenges from the Covid pandemic makes the post-Covid ‘recovery’ period more crucial and at the same time creates newer opportunities to innovate in various sectors including governance and city planning. Re-examining the conventional paths of economic development and environmental protection becomes an imperative,” he said. He emphasized the need to address urban-rural interdependencies in various aspects of development and elaborated on the R-CES approach that encompasses integration of complex social, environmental and economic sustainability challenges for urban as well as rural regions together. Addressing the forum, Prof Pramod Padole, director of VNIT pointed out the need for creating synergies for achieving green growth and sustainability of urban regions in the wake of discriminatory exploitation of natural resources. Signifying the philosophy of Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam, Prof Padole appreciated the multi-regional and multi-disciplinary collaborative efforts such as through the ensuing R-CES forum for the protection of mother nature. He expressed his gratification for VNIT being a part of the unique initiative by IGES, Japan & START, USA along with other esteemed University partners in establishing the R-CES forum in South Asia and Southeast Asia. He stated his conviction in the concept of R-CES that can potentially provide a pathway to realize a bouncing forward vision for cities and societies in the face of emerging environmental challenges. He affirmed the support of VNIT towards leading the global initiative in South Asia region and acknowledged the partnering institutions for their participation. The consortium activities in VNIT under the R-CES project are being led by Prof Sameer Deshkar, coordinator, IRDR ICoE and assistant professor at the department of architecture and planning. He is assisted by his team of researchers, Harshal Bopardikar, Vaidehi Pathak, Shreya Kanetkar and Bhumika Morey. Dr Akshay Patil, head of DAP, VNIT, extended wishes for the project. Dr Bijon Mitra, deputy director of IGES, Japan, coordinated the event.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/vnit-to-lead-international-consortium-for-advancing-r-ces-concept-in-south-asia/articleshow/87244629.cms||---

At least four persons were injured and five cars were damaged in the clash. RAF had to be deployed to control the situation. Cops said the clash between the local strongman Vicky Ali’s group and Medical College employees’ family members who were attending a meeting to discuss preparations for the upcoming Kali Puja. Both the groups allegedly threw bricks and bottles at each other. They also vandalised the cars parked outside the Medical College’s gate No. 5, which had to be shut for over an hour due to the clash. It was alleged that Ali’s group pelted bottles and assaulted some residents when the meeting was going on. Though locals claimed that there was a firing by the criminals, cops refuted this allegation. “We have found no evidence of any firing so far,” said a police officer, adding that both the groups owe their political allegiance to Trinamool Congress. Cops said that Vicky Ali, a resident of BB Ganguly Street was also injured in the clash. He runs a club on the road where the clash happened. According to sources, there has been a rivalry between the Eden Hospital Road residents and Vicky Ali’s group for the past few years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/clash-near-mch-leaves-four-injured-raf-deployed/articleshow/87244643.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Hyderabad||Merger must to ensure equal constitutional rights||India is a constitutional democracy and no longer a colony of a foreign power which makes laws for us. We make our own laws and these are intended to fulfil our constitutional goals. One such goal is to strengthen representative democracy at grass-roots level. To achieve this goal the 74th Amendment added Sections 243(P) - 243(ZG) to the Constitution. These add a third tier to our democracy - urban local bodies (municipalities and municipal corporations) in addition to the two existing tiers, Parliament and state legislatures. To ensure that local bodies are answerable to citizens, the 74th Amendment specifies that urban local bodies must be run solely by elected representatives. Since Cantonment boards are “urban local bodies” they are covered by 74th Amendment. But cantonment boards function under Cantonments Act, a colonial law which mandates that half the members of a cantonment board shall be nominated from among military and defence estates staff. This makes the board unaccountable to electors. The unrepresentative character of cantonment boards leads to frequent arbitrary and high-handed actions against public interest, poor civic facilities in cantonments, and deprivation of citizen rights which are taken for granted in municipal corporation areas. From both ethical and practical considerations therefore, it is desirable that cantonment be merged with neighbouring GHMC so that it develops on par with municipal areas and its citizens get their constitutional rights.

---||Hyderabad||Medical facilities in Secunderabad Cantonment still not up to mark||SECUNDERABAD: While efforts to battle Covid-19 — through tests and the vaccination drive — have seen Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) officials toil endlessly, the same cannot be about the board’s efforts to improve other areas of healthcare. The board even released notifications for recruitment of permanent doctors in the wake of the pandemic. Consider this: While the Cantonment General Hospital at Bolarum has gynaecologists, the hospital does not have a dedicated maternity ward or even a labour room. As a result, women from the Cantonment area who are expecting have to either go to corporate hospitals or to Gandhi or Osmania General hospitals. “As specialist doctors are unavailable at the Cantonment General Hospital, many patients are referred to corporate hospitals,” admitted one SCB official. Similarly, the near 1.1 lakh population in Rasoolpura — one of the largest slums in the country — relies on the services of a Basti Dawakhana. The Cantonment does have dispensaries — in Picket, Trimulgherry and Bowenpally — but these facilities were built during the British era and are now lacking in both infrastructure and manpower. The dispensaries barely have enough seating facilities with several patients seen standing in queues outside doctors’ chambers. Meanwhile, urban health centres at Bowenpally, Picket, Bolarum, Rasoolpura, and Balamrai cater to an average of 70 to 80 patients daily. While the dispensaries are managed by SCB, the medical staff there has been deputed by the Telangana medical and health department. “The Cantonment Board has enough vacant lands so why can’t they enhance medical services by developing infrastructure and opening more dispensaries,” questioned V Ramesh Kumar, a retired medical department official and resident of Bowenpally. Speaking on the issue, medical superintendent at the Cantonment General Hospital, Dr Ramakrishna, told TOI, “We have three ambulances, including the 108-Ambulance, which is enough to cater to needs within the Cantonment. OPD and maternity services too will begin soon while recruitment of permanent doctors and medical staff is in process. In a month, the hospitals will work at the level of a corporate hospital.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/medical-facilities-in-cantt-still-not-up-to-mark/articleshow/87245009.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Five crocodiles visited Laxmi Vilas Palace in one month||VADODARA: Laxmi Vilas Palace’s compound comprising lush green golf course and garden seems to have gained popularity among tourists of all kinds and species as a great place for hangouts. Of late, it has become a major spot of attraction for Vishwamitri’s crocodiles with the palace recording five nocturnal visits so far, one as recent as late on Saturday night when a guard spotted a four-and-half-foot long crocodile sauntering around the majestic palace and had to be rescued. The volunteers of Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) were called in who rescued the reptile after half-an-hour of operation in the garden next to the palace and successfully handed it over to the forest department. On the night of September 20, an eight-feet-long adult crocodile had ventured near the ornate gate of the palace and was about to progress up the palace’s stairs on the northern side when it was spotted on the nick of time by a gaurd and safely stopped. A day later, another of its species, this time a seven-feet-long one, managed to dodge security and crawl inside the palace compound on October 13 night. Rescuers believe it may have teed off from the sprawling golf course that encircles the palace. On October 21 too, a three-feet-long reptile was rescued from near the palace. The visits are from adventurous reptiles that crawl out of the river that flows at some distance from the palace. Vishwamitri is home to over 270 crocodiles. Some of the crocodiles residing in the Lalbaug lake on Rajmahal Road too often venture into the palace’s sprawling compound. Wildlife experts said that the nocturnal visits are mostly from migrating reptiles from the river that seek safer options during monsoons. “They usually migrate during the night time so anyone can hardly notice their movement. During monsoons, the water level in Vishwamitri goes up and the flow of water too is high. So, they move out to look for some other water body,” said Arvind Pawar of Wildlife Rescue Trust (WRT). Though by appearance they do not seem to be too friendly, none of the reptiles have ever attacked any humans while migrating from one place to another, rescuers added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/five-crocs-visited-royal-palace-in-one-month/articleshow/87243681.cms||Tushar Tere

So far, 115 people with viral fever and dengue-like symptoms have died in the district. Of these, 92 were children. In the last two months, 450 people have been tested positive for dengue which is the highest in the last 10 years, health department officials said. More than 5,000 people are still bedridden at their homes in the rural areas. Most of them are dependent on quacks for treatment. Munendra Singh Singh, father of a six-year-old and resident of Dhamli under Khandoli block, said, “My daughter was suffering from viral fever for four days. We gave her medicines from a private clinic as no doctor was available at the government centre. On Saturday, her condition deteriorated. She died on the way to SN Medical College.” Resident of Midkoli under Bah block, Virendra Chaudhary said, “Most of the people suffering from high fever are dependent on quacks operating in the area as the government centres are not admitting the patients. In the last 10 days, seven people have died in the village. Over 300 people are bedridden with high fever.” Chief medical officer of Agra district, Arun Kumar Srivastava said, “Health department teams are conducting door-to-door surveys in the rural areas to identify patients suffering from fever and help them in getting the required treatment. Cleanliness work and anti-larvae spraying is being done in the villages to prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases. All the cases of deaths are being investigated.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/5-more-kids-with-fever-die-in-24-hrs-in-agra-dist-toll-reaches-115/articleshow/87244118.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Hyderabad||Breathing easy: Steps taken to boost Hussainsagar oxygen levels||HYDERABAD: Recent figures released by the Pollution Control Board (PCB) on Hussainsagar shows a favourable trend in controlled values of all water indicators. Of them, the most significant value of dissolved oxygen (DO) level was observed to be around 4mg/litre. As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), DO has been stabilised at the minimum required level of 4mg/litre — the level required for aquatic life to survive. DO levels at Hussainsagar have been stabilised by a process known as bioremediation. DO levels can decrease when a water body is polluted with contaminants. Dissolved oxygen is essential for the survival of aquatic life. While DO level of 4mg/litre is the minimum to sustain aquatic life, levels of 7 to 8mg/litre are considered to be very good oxygen saturation levels for aquatic organisms. It may be noted that even at 4mg/litre, oxygen saturation will be above 70 per cent. In bioremediation, microbes like bacteria are used to purify water. The process promotes the growth of bacteria that consume pollutants which in turn reduce the foul smell and improve DO levels at the top layer of a water body. Across various collection sites on Hussainsagar, DO readings were found to be at least 4mg/litre, indicating oxygen saturation levels of around 70 per cent. Bioremediation process was first introduced at the lake a few months ago when it was found that DO levels had dropped below the 4mg/litre threshold to sustain aquatic life. “This is an advanced process which is already in use in developed countries. It was recently introduced in India with states such as Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh already employing the method,” a member of the lake pollution control committee told TOI. It must be mentioned that extremely high or extremely low DO levels can harm aquatic life and affect the quality of water too. “Only after a scientific process is the amount of microbes to be introduced for the bioremediation process decided,” said one source closely involved with the process.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/breathing-easy-steps-taken-to-boost-hussainsagar-o2-levels/articleshow/87244974.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Firecrackers with fake QR codes in market, says NGO||MUMBAI: NGO Awaaz Foundation, which recently tested firecrackers for noise pollution along with Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), has revealed that majority of the products had fake QR codes or bar codes. QR codes give details of the manufacturer, manufacturing date, expiry date and chemical content of the product besides the price. It also confirms whether it has followed prescribed government standards in terms of noise and emission. TimesViewAfter years of consistent efforts by groups like Awaaz Foundation to curb noise and pollution levels of firecrackers, much progress has been made. However, as the latest study reveals, many products still carry fake QR or bar codes and thus it is difficult to determine if the use of permitted chemicals is within safe limits as prescribed by NEERI. If manufacturers are flouting Supreme Court guidelines, the state should crack down on them and seize their products.In a letter to the director of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) that has powers to regulate chemical content to avoid noise and harmful emissions that can pollute air, Awaaz Foundation convenor Sumaira Abdulali has pointed out that of the crackers claiming to be ‘green’ and having the NEERI stamp, only a few carried a QR code and the rest had bar codes that do not fulfill requirements laid down by the Supreme Court.  Later, in a tweet Abdulali said the codes in most cases were fake as they didn’t work at all. She said she found the banned chemical, barium nitrate, in some products. To test noise levels /pollution, the NGO got ‘Green Crackers’ with stamp of NEERI from the market in Mumbai on October 19. NEERI had developed green standards which fireworks manufacturers had to comply with. “I attach herewith photographs of the QR Code/Bar Code/s published on the boxes of crackers. Please confirm that these codes are genuine. I earnestly request your urgent response, as starting very soon, citizens would be buying and using such crackers,” she wrote. Replying to Abdulali’s tweets, former NEERI director Rakesh Kumar said spurious products were a serious issue. “Though I am not involved now, it’s important to note that QR code generation and tracking system was put in place...” he has said in his tweets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-firecrackers-with-fake-qr-codes-in-market-says-ngo/articleshow/87245553.cms||---

Several commuters who are heavily dependent on these cab services complain that drivers often call after accepting their ride seeking the drop location and cancel after that. In some cases, there are complaints wherein drivers denied the ride after boarding the passengers. “I had booked a ride from a hotel in Banjara Hills to Tarnaka after accepting a waiting period of 18 minutes. After the ride arrived and I boarded the cab, the driver refused to proceed with the trip after knowing the destination, leaving me helpless,” said Shyamali, a resident of Khairtabad. Many enraged commuters have taken to social media seeking better services from Uber. “@Uber_India is terrible in Hyderabad. After every booking, the driver calls and asks where one has to go. If it’s not their preferred location they cancel. Takes 5-6 booking - cancellation before one finally gets a cab,” tweeted Himani Singh. Following multiple complaints, Uber India in a statement stated they are taking all efforts to deliver a seamless experience to the consumer. “We are doubling down on our efforts nationwide to ensure steady service through driver education and improvements to our app and procedures. We listen and act on rider feedback about their experience while taking an Uber. Uber’s in-app features now make it easier for riders to report ride cancellations by drivers and the app has a simplified redressal mechanism for claiming refunds,” said an official spokesperson.

The recent extremely heavy rains in Kumaon region of Uttarakhand have resulted in an increase in the water level in Ganga. While these rains wreaked havoc in the hills by causing flash floods and triggering landslides, the downpour also made the Ganga and its tributaries swell up by feeding them with extra water. Such heavy rainfall is unusual in the month of October and hence when the water level rises in Ganga, it is noticeable at Ganga Barrage from where a tab is kept on water levels. But the increased water level is benefiting the Jal Kal department since the water supply to the city is provided from Ganga. Due to increased water level, the department now does not require the use of dredging machines to pull water from the Ganga. Two dredging machines were being used till a few days ago, but now their use has been discontinued. However, the situation may not remain the same in the coming days. Once the water level dips again, then the same procedure of drawing water from Ganga will have to be deployed. The Ganga water is now directly reaching the Bhairo Ghat pumping station. Over two lakh cusecs of water had been released from the Narora dam into the Ganga. The water level, therefore, increased at Barrage and at Shuklaganj where increase or decrease in water table is recorded on an hourly basis. All 30 gates of Ganga barrage had been opened on Friday to allow increased water flow. However, the increased water level is presently posing no threat to the low-lying Katri region, which is a cluster of about a dozen small villages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/ganga-swells-after-unseasonalheavy-rainfall-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/87244655.cms||---

Apart from the environmental impact, their surrounding air and water will also get polluted, experts say. Those who consume fish netted from streams would also be exposed to dangerous toxins. Malaria and dengue fever have the potential to spread rapidly. While the lake’s bio oxygen demand ( BOD) ranges between 20- 25 mg./ at different sites, this is the only parameter that is higher than the prescribed threshold. “It reflects the amount of oxygen required to eliminate organic materials during the breakdown process by bacteria. BOD levels in lakes can be up to a maximum of 3 mg/l,” said an expert. This apart, other harmful compounds found in the lake are Cobalt, Manganese, Aluminum, Zinc, Barium Sulphate, Arsenic, Mercury and Mica among others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bod-pollution-levels-key-to-life-in-lakes/articleshow/87244987.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Chief medical officer, Kanpur, Nepal Singh, said, the officer was being treated at 7 Air Force Hospital in the district with high fever and his blood samples were sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, after his body temperature remained alarmingly high for a week. At least 200 more samples of those in contact with the patient and those with similar symptoms have been dispatched to the Pune lab and isolated in their homes. A team of health experts from Delhi has been rushed to Kanpur to contain the spread of the contagion even as UP health department constituted two medical teams on Sunday. A team headed by additional CMO Dr Subodh Prakash went to Pardevanpur Pokharpur locality of Kanpur, where the officer resides, and collected samples of 200 people, including his wife, son and daughter. His family, however, lives in Pune and Bangalore and are currently present in Kanpur. The second team inspected 7 Air Force Hospital and directed fogging and sanitisation. District magistrate, Kanpur, Vishak G, said all necessary steps were being taken after confirmation of the first zika positive patient in UP. “An emergency meeting of medical college doctors will be held on Monday and civic staff have been directed to launch a fogging exercise with mosquito repellents. The virus does not spread like Covid, it’s vector-borne like dengue,” the DM said. The first Zika infection was confirmed in Kerala on July 8. As per a WHO report, the zika viral RNA was detected through RT-PCR testing at National Institute of Virology Pune in a blood sample collected from a 24-year-old pregnant woman in Trivandrum. On July 31, Maharashtra too reported its first zika case from Belsar village in Pune district when a 50-year-old woman tested positive. Protection against mosquito bites during the day and early evening is key to preventing spread of infection. Aedes mosquitoes breed in small collections of water around homes, schools, and workplaces and it’s important to eliminate these sites by appropriate methods.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/kanpur-iaf-officer-ups-1st-zika-patient/articleshow/87244674.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Goa||Faleiro joined TMC to help BJP come to office: Mickky||Margao: Former Benaulim MLA Fransisco ‘Mickky’ Pacheco, who recently joined Congress, lashed out at former Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro alleging that his joining Trinamool Congress (TMC) was but a backdoor support to BJP with the only motive of hiding his skeletons in the closet. TMC, instead of defeating BJP, will only end up helping the saffron party in the 2022 polls by dividing anti-BJP votes, Pacheco told reporters on Sunday. “Luizinho Faleiro was never seen as aggressive during his long stint in Congress as he is now,” Pacheco said. “That’s because he was being pressurised by BJP. TMC is now poaching Congress candidates and BJP is enjoying Faleiro’s sideshow…Here, TMC is not getting promoted, instead it’s BJP that is gaining from all this through the backdoor.” Urging people to see through TMC’s plans of helping BJP to come to office through the back door, Pacheco said, “Faleiro did many black deeds during his tenure as chief minister. His joining TMC is an advantage for BJP.” Accusing Faleiro of encouraging Congress workers to quit the party to join TMC, Pacheco warned them against falling for Faleiro’s words in the interest of Goa. “If TMC comes to Goa, there will be an influx of Rohingyas in Goa and Goa will be further ruined,” he said. Referring to Faleiro’s accusations against Congress leaders during his meeting with his supporters on Saturday, Pacheco said, “Had Faleiro made these allegations when he was in Congress, one would tend to believe them. He should stop misleading the people of Goa.” Faleiro had on Saturday hit out against his detractors within Congress calling them BJP’s B team and its brokers, and accusing them of precipitating the ruin of Congress in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/faleiro-joined-tmc-to-help-bjp-come-to-office-mickky/articleshow/87245265.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Uttarakhand: 4 trekkers’ bodies set to reach Kolkata||KOLKATA: Arrangements are being finalized to fly back home the bodies of at least four trekkers from Bengal — who died in an avalanche in Uttarakhand last week — at the earliest. The deceased, whose remains are supposed to reach the city, are Tanumay Tiwari, Sourav Ghosh, Bikash Makal and Shibayan Das. While Ghosh and Makal were the residents of Bishnupur in South 24 Parganas, Tiwari and Das hailed from Kolkata. While 10 trekkers from the state have been confirmed dead, at least six others are still missing. Thirty-one-year-old Mithun Dari, also from Bishnupur, who had a narrow escape during the expedition that killed other six members of his trekking group, reached Kolkata late on Sunday. He had been under treatment at a hospital in Harsil after being rescued by the army. On Sunday, Dari and his brother Manoj took a flight to Delhi from Dehradun and then another one to Kolkata. Speaking to TOI from Dehradun, Dari said that a foot injury, which left him immobilized, saved his life. “We were trekking back from Chitkul and had reached the Lamkhaga pass at an altitude of 18,000 feet on October 17 when I fractured my right leg. The other six members of my group carried me to a tent and left me in charge of sherpas as they proceeded towards the nearest army camp to seek help for me. They were caught in the avalanche on their way and were buried under the snow,” said Dari. Dari had left Kolkata on October 11 and reached Harsil the next day. The group started their trek on October 14. Dari spent four days at the camp and ran out of food and water. “I stared at certain death even as I realized that the members of my group have been killed. I had almost left all hopes of survival, until an army helicopter reached my tent on October 21. It carried me to a hospital in Harsil,” Dari recounted. He added that he would probably never trek again. Meanwhile, according to the officials of the South 24 Parganas district administration, the bodies of Ghosh and Makal were taken by road to Delhi from Uttarkashi. From the capital, the remains are to be flown back to Kolkata. “Arrangements are ready to fly back their remains. We expect at least four bodies to reach Kolkata in the wee hours of Monday. Search operations are on to locate the missing persons and we hope that we will be able to trace them soon,” said Bishnupur 1 BDO Subir Kumar Dandapat. According to state government sources, the bodies of Makal, Tiwari and Ghosh are likely to be flown to Kolkata from Delhi on Monday. However, the official was unsure if the body of Sadhan Kumar Basak, another trekker and a resident of Thakurpukur, who was killed, will also be flown to the city. The state government officials said that they are in constant touch with Uttarakhand to trace the other missing trekkers. Efforts are also on from the end of the Bengal government to rescue the stranded tourists from the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/uttarakhand-4-trekkers-bodies-set-to-reach-city/articleshow/87244672.cms||Debashish Konar

The incident occurred in Jasupur Gadhiya village of Rajepur police station area. As per details, 50-year-old Irshad’s wife Nanhi (45) had cooked cauliflower curry which was consumed by them, besides their daughters Majida (18), Rajida (10) and sons Majid (12) and Asif (5). Their health deteriorated within a few hours after the dinner. While Irshad and his son Asif died after being admitted to Brahmadutt Dwivedi hospital, Nanhi, Majid and Rajida are said to be critical and still undergoing treatment. A police team visited Irshad’s home and inspected the spot where the food was prepared. The police seized the cauliflower curry and sent it for forensic examination. Cops have also sent the bodies to district hospital for postmortem, the report of which is awaited. It is being doubted that Irshad and his minor son died due to food poisoning. Police, however, maintained that nothing can be said till the postmortem report and forensic report of the cauliflower curry arrive. Police officials said that all possible angles will be investigated in detail. The whole village is in a state of shock after the incident. Dr Haridutt Dwivedi of the Brahmadutt Dwivedi hospital expressed doubt that pesticide may have been sprayed on the cauliflower in the field a day earlier and the farmer might have sold it in the market the very next day. Probably, the cauliflower was not washed properly, as a result of which the effect of insecticide remained in it. “The incident occurred apparently due to the effect of pesticide in the vegetable,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/two-family-members-dead-three-critical-after-consuming-cauliflower-curry/articleshow/87244671.cms||---

After February, the health department ceased immunisation work due to the second wave of Covid-19, and their teams didn’t go door-to-door vaccinating children between 8 months to 5 years of age. Even on the occasion of World Polio Day on Sunday, no immunisation program was conducted. Firozabad district immunisation officer Dr Anjush Singh said, “No directives were received from the state government regarding the celebration of world polio day. Suitable action will be taken as per the government orders." According to the health department officials, all the anganwadi workers were busy with Covid-19 work. In August, cases of viral fever, dengue, malaria and other vector-borne diseases started increasing across the Agra region. With beds at government hospitals occupied with the patients and an increasing number of dengue cases, they were occupied in treating patients. IMA central working committee member Dr Sharad Gupta said, “Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious viral disease that largely affects children under 5 years of age. The virus is transmitted through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g. contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and even cause paralysis. It has no cure and can be prevented only by immunisation. Health authorities must ensure children get oral poliovirus vaccines on time.” Health department additional director AK Singh said, “Polio immunisation programme will be restarted very soon. We will ensure all the children get the vaccine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/covid-dengue-outbreak-hits-polio-immunisation-drive/articleshow/87244139.cms||Deepak Lavania

Hospitals should be allowed to carry on non-Covid work at least for more than 50% of capacity as per the State GR,” said Dr Marar. The state government, in an earlier GR, had stated that in case of a decline, the beds reserved for Covid shouldn’t drop below 50%. Officials from the state government said that more than 15 districts in the state have less than 100 active cases and Covid beds are lying vacant. Even in cities, most cases are getting treated at home and a very small percentage of Covid patients need hospitalization. VHA has more than 126 private hospitals of Vidarbha attached to it with total bed strength of more than 10,000. Apart from the private hospitals, there was a demand to restore the building of Trauma Center of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) for the accident victims and trauma patients. But, officials at GMCH told that it was strategically decided to continue the Covid hospital status of the Trauma Center for some more time. “The Covid Hospital developed in Trauma Center building has all major facilities installed in case the third wave hits us. The hospital has pediatric ICUs and ventilators too. Hence, it was decided to maintain it as a Covid hospital,” said a senior official. The same strategy has been applied to the private hospitals in Vidarbha region. “The administration is still anticipating that the third wave might hit us anytime especially after school, college reopening. Its better to stay safe and prepared for the spike. So, complete withdrawal of the Covid reservation is still not on cards,” said a member of State Covid task force. VHA president Dr Ashok Arbat told that the rules must be flexible and the bed reservation can be reinstated if Covid-19 cases surge and people require hospitalization. “Not many Covid-19 patients are requiring hospitalization or ICU admissions at present phase. Private hospitals should be allowed to focus on post-Covid problems and non-Covid illnesses now,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/end-covid-19-bed-reservation-in-pvt-hospitals-vha/articleshow/87230218.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Low water pressure slowed fire-fight, says fire brigade||MUMBAI: Low water pressure in the nozzle of the 60-storey high-rise, One Avighna Park, at Currey Road, hampered fire-fighting, the fire brigade has claimed. “Had water pressure been up to the mark, we could have contained the blaze at the start itself,” a senior fire brigade official said. The builder’s company, however, refuted the fire brigade’s claim. The fire official, who did not wish to be identified, said that while fire-fighting equipment in the high-rise was operational, but it failed to start on time. The official said that tackling any fire at the initial stage itself can help pre-empt its spread. “The water from the nozzle in the building was pouring out in a very inadequate manner,” the official reiterated, adding that this is the reason they insist that fire-fighting equipment in every building is functional so that it gets activated immediately in case of an eventuality. A major fire broke out at the high-rise on Friday afternoon. A security guard died in the incident. Two days after the incident, a team of senior fire officials visited the site on Sunday. They said it was a “routine” visit as a part of their investigation into the cause of the fire and to understand what more needs to be done on the part of the fire force in case of fires in a high-rise. A top official of Avighna Group, maintained that they have been “very particular about fire safety”. The group’s managing director, Nishant Agarwal, had told TOI that a mock drill had been held on the premises on October 1. Agarwal also said on Saturday that the mandatory certificate required to be submitted regarding maintenance of fire prevention and safety measures had been submitted to the fire brigade earlier this year, ensuring that compliances were “completely in order”. A notice of the mock drill put up at the building read: ‘An awareness session followed by evacuation drill on handling domestic emergencies, fire-fighting, training and use of fire-fighting equipment will be held on Friday, October 1...”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-low-water-pressure-slowed-fire-fight-says-fire-brigade/articleshow/87245560.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Thane||Thane: Bank staff’s death underlines threat to life in old buildings||ULHASNAGAR: The slab collapse at Paras building in Ulhasnagar has revealed how citizens are forced to live in dangerous buildings putting their lives at risk. The incident revealed that 24-year-old bank employee, Aakash Poptani (24), who died in the mishap had left Paras building four months ago after Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) issued notice to over 2,000 buildings constructed in the years 1994-1996, which included Paras building, asking them to get a structural audit done. A family member of Poptani told TOI, “Since the rent was high at the new house Aakash, who was the sole breadwinner in the family, taking care of his parent and younger sister, shifted back into Paras building with his family as the rent was low here since they were living here on pagdi system”. On Saturday at 10.30 pm Aakash had gone into the bedroom to take some clothes when a slab on the fifth floor where they lived came crashing down on the fourth floor. Seeing this, the other family members fled the building. However Aakash was stuck on the fourth floor as the owners had moved from the house and it was locked. Yuvraj Bhadane, Public relation officer of UMC said, "Paras building was not on dangerous lists but since it was constructed in the 1994-1996 period during which many buildings came up using inferior quality sand, notice was issued to the building among over 2,000 such structures asking them to get a structural audit". The Paras building incident has brought the focus back on the issue of dilapidated buildings in Ulhasnagar where citizens live in dangerous conditions. There is a growing demand that the government resolve technical problems of regularisation and expedite redevelopment of such illegal buildings in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/mumbai-bank-staffs-death-underlines-threat-to-life-in-old-bldgs/articleshow/87244684.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Rs 100 crore worth paddy ruined in Udham Singh Nagar||DEHRADUN: The farmers of Udham Singh Nagar (US Nagar) -- regarded as the premier rice-growing belt of Uttarakhand -- have suffered a major setback due to the recent rains, as the ripened paddy crop, ready to be harvested across 45,000 hectares of agricultural land, has been waterlogged. “Preliminary findings indicate losses worth almost Rs 98 crore because of damage to crops spread across around 45,000 hectares,” said A K Verma, district agriculture officer, US Nagar. Farmers in the region said that the paddy crop is usually harvested by mid-October. However, this year, because of excess moisture in the paddy grains, the process got a little delayed. This delay proved costly as untimely rains lashed the area last week. Udham Singh Nagar has almost 1.5 lakh farmers who produce at least 4.4 lakh metric tons of rice every year, which is also exported to various countries. The area is famous for its rice, wheat and sugarcane. “Recently, we had harvested paddy across 40 hectares of land. We were now supposed to get rice from the paddy after thrashing it. However, everything has drowned. We are left helpless as our prime source of income has gone away,” said Daljeet Singh, 58, a farmer from Pratapur area of the district. Agriculture department officials who made a preliminary assessment of the damage, said that almost 60% of the paddy crop was already harvested and has been swept away in the fast-flowing water, while the remaining 40% has been so severely waterlogged that it’s market value has crashed. They added that a joint committee of the agriculture department and the revenue department has been formed to evaluate the losses and give compensation to the affected farmers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/45k-ha-paddy-crop-worth-rs-100cr-ruined-in-us-nagar-rice-bowl-of-ukhand/articleshow/87244145.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Nagpur||Divorced parents must share equally child’s education expenses: HC||Nagpur: Both parents should be equally responsible for taking care of their children’s education expenses, ruled the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court after an 18-year-old approached it as he was finding it difficult to pay fees at IIT Dhanbad, where he has secured admission in mechanical branch. Dismissing the father’s contention that he is unable to hike the maintenance amount, as he has to look after his old mother, divorced sister and her daughter, the bench also held that “children must be the first priority of a parent in the matter of maintenance.” “Before the petitioner’s birth in 2001, his parents had separated and he has been residing with mother. Both of his parents are serving as teachers and earning salary of over Rs48,000. It is, therefore, apparent that both are equally responsible to share maintenance as well as education expenses of their son,” said a division bench comprising Justice Atul Chandurkar and Justice GN Sanap. “Even if it is assumed, for the sake of argument, that there are some other persons dependent on the father, the child must be his first priority in the matter of maintenance. If he fails to share the maintenance and expenses, then the mother would be required to bear the unnecessary burden,” the bench added, while asking the father to enhance the monthly maintenance to Rs7,500 from Rs5,000, with effect from October 27, 2015, the date on which the student had filed the petition. The youngster, a meritorious student scoring 93% in Class X examination, had moved the HC after he was finding it difficult to pay the fees of the course at IIT Dhanbad. Till now, his education and other expenses were taken care of by his mother, while the father used to provide Rs5,000 maintenance as fixed by the family court. The petitioner had prayed for enhancing the maintenance to Rs15,000 so that he could pay the college fees. “It is seen that the petitioner, who happens to be a meritorious child, has been made to face this unfortunate situation. Considering his plight and needs, he was constrained to knock the judiciary’s doors,” the judges observed. The parents were granted divorce on July 21, 2009, through mutual consent. The petitioner contended that his father, teacher at a zilla parishad school, did not bother to maintain him nor took care of his well-being, after his birth. On other hand, his mother faced several difficulties while maintaining him with her meagre salary, the petition said. “Considering the fact that both parents are in service and having their own maintenance and responsibilities, the reasonable amount of maintenance is required to be quantified. As far as the education expenses are concerned, both parents shall share it equally. Both on their own must devise a mechanism to obtain the statement of the education expenses and share the same,” said the bench.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/divorced-parents-must-share-equally-childs-education-expenses-hc/articleshow/87244688.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Varanasi||Corruption in previous govts deprived Uttar Pradesh of development, says CM Yogi Adityanath||VARANASI: Launching a fierce attack on the Opposition, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that Uttar Pradesh remained undeveloped because massive corruption by leaders of ruling parties during previous regimes cast an eclipse on development schemes. Addressing a public meeting after launching 74 projects worth Rs 373 crore in Bhadohi on Sunday, the CM targeted the Opposition alleging that corrupt leaders and criminals misappropriated the funds allocated for development projects and their ill intentions were like an eclipse on development. “The people of Bhadohi then elected hard working MPs and MLAs, who are implementing all the development projects of BJP-led Union and state governments zealously, and as a result the district is creating a new image by emerging as a hub of export under One District One Product scheme,” the CM said. “The previous governments did not have the approach to ensure development, but only had corrupt designs and criminal intentions. Instead of ensuring the development of everyone, they focused on developing their own families. In contrast, BJP considers all the people as its family and ensures their welfare and development,” said Yogi. “We believe in taking all sections of the society together on the path of development. Opposition should tell why they could not ensure such development in 70 years after independence, which my government has done in only four and half years,” the CM added. “New opportunities of employment are being created in Bhadohi where development faced hurdles due to criminalisation of politics. My government cleared this hurdle and we pledged to ensure that no woman becomes a widow or child turns orphan due to criminals,” said Yogi. Now, the faith of people is being given due regard as is evident with the development of Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kashi and renovation of Maa Vindhyavasini Dham in Mirzapur, the CM added. “Our holy Ganga has been becoming free from pollution during the seven years of the Modi government,” he added. There have been no riots in the state and anyone who tries to indulge in rioting should keep in mind that their seven generations will have to repay for it, the CM warned. Bulldozers of the government are ready for action against those who grab public property, he added. Highlighting the schemes and achievements of BJP governments at the Centre and in the state, Yogi said Bhadohi has 15.70 lakh families of which 10.60 lakh families have benefitted from government schemes. He directed officials of the panchayati raj department in the district to complete the recruitment of sanitation staff in the coming three-four months. The 100-bed hospital in Bhadohi could not become ready due to corruption in the previous government, said Yogi adding none of those involved in corruption will be spared and the hospital will be constructed very soon. He also announced that a medical college will come up in Bhadohi in PPP mode. BJP state president Swatantrata Dev Singh appealed to the people to keep development in mind while casting their votes in the 2022 assembly elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/corruption-in-previous-regimesdeprived-up-of-devpt-says-cm/articleshow/87244697.cms||---

However, when Deepak M Damor took charge as the city commissioner in May, he ordered police to register FIRs to all the pending complaints in connection with the motorcycle theft cases, the officer added.So, according to police data, as many as 279 motorcycle theft cases were registered since the start of this year until October 22 compared to 125 cases registered in the whole of 2020. Of the 125 cases, 99 were solved and 130 people were arrested last year compared to 106 solved cases and 153 arrests this year.“After registering FIRs, many people claimed compensation from insurance companies. Such people could not get back the stolen motorcycles if they were recovered. The seized motorcycles will be handed over to the insurance companies through the court,” said the police officer.The officer said police are not bothered about the number of FIRs registered. “We registered cases immediately, if complaints were found to be genuine.

Social distancing norms went for a toss at some of the popular stores. While most of the shoppers wore masks, some, including employees of stores, were wearing mask on their chin.Motorists had a tough time passing through the busy stretches, although those aware of the festival, avoided crowded stretches. Cops were deployed for crowd management and to streamline traffic. A manager of a popular textile store at Gandhipuram said that the shop has been receiving overwhelming crowds from last week. “Although we expected a high turnout, the number of people visiting the store exceeded our expectations.

---||Kochi||Kerala govt plans to float expressions of interest for vaccination facility||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government is all set to float expressions of interest (EoIs) inviting market players for setting up a vaccine-manufacturing unit and a fill-finish facility in the state. Two separate EoIs will be floated—one for setting up the fill-finish facility whereby manufactured vaccines will be labelled, bottled and marketed and another one for setting up a full-fledged vaccine manufacturing unit. Though the original idea of setting up of the vaccine manufacturing unit had taken shape when the state was facing a dearth of Covid-19 vaccine, the government will not insist on Covid-19 vaccine alone to be manufactured here, as it is not planning to enter into any kind of contractual obligation to purchase the manufactured vaccine, according to government sources. The working group set up for the purpose convened on June 16 this year had reported to the government that there are only around 20 companies in the vaccine manufacturing sector in India and many of them do not have the bandwidth to set up a new manufacturing facility. But many of them could be attracted to the state if competitive incentives are offered in the bio-sciences park. Hence, the committee recommended the government to first invite companies that have licences to fill and distribute approved vaccines to establish a fill-finish unit and start distributing vaccines to the market within a stipulated time limit. It had further recommended that in the second stage, a manufacturing facility can be built and subsequently a research and development facility also can be explored in association with the virology institute functioning in the park. The nearly completed 85,000 square feet with biosafety level-two facilities needed for vaccine industry in the life sciences park would be rented out to contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to set up the fill-finish facility. The CMOs like Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech which had participated in the interaction were looking for a built-up infrastructure to set up a fill-finish unit as soon as possible, the committee had reported.

This is the first time in city that bookies were rounded up and their dens raided even before the match had started.

The first patient of Zika virus in Uttar Pradesh has been detected in Kanpur after a Pune laboratory confirmed the infection on a 57-year-old warrant officer of the Air Force Station here late Saturday night. Chief medical officer Dr Nepal Singh said, “The multidisciplinary team comprising an entomologist, public health specialists and gynaecologist from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, National Centre for Disease Control and RML Hospital, New Delhi sent by the Union Ministry has been deployed to assist the state health authorities for control and containment measures of Zika virus.” “The high-level team including a campaign team of Vector Borne Diseases from Delhi visited the affected area and observed the situation there,” said the CMO further adding, “The samples of the suspected persons are also being taken. Fever patients have also been taken under investigation.” The health department, meanwhile, has declared Pardewanpurwa as a containment zone after the state’s first Zika case was reported here. “A Containment Zone has been declared within a radius of one kilometer to track Zika patients, if any, in the affected area,” said chief medical officer Dr Nepal Singh. The CMO said, 24 teams have been formed for procuring samples from three hundred houses of Pardevanpurwa. On Sunday, five more samples were taken and sent to the KGMU lab in Lucknow. The area has a population of about 1,300. The area has been sanitised by the health department by putting up several teams. Medical teams deployed in the area are conducting door-to-door health surveys of locals. “We are also preparing a list of people who have travelled abroad or any other state in the country. So far seven such people have been traced, but none among them are from affected Kerala or Maharashtra, where cases of Zika virus were reported earlier,” said a senior health officer adding that contact tracing of the patients would be carried for next two weeks. After confirmation of the Zika viral infection in the Air Force personnel in Kanpur, Zika wing has been raised in Lala Lajpat Rai hospital. “In the maternity block where Covid patients were being kept, 10 beds have been reserved for Zika patients,” said chief medical superintendent of LLR Dr RK Maurya.

President of United Goans Democratic Party (UGDP) Jorson Fernandes is all set to join the West Bengal-based party at a function to be held at Margao on Monday. Fernandes has already sent his letter of resignation to UGDP’s secretary general stating that he is resigning as the president of the party as well as its primary member with effect from October 23. Fernandes, when contacted, confirmed that he will join TMC on Monday, and said that all details will be disclosed after his formal induction into the party. However, vice-president of UGDP Radharao Gracias, maintained that Fernandes hasn’t yet resigned and that he continues to be the president of the regional outfit. He, however, said that UGDP has “struck a deal” with AITC, details about the nature of UGDP’s arrangement with TMC will be revealed at a press briefing on Monday. UGDP has been trying to stay afloat after its abysmal performance in the last few elections. The regional outfit has already lost its recognition as a regional party and also its right to ownership of the once emotive “two leaves” symbol. UGDP was de-recognised as a regional political party by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in 2012 following its successive poor performance in the previous few elections. In the 2007 assembly elections, UGDP had won one seat of 40 assembly seats and secured 5% of the total valid votes. In the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, the party did not win any seat and had secured 1% of votes of the total valid votes. However, as per the Election Symbol (Reserved & Allocation) order, 1968, the ECI allowed the UGDP to use its ‘two leaves’ symbol for that election. Following its dismal output in the 2012 elections as well, the UGDP lost its recognition by the ECI.

A farmer, he wants to get back to cultivation but his family has asked him to stay at home, lest he catches Covid infection. “Earlier, cancer patients had to fight stigma, now we have to fight stigma and family and government-imposed curbs that lead to isolation and loneliness,” he complained to his oncologist during a follow-up session. The pandemic, and fears about the risk it poses to people with underlying medical problems like cancer, especially the elderly, has fundamentally altered the manner of patient interactions within family and society. Oncologists said there is about 15% increase in patients (especially those on chemotherapy and new patients detected with cancer) complaining of depression and loneliness. The problem is more acute among senior citizens forced to sit in reverse quarantine. “There is a false notion in the society that a cancer patient will catch Covid if they get out of the house or mingle with other family members. This has a psychological impact on them and they get easily agitated and aggressive. They often tend to disobey and refuse treatment due to which we have to give extensive counselling to the patient and their family members,” said Dr V P Gangadharan, medical oncologist, VPS Lakeshore Hospital. “Isolation is something that cancer patients have to continuously fight against. Covid has further piled the pressure. But in reality, there is no dramatic difference seen in cancer patients who are Covid infected and other patients. From our experience we know that even patients on chemotherapy who got infected with Covid have recovered. But it is problematic for haematological cancer patients as their immunity is low,” said Aster Medcity oncologist Dr Arun Warrier. What is of worry is that since Covid period, key cancer measures have lagged, with two dropping to their worst ever levels– early detection and timely treatment. There are also increased instances of patients postponing or stopping treatment midway. “Ten to 15 years ago, patients used to reach the hospital in an advanced stage and it was difficult to completely cure them. That changed in the past few years with awareness… But with the pandemic we are again seeing an increase in delayed cancer detection. In addition, in our families no one discusses the distress and psychological concerns of a cancer patient,” said Dr Narayanankutty Warrier, medical director, Cancer Centre & Research Institute, Kozhikode. Dr Aju Mathew, an oncologist at MOSC Medical College Hospital, Kolenchery, said such concerns were slowly reducing and stress levels had come down as more people accept that Covid is here to stay. “They now understand that just like others, vaccinated cancer patients can move around by wearing masks and ensuring social distance,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/covid-deepened-isolation-of-cancer-patients/articleshow/87244176.cms||Preetu Nair

It has roped in Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, a Bengaluru-based non-profit organization, to carry out a slew of measures to motivate employees and improve revenue generation.A tweet from Janaagraha read, “We are delighted to be partnering with Coimbatore corporation for the first ever Municipal Premier League in Coimbatore.

---||Kochi||Many reforms failing to benefit investors||Thiruvananthapuram: Even as the government struggles to improve the state’s investor-friendly image through several business reforms under the ease-of-doing-business (EoDB) initiatives, it has found that several of them are not actually reflected on the field to benefit investors. According to an order issued by the industries department last week, the district development commissioners (DDCs) have been entrusted with the task of liaising with collectors and convene meetings with industry representatives and facilitate resolving the issues. “While the government has initiated several business reforms, the same is not reflected in some of the actions by the district-level functionaries. This has created a wrong perception about the state,” the order said. The government has instructed major department representatives, including local self-government, power, factories and boilers, labour and fire and rescue services to attend the meetings to iron out interdepartmental issues. The DDCs have been asked to ensure that the monthly meetings of the district single-window clearance board take place regularly. The state has been undertaking several measures to improve its position in the EoDB rankings. It stood 28th in the 2019 list of states where launching and running a business was smooth and easy. As on March 1 this year, 15 states, including Kerala, completed the district business reform action plan (DBRAP) as part of EoDB. On completing the reforms, the department of expenditure granted the state permission to borrow Rs 2,261 crore as part of raising funds through open-market borrowings. The government appointed five IAS officers, dividing the 14 districts among them, under the supervision of principal secretary (industries), to ensure that the reforms are implemented effectively. The state has completed 94% of the reforms under the state business reforms action plan (SBRAP) and submitted them to the Centre. More than 75 permits and licences of 21 departments required for launching various businesses are now offered online. Though the DDCs have been receiving additional roles and responsibilities, the lack of statutory powers has raised questions on how effectively they can discharge their responsibilities. It has also been pointed out that the post of DDCs, instead of improving the quality of governance is leading to cross-functionalities, confusion and conflicts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/many-reforms-failing-to-benefit-investors/articleshow/87244183.cms||KP Saikiran

Its first power plant project at Arippara in Kozhikode will be commissioned by CM Pinarayi Vijayan on Nov 6. Cial estimates an annual power generation of 14 million units from the plant and the same will be fed to KSEB’s power grid from November first week. The 4.5MW run-of-river small hydro project (SHP) across Iruvazhinji River was awarded to Cial by state power department as per Kerala Small Hydro Power Policy under Built-Own-Operate-Transfer for a lease period of 30 years. The total project cost is Rs 52 crore and Cial purchased five acres from 32 residents at Arippara. Earlier, works were severely affected during the floods of 2018 and 2019. A lot of additional precautions had to be taken by modifying the designs and building additional retaining structures to ensure safe working conditions for labourers. The construction of a weir across the river, hydro-mechanical and electro-mechanical systems was completed in September despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. The trial run started in October. The powerhouse will generate around 1.08 lakhs unit of power a day during peak flow days and it is estimated that it could be operational at full capacity for 130 days in a year. Cial MD S Suhas said that the project was the company’s biggest one after achieving power neutrality at Kochi airport in 2015. "It was the leadership and guidance of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, as the chairman of Cial that turned out to be decisive to speed up the project. We are sure that this will impart further momentum to set up such hydro projects across the state which has 44 rivers and numerous streams," he said. The SHP works on limited storage of water causing no adverse effect on the environment. Such projects use the natural downward flow of rivers and micro turbine generators to capture the kinetic energy carried by water. "The construction of an overflow-type weir across the river diverts the water to a pool from where the intake structure and connected water conductor system is built. A surge tank was constructed to moderate the flow during load acceptance and load rejection time. The penstock feeds two machines each of 2.25MW capacity. The powerhouse, with horizontal turbines, is installed at the right bank of the river," said a Cial statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cial-to-commission-its-first-hydro-power-project/articleshow/87244188.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

We have already purchased three CT-Scan machines for Rs 1.5 crore, and we will procure another for the SDM Hospital in Ujire. These machines are being procured for the benefit of the rural people.” He added that, in the earlier days, the lack of advanced medical facilities hampered doctors’ abilities to diagnose an illness correctly. “With technology, hospitals are able to save more lives. To help people suffering from renal disorders, we will be donating two dialysis machines to the District Wenlock Hospital in Mangaluru,” Heggade added. The Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala dharmadhikari said that as many as 365 lakes had been rejuvenated across the state under the ‘Namma Ooru, Namma Kere’ initiative of the Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project. “There are plans to clean and revive 120 more lakes in the course of the next year.

It was a year ago that Justice D Krishnakumar, while disposing of a batch of petitions, took serious note of the pendency of lakhs of patta transfer applications for years and issued a slew of directions to the government to dispose of such applications before March 2021. Recently, the additional director of survey and land records submitted a status report filed by the director of survey and settlement before the court. It showed that as on March 31 there are about 1.51 lakh online patta transfer applications not involving sub-division (NISD) pending across the state. That apart, about 6.9 lakh applications were received from April to September. Of the total 8.4 lakh online patta transfer applications, 7.38 lakh were disposed of between April and September and more than a lakh applications are pending as on October 1. Similarly, as many as 6.62 lakh online patta transfer applications involving sub-division (ISD) are pending as on October 1.Justice D Krishnakumar observed that 40,000 patta applications are pending as on December 2020 and fresh applications have also been submitted at the rate of 1.18 lakh a month. Therefore, including the fresh applications, as of now 6,62,330 patta applications are pending before the concerned authorities.The additional director of survey and land records assured that all efforts will be taken by authorities to dispose of all pending applications. He sought three months time to clear the above backlog. He assured that disposal of online patta transfer ISD applications will be continuously reviewed and expedited in order to clear the maximum number with the current manpower. Taking cognizance of the submissions, the judge adjourned the case to October 26 for filing further reports.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-seeks-report-on-steps-to-fill-posts-in-land-records-dept/articleshow/87244739.cms||---

She stated that when she admitted her daughter to the elementary school, she had provided her name as initial to her daughter. Consequently, her name remains her daughter’s initial in all government records including Aadhaar card. She said her daughter also did not want to have her father’s name but her name as initial. The petitioner stated that an examination was conducted at the school for students to avail of government scholarship. However, when her daughter applied to appear for it, the school authorities insisted that she mention her father’s name as initial. When she went to the school and asked the authorities to allow her to write the exam, they insisted that she provide her father’s name as initial, Pothumponnu said. The school authorities also informed her that a similar situation would also arise at the time Kaviya appears for Class X public examination. She said both she and her daughter suffered mental agony due to the stand of the school authorities which denied Kaviya the opportunity to write the exam. She stated that the government scholarship would have been of great benefit to meet her daughter’s education expenses. She said she had submitted a representation to the school education department seeking to permit her to continue using her name as her daughter’s initial, but it is yet to be considered. Hence she had moved the court seeking relief.  Hearing the plea, Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy sought response from the school education department and adjourned the case to October 26.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/woman-moves-hc-for-using-her-name-as-daughters-initial/articleshow/87244742.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The mayor of the Dehradun municipal corporation (DMC), Sunil Uniyal Gama, inaugurated an e-waste management and minimisation campaign this week, which is a joint effort by the DMC, Society of Pollution and Environmental Conservation Scientists (SPECS), Uttarakhand state council of science and technology, and the national mission on Himalayan studies. The aim is to make the city and state e-waste free, said officials. The city currently produces less than two tonnes of electronic waste per year, but officials expect the figure to increase in the future. “We already have 42 specific e-waste bins in the city. Two of our vehicles also work with an NGO that focuses solely on collecting e-waste,” said Kailash Joshi, chief health officer, DMC. The new centres will collect and repair electronics as well. “Seven centres in Vikasnagar, Doiwala, and Sahaspur block are ready and will begin operations in the next few days. Other places in various wards have been identified and will start soon,” said Dr Brijmohan Sharma, secretary, SPECS. Officials also hope to increase employment opportunities with these centres. The staff will receive specialised training and technical support as well. Naveen Sadana, senior manager, Waste Warriors, an environmental NGO, said: “Apart from the door-to-door collection of e-waste, we also have two drop-off centres in Jakhan and Harrawala. Since 2018, we have been working with the DMC for a responsible e-waste collection campaign.” Currently, all e-waste from the city goes to a plant in Haridwar for processing. Officials said discarded electronics can be very easily repaired and reused sometimes. They are also urging the public to be responsible with discarding any e-garbage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/dehradun-launches-e-waste-management-campaign-to-open-51-centres/articleshow/87244193.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

PGI director Prof Jagat Ram presided over the function, which was attended by former director Prof Y K Chawla and former head of the department Prof Kartar Singh. Dr Ajay Kumar, chairman, Dr B L Kapoor Hospital, New Delhi was the guest of honour. Prof Usha Dutta, head of the department said, “The new center has state-of-art equipment for advanced complex endoscopy procedures and a new image C-arm fluoroscopy unit besides Spy Glass Cholangioscopy equipment. The centre will give a major boost to the new domain of third space endoscopy, which includes procedures like per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM).” POEM is an endoscopic procedure used to treat swallowing disorders. A benefit of having an endoscopic procedure, especially for swallowing disorders, is that there are no incisions in the chest or abdomen and minimal or sometimes no hospital stay post-procedure is required. Another addition to the department is a new automated disinfection unit for sterilising endoscopes to overcome the risk of transmission of infection. Dr D N Reddy delivered the first PGI gastroenterology oration. He recounted his journey in endoscopy from his two-year training in PGI to becoming a leading international expert in endoscopy. Dr Rakesh Kochhar, former head of the department gave details about the history of the department since its inception as a division of the department of medicine in 1967, to its special status as a super-specialty department recognised for its services in India and internationally.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pgi-gets-advanced-endoscopy-center/articleshow/87244212.cms||---

The park had been shut due to Covid-19 restrictions but after the residents appealed to chief minister Pramod Sawant during his Dabolim ‘Governance at your Doorstep’ programme, he had ordered opening of the park in view of the improved pandemic situation. However on Sunday to a pointed question from gram sabha member Alka Damle about the poor condition of the park, the sarpanch expressed his helplessness in maintaining the park, claiming that the panchayat has no funds for its upkeep. This angered the residents who expressed shock at the empty coffers of the Chicalim panchayat. Local Cyril Fernandes stated that it is a poor reflection on the affairs of the panchayat even as local MLA Mauvin Godinho is the minister for panchayats in the state cabinet. The sarpanch said he is trying to extend the maintenance contract through Goa Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) which had built the park at a cost of Rs 54 crore. A resident, Roopa Naik appealed to the panchayat to stop issuing fresh licences for multi-unit projects without improving the sewage infrastructure of the village. Similarly Pratap Mardolkar, another resident, spoke of closure of natural water drains by private builders and sought the panchayat’s intervention to inspect such projects. The sarpanch promised to visit and inspect the area at the earliest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/panchayat-has-no-funds-for-upkeep-of-chicalim-park-sarpanch/articleshow/87245320.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||PGI doc’s invention set to give lease of life to patients||Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: At any given point of time, there are 50 patients in PGI’s emergency and trauma, who are on ambulatory bags as ventilators are not easily available. This leaves attendants with the difficult task of pumping the AMBU bag (Artificial Manual Breathing Unit) round the clock. An innovation by a PGI faculty can change things. Dr Rajeev Chauhan of the department of anaesthesia, PGI has invented a device which pumps the right volume of gases --which is not possible manually--until a ventilator is available. A patent has been applied and the commercial product will be launched soon. The product also won the innovation award during the annual research day award in PGI on Friday. “This device will be helpful for poor patients who seldom get access to ventilators and are often seen pumping AMBU helplessly. This is an affordable health care innovation,” said the director, PGI Prof Jagat Ram. Often, manual ventilation by patients’ attendants is inadequate because of fatigue and lack of knowledge about patient requirements. Improper use of AMBU bags for a prolonged duration further leads to damage of the lungs,” said Dr Rajeev Chauhan. The device is portable. It weighs between two and three kg and can be fitted inside an ambulance. It can work using batteries and DC voltage. Batteries can work between six and eight hours after charging. “When there is any movement of the patient or the circuit breaks, there is an alarm to alert the doctor/attendant,” Dr Chauhan explained. By next month, the device will be used in PGI trauma and emergency and by March next year, it will hit the markets. “We have made five units, which can be used in PGI. To upscale it, we are looking for commercial partners. PGI has given permission for commercial upscale,” said Dr Chauhan. Most common conditions requiring mechanical ventilation are post-surgical treatment, trauma, infectious diseases, maternal and neonatal complications, etc. Majority of these conditions are reversible and may require short duration of mechanical ventilation. AMBU ventilation has also been found to be very helpful in circumstances where short-term respiratory support is needed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pgi-docs-invention-set-to-give-lease-of-life-to-patients/articleshow/87244198.cms||Shimona Kanwar

However, the court converted the claim made under Motor Vehicles Act to that under Workmen’s Compensation Act. The incident happened on May 25, 1992, on a private bus plying between Aruppukottai and Rajapalayam when the driver and the conductor permitted some passengers to carry unlicensed explosives on the bus. Years after the tragedy, in 2004, Nainar’s family members petitioned the Srivilliputhur MACT seeking compensation. The tribunal in 2010 termed the accident an “Act of God”. Since the deceased was working as driver and the bus was insured, it directed the insurance company to pay Rs 1,32,800 as compensation to his family members. The insurance company filed the present appeal before HC Madurai bench in 2011 challenging the order.The insurance company submitted through its counsel that the accident had occurred only due to the negligent act of the deceased driver and conductor, who permitted passengers to carry explosive substances. He said the claimants cannot maintain the claim under Motor Vehicles Act and their remedy is available before the Workmen’s Compensation Act. However, the tribunal wrongly awarded compensation under Motor Vehicles Act.Justice V Bharathidasan agreed with the insurance company’s contention that the claim petition under MV Act is not maintainable and the remedy is available only under Workmen’s Compensation Act. However, the judge observed that the claim was made in 2004 and the tribunal had awarded only a meagre compensation of Rs 1,32,800. Considering the fact that all the other claims were processed and compensation paid, the claimants need not be driven to file a fresh claim under the Workmen’s Compensation Act at this distant point of time. Hence the judge converted the claim as one made under Workmen’s Compensation Act and confirmed the compensation awarded by the tribunal. Taking into account the fair compensation awarded by the tribunal, the judge dismissed the appeal preferred by the insurance company.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-upholds-relief-for-driver-killed-in-bus-fire/articleshow/87244740.cms||Kaushik Kannan

While for Class IX to XII, social distancing was not much of a concern as schools could use classrooms used for lower class students as well, now with the increase in strength, it is going to be a challenge. “We didn’t have much of an issue when it came to Class IX to XII and got used to having classes on a rotational basis after a while. But now, reopening for all classes is going to be a challenge and can happen only in a phased manner. This will mainly be an issue for higher secondary schools, which have a high strength of students,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school. Schools were also hoping to make the most of using school grounds for a few classes and have classes outdoors provided there is no rain. “Most schools will have to hold classes only on alternate days or three or four days per week only since there will be more students on campus now. We will have to let a few of the classes come to school on one day and other classes on the next day. Schools are also not likely to open for all classes on November 1. It will be a challenge to implement SOPs but children at least need to get back to school for some time,” said Senthilnathan M, president, Private Schools Correspondents’ Confederation. Further, schools are also unsure of the working hours for different classes as online classes too cannot continue through the day. K Sridevi, a parent of two children who study in Class IV and Class VII, hopes that their school has some uniformity in holding classes. “It will be really difficult for working parents if schools keep classes at their whim for half-day for few classes and whole day for some classes. At least if classes are held throughout the day on alternate days, it will be better. Schools have to consider logistics too,” she added. Meanwhile, there are also concerns from parents on how far schools will properly maintain social distance on the campus.  “We saw many schools have all students from Class IX to XII come to school as there were classrooms to spare. However, now, they cannot do the same as now they will not have enough room. The health, revenue and school education department officials must monitor schools to keep them in check,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/schools-grapple-with-reopening-challenge/articleshow/87253555.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Meanwhile, as rain lashed the city on Sunday, shoppers and street vendors found it difficult to get cover and crowded on the sides of the roads. Even as number of fresh Covid-19 cases continues to be below 20 in the district, the massive crowds raise concern with many not wearing masks properly.The Vilakkuthoon junction connecting East Masi Street and South Masi Street is almost always crowded during the festival season, housing many textile showrooms. “ Even last year when cases were more than this year, there were huge crowds. In such a situation, we cannot expect any social distancing. At least masks must be worn properly,” said N Muthukrishnan, salesperson at a small textile shop on South Masi Street.Even as social distancing is expected to be maintained inside shops and showrooms, shoppers crowd despite efforts of salespersons. “It is absolute chaos inside some of the more popular shops. Though they say that safety measures are followed, it is not so strictly enforced. Many pull the mask down or remove it as they feel sweaty,” said K Anitha, a shopper. Another shopper, S Vinoth Kumar said that few textile shops also allowed those not wearing masks to enter and also did not check customers with thermal scanners or even have hand sanitisers available. Meanwhile, Madurai Corporation health officials said that they have instructed shop owners to properly follow Covid-19 safety norms. “We have an enforcement team for ensuring Covid-19 safety norms are followed,” said a health official.Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said that 12 teams are in place for monitoring of Covid-19 safety norms in shopping hubs and for inspection and taking penal action if any violation is found.

The late passenger Salim Sabuwala’s nephew Faisal Qadri too was present in court. He has alleged that the matter is purposely delayed citing some or the other reason. The police said there was a delay due to Covid. On Thursday, Gadkar’s advocate Dimple Shah sought adjournment and said her senior advocate from Delhi has to argue on behalf of Gadkar and sought permission to advance arguments through video-conferencing. Additional sessions judge Uday Padwad adjourned the matter for November 27. The court stated: “It is made clear that the learned counsel may advance arguments through video-conferencing, however, subject to availability of the network. He may also submit written arguments ... instead of advancing oral arguments.” The court said there shall be no further adjournments. “It is also made clear that no further adjournments shall be granted for any reasons since the matter is very old. If the learned senior advocate is not available, the accused can make alternate arrangements. In case no arguments are advanced from the accused side the matter shall be posted for order.” Advocate Shah, Gadkar and special public prosecutor Jaisingh Desai were present. No police officers were present. When the judge stated that the matter was adjourned to “27”, Faisal raised his hands in the court and sought clarification from the judge as to “which 27”, whether October or November. The judge asked him who he was, and when he introduced himself as a relative of the deceased who was concerned for justice, the judge replied that the matter was adjourned to November 27.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-final-arguments-on-nov-27-for-charge-framing-in-gadkar-case/articleshow/87245596.cms||Ahmed Ali

The garden is the country’s biggest such facility, forest officials claimed. The project has been developed by the research wing of Uttarakhand forest department with Centre's compensatory afforestation (CAMPA) funds. The idea is to conserve, promote research of and create awareness around various aromatic species, officials said. “The aroma industry has huge scope. Villagers can look forward to a promising livelihood from nurturing these plants. Also, it will prevent these species from dying out. In the coming years, the garden will be spread to 113 acres,” said Veena Rao, aroma plant consultant from Maharashtra, who inaugurated the garden on Sunday. Work on the garden started in 2018, forest officials involved in the project said. They added that aromatic species from all over the country were brought to Nainital and conserved here, like Chandan from South India, Agarwood from North East, Kewada from coastal regions and Parijat from Terai zone. The garden has a total of eight sections. One is just for plants with aromatic leaves, like Rosemary, Mint, Lemon Balm, etc. Another has species with aromatic barks like Chandan, Prijat and Nagalingam. There is an aromatic rhizome (underground stem) section with aama haldi and kali haldi plants and an aromatic seeds section with Timur, Kasturi Bhindi (Ambrette) and Black cardamom. The aromatic grass section has Java, Khas and Lemon plants while the aromatic bulbs section has Red Ginger (also called Pink Cone Ginger) and sand ginger plants. The aromatic roots section has Patharchur and Vach plants. A Tusli Vatika inside the garden has around 20 different species – including Rama Tulsi, Shyama Tulsi, Kapoor Tusli as well as variants that grow in Africa, Thailand and Italy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/indias-biggest-aromatic-garden-spread-over-3-acres-opens-in-nainital/articleshow/87244224.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Rs 1.7 crore revenue loss for urban local bodies last year||Thiruvananthapuram: Decision to reopen film theatres is a great financial relief to the urban civic bodies in the district. In the past one year, urban local bodies in the district suffered a loss of around Rs 1.7 crore due to the closure of theatres as a result of lockdown restrictions. According to figures presented at the ongoing assembly session, the city corporation’s loss from closure of theatres was Rs 78.54 lakhs in the last one year. Varkala municipality is another urban local body in the district which recorded a major loss of Rs 73 lakhs. The estimated loss of corporation in terms of entertainment tax presented in the assembly, however, is way lower than the average returns earned by the corporation from theatres. On an average, the corporation used to collect Rs 5-7 crore annually as entertainment tax. The finance standing committee had earlier cited that the corporation collected Rs 5.09 crore as entertainment tax during 2014-15, Rs 7.63 crore during 2015-16 and 8.54 crore for 2016-17. The finance standing committee had set a target of Rs 10.5 crore for 2017-18 in its budget as entertainment tax, however, with GST coming into effect the target could not be met. Until the introduction of GST, the corporation collected entertainment tax from 25 theatres in the city, of which around 20 screens played shows with tickets priced at Rs 101; the lowest price was Rs 24 for a theatre and less than six screens had price range of above Rs 100 for tickets. Of the ticket price of Rs 101, the price of administration was Rs 78.4, the entertainment tax was Rs 19.6 and the remaining sum; Rs 2 was collected as service charge and Rs 3 as cultural cess. Earlier the corporation collected 25% entertainment tax on movie tickets regardless of any slab. In 2019, the city corporation had resumed collection of entertainment tax from theatres in the city. The revenue wing had identified 39 screens in the city and it was communicated that entertainment tax will have to be paid in proportion to the GST amount. The state government had cancelled collection of entertainment tax from July 1, 2017, with the imposition of GST. Later in June 2019, the government decided to impose 10% entertainment tax to reduce the quantum of loss borne by the local bodies and citing that GST on cinema tickets was reduced from 28% to 18%. This order was revised in September 2019 by which local bodies were directed to levy 5% entertainment tax for tickets priced below Rs 100 and 8.5% entertainment tax for tickets priced above Rs 100. The revised entertainment tax was being collected from September 1, 2019, until the Covid pandemic struck the world forcing shutdown of theatres.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/rs-1-7-crore-revenue-loss-for-urban-local-bodies-last-year/articleshow/87230307.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The PGI director said, “At the end of your term, there will be a great transformation in your outlook and perception of dealing with complex situations with ease and you will go out with a big brand name.” The welcome address was followed by dinner with students. They had an opportunity to interact freely with their faculty members, which otherwise is not possible during their busy postings in clinics, emergencies, OPDs and operation theatres. PGI authorities felt that such social interactions with students would be organised more frequently at the institute and departmental levels, which would act as a great stress buster for overworked students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pgi-welcomes-new-students/articleshow/87244222.cms||---

For, an official at a Covid control room said the number is based on data from the previous census and that the actual figure may differ. Going by statistics, sources state that Uttarakhand has 77.3 lakh people above the age of 18 (who are eligible for vaccination). This includes 3 lakh healthcare and frontline workers in the state. The highest population concentration is in Haridwar (15.7 lakh) and Dehradun (14.3 lakh) districts. Disputing state government’s claims that the entire adult population has been vaccinated, Anoop Nautiyal, founder, social development for communities foundation, said, “There are discrepancies in the figures. The latest Covid bulletin shows that 74.48 lakh people in the state have been partially vaccinated, including healthcare and frontline workers, while the state population has been approximated at 77 lakh.” Experts have questioned the basis on which government is making such claims. Meanwhile, when TOI spoke to with healthcare workers at vaccination centres, they said people were still turning up for their first jab. “Earlier, the number of doses administered daily was 400 and now it has come down to 100-150. Most beneficiaries are coming for the second dose, with a few showing up for getting their first vaccine shot. There are definitely people out there who are yet to be vaccinated,” said a health department official at Gandhi Shatabdi hospital. A section of people in the city is still hesitant to get the jab. “We have done fine in the past year and a half by exercising simple precautions. Our family hasn’t been vaccinated and we don’t see any point in taking any unnecessary risk,” said a security guard working in Dalanwala area. Government officials, however, continue to claim that the entire adult population is at least partially inoculated. “The local administrative units have shared the respective data from their individual blocks and tehsils. The difference in figures is accounted by state people who are part of the population but got vaccinated elsewhere or any contraindicated people among other such individuals,” said Dr Tripti Bahaguna, DG, health. State government figures also suggest that 36.28 lakh people are fully-vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhand-govts-100-first-jab-claim-experts-take-it-with-a-pinch-of-salt/articleshow/87244244.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Police registered a case of fraud. Ram Kumar Mittal (58) said his acquaintances Deepak Anand and Sushil Kumar offered to invest together in real estate. They claimed to be co-owners of a house in Sector 12 A. They assured Mittal the property would be directly transferred in his name and showed documents like a registered general power of attorney and the will executed by the owners and allottees of the house by Krishan Gopal Gupta and Shila Gupta in their favour for the first and second floor. Mittal agreed to invest Rs 35 lakh for the first floor and Rs 25 lakh for the second floor and two sale agreements on May 9, 2013, were executed between him and Deepak Anand and Sushil Kumar. When Mittal applied for the transfer of the property, he was asked to wait. When he inquired about the status from the two, they allegedly kept delaying the matter on one pretext or the other. After waiting for a long time, Mittal moved a complaint in 2017 and wrote a letter to Haryana Urban Development Authority (Huda) to know the status of the transfer of the property. The Huda dismissed the application on the basis of power of attorney. The accused assured Mittal of applying for a fresh application to Huda. However, they stopped taking his calls later and revoked their general power of attorney cancellation/revocation on October 3, 2019. Mittal alleged Deepak Anand and Sushil Kumar in connivance with Krishan Gopal Gupta and Shila Gupta duped him.

Chavan said ‘policy chaos’ caused by the BJP-led Centre cost thousands of lives since the pandemic began. Chavan demanded that the Centre have a clear policy on the vaccination programme going forward, especially for the younger population. “Many countries have already started vaccinating the young population. Some have started administering a third booster doses as well. In India, only 30 crore people are fully vaccinated as against countries like China, where 110 crore people are fully vaccinated,” he said. “The ‘policy chaos’ of the central government over vaccination procurement forced the Supreme Court to intervene; the programme then became smoother to some extent. Therefore, we demand that that the Centre have a clear policy on vaccinating those in the 5-18 years age group,” Chavan added. Chavan said the only way to beat the pandemic was to fully vaccinate all citizens and came down heavily on the “self-indulgent” behaviour of the prime minister. “No country in the world except India has the photo of the head of state on the Covid certificate,” said Chavan. Chavan further touched upon other issues, such as rising fuel prices and farmers’ distress over the recent laws passed by the Centre. “The government is paying salaries, pensions and interest on loans through tax collected from petrol and diesel. Few schemes for public are being run using the funds from these taxes,” added Chavan. He said India slipping down the Global Hunger Index was a cause for worry, as the ailing population will further burden the economy. He said India being ranked lower than Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh shows the depth of the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/chavan-slams-centre-for-lives-lost-to-vax-chaos/articleshow/87243055.cms||---

Authorities in Dharwad district are not leaving any stone unturned in their efforts to reach more than one lakh people who are due for the second dose of the Covid jab.Health officials and others have been focusing on people who are due for a second dose of vaccination. Dr SM Honakeri, vaccination nodal officer, stated that more than 1,20,000 people in Dharwad district are due for a second dose of vaccine. “We are making every effort possible, including a personal call to the person who is due for a second dose of vaccine. The number changes on a daily basis, and in addition to new vaccinations, the staff is also working on the people who are due for a second dose,” he said. When contacted, the health staff stated that the majority of people are unaware that they are receiving a second dose due to a lack of proper follow-up. Many people have not received alert messages, and some have left their homes for work. “When we contact them, they say they will get a vaccine after returning to their homes and disconnect the call, and some say they are afraid of pain and fever because they experienced it during the first dose of vaccination; we assure them nothing will happen, but many are hesitant to come for a second jab. Some clearly refuse to take a second dose, claiming that they are no longer afraid of Covid,” they stated.The majority of those due for the second jab come from villages and are primarily from the labour class. According to health department sources, as they left the area, they changed their contact numbers and are having difficulty obtaining a second dose of the vaccine. Until October 24, the district administration administered the first dose of vaccine to 11,87,174 people and the second dose to 5,25,388 people.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/campaign-to-administer-second-dose-intensifies/articleshow/87243050.cms||J Abbas Mulla

However, locals have objected to the location, stating that it is unsuitable and will create problems later. The high court of Bombay at Goa recently took serious note of neglect by a few panchayats in putting up MRF units in their jurisdiction as required under various legislations and rules. The division bench had also stated in its order on September 28 that these panchayats without MRF will not issue any construction licences from the date of the order. Neura panchayat recently carried out a survey at the proposed site – a 500 sqm land parcel offered by the local comunidade. This alerted the villagers, who were irked by the lack of transparency, as they alleged no consultation had been held to clarify issues. “We are objecting to the plant, as the site is near a residential area. Even if it is needed, it should be planned properly and people’s consent should be taken,” Viresh Borkar, a villager stated on social media. Further, the locals alleged that the panchayat is setting up the facility to pave way for mega construction activity. “The site has no proper access,” a local resident said. Ramrao Wagh, a local politician who visited the site said the local residents are concerned about its location in a low-lying area. The sarpanch couldn’t be contacted but a village development committee member allayed fears saying the facility is for sorting dry waste. “We will explain all aspects at the gram sabha on November 7,” the member said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/location-identified-to-set-up-material-recovery-facility-at-neura-kicks-up-row/articleshow/87245331.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||80% of breakthrough infections caused by Delta in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: About 80% of the breakthrough infections detected in Punjab have been caused by highly contagious Delta (B.1.6172), a variant of Covid-19 capable of evading the vaccine-induced immune response. Of about 80 cases of breakthrough infection, reported by patients who have contracted Covid-19 infection again after having been partially or fully vaccinated, 64 have been caused by Delta lineage of the virus. A majority of the cases were mild, and no death has been reported in any breakthrough infection in the state. Genomic sequencing and other studies conducted till mid-October show there is no sign of the virus mutating nor has a new variant emerged. And while infections and even breakthrough infections might occur, they are most likely to be mild and the cases few and far between. The trend in Punjab is in sync with a study done by the Indian Council of Medical Research, in which Delta was found to be behind 86% of the breakthrough infections, pointing at the need for people to continue following the Covid appropriate behaviour even after getting jabbed. Covid vaccines have been proved safe and effective. However, they do not provide full protection to everyone, leaving individuals with low immunity vulnerable to getting infected. Punjab has been one of the worst-hit states by the pandemic and accounts for nearly 3.5% of the total variants of concern detected in the country. Nearly 2,400 samples of Punjab examined at Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) have been tested positive for different variants. Of the total, about 1,100 samples are of Delta variant that constitutes about 43% of total variants of concerns found in the state. As the pandemic situation is easing, no new mutation of the virus has been reported in samples of Punjab, much to the relief of the health experts. The last mutation noted in the state was of Delta Plus (AY.1) variant. Highlighting the importance of Covid appropriate behaviour, Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said that people should rigorously follow safety norms even after getting immunised. “Vaccination and adherence to safety norms is the only way of keeping yourself protected from the deadly virus,” he advised. To improve its vaccination cover, the Punjab government is pressing its employees to get themselves vaccinated. Instructions have been passed by the government, asking employees to get vaccinated. If any government employee fails to be vaccinated for any reason other than medical, necessary disciplinary action may be initiated against them. The issue was also taken up in a review meeting chaired by the chief minister. Punjab deputy chief minister O P Soni said they want everyone to get vaccinated and government employees have been asked to get inoculated at the earliest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/80-of-breakthrough-infections-caused-by-delta-in-punjab/articleshow/87244787.cms||Vinod Kumar

Experts and government pollution watchdogs have for long warned against the rising particulate matter PM2.5. But few have deciphered the nature of particles that make up the smoke. Recently, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, and a few other institutions released a report on the substances that remained suspended in Ahmedabad’s air after the Diwali night in 2018-19. The researchers showed that potassium content increased 15.3 times after Diwali over the previous day. Magnesium compound particles went up 10 times, manganese content shot up 6 times, while lead and sodium content surged 4 times. The study was conducted by IITM’s Latha Radhadevi, Vrinda Anand, Nikhil Korhale, Pramod Kori, and Murthy Bandaru. The study covered Delhi, Pune, and Mumbai too. Ahmedabad had the second highest average PM2.5 concentration on Diwali day with the Rakhial station topping the charts at 353 microgram per cubic metre. GIFT City saw the least concentration, 89 microgram per cubic metre.  Unlike in other cities, in Ahmedabad, most stations showed peak values in close range, the study said. The study covered 1,050 square kilometre area.  The study also observed that the PM10 (dust level) difference between Diwali and pre-Diwali day was 1,407 microgram per cubic metre, while the difference was 746 microgram per cubic metre for PM2.5 particulate pollution. “Pune comes third with the Pashan station having PM2.5 at 67 microgram per cubic metre and Hadapsar at 257 microgram per cubic metre as Diwali day peaks which are minimum and maximum respectively in the range,” the study said. It added, “It was seen that PM2.5 and PM10 in Delhi increased by 353% and 213% respectively.” In Pune and Ahmedabad, the enhancement in PM2.5 was half of that of Delhi while the effect in Mumbai was just one-seventh of Pune, where variation is atypical to other cities, the research said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/what-festive-skies-cough-out/articleshow/87244842.cms||Paul John

Municipal officials are already worried whether there will be repeat of the 2019 dengue outbreak along with a large surge in chikungunya cases when compared to the first witnessed in 2006. TOI collated details from at least two affidavits filed by the AMC before the high court after 2006. One can already see a dramatic jump in dengue and chikungunya cases but an equally dramatic fall in malaria and falciparum cases in the city. The affidavits claim how malaria cases, spread by female anopheles mosquito, since 2012 have seen a dramatic decline — from 15,904 cases to 618 in 2020. On the flip side, chikungunya cases have risen from 82 in 2006 to 923 in 2020. Similar is the case with dengue which saw rise from 146 cases in 2006 to 1,962 till October this year. Both dengue and chikungunya is spread through the Aedes aegypti mosquito. “We have seen a consistent decline in malaria cases since 2010 when the strategies to tackle anopheles mosquitoes and the plasmodium parasite changed. In dengue and chikungunya we are dealing with the virus that gets transmitted via Aedes aegypti mosquitoes,” says a senior AMC health official.  A former AMC officer and an entomologist said that the gestation period of the malarial plasmodium parasite is 10 to 12 days while in cases of dengue and chikungunya, the gestation period is 3 to 7 days which is far less time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/big-rise-in-chikungunya-dengue-cases-this-year/articleshow/87244838.cms||Paul John

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2 IIT researchers file PIL against Powai cycle track||MUMBAI: Two PhD students at IIT Powai have filed a public interest litigation (PIL) before Bombay high court to challenge the construction of a cycle track at the lake, stating that it is flouting the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules.  Almost 5,000 people have lent their support to an online signature campaign for the cause. The PIL is listed for hearing on Monday. Omkar Supekar (27) and Abhishek Tripathi (28), researchers on environmental ethics and chemistry at IIT Bombay, seek the intervention of the HC for directions to restore the Powai lake till such time information “in its entirety” about the cycle track project is made public and right to information (RTI) queries are answered. They are also seeking directions so that authorities produce the de-notification and survey report permitting the reclamation for the project. The students said representations and RTI applications submitted by Supekar are not yet answered by the BMC, revenue or forest departments, Maharashtra pollution control board, state environment department and the state wetland authority. The PIL seeks directions to authorities to create an online public forum for dissemination of information on wetlands, along with timely reports on proposed projects. The forum should also allow for public grievances, it said. The students also want the HC to “acknowledge the scientific findings that by proper cleaning and regular physico-chemical analysis,’’ it is possible to get potable drinking water from Powai lake that would meet some of the rising needs of Mumbai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-2-iit-researchers-file-pil-against-powai-cycle-track/articleshow/87245604.cms||Swati Deshpande

Mind your sleep hygiene||AHMEDABAD: If you have a hard time jostling with your sleep schedule, you may have tried everything under the moon to help you get that uninterrupted restorative sleep at night. You may be missing something — a sleep hygiene — that does not mean a good bath before you go to bed! A strong sleep hygiene means having both a bedroom environment and daily routines that promote consistent, uninterrupted sleep. Recently, researchers at department of community medicine of BJ Medical College, Ahmedabad interviewed 208 individuals as to whether they get their share of proper sleep. At least 27.9% respondents claimed that they very frequently experienced sleeplessness, while 51.4 % respondents had felt sleepy and tired on at least 2 days in a week. Also 57.2% respondents said that they slept for 5-7 hours. But how did one put oneself to sleep. About 55% respondents claimed they read books, magazines in bed , while 78% said that they needed quiet to grab a nap. “About 47.9% respondents strongly agreed that sleep was very important to them and that it largely impacted their health and work lives,” the study by senior resident doctor BJ medical college Dr Dhaval Parekh, Vedanti Dave and Tattvam Shah claimed. The study also highlighted certain coping mechanisms to deal with sleeplessness. About 37.8 % respondents said they avoided using bright screens and gadgets at least 2-3 hours before bedtime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/insomnia-mind-your-sleep-hygiene/articleshow/87244831.cms||---

In his complaint, victim's brother Shashidhar Shankreppa Nimbaragi stated that his elder brother Ravi Shankreppa Nimbaragi, 32, had been in love with a 24 year old girl from a specific community for 4-5 years. "Irked by their affair, the girl's family members murdered Ravi on Thursday night and dumped his body in an abandoned well," he added said. While Almel police stated that no arrests have been made in this regard, superintendent of police HD Anand Kumar said that two people have been arrested but their names cannot be revealed. "We won't be able to share details until the investigation is completed," he added. Despite the fact that the complainant has named eight people as accused, the SP stated that no further information can be shared at this time. The SP also clarified that the youth was murdered by another family, so it was not an act of honour killing. "If family members murder their own daughter or son, we can call it an act of honour killing. In this case, the girl's family has murdered the youth," he said. A case has been filed under IPC sections 143, 147, 302, 201, and 149.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/2-arrested-in-connection-with-youths-murder/articleshow/87243071.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

---||Ahmedabad||Stepwells climb to revival with ‘girl power’||AHMEDABAD: What started as an initiative to nudge the local community to take ownership of built heritage in Gandhinagar district, has now become a sustainable effort in conservation at Ambapur and Uvarsad, 12km and 7km respectively from state capital Gandhinagar. The centuries old stepwells are alive with cultural activities as locals celebrate birthdays of their daughters at these monuments. Kapil Thakar, a trustee of Atulya Varso NGO, said that about three years ago, they had visited the stepwells and found them in dilapidated condition. “The monuments, not part of any conservation list of the state or the Centre, were open to natural wear and tear and had also become places where even locals won’t venture. With the help of local volunteers, we first started cleaning these monuments and created awareness about their historic value. I celebrated my daughter’s birthday at the 15th century Ambapur stepwell and had decked up the stepwell. The idea caught on,” he said. Alpesh Patel, a resident of Uvarsad, said that after the initiative, many locals organized birthday events for their daughters at the 18th century stepwell. Why daughters? “Traditionally, stepwells are associated with Shakti, the feminine form of Almighty and often one would find a small shrine dedicated to Mataji. Girls being part of the same energy, it celebrated both girl children and Shakti,” he said. “The events also generated some income for musicians, nearby shop owners and others. Thus, the community now takes care of the monument.” Due to the efforts of the locals, Uvarsad is also getting a small interpretation centre near the stepwell giving a glimpse of important stepwells of Gujarat from the grant of the Government of Gujarat. The stepwell is currently under repair after representation to the state government. Nirav Panchal, a heritage lover from Ahmedabad who celebrated his daughter’s birthday at Uvarsad stepwell, said that heritage conservation often needs an out-of-the-box approach. “Biggest challenge for any group involved in conservation is to involve locals. We might go to monuments once a year and clean it and be happy about it. But what about the other 364 days? The locals must take ownership. The idea of connecting stepwells with the Shakti and daughters is to give that much-needed connection,” he said. Panchal added that even in Ahmedabad and vicinity, there are several examples where locals simply filled up the stepwells considering it a ‘hazard.’ Thakar said that heritage ownership must be with the local community to make it sustainable. “Without context, we are slowly losing our heritage to the rapid pace of development. We must not only revive the old monuments with its utility for locals, but also connect it with the tourism circuit to make it sustainable,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/stepwells-climb-to-revival-with-girl-power/articleshow/87244804.cms||Parth Shastri

Rai claimed that Delhiites want a change in the municipal corporations in the upcoming elections. “Bharatiya Janata Party has given three gifts of garbage to the national capital, which are standing on the borders of Delhi. To clear it, a deadline is presented again and again. In the same way, those deadlines are moved forward again and again,” he said in a press conference, adding that the “deadline of BJP’s farewell from the corporations will come even before the deadline for cleaning the garbage is over.” The minister said that AAP organised 2,532 mohalla meetings across the city between September 1 and October 20 under ‘Aapka MLA Aapke Dwar’ programme. Now, the party is making an action plan on the basis of the preliminary reports of these sabhas. Rai said that there has not been any sabha in which people have not raised the issue of garbage. He said that BJP has proved to be a complete failure in disposing its responsibility of sanitation under the MCD. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that Rai is free to make political claims, but time will tell who wins the municipal elections. “Delhiites are fed up of the allegation politics of AAP functionaries, people have seen how Kejriwal government failed them during Covid-19 phase. Meanwhile, BJP’s central government has not only provided medical aid in the pandemic but has also ensured free Covid vaccination for 2 crore people in the capital,” Kapoor said, claiming AAP MLAs were missing during the pandemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-led-corpns-failed-to-keep-capital-clean-claims-aap/articleshow/87244817.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||I-T raids on onion traders in Nashik yield Rs 24 crore in cash||NAGPUR: Income tax (I-T) raids on 10 onion traders of Pimpalgaon in Nashik district that began on Thursday led to seizure of over Rs 24 crore, pegged to be the biggest haul in recent times in the state, said sources. Officials also claimed to have detected unaccounted income of Rs 100 crore, of which traders admitted to concealment of Rs 50 crore. This means the traders may be paying tax on the disclosed amount, while further assessment will continue for the remaining. The action comes under the office of income tax department principal director (investigation) at Nagpur. The raids are also reported to led to a drop in onion prices. The action began on Thursday and since then, onion prices have dipped by Rs10, touching Rs30 a kg. This is because traders began offloading the stock allegedly hoarded to be sold at a later date. Traders said fresh arrivals in the market have also impacted the rates. The action by taxmen has also exposed certain practices by traders which resulted in farmers getting lower rates for their produce, but making onions costlier for consumers. Payment for purchase of agricultural commodities like onions can be made in cash. Taking advantage of this, traders were allegedly found showing huge amounts of cash paid towards onion purchases in their books. With large payments shown against individual farmers’ names, it did not lead to any tax liability. This is because agricultural income is exempt from tax. However, the farmers actually got a smaller amount in hand. Showing purchases at higher rates in the books only helped traders reduce their tax liability. Here is an example of how it worked. A farmer was paid Rs10/kg in cash for the produce. This was the rate for the grower. But in the books, the amount was inflated to, say, Rs30/kg. So finally, if the onions were sold further at Rs35/kg, the profit on record would be Rs5/kg. But the profit was much higher, and not disclosed. Taxmen are learnt to have come across evidence of real estate purchases through unaccounted income. Dealings were spread over more than a year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-i-t-raids-on-onion-traders-in-nashik-yield-rs-24-crore-in-cash/articleshow/87245617.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Bikers snatch gold chain from 65-year-old in Salt Lake||KOLKATA: A 65-year-old morning walker in Salt Lake was robbed of her gold chain on Sunday by two men on bike while she was out on morning walk near her home at EE Block around 7.30 am. Police said Zakia Rahman had fallen on the road and also hurt herself when the miscreants tugged at her chain and dupatta wrapped around her neck. The woman screamed in pain and fear and even as fellow morning walkers came running towards her after being alerted, the bikers managed to flee. None could also notice the bike’s registration number, said a source. “I was walking along the road when the two men on bike suddenly slowed down near me and tugged at my chain along with the dupatta. They even tore apart my mask as they sped towards the canal side road,” Rahman said. Rahman has told cops that the two men were not wearing any mask or helmet. Both of them looked young, skinny and dark-complexioned, she has told cops, describing the miscreants. The woman’s husband, Badi-Ur-Rahman, a retired professor with Calcutta University said the woman had even fallen sick after she returned home and was visibly shaken with the suddenness of the incident. “We have lodged a complaint with Bidhannagar North police station immediately after the incident,” he said. Partha Chakraborty, a local resident who lives near the woman’s house said the entire neighbourhood has been left shocked with the incident. “The fact that the snatchers are daring to loot residents right outside their home inside the block lanes is seriously concerning. Since our block is located so close to Karunamoyee crossing and has multiple entry, exit points, it has probably turned out to be an advantage for the criminals. Police should enhance patrolling in this area to prevent any further repeat of such crimes,” said Chakraborty. Cops probing the case said they were checking the CCTV footage of the area and trying their best to nab the miscreants based on available electronic evidence and physical description of the accused persons provided by the victim. A senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate said: “We are probing the case. We are working on some leads and hopefully we will arrest the miscreants soon.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bikers-snatch-gold-chain-from-65-yr-old-in-salt-lake/articleshow/87244291.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Kankulia accused stays off grid; uses cash, avoids phone||Kolkata: The Kankulia double-murder prime accused, Vicky Haldar, has already spent eight days on the run, managing to dodge sleuths by using cash and not using his cellphone. Police say his luck will run out when the cash dries up. Two of his aides who were with him during the crime also continue to evade police.A Class X dropout who speaks fluent English, Hindi and Bengali, Vicky is believed to be using the remote terrain in South 24 Parganas to his advantage, shifting and changing his hideouts without leaving a trail. He may have changed his hideout at least five times in the last eight days and snuck out before investigators reached the spots. The only clear image investigators have is of Vicky and his aide stepping into the Kankulia house the day the murders took place.Lodged in Diamond Harbour prison for attempting to kill his father when he refused to sell the family property and give him Rs 25 lakh, Vicky, police sources said, believed he could make money off the Kankulia property even though he couldn’t match Subir Chaki’s Rs 1.5 crore demand. When he realised he couldn’t buy the property, he schemed to extract money from Chaki on the pretext of finding him the right buyers.Unlike his mother Mithu, who is now in police custody, Vicky’s father — and relatives — had sold off their Diamond Harbour holdings to settle on Jagannath Ghosh Road at Kasba. It was late last year when Vicky took his father to meet Chaki to scale down the asking price for Kankulia property. Chaki wasn’t willing to lower it, sources said. Vicky then demanded Rs 25 lakh from his father, with his mother promising him another Rs 10 lakh. His father’s refusal led to the attempt on his life which landed both Vicky and Mithu in prison. For all his suave clothes and flashy talk, sources said Vicky didn’t have much money. “Whenever we asked him about a month’s unpaid rent, he would claim he was up to something big and would buy bigger houses,” Purnima Halder, the landlady, told cops.With deep contacts among the construction workers of South 24 Parganas, Vicky had also briefly been part of the syndicate business in the Kasba area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kankulia-accused-stays-off-grid-uses-cash-avoids-phone/articleshow/87244283.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

An Afghan Muslim married to an Indian woman told TOI on Sunday evening that: "A few organisations and politicians are spreading fake news of atrocities being committed on the Afghan Hindus and Sikhs along with the Indian Muslims stranded in Afghanistan. This will do us more harm than good." Quoting Taliban, there are reports that they have warned the Afghan Hindus and Sikhs to convert to Sunni Islam or leave the county. The Afghan national who wished to hide his name for obvious reasons said: "On October 15, we kept waiting outside the Kabul airport for evacuation but couldn’t enter the complex for want of certain travel documents. We waited for almost an entire day. The Taliban knew about it. If they wanted to do any harm, they could have done so. We have security concerns in Afghanistan, no doubt, but not the kind being made out." An Afghan Hindu who runs a shop in Kabul said: "Some people allegedly bought their freedom by spreading fake news about us." The chief commercial officer of a travel and logistics company had written to external affairs ministry’s joint secretary J P Singh for landing permission in Delhi. The source said: "Our visas have expired but we need to travel back to India, so we expect the Indian government to give us some concession, given the exigency of the situation."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/dont-spread-fake-news-about-us-say-afghan-hindus-sikhs/articleshow/87244823.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Rough ride through haze of dust on VIP Road as patchwork wears off||KOLKATA: Large stretches of VIP Road — especially the airport-bound flank — are riddled with large potholes and covered in a haze of dust since the shoddy patchwork repairs undertaken before Durga Puja have started to wear off. Motorists complain that uneven roads, coupled with the dust rising from the surface whenever a truck or bus passes over a brick-laid patched up stretch, make commuting painful and accident prone. Additionally, Metro work has reached Kaikhali and has blocked a portion of the thoroughfare. Dust covers a part of VIP Road in the wake of large vehicles“First it was the rain and then the Pujas. I wonder what excuse the authorities have for the sorry condition of the road now. Parts of VIP Road look worse than a village road, especially when I am forced to ride behind a truck or a bus through a haze of dust,” said Utpal Malakar, a resident of Maniktala who commutes on a bike. On Friday, TOI drove through the thoroughfare and found multiple stretches, including in Dum Dum Park, Bangur Avenue, Haldirams and Kaikhali, in a poor condition. At Dum Dum Park, multiple small and large potholes dot the road and bikers have to swerve to dodge them. Larger vehicles bump along the uneven surface. “Just a month ago, I had to repair my car after water seeped in when this entire stretch was waterlogged. Now that there is no rain and waterlogging, the poor condition of the road will ensure I need to send my car to the service centre again,” said Rahul Agarwal, a businessman who drives regularly between Lake Town and Madhyamgram. Craters have also formed on a stretch near the Haldirams-Chinar Park intersection. Officers of Bidhannagar traffic police said they had stressed on placing bricks on the main thoroughfare during monsoon as the worn out roads had made traffic movement a nightmare. “The move had worked then, but now that the rain has finally ceased, its high time the authorities carry out proper repair of the stretch to ensure a smooth travel experience for motorists,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar traffic police. A senior PWD official said a tender has been drawn for the thorough repair of VIP Road with mechanised mastic and work is set to start soon. “VIP Road will undergo a thorough reconstruction very soon with mechanised mastic. We are waiting for the equipment to arrive from Germany,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rough-ride-through-haze-of-dust-on-vip-rd-as-patchwork-wears-off/articleshow/87244295.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Gusty winds at the speed of 30-50 kmph were recorded at Palam around 7pm. Track the pollution level in your cityHowever, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that no further intense spell is likely over Delhi from Monday. According to IMD, Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station, recorded moderate rain of 27mm on Sunday. It received 0.6mm rainfall till 5.30 pm and 26.4mm between 5.30 pm and 8.30 pm. Palam recorded 4.9mm rainfall till 8.30 pm. Apart from rain, a hailstorm occurred at a few places in the city between 4 pm and 6 pm. Delhi Traffic Police tweeted that the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road in south Delhi was closed due to waterlogging at Pul Prahladpur underpass. “Due to waterlogging at Pul Prahladpur underpass, MB road is closed. Please avoid this route. Kindly take alternate route MB Road-Maa Anandmai Marg towards Badarpur (sic),” it tweeted. Other places from where waterlogging was reported included Kirari, Rohtak Road, and Nangloi, civic officials said. RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, said, “Rain, lightning and thunderstorm were reported under the influence of a western disturbance. However, the weather is likely to remain dry from Monday as no major western disturbance is expected to impact the region in the next seven days.” After Sunday’s rain till 8.30 pm, Safdarjung has reported 119mm rainfall so far in October. The city had recorded the wettest October day in 65 years after Safdarjung received heavy rainfall of 87.9mm on October 18. The city had beaten the 1960 record of 93.4 mm rainfall on October 18, but it is quite far from the all-time record of October. In 1956, October received the highest rainfall of 238.3mm. On Sunday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 31.5 degrees Celsius whereas the minimum temperature was 19 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal. IMD has forecast that the minimum temperature is likely to touch 16 degrees Celsius on October 27 and may dip further to 15 degrees Celsius by October 29. Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said, “The wind direction is expected to change in 24 to 48 hours. After the change, icy cold winds from snow-capped mountains are likely to cause a dip in the night temperature of Delhi.” Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the ‘moderate’ category with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 160. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the moderate category. In presence of local dry weather and southwesterly wind, local dust emission will enhance PM10. Additional dust input from desert areas via transport is very likely. Stubble burning fire count, as per the SAFAR model, is 735 and its share in PM2.5 is 2%. Impact of fire emission will be low as wind is mainly from the south-westerly direction. With a change in the wind direction from southwesterly to northwesterly, AQI may degrade. Due to scattered rainfall, AQI will improve slightly over the next 24 hours and, then, again degrade to moderate.” With agency inputs||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/rain-hailstorm-keep-delhi-air-breathable/articleshow/87244844.cms||---

Top leaders of the TRS, BJP and Congress, who are not voters of Huzurabad assembly segment in Telangana, have been camping in the constituency for the last three months. They have been personally monitoring and implementing strategies and participating in campaigns. All such non-local leaders will have to leave Huzurabad constituency by Wednesday evening, ahead of the bypoll to the constituency on Saturday. Sources said the think-tanks of the three parties have started making strategies to maintain the connection with the voters through their local leaders until the polling is over. “If the campaigning in the last few months was important, the last 72-hours before the polling are even more crucial for the three parties to win the elections. The local leaders and sleeper cells will get activated and their role in alleged distribution of money, liquor and other freebies would have a lot of impact on the poll prospects of the candidates in the fray,” said a political observer. The chief electoral officer Shashank Goel told TOI that the ECI, keeping in view the Covid-19 situation in the country, has laid down the new guideline that campaign through loudspeakers, road shows and public meetings will come to an end 72 hours before the polling as against the 48-hour earlier norm. The election authorities will strictly implement the norm. “The leaders who are not voters of the constituency have to leave the area by 7pm on Wednesday. However, the local leaders can make door-to-door visits of the voters up to 48 hours before the polling,” Shashank Goel said. Former minister Eatala Rajender told the people on Sunday said all top leaders who are coming from outside the constituency and promising sops, schemes, projects will go away. “Only I will remain here amongst you and only I will deliver the promises made to you by me. They are not going to come back once elections are over,” he said. Finance minister T Harish Rao, who has been spearheading the campaign for the ruling TRS, said Gellu Srinivas Yadav was a local candidate who would continue to work for the welfare of the people of Huzurabad. Also, he promised the people that he would personally visit Huzurabad every month and ensure the implementation of all promises made by him. Even the Congress is depending upon its local leaders to toil hard and ensure victory of party candidate Balmoor Venkat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ec-non-local-netas-to-exit-72-hrs-before-vote/articleshow/87245635.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Delhi||Delhi: DMRC’s plans to join 400km club delayed by a year||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has been working on a war-footing to complete the 12.5km Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor of its Phase-IV project by 2022. It wants to complete 400km of its network before reaching the milestone of 20 years of operations. However, DMRC’s plans to join the coveted 400km club, which includes metro systems of Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Moscow and London, would have to wait until 2023. Mangu Singh, DMRC’s managing director, told TOI that despite their best efforts to complete the corridor by the end of 2022, delays in getting permission to fell trees and some engineering challenges had resulted in pushing the target to October 2023. The Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor might be the smallest among the three approved corridors of DMRC’s Phase-IV project, but it would boast of engineering feats like a “double-deck” viaduct with tracks on the top level and a flyover below, and also DMRC’s first cantilever bridge across the Yamuna. Another engineering challenge would be the first time use of “integrated portals”, which support both the viaduct and a flyover running parallel for nearly half a kilometre. The Integrated “flyover-cum-viaduct structure”, along with a vehicle underpass, is being built near Soorghat in north Delhi in association with Delhi government’s Public Works Department (PWD). The PWD flyover and vehicle underpass are a part of the proposed elevated road along the Yamuna parallel to Ring Road between Wazirabad flyover (Signature Bridge) and DND Flyway. Singh said that work on the double-deck viaduct was going on smoothly, but comparatively newer engineering challenges, apart from permission awaited for tree felling, meant that the corridor would be completed only by 2023. Environmental concerns had also led to more time being taken for construction of two other approved corridors of Phase IV — the nearly 29km Janakpuri West-RK Ashram extension of Magenta Line (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West) and the 20.2km standalone Silver Line (Aerocity-Tughlaqabad). Last year, DMRC had to shift the alignment of Silver Line to steer clear of Qutub Minar following instructions from Archaeological Survey of India. The detour resulted in an addition of 3.4km to the corridor. A total of 5.2km of the corridor falls within the Ridge and DMRC received a final go-ahead from Ridge Management Board in July. The project would result in felling of 1,072 trees. The Janakpuri West-RK Ashram corridor was the first Phase-IV stretch where construction work started in December 2019. In August 2020, the forest department stopped DMRC from continuing work on a 5.3km section between Vikaspuri and Peeragarhi on the ground that it was violating Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The department had said the area was a “deemed forest” and work required prior permission from it. “Wherever the alignment goes into a forested area, there is a different mechanism and it has to go to Supreme Court for final clearance. Though the Janakpuri West-RK Ashram corridor’s alignment doesn’t pass through a forest, the same process is being followed. The Central Empowered Committee examined it and submitted its report to Supreme Court,” said Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/dmrcs-plans-to-join-400km-club-delayed-by-a-year/articleshow/87244861.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Delhi cops search 100 houses, chase four buses before nabbing minor’s rapist||NEW DELHI: In a late-night operation on Saturday, a 20-year-old man was arrested for sexually assaulting a minor in central Delhi’s Ranjeet Nagar. The crime was reported on Friday morning. The child’s father told TOI that she had gone with her friends to a langar. “My daughter returned home carrying some food items. She again went outside to play, but this time she came back after a long time,” he added. “When she started changing her clothes, her mother noticed bloodstains on her clothes. My wife called me after which we took her to a hospital where she told us that an uncle gave her Rs 10, took her to an isolated place on the pretext of purchasing books and sweets and then sexually assaulted her,” said the 32-year-old father. He added that she had talked to him in the morning and said that she was all right. Joint commissioner (central range) Suman Goyal reviewed the case and a team of AATS, special staff and cops from Ranjit Nagar police station was formed to probe the crime. “We also roped in teams from the North district and Crime Branch,” said an officer. The investigators first thought that the accused may be a resident of Ranjit Nagar. “We scanned footage of 100 CCTV cameras and finally located him in one such video. We extracted his photo from the footage and started a manhunt,” the officer said. The teams searched more than 100 houses and factories, but couldn’t find the accused. Photographs of the suspect were shown to hundreds of residents, but no one knew about him. The cops also conducted searches in North and West districts, but got no information. Police then realised that he was not a resident of central Delhi. An informer finally confirmed that the accused was a resident of west Delhi. The team reached his house in Raghubir Nagar, but he had left for Peeragarhi bus stand by then. “We came to know that he was a vendor who sold utensils and also visited Rajasthan for the same purpose,” said police. The team of AATS and special staff (central) reached Peeragarhi bus stand where they came to know that in the last half an hour four buses had left for Rajasthan. The cops started chasing the buses in five vehicles. “We stopped one bus in Bahadurgarh and carried out a thorough search, but he was not in it. The second bus was stopped at Rohtak and the third near a stadium, but to no avail. Finally, he was caught sleeping in the fourth bus that was stopped at Kalanaur. The accused had changed his clothes. The entire effort took us three hours,” said an investigator. DCP (Central) Shweta Chauhan said the accused was identified as Suraj. He was earlier arrested for molesting a child in Khyala. When interrogated for the reason behind committing such an act, he told police, “Mujhe bachche pasand hain (I like children). I’m also obsessed with them.” Suraj further claimed that before targeting the girl, he had tried to lure two more children, but they escaped from his clutches. Police are trying to verify this information. Asked whether he was a paedophile, police said it was too early to say anything. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/cops-search-100-houses-chase-four-buses-before-nabbing-minors-rapist/articleshow/87244851.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Nashik||Nashik: Fewer cyber crime plaints this year||NASHIK: The Nashik police have said that the cases of cheating and online sexual harassment have dropped this year compared to last year. Officials of the cyber crime police station said that the drop has been significant. During the entire last year, the cyber police station had received 104 complaints. This year till September end, the police station has received only 33 complaints. Senior officials attributed the drop to the rising awareness among people as well as lesser dependency on the internet this year compared to last year. Out of the 104 complaints last year, 68 cases were about cheating, 16 of online sexual harassment and others. This year till September-end, 24 of the 33 complaints were about online cheating and one was of sexual harassment. Inspector Mahendra Chavan of the cyber police station said that for most part of last year, people were indoors owing to Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed. Hence, the use of internet had increased tremendously and many people fell prey to the online conmen. “The situation is not so this year. The restrictions this year were for lesser time and not as strict as last year during April, May and even for the next few months until the Diwali festival,” he said. This apart, there is an increasing awareness among people about the precautions that should be taken while being online. All such things seem to have helped in bringing down the cyber crime rate in the city, said Chavan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-fewer-cyber-crime-plaints-this-yr/articleshow/87243134.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The statement is likely to get mired in controversy as the opposition parties have been claiming that their functionaries are being targeted by the central agencies for allegedly being involved in corruption. On Saturday, Sanjaykaka Patil was speaking at a function organised to inaugurate shopping mall at Vita in Sangli district. His words echo Harshvardhan Patil’s recent comment. Harshvardhan Patil, who had joined BJP after leaving Congress, too had said that he gets sound sleep since joining the saffron party as there are no inquiries against him by the central agencies. Sanjaykaka Patil, an MP for the second time, said: “Since I am a BJP MP, the ED will not chase me. We have to show people that we have a lot. However, we avail of bank loans and buy vehicles worth Rs 40 lakh. I am putting out the reality, and have no problem if it is gets recorded. If they see our loan figures, the heads of ED officers will spin. In a lighter vein, Harshvardhan Patil said that he gets sound sleep now. If our loan figures are revealed, even the ED officers will ask, ‘Are these human beings?’” The statement came after someone on the dais pointed out to the MP that the ED will not chase him as he is not a defaulter. The MP, who runs sugar factories, has defaulted on payment to sugar cane farmers and workers of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana had even organised agitations against him. The leaders of the farmers’ outfit had claimed that the factories run by the MP are running in losses and have piled up huge loans. TOI tried to reach the MP over his comments, however, he did not respond to calls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/ed-will-not-chase-me-i-am-a-bjp-mp-sanjaykaka-patil/articleshow/87243137.cms||---

---||Delhi||Exercise of sexual choices does not give partner right to exploit woman: Delhi court||NEW DELHI: A woman exercising sexual autonomy through consent cannot be presumed to have also given consent to violate her reproductive rights, a Delhi court has said while denying bail to a man. The man was accused of raping a woman several times and forcing her to abort her pregnancy. The court further said that the exercise of sexual choices does not vest any corresponding right in the partner to exploit a woman sexually, and she does not forsake her other rights, including reproductive rights, when she enters into a sexual relationship with a partner. “While parties in a consensual relationship may be on an even keel when sexual relations are of a consistent and long duration, the act of contravening reproductive autonomy through multiple pregnancies and abortions takes away the element of consent, which may have been given for the sexual act itself,” said additional sessions judge Vishal Gogne in the order. The court said that this was a “flawed construction” of the concept of bodily/sexual autonomy of a person/female. “The exercise of sexual choices by a woman does not vest any corresponding right in the partner to sexually exploit her. The woman does not forsake her other rights, including reproductive rights either, when she enters into a sexual relationship with a partner,” it added. It further noted that it could certainly be assumed in a prima facie view of the matter that the exploitative conduct of the man in abusing the sexual relationship between the parties did lead to previous pregnancies and has caused the complainant to continue with the present pregnancy in the interest of her health and future conception. “It would indeed be a decision of immense difficulty for a young woman to go ahead with pregnancy as a single mother, especially when the child has been fathered by a person she accused of rape,” it observed. The court said that it appeared that the accused allegedly committed both sexual exploitation and violation of the reproductive rights of the complainant. The accused had sought bail, saying he was falsely implicated in the matter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/exercise-of-sexual-choices-does-not-give-partner-right-to-exploit-woman-court/articleshow/87244899.cms||---

The Pune regional transport office’s (RTO) figures stated that while the registration of e-bikes jumped by over 95% in the last financial year, compared to 2019-20, the registration of e-cars witnessed a massive surge of over 400% during the same period. Till September this year, the registration of e-bikes had surpassed the last fiscal’s registrations by close to 17%. Manufacturers of e-bikes said the registrations would increase further in this financial year and by 2025, Pune would have close to 10 lakh e-vehicles. An electric two-wheeler with a 250-watt power motor or less doesn’t require an RTO registration. “Though some concerns regarding charging points remain, it hasn’t stopped people from buying EVs. First-time buyers, besides those having petrol-run bikes, are coming to us. In 2018, we sold just around 20 units in Pune and now the sales have been close to 2,000,” said Sunil Chacko, the president of Vadodara-based WardWizard, which is the manufacturer of Joy e-bike. It opened a showroom in Kothrud on Friday. “Our infrastructure regarding charging points is ready on the drawing board. To implement it, any manufacturer will need a sizeable number of on-road vehicles. We are reaching that stage fast in Pune. The government has a plan, wherein the petrol pump owners need to create space and set up atleast one charging point. With sales doubling in the last six months, we are requesting the state government to implement the subsidies announced,” Chacko added. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, who was the chief guest at the inauguration of the Joy e-bike showroom in Kothrud, said that directions had been given to the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) to buy only CNG buses or e-buses and not buy diesel-run buses. At present, the entire MSRTC fleet of around 20,000 buses run on diesel. The MSRTC is the process of getting e-buses, but the pandemic has delayed the plan. Shreyas Dixit, a Pune-based dealer, said the global chip shortage impacted the EV sector as well. “There has been a supply delay, but the impact on e-vehicles (EVs) has not been huge as many companies have ready models,” Dixit said. The registration of e-vehicles in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad had increased by 114% and 117%, respectively, in July, compared to June this year. There was a negligible drop in August.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/e-vehicle-market-looks-at-big-jump-this-financial-year/articleshow/87244320.cms||Joy Sengupta

The tremors were felt in Koyna and Warna dam areas at the same time (5.07 pm). At Koyna, the tremors recorded were of 3.9 magnitude on the Richter Scale, while the magnitude recorded at Koyna dam was 2.9. Sandesh Todkar, a resident of Ratnagiri town, said he saw that his dog acting strangely at 5 pm and few minutes later, he felt the mild tremors while he was on the second floor of his house. Similar observations came from residents of Satara town that, just like Ratnagiri, is near the epicentre. The depth of the epicentre was just 5 km from the surface and mild intensity tremors were also felt at Karad, Pophali, Chiplun and Patan — most of these places are hilly areas. Prasad Sankpal, Kolhapur’s district disaster management officer, said, “No loss of life or property has been reported so far. There was only one quake, but its expanse was large. Quakes of smaller intensities keep happening now and then, but they go unnoticed. An earthquakes above 3 Richter Scale can be felt as light vibrations in some localities that are near the epicentre.” Satara administration has asked the local authorities to keep a watch on the seismic activities in hilly areas where landslides may occur due to the tremors.

Shrabona Borthakur, a student from Assam who has taken admission at Lady Shri Ram College for Women for BA (H) English, said, “I have been very excited to move to Delhi for my college life. Even though the hope seems far-fetched at this point, I am really looking forward to physical classes and interacting with people from across the country.” While hoping for a holistic development at the varsity, Tanurika Chavali, a resident of Chandigarh who enrolled into BA (H) psychology at Keshav Mahavidyalaya, said, “I am looking forward to the internships, activities, programmes and a good faculty. I have been hearing a lot about college life in DU and that has ignited a spark of curiosity in me.” Asmita Kakati, another student from Assam who has taken admission at LSR for BA (H) history, said, “I do have lots of expectations from the university as far as the academic and co-curricular atmosphere of the college is concerned. Given the present situation concerning the pandemic, I do understand that it is not simple for the university to begin physical classes all at once, but at the same time, I wish that things take a turn for the better and we are able to attend physical classes.” “The online platform cannot provide us with the joy as well as understanding that physical classes and the campus can provide,” Kakati said. However, for Kolkata resident Auroghni Chakravarthy, getting vaccinated is more crucial than attending offline classes right away.  “Because I am not yet eligible to take the vaccine, as of now, I prefer online classes. However, I am expecting quality teaching at the university and looking forward to the next three years,” said Chakravarthy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/outstation-students-hope-for-campus-life-soon/articleshow/87244889.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sadar, told TOI that of the two accused, one has been identified as Deepak Saini. “Both accused reside in the same society as the complainant.

---||Kochi||Kochi city wins national honour||KOCHI: Kochi has bagged the ‘City with most sustainable transport system’ award instituted by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. The award is expected to propel the development of the city as more international firms in automobile sector, especially those based on green energy, may give focus to Kochi. Besides, funding from the state and Union governments may also pour in to support the growth of Kochi in its integrated and sustainable transport. “It is as a recognition for our efforts to integrate sustainable modes of transport like Kochi Metro, Water Metro and e-mobility that the Union government bestowed the award on Kochi. The Centre has informed us that it was exploring the possibilities of taking Kochi as a model for similar projects all across the country,” said transport minister Antony Raju. The Union government nod for the second-phase expansion of Kochi Metro to Kakkanad has been pending for a few years. Though the Centre had given in-principle approval for the expansion, the project would gain momentum only if it gives its formal approval. The city with best sustainable transport system may be a catalyst for expediting the Union government’s decisions on such issues. “The Centre is already convinced with Kochi’s potential in sustainable transport system. That’s why the government had planned to conduct urban mobility conference in Kochi on October 29. But due to the pandemic situation, it was decided to conduct online. This indicates that Kochi is in the limelight,” mayor M Anil Kumar said. “Chances are high for many international automobile firms setting their feet in Kochi. Kochi is the only city in the country were Urban Metropolitan Transport Authority has been formed,” Kumar said. Kochi Metro Rail Ltd managing director Loknath Behara said that inland navigation in the city, which is on the cards, would also add to the integrated and sustainable navigation system. “We are thinking whether the canal navigation project should be integrated with the Water Metro project or it should be operated as a separate system,” Behara said. “We are also planning to give a boost to the sustainable transport system. We plan to procure at least 8,000 bicycles using various means, including corporate social responsibility funds, in the next two years. More electric buses and hydrogen buses will also be brought to the city,” Behara said. At the same time, the slow pace of implementation of projects like Water Metro, the integrated urban regeneration and water transport system, will turn out to be a burden for the authorities. Kochi had got fourth rank in the first Swachh Mission ranking. But, the city’s ranking slipped over the years and it was in 372nd position in the country in 2020. Similarly, more than 100 low-floor buses, including AC low-floor and non-AC low-floor allotted to Kochi have been alienated due to the incapability of authorities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/kochi-city-wins-national-honour/articleshow/87244332.cms||---
---||Goa||‘An irreparable loss.... Goa has lost its kindest & greatest soul’||GOA: Dr Manjunath Desai, an eminent cardiologist at GMC and one of the brightest stars on the state’s medical firmament, died on Sunday after a brief illness. A hero to thousands of heart patients across the state, he was admired both for his exceptional skills and his humility, and his death plunged Goa into a state of grief. The first specialist to join the hospital’s cardiology department in 2013, before it was formally commissioned, Desai built up a towering reputation over just a few years, and was known for treating prince and pauper alike with equal dedication and integrity. After the news of his death broke early on Sunday, Goan social media was turned into a large canvas on which patients, colleagues, politicians and others paid their tributes and posted remembrances. Some recounted how he saved their lives, others how he put them at ease while they were terrified. Some also recalled him as an oasis of zen-like calm amidst the inevitable rush of a large public hospital. Desai is survived by his wife and son. His last rites were performed at Borim on Sunday after noon. After completing his MBBS and MD at GMC, Desai worked in the UK for a few years, and also at a private hospital in Bengaluru. Desai joined GMC after Parrikar unveiled plan for cardiac centreHowever, private hospitals didn't suit his temperament, so when former chief minister Manohar Parrikar unveiled his plan to set up a full-fledged cardiology department at GMC, he jumped at the opportunity to serve his state and his people. He continued this service even through his illness. "Although he was unwell for the past three months, he reported to work as often as he could," said GMC's cardiology head Dr Guruprasad Naik, who was appointed to the department along with Desai. "He was an extremely good doctor, totally devoted to his work and highly compassionate to his patients. He provided full care to whoever came to him. I have never heard him say no to anybody.” “He groomed our department,” Naik said. “He was a very popular doctor because of his helping nature. His passing away is a great loss to all of us.” His other GMC colleagues too paid him rich tributes. "I never heard him say he was not on call, he would rush to care for anyone, poor or rich," said Dr Jagadish Kakodkar, head of the hospital's preventive and social medicine department. "He was a legend and a saviour of innumerable lives. Besides being a cardiologist par excellence, even as a person, he was too good. His death is an irreparable loss to GMC and future students. Goa has lost its kindest and greatest soul.” GMC's head of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery, Dr Shirish Borkar, last met Desai on Saturday. "His going away is a personal loss to me, but Goa has lost a brilliant cardiologist and a great human being. Death snatched him too early.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-has-lost-its-kindest-greatest-soul/articleshow/87244903.cms||Bindiya Chari

The order issued by SHRC chairman Antony Dominic gave direction in this regard to the chief secretary and director of the Museum and Zoo. The rights panel also directed the station house officer of Museum police to include the statements of Harshad’s father M Abdul Salam and prepare the final report. Abdul Salam had raised suspicion in the manner of death of Harshad. He complained that zoo authorities failed to comply with the central norms that the cage where king cobra is kept shall be cleaned employing more than one staff and there shall be a supervisor present. The SHRC observed that the report submitted by the Museum director did not mention any other person present to assist Harshad at the time of the accident. The SHRC said in the directive that the government shall ensure all safety measures to prevent occurrence of such incidents in the future. Three government departments have issued separate orders authorising aid for the family of Harshad. The forest department will disburse an aid of Rs 10 lakhs to the family of Harshad. The revenue department has entrusted the district collector to take up the educational expense of his son till the age of 18 . Meanwhile, local self-government department had also issued an order sanctioning construction of a house for the family of Harshad under the LIFE mission.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/shrc-directs-govt-to-give-aid-to-kin-forthwith/articleshow/87230462.cms||---
---||Delhi||Clean track record can’t absolve accused: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court rejected the bail plea of a woman booked under the stringent anti-drug law, while observing that a “clean and tidy track record” would not absolve an accused. The court also pointed out that according to the prosecution, she was found in possession of 600gm of methamphetamine, a banned substance. Justice Subramonium Prasad observed that a “commercial quantity” of the drug was recovered from the woman and the material on record disclosed that she was “part of a network which deals in supply/sale of narcotics,” while dismissing her plea for bail. The court also noted that the petitioner’s disclosure statement resulted in the arrest of two Nigerian accused, who were found living illegally in India on fake passports and possessing narcotics. “The clean and tidy track record of the petitioner does not absolve her from being in possession of 600gm of methamphetamine,” the court noted, while going on to add that “an uneducated person may claim no knowledge of the substance found in his or her possession and may raise a defence of the substance being planted on them, but being a highly educated person, there is greater presumption that carrying large quantities of narcotics is a crime and that it would entail consequences in law which could be harsh and irrevocable.” The woman was arrested in February 2018, after police received a secret tip that she would be travelling to Mumbai by train from Hazrat Nizamuddin station, carrying illegal contraband in her baggage. Seeking bail, the petitioner contended that as she was searched by police in a toilet inside the train and her bag was not there with her, the possibility of the bag being tampered with could not be ruled out. It was further contended in her defence that she was an educated woman with no past criminal record. However, the prosecution opposed the bail and told the court that the commercial quantity of the drug was kept clandestinely and recovered from one of her baggage marked as ‘baby carrier’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-clean-track-record-cant-absolve-accused/articleshow/87244917.cms||---

A joint meeting of ministers, MPs and MLAs from Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara district was held in Kolhapur to suggest modifications in the six-laning project at Kagal- Satara stretch of NH 48. Last month, union road development minister Nitin Gadkari had laid the foundation stone for the project and asked the public representatives to suggest modifications in the plan to avoid inundation of the road. Due to the flooding of the Panchganga River, the stretch from Shiroli to Kolhapur city entrance gets inundated and causes traffic congestion on the highway. Patil said, “An overbridge has been proposed in the six-laning plan. It will connect Shiroli to Market Yard. This overbridge will help in smooth traffic flow. Also, we have suggested building 13 box culverts on Tawade hotel chowk to Sangli phata stretch which will help in unobstructed water flow.” The ministers have also suggested the removal of existing concrete elevations on the highway as it obstructs the floodwater. Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said that the water should not get logged in the underbridge culverts. Hence a suggestion has been made to elevate highway stretches on pillars instead of the concrete basement. Anshumali Shrivastava, general manager of the National Highway Authority of India said, “All suggestions will be incorporated before starting the work. The six-laning will turn out to be an ideal project and address the challenges such as floods.” Satara to Kagak stretch is 127.15 km in length. The total cost of the project is Rs 4,479 crore and the aim is to lessen the traffic congestion along the stretch.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/overbridge-to-avoid-flooding-at-kolhapur-entrance-proposed/articleshow/87243169.cms||---

Shrisha guaranteed herself a medal on Monday after making it to the semifinals of the 5th Elite Women’s National Boxing Championship at Hisar in Haryana. Vidya Bandekar from Goa Police had last won a bronze medal in 2003. It was Shrisha's third fight in the competition against Bihar’s Shivani Bharti which she won with a split 3-2 decision. “Today's fight was a close one, but I’m all set to bring home the gold,” Shrisha said. Shrisha showed great maturity on debut in the senior division after her switch from youth category as she punched above her weight. She won her first two fights by technical knockouts in the very first round. Standing in her way will be Rajasthan’s Arundhati Choudhary in the last-four stage on Tuesday. Arundhati became the first-ever women’s boxer to win a gold medal at the AIBA Youth World Boxing Championships in April. “It will be a tough bout,” Goa Boxing Association secretary Danuska Da Gama told TOI. “Rajasthan also has a lot of good boxers and has been continuously winning medals at nationals. Her opponent has a bit of height advantage but Shrisha is determined to win.” GBA has announced a prize of Rs 50,000, Rs 30,00 and Rs 20,000 for gold, silver and bronze medal winners at the nationals. Shrisha, 19, took up boxing in 2016 under SAG coach Chitambaram Naik at the Government HS, Porvorim. She is currently pursuing her higher secondary studies at Vidya Prabodhini, Porvorim. “Her opponent is tall and tough. Usually boxers in the 66-70kg are well built with height, but Shrisha makes up for it with her energy levels and technique. She has broken a record and her performance must be highly credited on debut at the senior nationals,” said Chitambaram. The semifinals are scheduled for Tuesday with both losing boxers walking away with a bronze. The winners will compete for gold.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/boxer-shrisha-breaks-goas-18-year-medal-drought/articleshow/87265999.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

He was referring to the assembly byelection in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur in Bihar on October 30. RJD refused to cede Kusheshwar Asthan to Congress, which had finished runner-up there in the 2020 assembly polls. Now, RJD and Congress are contesting from both the seats against the JD(U). #RJD president #Lalu Prasad questions the utility of the Congress as an ally and called the AICC in-charge for Biha… https://t.co/cTmZzeq9Gg— TOI Patna (@TOIPatna) 1635126635000“Kya hota hai Congress ka gathbandhan? (What is all about an alliance with the Congress?),” Lalu retorted when asked about a virtual collapse of their alliance in Bihar. When asked about Das’s allegation that the RJD and the BJP had reached a secret deal and that the Congress would contest all the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar in the next parliamentary polls, Lalu retorted, “Bhakta Charan is a ‘Bhakchonhar’ (imprudent person).” Lalu, in fact, reminded people about the Congress’s poor strike rate in the 2020 assembly polls in Bihar, which paved the way for the return of Nitish Kumar-led NDA government to power. The Congress was allotted 70 seats as part of seat-sharing among the grand alliance partners, but could win only 19 seats. Reacting to Lalu’s remarks, Congress MLA Shakeel Ahmed said his derogatory statement for Das exhibited his anti-Dalit mentality and autocratic attitude towards the depressed sections of the society. “Lalu is aware of Das’ political journey as a cabinet minister in the 90s and having served as MLA and MP several times. Above all, he is the state in-charge of a national party. So, his (Lalu’s) remarks are highly objectionable,” he said. Congress state spokesperson Asit Nath Tiwari said Lalu’s statement was not against Das, but the Dalit community. “Lalu should apologise from the members of Dalit community,” he added. BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said Lalu spoke his mind and showed his anger and frustration that he had to suffer for years together due to the Congress. In fact, Lalu was booked in fodder scam cases during Congress regime at the Centre. CBI filed chargesheet against him during the same regime and he had to go to jail for the first time at the behest of the Congress, the BJP’s OBC Morcha national general secretary said. JD(U) spokesperson Abhishek Jha said Lalu’s statement is shameful. “It’s high time the Congress leadership should ponder over it as the party’s state in-charge has been showed in demeaning manner by the RJD’s top leader,” he added. Former deputy CM and BJP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi also condemned the RJD chief’s statement against Das. In a tweet, SuMo, however, said that it would not affect the relationship between the RJD and the Congress as the latter would continue to suffer humiliation at the behest of the former.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/lalu-questions-cong-utility-as-allydraws-flak-for-comments-on-das/articleshow/87244347.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Mumbai||‘Divorced couple equally responsible for child’s education cost’||Both parents should be equally responsible for taking care of their children’s education expenses, ruled the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court after an 18-year-old approached the court (he was 18 in 2019 when he went to court) as he was finding it difficult to pay fees at IIT Dhanbad, where he has secured admission to the mechanical branch. Dismissing the father’s contention that he is unable to hike the maintenance amount, as he has to look after his old mother, divorced sister and her daughter, the bench also held that “children must be the first priority of a parent in the matter of maintenance”. “Before the petitioner’s birth in 2001, his parents had separated and he has been residing with his mother. Both his parents are serving as teachers and earning salary of over Rs48,000. It is, therefore, apparent that both are equally responsible to share maintenance as well as education expenses of their son,” said a division bench of justice Atul Chandurkar and justice GN Sanap. “Even if it is assumed, for the sake of argument, that there are some other persons dependent on the father, the child must be his first priority in the matter of maintenance. If he fails to share the maintenance and expenses, then the mother would be required to bear the unnecessary burden,” the bench added, while asking the father to enhance the monthly maintenance to Rs7,500 from Rs5,000, effective October 27, 2015, the date on which the student had filed the petition. The youngster, a meritorious student scoring 93% in Class X, had moved HC as he found it difficult to pay fees of the course at IIT Dhanbad. Till now, his education and other expenses were taken care of by his mother, while the father used to provide Rs5,000 maintenance fixed by the family court. The petitioner had prayed for enhancing maintenance to Rs15,000 so that he could pay the college fees. “It is seen that the petitioner, who happens to be a meritorious child, has been made to face this unfortunate situation. Considering his plight and needs, he was constrained to knock the judiciary’s doors,” the judges observed. The parents were granted divorce on July 21, 2009, through mutual consent. The petitioner contended that his father, teacher at a zilla parishad school, did not maintain him nor took care of his well-being, after his birth. His mother faced difficulties while maintaining him with a meagre salary, the petition said. “As far as the education expenses are concerned, both parents shall share it equally. Both on their own must devise a mechanism to obtain the statement of the education expenses and share the same,” said the bench.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/divorced-couple-equally-responsible-for-childs-edu-cost-in-mumbai/articleshow/87245664.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Historians estimate that the sculpture has been carved during the Kadamba period between 9th and 13th century. The sculpture depicts Lord Ganapati in a seated position and is 45 inches in height. It originally included four arms of the god, but today the arms are not distinct due to neglect. The sculpture is also no longer in an upright position, having toppled over and is now lying on its back. “The directorate of archives and archaeology should take necessary steps at the earliest to protect this unique sculpture of Lord Ganapati by involving locals of Makadye, as this sculpture depicts the pre-Portuguese history of our area,” Ramnath Gaude, a well-known literary figure from Mollem told TOI. The pot-bellied sculpture shows the upper right hand holding a battle axe (Parashu). The long trunk is turned towards the left and the object held in the lower right hand is worn out and not visible. The sacred thread (Yadnyo pavita) can be seen on the chest of the idol. The sculpture is unique as it does not show the mouse, the mount of Lord Ganapati, and also does not have a crown (kirita mukuta) and much ornamentation. “The water of the stream Chimtovhal that joins the Khandepar river at Codli, was used for irrigating agricultural fields here. When we were engaged in winter paddy cultivation, we used to express our gratitude to this Ganapati by offering a sacred thread on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi,” Vaman Gaonkar, a senior citizen from Makadye, recalled. Today, the sculpture is lying forgotten under a mango tree. “This laterite sculpture is lying a few meters away from the ancient temple of Mahadev, a presiding deity of Sangod. However, today, very few villagers are aware about the history and heritage associated with it and that is why it is lying in the open, neglected and in a pitiable condition, facing vagaries of nature,” said 39-year-old Makadye-resident Viroji Mangaldas Gaonkar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/kadamba-era-ganapati-sculpture-lies-in-neglect-in-mollem-hamlet/articleshow/87245483.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

---||Kolkata||On its 37th birthday, Kolkata Metro bids adieu to the last non-AC rake||KOLKATA: On Sunday, India’s oldest rapid transit system, the North-South Metro, formally bade adieu to its non-AC rakes. All the 28 rakes in the North-South Metro or Line 1 are air-conditioned. Line 2 or East-West Metro also has 14 state-of-the-art BEML AC rakes. The Metro has been phasing out the snag-prone non-AC rakes of the North-South line over the past few months. On its 37th birthday, the utility gave an official farewell to the now-heritage non-AC rakes at an event at Mahanayak Uttam Kumar station (Tollygunge). An exhibition titled “Down the Memory Lane”, inside the last non-AC rake, marked the departure of these old trains, some of which have been running since Metro’s inception as India’s first underground railway in 1984. “The exhibition depicts the past, present and future, helps us relive moments the city has shared with Metro, an integral part of the people’s lives,” Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi said, inaugurating the exhibition. In the evening, he ceremonially had the rake chug off to Noapara carshed and declared: “Metro will only provide AC services now.” Several old-timers were present, celebrating the city’s lifeline. Starting with motormen Tapan Nath and Sanjay Sil, who had steered the first BHEL-made rake from Esplanade to Bhowanipore, first commuters Gautam Sengupta, P K Dasgupta and Shri Santanu Banerjee, recalling their first-day Metro experience and Ranjan Prasad, nephew of Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, who narrated the untold stories behind the maiden run. Anup K Kundu, formerly Metro Railway’s chief electrical engineer, rolling stock, gave a lowdown of the non-AC rakes: “India’s underground railway was planned in 1921, but the British dropped the idea thinking they may have to give up the colony. BC Ray tried reviving the project in 1949. Finally in December 1972, Metro’s foundation was laid.” Kundu, who shifted to Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), implementing agency of East-West Metro, as director, rolling stock, added, “In 1983, the first BHEL coaches were damaged during trials as water entered the tunnel. Then came NGEF coaches, 2001 and 2002 and operations started. Coach 2002 is now preserved at Howrah Railway Museum as India’s first Metro rake.” It was time to look back at the journey that started along the 3.4km Esplanade and Bhowanipore section to its present 32km Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar avatar. GM Joshi said, “It’s because of the dedication of the staff that Metro managed to provide smooth services during the pandemic.” Joshi hoped Sealdah station will start operations in a few months and the entire 16km East-West Metro — from Sector V to Howrah Maidan — in a year’s time. Even in the most challenging times, he said, all ongoing projects, New Garia-Airport, Joka-Esplanade and E-W Metro achieved significant progress.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/on-its-37th-birthday-kolkata-metro-bids-adieu-to-the-last-non-ac-rake/articleshow/87244341.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Goa||Consider closing down loss-making bodies: CAG||PANAJI: Criticising the meagre returns on investments in loss-making corporations, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report for 2019-20 has recommended that the state should consider shutting down financially weak entities. In its annual report, CAG said that while the state government invested Rs 640.7 crore over a five-year period in state-run corporations, the return on investment was a paltry 0.2% during 2015-20. The CAG criticised the state’s investment policies, and has said that the return on investments did nothing to offset the interest of 7% on borrowings. “If the state government keeps on making investments in loss-making government companies, whose net worth is completely eroded, the chances of earning returns on such investments are remote,” said the CAG in its report. Net worth of four SPSEs completely eroded due to accumulated lossesSimilarly, experience has shown the inevitability of write-off of the loans given to loss-making corporations and other bodies such as sugar mills and financial corporations,” said the CAG in its report. The CAG has asked the state government to take requisite steps to infuse transparency in the financial operations of the staterun corporations. “Financial support to non-functioning SPSEs places additional financial strain on the government budget, which is already reporting revenue deficit and a high debt-GSDP ratio,” said CAG. “The state government needs to expeditiously decide on the continuance or closure of non-functioning SPSEs,” said the CAG. Goa meat complex, Goa State Horticulture Development Corporation, Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC), EDC Limited, Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC), Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC), InfoTech Corporation of Goa, and Goa electronics limited (GEL) are among the 16 state-run companies in Goa. Of the 16 state-run public sector enterprises (SPSE), two were non-operational. “Five SPSEs registered accumulated losses of Rs 260.8 crore. Of the five companies, two SPSEs incurred losses of Rs 138.3 crore during 2019-20, while three SPSEs, though did not incur any loss in 2019-20, had accumulated losses of Rs 30.2 crore at the end of March 2020,” said the CAG report. The net worth of four out of five SPSEs had been completely eroded by accumulated losses and stood at -Rs 88.8 crore against an equity investment of Rs 170.1 crore as on 31 March. Six out of nine corporations registered profits of Rs 39.4 crore during 2019-20, but the data showed that the profits earned by these six entities had decreased from Rs 40.6 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 39.4 crore in 2019-20.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/consider-shutting-loss-making-state-run-corporations-says-cag/articleshow/87244920.cms||---

Addressing a programme organised by industry body Ficci, A Surya Prakash, chairman advisory board of the Indian National Army (INA) Trust, said the government must accord a due place for Netaji in the Central Vista area. “The Central Vista area has buildings or complexes named after Indira Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi. There should be something in the scheme of things for both Netaji and Sardar Patel. These can be either statues, auditoriums or buildings named after them,” he told TOI on the sidelines of the event. Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari was the chief guest at the event to mark the formation of the Azad Hind government by Netaji in Singapore in 1943. Former Prasar Bharati chairman Prakash said the issue has been taken up with the housing and urban affairs ministry. Earlier, there was a demand to have an auditorium at the erstwhile IGNCA complex close to the India Gate named after Netaji. Now the IGNCA has been temporarily shifted to Hotel Janpath and finally a new one will come up at the Jamnagar House complex near UPSC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/netaji-should-get-due-place-in-central-vista-demands-ina-trust/articleshow/87244926.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Two held with whale vomit worth Rs 8 crore in Tiruvarur||TRICHY: Forest department officials in Tiruvarur seized 8 kilograms of ambergris or whale vomit worth Rs 8 crore from two people near Muthupettai on Saturday night. Ambergris is a waxy substance secreted from the intestine of sperm whale and is used in perfume manufacture, but its possession and sale are banned in India under the Wildlife Protection Act. District forest officials said they laid a trap based on a tip that a gang was trying to sell the banned substance in local as well as international markets. District forest officer Arivoli formed a special forest special investigative team comprising assistant forest officer Radhakrishnan, forest range officer Jayachandran and foresters Manimaran, Periyasamy and Sivanesan. They fanned out looking for any movement of people attempting to sell the substance.  That was when they approached some people in and around Muthupettai under the guise of buyers of ambergris. Two people walked into the trap and offered to sell them the substance weighing 8 kilograms. They were later identified as S Nijamudeen, 53, a resident of South Street, and Y Zahir Hussain, 52, a native of North Nagar, Muthupettai. The team gleefully secured the duo who had the shock of their lives and arrested them. The substance recovered from the two was valued at Rs 8 crore, the officials said. The two have been remanded at Nannilam prison.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/2-held-with-whale-vomit-worth-rs-8cr/articleshow/87244934.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Feels like Diwali with faral travelling abroad||PUNE: It’s that time of the year again when NRIs are eagerly waiting to receive a box of happiness containing sweet and savoury festive treats from their relatives in India. Across the city, people are rushing to courier Diwali faral to their kin abroad with great concern over how the parcel will be handled and whether it will reach on time before the festival. B P Erande, senior post master, Pune head office, Finance Road, said, “There is high demand for sending faral and sweets to the US and the UK, and Canada. Our service is now available for 81 countries, though we are not delivering to China at the moment. We are collecting a daily revenue of over Rs 1 lakh.” India Post offers a speed service for most countries where parcels are delivered in less than a week, but for Sri Lanka, Iran and Belgium only regular delivery is available which takes about 7-10 days. “We accept boxes starting from 250g to 20kg, priced differently according to the delivery destination. There is no upper limit to the weight of the parcel, but as maximum weight per box is 20 kgs, the customer can send multiple boxes. We do not accept liquids as it may damage the other items in the parcel, and a prescription is required for any medicines. Our branch is popular for the impeccable packing service at a reasonable cost, which is not provided by private courier services. The UAE and the Philippines have the lowest prices at Rs 720 and Rs 770 per kg, the most expensive destinations are Belgium and Germany, at Rs 1,670 and Rs 1,540, and the rates for popular destinations such as the US and the UK are Rs 1,240 and Rs 1,550,” he added. Rashmi Birajdar’s parents have bestowed on her the responsibility of couriering home-made faral to her sister who married and moved to Chicago a few years ago. “I used to feel that the service of private couriers are better and on-time, but I was poorly disappointed. In 2018, I sent my sister a parcel during Diwali which reached her after the festival, terribly damaged, and it could not be tracked during the delay which was very stressful. With India Post, I have had a good experience, specially with the packing they do right in front of you for a fee I don’t mind paying to know that the parcel will be intact.” Shrikant Kulkarni, another customer at the post office sending Diwali faral to his son in Germany, said, “Along with some festive treats, we also sent some of my son’s favourite snacks such as bakarwadi, dry atta and some of his books. The total weight was 23kg. It is his first year away from home during Diwali so this should cheer him up.” Gauri Patil, who sends faral and sweets to family abroad, found a service that allows customers to pick ready-made sweets and savouries from popular stores in the city and directly send it to recipients in select countries. “This year I couldn’t make Diwali specialities at home, so instead I sent readymade items to my daughter and her family in London via a service started by my friend. I also sent similar parcels to my relatives in Russia. Since it is a new service, I sent it much in advance, taking possible delays caused into account, as it is start up.” Swapnil Joshi, logistics manager at a city-based international courier service specialising in bulk shipments, said, “When people send parcels to family abroad, specially during Diwali time, it generally weighs between 10-15kg. Our rates decrease as the weight increases, like the concept of wholesale. Australia and New Zealand are popular destinations with the cost ranging from Rs750 for minimum of 6kg, Rs700 for a minimum of 8kg and 600 for a minimum of 20kg. We have included the Netherlands and Ireland to the countries we deliver to this year after getting many queries and the response has been good.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/feels-like-diwali-with-faral-travelling-abroad/articleshow/87244355.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

They have also arrested a man in connection with the case. The accused has been identified as Akbar Shah, 28, of Azhikode near Nedumangad. According to excise officials, the ganja was seized from the poultry farm located at Manalimukku near Nellanad. The poultry farm belonged to the cousin of Akbar Shah. The accused had allegedly hidden the contraband in the farm without the knowledge of its owner. On Saturday morning, the owner of the farm noticed the packets of ganja when he turned up to feed the birds and informed the excise enforcement squad circle inspector T Ani Kumar. It is presumed that rats gnawed into some of the packets and a strong smell of ganja spread across the farm, which prompted the owner to conduct a thorough search. The excise officials said after confiscating the ganja, they caught the accused from his residence. He even put up a fight to resist the arrest with the help of his mother and wife. However, the excise officials eventually managed to apprehend him and took him into custody. Akbar Shah is suspected to be part of an inter-state racket that smuggles ganja and Goan liquor into the state through tourist buses and goods trucks. He is suspected to have close acquaintance with individuals who were arrested with 150 kilogram of ganja from a tourist bus in Palakkad and 250 kilogram of ganja from a truck at Melpuram in Tamil Nadu recently. Though he claims to run an export company with its office at Nedumangad, he did not have any clear answers about what he exported.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/excise-seizes-60-kg-ganja-hidden-in-poultry-farm/articleshow/87230478.cms||---

---||Goa||Now, sub-registrars can grant mutation during registration||Panaji: The state could soon see a drop in pendency of mutation cases, as well as a truncation of the timeframe for issuance of mutation certificates, as the state government has empowered sub-registrars to grant mutation while registering property transactions. The revenue department has issued a notification to grant powers of the mamlatdar to the sub-registrar and registration officers in the state so that mutation records can be updated simultaneously while property transactions are registered or when there is a change in the ownership of a particular plot of land. “The government of Goa hereby appoints the registering officer, as appointed under Section 6 of the Registration Act, as a mamlatdar exclusively for the purpose of disposal of mutation cases under the Goa Land Revenue (Records of Rights and Registrar of Cultivators) Rules, where the right to any land has been acquired through a document registered before him,” said under-secretary of revenue, Sudin Natu, in a notification. Mamlatdars in the collector’s office have been overburdened with cases and hearings under various issues, and there is a huge delay in granting of mutation certificates in Goa. The lengthy process for mutation certificates also paves the way for rampant corruption as desperate landowners are made to repeatedly run from pillar to post to get the vital document. A mutation certificate is a revenue document which reflects the transfer of land ownership, and it becomes essential for deciding the tax liability when the property ownership gets changed. In September 2016, the state government had introduced an amendment to the Goa, Daman and Diu Land Revenue Rules, empowering the sub-registrar to collect fees from the property owner and refer the sale deed to the mamlatdar’s office within a period of three days. The amendment had been introduced for simplification of the mutation procedure, but the ground reality did not change. Given the lengthy process and demand for bribes, many people after acquiring land refrained from going for the mutation process and thus the names of previous owners continued to reflect in the government records.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/now-sub-registrars-can-grant-mutation-during-registration/articleshow/87244933.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Since the preparations for designer earthen pots, idols of Lord Ganesh and Goddess Laxmi and toys usually begin about a month before the festival, potters who used to be busy crafting designer diyas and colourful toys around this time are not able to work due to lack of good quality soil. Shyam Babu Prajapati, a potter at Alopibagh, told TOI, “We are unable to get good quality soil from the trans-Ganga area as we used to get earlier.” “We used to get adequate rich quality soil from the Chatnag area before, but now we are facing hardships in getting the soil we need to shape diyas and toys despite paying Rs 3,500 per trolley,” he added. Prajapati said the high price of soil and some cartelisation by soil suppliers have dented the business when it is at its peak during Diwali. Other potters, Ram Babu, Vishnu, Dinesh, Vinod, Rajesh and others also complained of lack of soil to make diyas in required quantity ahead of Diwali. Shyam further alleged that soil was being dumped by suppliers near Andhawa (Jhunsi) and they face hardships to arrange the required amount. “We had to run from pillar to post to get quality soil. The high price of soil is depleting our savings as we have to shell out extra to get a decent supply, and this will impact our earnings also,” he added. Anuj, another potter, said, “The price of soil has gone up as villagers did not allow us to take soil from their respective villages.” He added that groupism among suppliers puts brakes on their work as they could not arrange the required soil. Ahead of the festive season, potters travel miles to identify and arrange good soil for making earthen pots, toys, idols etc. They usually arrange the soil from trans-Ganga, trans-Yamuna and Kaushambi as these belts have rich soil in adequate quantities. Potters in Alopibagh, Daraganj arrange soil from Chatnag (trans-Ganga) and even pay high prices for it. “Arranging good quality soil has become a herculean task for us with every passing year. We have to pay more for soil ahead of the festive season,” said Rajesh. The potters have sought the attention of district authorities to sort out their problems.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/scarcity-of-good-soil-cartelisation-bysuppliers-hit-potters-ahead-of-diwali/articleshow/87244935.cms||---

He said here on Sunday that they are not compelling students to come to school on the first day itself. “Schools will be open from November 1. But, we did not say that all students should come on that day and attendance will be compulsory. We said the same thing to students when schools opened for classes IX to XII also,” he clarified. He said it is customary to start anything from the first date of a month. He was aware of parents’ general opinion that schools can be reopened after Deepavali instead of November 1 and the matter had arisen even from his department. Meanwhile, some private schools in the city have sought opinions from parents on the scheduled reopening by sending forms through WhatsApp. However, sources in government schools said headmasters are gearing up to reopen as announced by the government. The minister said school authorities have been asked to take the required precautionary measures before reopening. PWD authorities were also asked to check the existing infrastructure in all government schools.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/students-free-to-come-to-school-after-diwali-min/articleshow/87244936.cms||---

The dealers are losing business because vehicles coming from neighboring states avoid these fuel stations due to high rates. After a meeting in Ratangarh of Churu district, the dealers decided to go on indefinite strike from October 25 to press for their demands, Rajendra Singh Bhati, president of Rajasthan VAT steering committee said in a statement. The dealers have raised nine demands, including ban on illegal diesel sale, base oil or paraffin coming in form of bio-diesel in the division, ban on smuggled diesel coming from Punjab and Haryana, one-state, one-price for fuel, VAT rate on the lines of Punjab and Haryana, reduction of 6%VAT raised during Covid lockdown and reduction in the storage limit for farmers from 2,500 litre to 1,000 litre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/petrol-pump-dealers-call-for-indefinite-strike-in-bikaner/articleshow/87244942.cms||---

Earlier, BSES had built “double decker” sub-stations in congested areas. It has now installed a first-of-its kind pillar-mounted, compact sub-station in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj. A BSES official said this sub-station takes up one-fifth space of a conventional distribution transformer and would help increase power reliability and reduce local faults in heavily congested areas where space constraints hamper network augmentation. “We are among a handful of discoms in the country deploying space-saving solutions in congested areas,” he added. Delhi’s power demand has increased more than 2.5 times in the last two decades, mirroring its growth. The peak power demand was 2,789MW in 2002, which crossed 7,400MW in 2019. Despite reduced demand due to the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020, this year there was a peak power demand of 7,323MW. Catering to the increasing demand also requires installing new and robust distribution infrastructure, which the official said had been a challenge primarily on account of non-availability of sufficient space. This resulted in the existing infrastructure getting overloaded. The discoms had been writing to various stakeholders for space and had some degree of success, but even then there were 1,000-1,200 pockets across Delhi where space availability remained a challenge. As a part of its space-saving measures, BSES has commissioned a 400 kVA pillar-mounted compact sub-station in Vasant Kunj, which is scalable to 630 kVA. The sub-station, developed in-house by BSES, takes up slightly more than 4 sqm compared with 20 sqm needed for a conventional distribution transformer. A second pillar-mounted sub-station has been planned at Nehru Place, which would be a part of around 25 similar transformers that would be installed in several congested areas over the next few months. “Apart from this, BSES is also installing double-decker sub-stations in heavily congested areas. Such 630 kVA substations help strengthen the power supply in congested areas,” the official said. So far, the discom has installed 14 such sub-stations that take up about 6.2 sqm space. Earlier, BSES had installed the city’s first compact packaged grid at Krishna Nagar, a congested area in east Delhi. It takes around 40% less space and can be installed in one-third of the time taken for setting up a conventional grid. The official claimed it had substantially improved the area’s power supply.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/space-crunch-bses-mounts-power-sub-station-on-a-pillar/articleshow/87244931.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||HC takes dim note of agencies’ failure to keep complex free of biomedical waste, fines DDA||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has taken a grim view of the failure of civic agencies to keep a shopping complex in east Delhi free of biomedical/hazardous waste. Justice Najmi Waziri recently slapped a cost on DDA and summoned its director to appear and explain why a proper action taken report was not submitted, giving details of steps taken to clean the complex, which falls in a residential area. “The affidavit on behalf of the DDA director has not been filed. Let the commissioner, DDA look into the matter. An affidavit must be filed subject to the payment of the cost of Rs 5,000 is to be paid in the AASRA Fund created by this court within two weeks. Director of DDA shall be present in the court on the next date. In the interim, EDMC shall ensure that the premises are cleaned up within a week,” justice Waziri observed while hearing a plea by local residents. The court’s directive came after DDA claimed that the plot of land was auctioned by it to a private party who has developed a shopping complex and its maintenance is the responsibility of the developer, while the sanitation and cleanliness, etc. is the job of East Delhi Municipal Corporation. In response, EDMC told the court that the municipality can’t be held liable since the complex has been developed by DDA or at its behest. But the court was not convinced by passing the buck between the two agencies and ordered both to ensure that “the market-place is kept clean and up to the prescribed hygienic standard.” The plea filed by three residents sought the court’s intervention, alleging that DDA and EDMC have allowed illegal and unauthorised activity in the market complex by a veterinary hospital under the garb of a pet care clinic, leading to imminent danger and hazardous environmental concerns to those living in the vicinity. However, the vet, Dr Gautam Unny, strongly rejected the allegation and told the court that even he wants to have the neighbourhood of the clinic clean. Advocate Bharat S Kumar, representing the vet, assured the court that the clinic staff would never throw garbage, medical waste, etc. This would make the place unhygienic and the staff undertook to dispose of the waste at the designated place. Kumar also argued that no contagious disease can ever spread from a dog or a cat in any case, adding that the petitioners are silent on the presence of many other medical stores and pharma companies in the area, who generate medical waste and medical packaging waste. The court will continue hearing the matter next year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-takes-dim-note-of-agencies-failure-to-keep-complex-free-of-biomedical-waste-fines-dda/articleshow/87244948.cms||Abhinav Garg

District collector S Sivarasu on Sunday handed over a cheque of Rs 85,000 to P Arun Kumar, a native of Karadipatty, who cracked the exam in his first attempt. The 17-year-old-boy, son of a daily wage labourer, had cleared JEE Advanced by securing an all-India rank of 12,175 and OBC-NCL rank of 2,503. Son of N Ponnalagan and P Ponnathal, Arun Kumar was a student of government higher secondary school, Sevalpatti. His parents expressed their gratitude to the district collector for extending the financial assistance to their son. Arun Kumar was trained by NIT-Trichy students under IGNITTE, the teaching club of the institute which provides free coaching for competitive exams to students of government schools. In 2019, two such students had cracked JEE Mains and bagged a seat in NIT Trichy. Another cleared NEET and secured a seat in Stanley Medical College, Chennai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/collectors-aid-for-govt-school-boy-who-aced-jee/articleshow/87244927.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 8 crore payoff to NCB zonal chief, alleges witness' guard in affidavit||MUMBAI: The seizure of contraband from a cruise liner on October 2 night leading to the arrest of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan has turned murkier with the personal bodyguard of a witness filing an affidavit levelling serious allegations of a payoff to a Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) official. The affidavit by Prabhakar Sail, bodyguard to drug case witness K P Gosavi, cites a meeting between Shah Rukh's manager Pooja Dadlani, Gosavi and one Sam D'Souza in the wee hours of October 3 in Lower Parel. The affidavit also mentions a payment of Rs 8 crore to be made to NCB zonal chief Sameer Wankhede. Sail said he feared that NCB officials and other persons involved "may kill or abduct me like Gosavi". Gosavi has not been traceable since NCP minister Nawab Malik sparked a controversy over including him as witness. Bodyguard claims K P Gosavi asked him to collect Rs 50 lakh, give it to SamIn his affidavit, Prabhakar Sail has questioned the decision to make K P Gosavi, against whom criminal cases were pending, as a witness in the cruise drug seizure case. Pune police have even issued a lookout notice against Gosavi for his involvement in a 2018 cheating case. Sail is Gosavi’s bodyguard. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede has denied all allegations. The raid on the cruise ship began on October 2 and continued till the next day. Aryan Khan and two others were arrested on October 3 after hours of interrogation. The affidavit states that Aryan was brought from the international cruise terminal to NCB office in Ballard Pier in Gosavi’s vehicle.The affidavit, dated October 23, sworn before notary R B Gupta, has provided details of a series of events that unfolded the night before the raid. Sail has narrated one of the conversation which says, “Till such time we reached Lower Parel, Gosavi was talking to Sam D’Souza on the phone and said that ‘you put a bomb of Rs 25 crore and let’s settle at 18 because we have to give 8 crore to Sameer Wankhede’.” Sail said Gosavi told him to come to NCB office on October 2. “I asked the driver, Vijay Suryavanshi, where Gosavi is. He told me Gosavi is in the NCB office in a meeting with official… At 10.30pm, I was called by Gosavi in the boarding area (where the cruise ship was docked) and I saw Aryan in one of the cabins...I also saw a girl, Munmun Dhamecha, and a few others with NCB officials,’’ said Sail. Aryan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and Dhamecha were arrested together. After the raid, Gosavi drove the Innova, along with Aryan and NCB officials, to the agency’s office, while Sail came on foot.  “I reached there and Wankhede instructed his staff to take my signature and one Salekar took 10 signatures on blank papers and my Aadhaar card details…After a while Gosavi came down the NCB office and met D’Souza. Later we drove towards Lower Parel and D’Souza’s car followed us.” Sail said after a few minutes, a blue Mercedes came and Shah Rukh Khan’s manager Pooja Dadlani stepped out. Dadlani, D’Souza and Gosavi sat in the car and were talking. Then they all left. After driving Gosavi to his Vashi home, Gosavi asked Sail to go to Tardeo near Indiana hotel and collect Rs 50 lakh. Sail said when he reached there, a car arrived and a man gave him two bags full of cash which he gave Gosavi. Later, Gosavi ask-ed Sail to hand over the cash to D’Souza at Trident Hotel. Wh-en Sail gave the cash, D’Souza said there was only Rs 38 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bodyguard-claims-gosavi-asked-him-to-collect-rs-50l-give-it-to-sam/articleshow/87245394.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Allahabad||Over 2.6 lakh jabs given during week-long special vaccination drive in dist||Prayagraj: In yet another feat achieved by the district health authorities, over 2.61 lakh jabs were given to recipients of all age groups in a special week-long vaccination campaign. The state health authorities had launched a special vaccination week programme between October 18 and 23 to further boost vaccination in the district. In the Prayagraj district, the health department has set a target to cover 45.16 lakh recipients of all age groups. However, about 59% of the target recipients have received at least a single dose so far while 18 % of recipients are fully vaccinated. Figures by the health department revealed that the number of jabs administered to the beneficiaries till September 30 was 27,26,097 which grew to 34,38,26 on October 23. Out of the total of 34,38,126 jabs given to recipients till Sunday, as many as 26,55,589 recipients were given the first dose while 7,82,537 received the second dose as well. Statistics also revealed that right at the launch of the vaccination drive against Covid-19, a total of 11,504 doses were given to front-line workers in January. In February, the total number of doses given to recipients, including frontline workers was 51,575, which rose to 1,17,625 in March. The figure went up to1,86,853 in April. The number of doses administered crossed the two lakh mark in May when a total of 2,21,808 doses were given to recipients of all age groups. The tally rose to 2,74,860 and then 3,52,925 in June and July respectively. The pace of vaccination gained momentum in the second week of August, and a total of 5,84,496 jabs were given in August alone. However, September broke all previous records, and the 9,39,300 vaccine jabs given in September equalled the total number of jabs given in July and August months put together. Till September 30, as many as 27,26,097 jabs have been given to eligible recipients, which includes 21,49,901 recipients of the first dose and 5,76,196 recipients of the second dose. However, figures point out that a total of 6,86,366 jabs were given to eligible recipients in just 23 days of this month. This figure shows that around 18 per cent of the recipients (7,82,537) in the district are fully vaccinated now. District immunization officer and additional chief medical officer, Dr Teerath Lal, told TOI that over 2.61 lakh jabs were given to all eligible recipients during the weeklong special vaccination campaign held between October 18 and 23. He, however, said that sincere efforts to achieve the set target and more special and mega vaccination camps are lined up to administer jabs to all targeted recipients. According to health department records, the number of recipients aged between 18 and 44 years was seven times more than that of the recipients aged above 45 years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/over-2-6-lakh-jabs-given-during-week-long-special-vaccination-drive-in-dist/articleshow/87244944.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Rain causes loss to paddy in Punjab fields, grain markets||BATHINDA: The rain that lashed the region on Saturday evening and Sunday morning caused damage to standing paddy crop ready to be harvested. The rains also added the moisture content in the paddy unloaded into the grain markets for selling. The situation is learnt to be worst in the border districts of Amritsar and Tarn Taran where rain was followed by hailstorm and lightening. The paddy harvesting had already delayed due to inclement weather in the last week of September and early part of October, but the rains on Saturday came at the most inappropriate time for both those who have harvested and those who were ready for harvesting. With the rains, the harvesting will be delayed and those already in the mandis with the harvested crop may have to wait for moisture content to come down. In a visit to Barnala grain market on Sunday morning, it was seen that rain water was flowing in between the heaps and sacks loaded of paddy. With no proper arrangements to fully cover the paddy stacks, the crop of many farmers’ got wet. This despite the fact that India Metrological Department had predicted rains on October 23-24. “We had brought crop in the mandi on Saturday afternoon. We were waiting for the crop to be purchased but it got wet in the rains in the evening. Neither the commission agent nor the government agencies had made proper arrangements to save the crop from vagaries of weather,” said farmer Karnail Singh and Sukhwant Singh, who were sitting in Barnala grain market. Farmer Harjinder Singh at Rampura Phool grain market said the crop unloaded in the open has gone wet after the rains and it will take time for it to be fit for procurement. “We were to harvest the crop on Sunday, but the rains at the most inappropriate time has further delayed it as now we will have to wait for few more days for the harvesting, as taking combines in the fields may not be easy,” said farmer Mohinder Singh from Ralla village in Mansa. The crop that was ready to be harvested got flattened at some places due to rain and winds. Apart from the bureaucratic wrangling, the farmers also had to face the fury of nature, the state government should compensate the farmers for the losses they are incurring, said farm group Punjab Kisan Union’ Mansa based leader Gora Singh Bhainibagha. A senior official of the Punjab state agricultural marketing board not wanting to be named said adequate arrangements of tarpaulins have been made to save crop of farmers and the crop that was purchased but not lifted from mandis. However, it may not be possible to cover every heap., he added. BKU Ekta Ugrahan (EU) has decided to resume the indefinite protest from Monday after a week for fair compensation to farmers whose cotton crop has damaged due to pink bollworm attack. The organisation’ state body held a meeting at a gurdwara in Bathinda on Sunday and announced that a large number of farmers along with family members will reach at Bathinda district administrative complex on Monday, even after breaking cordons if barricades are put to stop them. BKU (EU) state secretary Shingara Singh Mann said this government is proving to be equally cruel with farmers even as chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi is daily enacting dramas of showing him to be poor people friendly as it has not completed the girdawari (revenue assessment) a month after his visit. Channi had visited Bathinda villages on September 26 assuring prompt compensation, but has now asked officials to complete girdawari by October 29.  It seems government want to get fair taste of farmers’ anger. Now, as rains have caused loss to paddy crop, we will now demand compensation to paddy growers as well.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/rains-cause-loss-to-paddy-crop-in-fields-in-grain-markets/articleshow/87244943.cms||Neel Kamal

While recalling chief minister M K Stalin’s letter to the Union government demanding to allot required volume of chemical fertilizers, particularly urea as samba paddy cultivation is in full swing in the state particularly in delta districts, the AIADMK leader also stressed the need for urea. Though fertilizer with nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and magnesium are required for the soil to help plants grow, urea would help compensate all other fertilizers. So, farmers are keen on using urea, Panneerselvam had stated in a statement issued on Sunday. Fertilizers like DAP, potash and urea are sold in private agencies. However, the demand for urea is much higher than the other fertilizers. However, when farmers approach private agencies, distributors allegedly compel farmers to purchase fertilizers, which are not required. So, the state government should take steps to supply required volume of urea , he stated. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/streamline-price-of-urea-ops-to-state-government/articleshow/87244941.cms||---
---||Goa||No power, school or health centre, Velips of Cotigao hamlet want to join the mainstream||POINGUINIM: Atop the Ravana hill deep inside Cotigao wildlife sanctuary, the 100-odd residents of Keri hamlet follow a primitive lifestyle. Despite the government’s declaration of having achieved 100% electrification of households in Goa, the Velip and Gaonkar tribal community members of Keri are yet to see what an electricity connection looks like. The government did make attempts to provide solar power to these tribals, but the dense forest cover interrupted supply during the monsoons. Situated more than 700 feet from mean sea level, it is a treacherous trek of 12km from the Cotigao village panchayat office to get to Keri. The journey can only be undertaken by foot in the absence of a road, and it takes one three hours to get there. “In 2018, Keri sheltered 80 people in 15 houses. While 40-50 of them reside in the village, the younger population of school students, drivers and daily wage labourers live at the base of the hamlet to be able to study and work,” said Laxman Kushta Velip, a senior resident. The poor living conditions, without any basic amenities, has even forced some of the villagers to try shifting to nearby hamlets like Tirval, Poinguinim, said Velip. “There is no electricity in our hamlet, although other hamlets at the base of the hill have had power for decades now. We’ve made constant demands to the government, but we have not received electricity connections, proper roads or any medical assistance,” Velip said. Another Keri resident, Gouresh, has a female family member who requires treatment for mental illness. However, she is forced to carry on her life without any medical assistance due to the location of her residence. “We don’t know where to take her as there is nobody to help us. Earlier, in cases of pregnancy, midwives would come up the hill to assist. But nowadays, the women go down the hamlet and stay with their relatives,” said Gouresh. It is not an unusual sight to see the ill being wrapped in a cloth and carried downhill on shoulders in search of treatment. “I had a paralytic attack, and to be taken to a Canacona hospital, the villagers wrapped me in a piece of cloth and carried me on their shoulders for 15km until we got some vehicle. The experience was terribly painful,” said one resident. The tribals are now of the view that the government should either provide them with basic facilities like a road, school and healthcare, or plan the Keri residents’ rehabilitation to another area which can offer them a better quality of life. “All we have received so far from the government is four solar panels for the entire village and two bulbs for each house during the previous election. But these solar panels did not work during the monsoon,” said 27-year-old Gokuldas Velip. Cotigao sarpanch Umesh P Gaonkar said that under the forest rights committee, underground cabling has been carried out upto Nadkem. “We are looking forward to making Keri electrified. We cannot cut the trees due to strict restrictions of the forest department. Twice I have sent letters to the power minister, and so in all probability, I hope that this issue will be settled soon,” he said. Range forest officer (wildlife), Canacona, Anant Velip, said that permission of the national and state wildlife board will be required to carry out any developmental work in the forest. “If there is electricity there, habitation will no doubt grow, but transportation through the forest can have an adverse effect on the forest. The government had promised them land in the plains. If they come down and stay, they will get all the basic amenities. Health and education facilities can also be provided to them easily by the government. Secondly, their food habits and language are also a bit different from other Goan tribals, and they need to make up their mind on shifting and mixing with others,” he said. The Velips residing in the far-flung and isolated settlement of Keri have not given up their original places of settlement over the years, as their very existence is intimately linked to the land they hold, said professor Arvind N Haldankar of Shree Mallikarjun College, Canacona, who has a doctorate dealing with lives of the Velip tribals. “But after having encountered an absolute deprivation of the barest necessities, a majority of the Velips are now manifesting an inclination of leaving their age-old habitats. In the wake of embracing modernity, these forest dependent families aspire not to remain marginalised but to be a part of the mainstream society. Thus, their desire and hope for a better future warrants special attention and necessary intervention,” said Haldankar. This would require sustainable investments by government and non-governmental agencies to reconstruct their livelihoods, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/no-power-school-or-health-centre-velips-of-cotigao-hamlet-want-to-join-the-mainstream/articleshow/87244952.cms||Albert Fernandes

The oxygen level in the water appears to have reduced,” said PK Bose, a lake regular. In September, too, dead fish were found floating in Sarobar water. “Some fish die during the winter season due to sustained cloud cover, but this is not the time. An expert committee that was appointed to look into the matter has recommended installation of aerator machines that will help infuse oxygen into the waterbody. We are working on the plan,” said a KMDA official. Officials said there is also a plan to restart the fountain — that has remained shut for quite some time — which will help in cycling the water and generate oxygen. “The lake is suffering from environmental degradation. Water pollution is on the rise owing to several factors. Only installing aerator machines on the lake water will not help. It is important to desilt the lake water,” said environment activist Somendra Mohan Ghosh, another lake regular.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dead-fish-found-floating-in-rabindra-sarobar-again/articleshow/87244356.cms||Suman Chakraborti

A Borivli college was told to pay Rs 58 lakh. Both colleges had collected fees over and above the sum fixed by the FRA. A trustee of an Ahmednagar nursing college paid Rs 50 lakh to the Tata Memorial Centre as “an act of repentance” for flouting FRA norms. TOI had earlier reported that at least 19 employees held two or more posts in nursing and pharmacy colleges run by the Ahmednagar trust. Discrepancies, including showing a peon and a nursing college housekeeper as lecturer and a department head in their pharmacy college, respectively, came to light while scrutinising a fee increase proposal. The trustee of the college, Dr Prakash Kolpe, claimed the mistake was due to lack of knowledge of the process and urged the FRA to take a lenient view. Kolpe voluntarily offered to donate a substantial sum to organisations like Tata Hospital Trust, which treats poor cancer patients. All the four colleges of the trust are in rural areas and taking extreme measures would affect the interest of the students, observed the FRA. The authority decided to considerably reduce the fees of all colleges. Against a claim of Rs 1.05 lakh for the nursing course, the FRA approved Rs 54,000 for 2020-21, and in another course, the fees were fixed at Rs 63,000 as opposed to the claim of Rs 1 lakh. The authority also deducted the salaries of all the teaching and non-teaching staff of the college by 25% for violating the norms. Nalanda Law College in Borivli, run by former minister Laxman Dhobale, was told to return Rs 58 lakh collected from students over and above the FRA-fixed fees over a period of three to five years for the 3-year and 5-year LLB courses. The college was told to deposit the money with the FRA and submit a detailed list of students whose fees had to be refunded. The college requested the authority permission to pay the sum in instalments due to “poor financial conditions during Covid”. At Thane’s Audyogik Shikshan Mandal’s Institute of Management and Computer Studies, the FRA had acted on complaints received from students from two academic years. It was found that the college had charged Rs 53,000 from each student in addition to the fees fixed, and the college’s excuse for it did not hold ground as per the FRA norms. While the college was told to refund the excess money totalling Rs 37.9 lakh, an equivalent sum has been levied as penalty for violating norms in the Maharashtra Unaided Private Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admissions and Fees) Act, 2016. The complainants were allegedly threatened to withdraw the complaints. Advocate Dharam Mishra, an FRA member, said the decisions taken by the authority to penalise the three colleges for committing illegal and manipulative act by providing false information in the fee revision proposals, is keeping in mind the interest of stakeholders and also to set an example for other colleges that resort to such malpractices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/mumbai-fra-tells-borivli-thane-colleges-to-refund-excess-fees-to-students/articleshow/87248991.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Chandigarh||Tomar wrong in predicting farmer protests will die down soon: SKM||Bathinda: Reacting to reports of Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar having said at Madhya Pradesh’s Satna that the farmers’ agitation had been abandoned by many organisations and it would die down soon, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has called it wishful thinking. It was precisely the strategy adopted by the Narendra Modi government with regard to the ongoing agitation, where formal talks were stopped on January 22, 2021, said the SKM on Sunday, while giving a “warning to the central government that it can believe in this wishful thinking at its own peril”. The farmer movement was stronger and wider after 11 months spent at the borders of Delhi, SKM claimed, adding that the Centre’s complacency would come back to bite them in numerous ways. No elected government in a democracy could afford to ignore the united voice and demands of the large category of workers and citizens, especially when such demands are based on evidence of irretrievable damage to livelihoods, it added. Haryana government on September 23 had constituted one-man commission of inquiry headed by Justice S N Aggarwal (retd) to look into the lathi charge at protesting farmers at Bastara toll plaza near Karnal on August 28 after the video of Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha asking policemen to act tough if the protesters move ahead by breaking barricades, had come to light. The commission was to submit the report in a month. It is learnt that the commission has now asked for an extension of three months, SKM said, adding that the probe panel needed to complete its report in the stipulated time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/tomar-wrong-in-predicting-farmer-protests-will-die-down-soon-skm/articleshow/87244959.cms||---
---||Delhi||Not all gas... Delhi the only state to have universal access to clean cooking energy||NEW DELHI: More than 70 per cent of Indian households use LPG as their primary cooking fuel and 85 per cent have LPG connections. Delhi so far is the only state that has achieved universal access (100%) to clean cooking energy, an independent study carried out by Council on Energy Environment and Water (CEEW) has revealed. The study titled ‘State of clean cooking energy access in India’ also finds as many as 54% of households are still using solid cooking fuels, including firewood, dung cakes, agriculture residue and charcoal, by either stacking them with LPG or solely relying on them. This exposes them to high levels of indoor air pollution. Between 2015 and 2020, all states in India made progress in enabling access to modern cooking fuels. A marked increase in the use of LPG/PNG as the primary cooking fuel was witnessed, especially in Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. “Except for New Delhi, an urban metropolitan region, no other state has achieved universal access to clean cooking energy,” the report says. CEEW’s findings are from India Residential Energy Survey 2020, which was conducted in collaboration with Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy. The survey, conducted before the pandemic in FY 19-20, covered nearly 15,000 urban and rural households across 152 districts in India’s 21 most populous states. The CEEW study also highlighted that 84% of households that use traditional solid fuels along with LPG cited high cylinder costs as one of their reasons for stacking fuels. This finding is significant in the context of the surge in LPG prices over the past one year. Delhi was also found to be having the highest average refill rate per year of nine LPG cylinder refills, with the national average standing at 6.7 refills. Households in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, meanwhile, reported the lowest refill rates. The report says the low refill rate in Assam and Madhya Pradesh appears to be linked to the high prevalence of stacking among rural households, large number of new connections and low home delivery rates. “In contrast, low refill rates in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana could be partly attributed to smaller family sizes,” it says. The report states households with older LPG connections were found to have a higher refill rate as well. “This is partly because households get used to the convenience of LPG-based cooking over time. In addition, they have also had more time to adjust their cooking habits/practices and to adjust their household cash flows to accommodate the recurring expense of LPG refills,” it says. The study finds a typical household that stacks LPG with biomass, but uses the latter as the primary cooking fuel, consumes four refills annually on average. On the other hand, households that consume LPG exclusively require 7–8 refills in a year. Sunil Mani, programme associate, CEEW, and lead author of the study, said, “Reducing citizens’ exposure to indoor air pollution should be a public health priority, more so during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the social costs of using solid fuels are very high, we must strive to make LPG affordable and accessible through timely home delivery. The government should consider diverse strategies to disburse subsidies to deserving households.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/not-all-gas-delhi-the-only-state-to-have-universal-access-to-clean-cooking-energy/articleshow/87244957.cms||---

Assistant inspector Manoj Pande of the Talegaon MIDC police told TOI that the Nepal-based company had ordered two earthmoving machines. “The company had appointed a transport operator from Jharkhand for the delivery of the machines to Nepal,” Pande said. Pande said on February 13, the transport operator’s trailer truck left for Nepal. “The complainant, an employee in the company, said the transport operator was in contact with the company for a few days. Later, he stopped responding to calls,” Pande added. When the machines did not reach Nepal even after eight months, the employee from Maval filed a complaint. Pande said a case has been registered under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. “Our probe is on,” he said. Earlier this month, a 37-year-old man filed a complaint with the Nigdi police, stating that his driver had fled with his bag containing Rs 19.2 lakh. Last December, rhe anti-extortion cell of the Pimpri Chinchwad crime branch arrested a transporter for trying to extort a man to the tune of Rs9,000 after withholding his household goods. Police had suspected that the transporter — Virendrakumar Ramkishan Puniya (25) — was part of an interstate extortion racket.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/transport-operator-dupes-nepal-firm-booked/articleshow/87244358.cms||---

The accident occurred around 8am at a spot 5km from the Zero Point. A mini bus, carrying 14 tourists to Delhi from Agra, had broken down on the expressway and two of them — Swapan Bhattacharya (56) and Saheb Mandal (24) — had got off the vehicle to look for an alternative transport. They were standing behind the bus when the sedan rammed the vehicle from behind. Bhattacharya and Mandal were sandwiched in between the Civic and the mini bus. Police said that of the 14 tourists in the bus, nine were from Howrah district in West Bengal. They had gone to see the Taj Mahal and were on their way back to Delhi when the accident occurred. The three Congo nationals, who are students of a college in Greater Noida, had gone on a long drive and were returning to their flat when they rammed into the bus. All three — Lucy (23), John (25) and Dieumerci (25) — suffered grievous injuries and are being treated at a private hospital. The fourth person who was injured was a tourist — Mandal’s sister Sneha (18). “Dieumerci was driving the car at over 110kmph. He failed to slam the brakes in time and crashed into the bus,” said Avesh Malik, the investigating officer in the case. “Initial investigation has revealed that the group of tourists had come to Delhi on a vacation and gone to see the Taj Mahal, for which they had booked the mini bus. They were returning when their vehicle broke down near Zero Point,” he added. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the sedan being driven by the students had also grazed past a patrol vehicle just 150 metres from the spot where they crashed into the bus. The police are trying to find out if the three were under the influence of alcohol or drugs. So far, the cops haven’t found any such substance from their car. “We have received a written complaint from the family of the deceased. An FIR would be registered soon,” Malik said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/car-rams-bus-on-yamuna-e-way-two-tourists-killed/articleshow/87244972.cms||---
---||Pune||Health dept exam aspirants kept out, get qs paper late||Pune: The group D examination for recruitment in state health department held in two sessions on Sunday at the Abeda Inamdar College saw several angry candidates who claimed they did not get the question paper in time and blamed the staff in-charge of conducting the exam. The candidates said that they had reached the centre one hour before the exam, yet the college staff appointed to conduct the exam disallowed them. While many candidates were attempting the exam on schedule at 10 am, groups of a few candidates, about 15-20, claimed they were not allowed inside the exam hall. When contacted, president of the Maharashtra Cosmopolitan Education Society, that runs the college, P A Inamdar, said that the exam was being conducted by the state government and their contracted agency while the college had only appointed its staff for supervision so it had no role to play in the claims made by the candidates. Inamdar also said that the college authorities and the government officials would discuss and resolve the issue at the earliest. Health minister Rajesh Tope attributed the delay to technical issues and said that the candidates were given extra time to complete their paper. The exam was held in two sessions and the second session was scheduled at 3pm. “The digital lock on the question paper box failed to open which led to the delay in distribution of question papers to the candidates. However, the candidates were given extra time to complete their exam for the time lost in the initial period." he added. The students who were not allowed at 10am were later permitted to sit for the exam after a 90-minute delay. A candidate who had come from Ausa taluka in Latur district said, “I came the previous night to Pune and spent the night on the railway platform. I came here at 9am for the exam that was scheduled an hour later but to my shock the exam authorities did not have enough question papers. We are very poor and have no money in hand and we cannot afford to lose this trip without giving the examination.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/health-dept-exam-aspirants-kept-out-get-qs-paper-late/articleshow/87244360.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Kolkata||Wrap up work by this week, West Bengal schools told||KOLKATA: The Bengal government has asked all state-run and aided schools to complete preparatory works by this week. The secondary and higher secondary schools have been asked to complete their first sanitisation by October-end, the second will be done ahead of school reopening. The move is largely believed to be a precursor to state allowing school reopening by mid-November. The CBSE and the CISCE first semester offline examination schedule kicks off in the last two weeks in November. Private schools affiliated to CBSE and CISCE are also waiting for more clarity from the Bengal government on reopening. While the respective boards have announced their offline semester one examination schedules, a formal notification by the state is required to allow students back to school. The present Covid guidelines in Bengal are effective till October 31, a notification is expected next week. The Covid spike has also added an element of uncertainty as far as school reopening is concerned. The Bengal government says neither CBSE nor the CISCE has sought the state’s inputs while announcing their offline examination schedule. On Saturday, senior officials from Nabanna spoke to all district inspectors of schools via a video conference in which DIs were given a set of instructions to be sent to all school heads. Sources said the DIs were asked that the first round of cleaning and sanitisation of schools should be done within October 29. Interestingly, this was only mentioned for secondary and higher secondary schools. “We have learnt that in the first phase of reopening only students of classes IX to XII will be allowed. But let the government notice come first,” said a headmaster. Schools have also been asked to sensitise guardians and students, submit details of pending works and distribute activity tasks to students. Chandan Maiti, general secretary of Advanced Society for Headmasters and Headmistresses, said, “A lot of work needs to be done in a week. The timeline may have to be extended.” Schools are shut for the last year-and-a-half and some district schools have been badly damaged by cyclones. CBSE first published its datesheet for the Term 1 offline examination which will begin from November 30. CISCE on Friday declared dates of Semester 1 from November 22. A senior official of state education department said, “Two boards have declared dates for offline exams without discussing with the government. Centre is trying to impose their decision on us. But the state will decide final reopening date after considering Covid situation.” Principal of a CBSE school said, “We are hoping that around November 15 schools will reopen because it is absurd that offline exams are happening but formally the school is closed.” Another principal of a CISCE school said, “We will follow council instructions and are waiting for the directives from the state.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/wrap-up-work-by-this-wk-state-schools-told/articleshow/87244361.cms||---

He tried to kill her by smothering her breath with a pillow and also struck her private parts with a screwdriver. Kanchan Bhandari, resident of Iskcon Platinum in Bopal, said in her FIR that she wed the accused Lokendra Bhandari around 16 years ago after falling in love with each other. Bhandari has a spa in Vastrapur in Ahmedabad, and also In Bangalore,. Around five years ago, she came to know that her husband had relationships with various women. The couple often had fights over the man’s illicit affairs. Recently, Lokendra went to Bangalore from where he sent pictures of three different women to Kanchan asking her to select who among them was the most beautiful. Feeling humiliated, Kanchan called up her sister-in-law and told her about Lokendra’s behaviour, and also raised this issue with him. When her sister-in-law raised this issue with Lokendra, he told her that he would flog Kanchan with his belt and would not leave her alive. On Friday night, when Kanchan was sleeping with her two kids, Lokendra reached their house and took her to the drawing room. He first snatched away her cellphone and threw it away. Later, he tied her to a chair and began thrashing and flogging her with a belt. As if this was not enough, Lokendra, while constantly abusing her, brought a screwdriver with which he hit Kanchan on her private parts. In his indiscriminate attacks, the chair on which Kanchan was sitting broke down. Then, he went to the bedroom and brought a pillow which he began pressing against Kanchan’s mouth to suffocate her to death. In the attack, she fell unconscious and when she gained consciousness, she found him sleeping in the bedroom. Using an intercom, she called a neighbour and asked her to come for her help. Her neighbour arrived with Kanchan’s sister-in-law and rescued her from the flat. They took her to Sola Civil Hospital in an ambulance and later she was shifted to Asarwa Civil Hospital. When she got discharged from the hospital, she, along with her brother and sister-in-law, approached Bopal police and filed an FIR against Lokendra. Inspector D N Patel of Bopal police said that the accused has been arrested and booked under charges of attempt to murder on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/casanova-tortures-wife-to-quell-objections/articleshow/87244364.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi HC directs AIIMS to pay Rs 50 lakh to illegally terminated employee||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has directed All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to pay over Rs 50 lakh to a former employee, who was illegally terminated from service, noting that the man has been running from pillar to post for the last several years. Raj Singh, who was appointed as a driver by AIIMS sometime in the 1980s, will also be paid Rs 19,900 as pension every month. According to the petitioner, he was illegally terminated after which he approached the labour court. The labour court in December 1998 held that the termination of service was an unfair practice, Singh said in his petition. The labour court’s order was challenged before various forums and finally the special leave petition (SLP), filed by AIIMS, was dismissed by the Supreme Court on June 3, 2016. Singh, represented through advocate B T Kaul, served a legal notice to AIIMS authorities seeking compliance of the award and payment of the amount, but it was not paid. Thereafter, he approached the high court. Justice Prathiba M Singh directed that the man be paid Rs 50,49,079 towards salary for the period from December 4, 1998, which is the date of award, and the date of superannuation, which is October 31, 2016, his leave encashment and his gratuity. This amount was calculated by the authorities and the court was informed about it. However, the basis for the computation has still not been explained. “However, considering that the petitioner has been running from pillar to post since 2016 when the Supreme Court dismissed the SLP till date, the respondents (authorities) are directed to pay the amounts in terms of order dated March 9, 2021, on or before October 30, 2021, to the petitioner,” the high court said in its October 12 order. The court was also told by advocate Sonali Malhotra, representing AIIMS, that Singh was also required to deposit Rs 30,000 as a lifetime validation amount for being enrolled under the employees health scheme. To this, the court said that in view of the long duration for which Singh has been fighting the present litigation, the amount of Rs 30,000 shall now be deposited on his behalf by AIIMS itself, in lieu of costs for the long-drawn litigation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-directs-aiims-to-pay-rs-50-lakh-to-illegally-terminated-employee/articleshow/87244989.cms||---

JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya questioned the BJP's state leaders for not bringing up the issue at the meeting even though the Jharkhand Assembly unanimously passed a resolution in November last year. "The state assembly unanimously passed a resolution in this regard and sent it to the Centre. The tribal advisory committee (TAC) also passed a resolution and sent it to the governor. Yet the BJP organised a meeting but did not speak a word about it," Bhattacharya said. JMM also questioned why the incumbent Assam government, which is currently led by the BJP, has been reluctant to accord scheduled tribe status to the resident Adivasi and Moolvasi communities which migrated from Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha centuries ago to work in the tea plantations. "On one hand, the Centre writes to the Supreme Court stating that it will not be able to conduct a caste-based census while on the other hand, it is talking about tribal rights. This is political double standards," Bhattacharya said. The JMM also criticised Union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda for his claims that the incumbent Jharkhand government was not lending a helping hand to the Centre when on the issue of setting up Ekal Vidyalayas in ST dominated blocks. "The JMM challenges him to give one instance where such an incident has happened," Bhattacharya said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jmm-criticises-bjp-st-morcha-for-keeping-mum-on-sarna-code/articleshow/87244521.cms||Dhritiman Ray

President, central unit of the Parishad, Prem Shahi Munda, lambasted the saffron party for ignoring the demand of the tribal community for asking to be identified separately as a distinct community. “Tribal identity can be preserved only when they are recognized distinctly in the national decadal census. We have been demanding inclusion of a separate code for the tribals in the census register and this would be possible only when the BJP government at the Centre agrees to do so,” he said, adding that the ST wing of the saffron party should have been responsive to the sentiments of the tribal community. Apart from Munda, principal general secretary Abhay Bhut Kunwar said the BJP government, when in power, had made efforts to amend the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act and pave way for acquisition of tribal land. “On one hand they speak of being concerned about tribal welfare and identity and on the other when it comes to taking action on paper they try to cheat the community,” he said. The Parishad cautioned the BJP against treating tribals as a vote bank and mute spectators.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/aadivasi-jan-parishad-flays-bjp-for-using-tribals-as-vote-bank/articleshow/87244575.cms||---

The Centre has recently given its nod to the state department of industries’ proposal to take part in Jharkhand’s first international event. The stall is expected to come up between February 27 and March 6 next year. Senior department officials will attend the event. Confirming the development, state industries secretary Puja Singhal told TOI, “The state has received the Centre’s nod to attend the Dubai International Expo between February 27 and March 6 next year.” Notably, India is attending along with 190 other nations at the event which started on October 1 and will continue till March 31. India has been showcasing its culture, food, agriculture, climate, urban development and other areas in its four-storey India Pavillion. The state had earlier failed to bag a berth at the expo while competing with other mineral-rich states like Chhattisgarh and Odisha between September 30 and October 6 this year. Sources aware of the developments claimed that Jharkhand missed out on a berth earlier this month owing to its delay in forwarding its proposal. “Even though Jharkhand will primarily showcase its mineral reserves, other areas of interest like food processing and technology, apparel, automobile, electronic vehicle manufacturing sector and pharmaceutical sector will also be showcased to draw potential investments,” a senior official of the department said. In September, the department had roped in the global consultancy firm, Ernst & Young, to assist it in participating in the expo. Earlier this year, the state government had unveiled a new state industrial and investment promotion policy which focused on eight high priority sectors — apparel, automobile, auto components and electric vehicles, agro-food processing and meat processing, pharmaceuticals and electronic systems and design manufacturing (ESDM). In September, chief minister Hemant Soren met corporate leaders in New Delhi and bagged investment assurances worth Rs 10,000 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jkhand-to-set-up-stall-in-dubai-expo-next-yr/articleshow/87244515.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Abhishek Kumar (24), who was posted in Drass sector in Jammu and Kashmir, died in the line of duty on October 24, 2020. He was with the Corps of Signals regiment. The family members and villagers appealed to the politicians who visited them to offer condolence and also the state government representatives to put up a statue at the entrance of the village, rename a local government school after the jawan and set up a toran dwar (welcome gate) in his memory. The family claimed that all gave assurance but nothing was done. The jawan’s elder brother, Parmanad Kumar, a farmer by profession, then decided to do it on his own. Gradually, a few villagers also chipped in with resources in the form of money, labour and other assistances. As it was formally unveiled on Sunday at a low-key ceremony, five lawmakers from BJP and Congress comprising two MPs — Sanjay Seth and Sudarshan Bhagat and MLAs — Bandhu Tirkey, Amba Prasad and Rajesh Kachchap — attended it. The smarak-sthal (place where the statue is put up) came up at the entrance of Churchu village on gair-mazurwa land. Talking to TOI, Parmanand said that the statue incurred investment of about Rs 8 lakh. “I invested much of it from my pocket, while some came from other villagers who donated to set this up. This village sacrificed a son to safeguard the country. The future generation here can get inspired to join the army or other forces to safeguard the nation,” he said. Unwilling to indulge in any blame game, he said that initially all the villagers put their demands before the government and also before local MP Sudarshan Bhagat of Lohardaga of their requirements, but with no visible action on the ground, they chose not to run after anyone for help. “It took us about six months to complete it. If the government wanted to do anything, they could have done overnight. I don’t want to blame anyone,” he said, adding that they were promised land by the government for setting up a petrol pump. “We have applied for it. Let’s see when it fructifies,” he added. Another villager, who didn’t want to be named, took a dig at netas turning up for photo-ops. “Madat koi nai kiya but feeta kaatne sab pahuch gaya (None helped, but all came to cut the ribbon),” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/villagers-kin-of-martyred-jawan-pool-in-funds-to-set-up-his-statue/articleshow/87244485.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The traffic police and transport officials have identified spots where road accidents are ocurring due to overspeeding of vehicles and unauthorised parking on the roadside. In the urban circle, Jubilee Park, Sakchi roundabout, Marine Drive, Mango Dimna Road, Pardih, Burmamines have been identified as spots where unauthorised parking and unauthorised street shops are causing road accidents. On NH-33, road at Dhalbhumgarh, Barsol and Baharagora besides, Boram and Dumaria have been identified as red spots where accidents are reported mostly due to unauthorised shops popping up in the recent years. "We have taken the stakeholders on board to address the issues of road accidents and traffic jams in the district," said ADC, Parmeshwar Bhagat, who chaired the district road safety committee meeting earlier this week. The state road construction department and Tata Steel Utilities and Infrastructure Services Ltd (TSUISL) have been asked to install speed limit signages at the potential accident sites in the city limits. NHAI will be doing the same on the highways. The traffic police and the transport officials will conduct frequent checking to penalise motorists riding without safety helmet and seat belts. The bikers using modified silencers, jumping speed limit, doing triple ride will be on the radar on the traffic police. The law violators will be fined in accordance with the provisions of the new Motor Vehicles Act 2020. The traffic rules violation incidents are so rampant in the district that on an average 100 plus chalans are issued by the traffic police daily. The traffic police records suggest that in 2018, 311 road accidents occurred of which 157 were fatal. In 2019, 349 road mishaps were reported of which 221 were fatal. In 2020, 268 road accidents happened of which 158 accidents were fatal. In the first six months of 2021, 120 plus road accidents happened out of which 50 were fatal ones. "With the resumption of industrial and commercial activities and reopening of the schools following the relaxation of Covid curbs traffic rush has increased on the streets and this has led to frequent reports of road accidents and traffic jams, regulation of the traffic is a must," said Ajay Mahato, member of the Sikshit Berojgar Tempo Chalak Sangh, the outfit that was called for the meeting chaired by the ADC. A traffic police sub inspector said several motorists driving without wearing the Covid safety face mask were also penalized during the peak of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jamshedpur/fresh-drive-planned-to-curb-road-mishaps-in-steel-city/articleshow/87246958.cms||---

As per state health department records, a total of 147 fresh cases of Covid-19 have been detected in the last four days, taking the number of active cases to 202 on Saturday, which was 55 on Wednesday. As per the Covid-19 bulletin issued by department on Saturday night, a total of 3,48,592 people have tested positive for Covid till date, of which 3,43,255 have recovered and a total of 5135 people have succumbed to the infection. Dr Dewesh Kumar, public health expert and professor of community medicine at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) here, said, “People who have tested positive during the last one week were detected after their samples were collected for testing and maximum of them are from other parts of the country. So we cannot say that there is an infection scare in our state and it is just a result of underlying transmission in different areas and among different population.” He added, “This is not an indicator of the arrival of third wave because of the current positivity rate because when we were at the peak of second wave, our positivity ratio of samples had crossed 40% in Rims alone. There are no positive cases being reported from hospitals even as indoor patient department services have started functioning in a full-fledged way.” Upon contact, critical care expert and head of Rims trauma centre Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya also said that the fresh infections aren’t a sign of third wave. However, he cautioned people against being negligent and said that next five months are crucial and people need to be careful. “The reason behind the fresh surge is unrestricted movement of people during the festive season, be it tourist places, inter-city travel as well as social gatherings. For instance, all the eateries have been opened and there is a huge crowd there on weekends. Apart from that, people are travelling to and from their homes for the festive season and these have increased the chances of the virus spreading,” Dr Bhattacharya added. He further said, “Over 100 crore people have taken jabs and apart from that, a very large population was infected and have developed anti-bodies so even if patients test positive, the symptoms will be mild. However, the situation remains volatile and government should focus on the vaccination of kids as they are more vulnerable.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/despite-surge-in-cov-cases-experts-allay-3rd-wave-fears/articleshow/87244500.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||BJP meet chalks out ways to improve reach among tribal voters||RANCHI: The two-day working committee meeting of the BJP’s national ST Morcha ended on Sunday in which a slew of political resolutions regarding welfare of scheduled tribes (ST) across the country were passed. Several tribal party leaders, including a dozen union ministers, attended the meeting aimed at chalking out modalities to increase BJP’s footprint among tribal voters. The Morcha demanded that November 15, which marks the birth anniversary of tribal icon and freedom fighter Bhagwan Birsa Munda, be celebrated across the country as the day of pride for tribal community. A few other resolutions include working towards ensuring recognition of tribals in ST list and reservation to them in the respective states where they currently work irrespective of their origin state, setting up of state-level ST Commission on the lines of national ST commission in all the states; total implementation of the laws made to safeguard loot of tribal lands and introduction of a new code to reclaim the illegally claimed tribal lands; ownership rights to tribal forest dwellers among others. Ashok Baraik, a senior officer bearer of the state ST Morcha of BJP, said, “Following tabling of the resolutions on day one, all these were passed on Sunday. The meeting has set the tone for renewed efforts for BJP to work for the betterment of the tribals. In Jharkhand, we will continue to fight against the loot of tribal lands and threat to their existence.” The conclave didn’t dwell on Sarna code, a raging political issue in Jharkhand, ahead of the upcoming nationwide census. The party maintained an official silence on it prompting the ruling JMM to attack BJP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/bjp-meet-chalks-out-ways-to-improve-reach-among-tribal-voters/articleshow/87244552.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Potato growers rue crop damages due to October rain||Hazaribag: The farmers of Ichak block in Hazaribag, known as potato-growing hub of the state, are ruing heavy crop damage this year and financial loss due to unseasonal and excessive rainfall. Many farmers claimed to have lost over 40% of their crops to vagaries of weather. Rakesh Kumar Singh, secretary of Bazar Samiti in Hazaribag, said Ichak alone has more than 300 farmers who took up potato as crash crop on more than 3,000 hectares of land. “But unseasonal rain in October has hit the farmers hard this time as many lost their capital investment for which they had taken loans. Due to excess rain, 40% crops got affected with a disease named jhulsha,” he said. He added, “We are making efforts to make up the losses by getting better remunerative prices. We have Ichak Green Agro Producers Centre consisting more than 2,000 farmers linked to e-nam portal through which they sell the produces. Our target is to do business worth Rs 10 crore to make up for the losses to farmers,” he said. Managing director of the Ichak Green Agro Producers Centre, Ashok Mehta, also a prominent farmer, said, “We have appealed to the deputy commissioner to pay compensation to farmers who incurred losses but so far we haven’t received any response.” SDO Sadar Vidya Bhshan Kumar, president of Hazaribag Bazar Samiti, said, “The district administration is assessing the crop damages to take an appropriate call for compensation.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/potato-growers-rue-crop-damages-due-to-october-rain/articleshow/87244503.cms||Abhijit Sen
---||Ranchi||PM Modi lauds tribal icon Birsa Munda in ‘Mann ki Baat’||RANCHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi remembered Jharkhand’s tribal icon and freedom fighter Birsa Munda on Sunday during his ‘Mann ki Baat’ on the national radio. During his talk, Modi called upon the youth to read about Birsa Munda and said, “The more you know about the contribution of the tribal community in India’s freedom struggle, you would take pride in them.” The PM also explained the term ‘Dharti Aaba” often associated with Birsa Munda as the father of the land. “He has been rightly called ‘Dharti Aaba’ because it is only a father who can lead the relentless struggle to protect land, water, forests and the distinct tribal identity against the British oppressors,” he said. Modi reminded the people that despite being harassed by the British, Birsa Munda continued to take up his tribal faith and opposed every policy that was aimed at hampering the environment. “No one can forget his Ulgulan. His accounts of bravery are still remembered in central India in the folktales and folklores,” he said. Expressing happiness on the mention of the tribal legend, Birsa Munda, in the PM’s ‘Mann ki Baat’, BJP state president Deepak Prakash said his party has always revered the tribal leaders. “The Prime Minister remembering Birsa Bhagwan ahead of his birth anniversary on November 15 is a testimony that the party has always held the tribal leaders in high esteem. It was also former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee who paved the way for the formation of Jharkhand as a separate state and chose the birth anniversary of Birsa Munda as the day for the formation of the new state,” he said. The tribal party and key ruling alliance partner in Jharkhand, JMM, however, expressed surprise at the “politicization” of the tribal icon who is considered as “God by the tribal community”. “It is not a matter of pride for us because the PM remembered Birsa Munda on a day when BJP was holding its central working committee meeting of its ST wing here,” said Supriyo Bhattacharya, the central general secretary of JMM. He said the PM never remembered any tribal freedom fighter in the previous 87 editions of his radio talk. “He could have remembered Sidho Kanhu but the ST wing meeting was not happening in Santhal Pargana, so he knew it was apt to remember Birsa Munda for political mileage,” Bhattacharya claimed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/pm-lauds-tribal-icon-birsa-munda-in-mann-ki-baat/articleshow/87244509.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||No. of botched eye surgery victims in Sahibganj increases to 19||DUMKA: The number of patients, who allegedly lost vision after cataract operations at a private hospital in Sahibganj, has now risen to 19, officials said on Sunday. Earlier, 12 persons reportedly went blind in the operations conducted by the same doctor at the private hospital, Jharkhand Sewa Sada Nursing Home, between October 5 and 7. The district administration had set up a six-member team to probe the incident on health minister Banna Gupta’s directive and the members visited the hospital on Sunday. Sources said the hospital management has taken at least 10 patients to Kolkata and nearby Malda district in Bengal for their better treatment. All patients had undergone cataract surgery under the Centre's Ayushman Bharat early this month. Sources quoting the probe team said nearly 1,200 cataract patients have so far undergone eye surgery at the nursing home, which started functioning in December last year. Dr Thomas Murmu, the district tuberculosis officer and head of the team, said, “We will submit the probe report to the civil surgeon, Dr Arvind Kumar, within the stipulated 24-hour period.” He said the team reached the Barharwa block headquarters on Sunday and started the probe. Meanwhile, the JMM MLA from Borio, Lobin Hembrom, said nine victims of the botched surgery from Chashganwa village of his constituency had approached him on Saturday after their vision loss following the eye surgery at the hospital. “I directed the hospital management to ensure their better treatment to make them recover their vision. All of them are now being shifted to the Ranchi-based Kashyap Eye Hospital,” Hembrom said, adding that the number of such cases might be more. Earlier, rural development minister Alamgir Alam said four of the patients are from his constituency (Pakur). All victims were operated on by a Bengal-based consultant eye surgeon, Dr H K Vishwash. On Friday, the victims had complained of vision loss after the removal of their bandages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/no-of-botched-eye-surgery-victims-in-sahibganj-increases-to-19/articleshow/87244460.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Though the former Baroda cricketer couldn’t fulfil his dream, he wants to ensure that he produces quality wicketkeepers who would go on to play for India. Shah, who recently hung his boots, has taken over as the chairman of the junior selection committee of Baroda Cricket Association (BCA). And, he has got down to business immediately. “We have a legacy of producing quality wicketkeepers from Baroda. Kiran More and Nayan Mongia kept wickets for the Indian team for a long time and they contributed with the bat too. I want to revive that legacy and ensure that we produce quality wicketkeepers,” Shah, who was a wicketkeeper-batsman, told TOI. He has also captained the Baroda team. “My job as a selector is to identify good cricketers and give them enough chances. It is important that talented players get opportunities to perform,” Shah added. He was in talks with the BCA over the last couple of weeks after the management offered him the job of junior selection committee chairman. Shah, who was a member of the U-19 World Cup squad, played 93 First Class games in his 16-year long career. He scored 3,409 runs including a double century. He took 278 catches behind the wicket and has 38 stumpings to his name. Shah has also played 54 T20 games and scored 471 runs. Impressed with his performance, Mumbai Indians team picked him up for the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/want-to-produce-quality-keepers-for-india-pinal-shah/articleshow/87243727.cms||Tushar Tere

---||Nagpur||Maha minister calls for protests against G’chiroli mining project||Nagpur: The vexed iron ore mining project of Lloyds Metal and Energy Limited (LMEL) at Surjagarh area of Gadchiroli is now facing resistance from the state’s relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar. The project has also been on the target of the Naxalites. Now, Wadettiwar has called the locals to stand up against it for saving natural resources from the capitalists’ onslaught. The mining activities would also disrupt the locals’ places of worship in the hillocks, says a pamphlet released by the protest organizers. Local activists, led by Maharashtra cabinet minister, have announced a rally and indefinite picketing at Etapalli tehsil where the mines are located. A protest rally has been announced for Monday. Wadettiwar’s name tops the list of organizers in the pamphlet announcing the strike. He had also led a protest in 2016 when BJP was in power. A message requesting Wadettiwar for a comment went unanswered. However, one of the organisers Ajay Kankdalwar confirmed the development saying the demands were mentioned in the pamphlet released by them. At present, Lloyds Metals and Energy Limited (LMEL) is the only company whose mines are operational in the district. The pamphlet reads that the government’s attention is being drawn to the fact that mining operations are being done in utter disregard to laws like the Forests Rights Act or Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act 1996, apart from not even considering human rights. A number of petitions demanding to permanently cancel the project have been sent to the governor, President of India and departments related to mining. Claiming that the state government has only been apathetic, the organisers have made calls to the locals to join the protest. The protest comes at a time when the company has once again drawn its plans to revive the mines. After over seven years, things appeared to be gaining momentum. Sources said around 1,500 persons have been employed since August. These were the signs of taking up operations on a full-scale. The plans were drawn up after Odisha’s Triveni Earth Movers Private Limited acquired 20% stake in LMEL taking over as promoters. Seeing the opportunity, a number of locals are lining up to get jobs in the mine, said sources, adding the number of job-seekers is going beyond the jobs available. The project was pushed during the Devendra Fadnavis regime when 100 acre land were earmarked for a sponge iron project of LMEL in Ashti, also in Gadchiroli district. The plan was to use the ore mined at Surjagarh in the Ashti plant. The mines are also seen as a means to develop Gadchiroli, which is still considered backward district. After Triveni Earth movers purchased the stake, LMEL stock also jumped to over Rs80 from Rs15 odd in a year. Earlier, there have been incidents of equipment being burnt down and even killing of a company official allegedly by the Naxalites.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/maha-minister-calls-for-protests-against-gchiroli-mining-project/articleshow/87244991.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||Cops on toes to thwart threat of Naxalite violence at Surjagarh||Nagpur: The possibility of Naxalites infusing violence in the Surjagarh agitation scheduled on Monday has kept Gadchiroli police on their toes. Having come under criticism from the local populace due to lukewarm opposition of iron ore mining there, Naxalites may try to trigger mob violence to be able to “utilize the situation later” for propaganda, feels a section of the security intelligence. The agitation, which is scheduled to take place in the sensitive Etapalli area in south Gadchiroli, has been organized to oppose iron ore mining in Surjagarh. State cabinet minister Vijay Wadettiwar, zilla parishad (ZP) president Ajay Kankdalwar, social activists and ZP members Sainu Gota, Lalsu Narote and Devaji Tofa are set to lead the agitation. Sources from police said that there are no clear indications but presence of Naxalites in the agitations is likely, because they too have been ideologically opposing the mining. Though Naxalites have openly opposed the mining, there had been no strong opposition from them so far against the undergoing work. Apart from a civilian’s murder and a few pamphlets opposing mining, Naxalites have so far not resorted to greater violence after mining resumed there around a year and a half ago. In 2016, Naxalites had set 80 vehicles on fire at the Surjagarh site, but no incidents were reported after that. State home minister Dileep Walse Patil, who was in the city last week, said an armed outpost would be set up at the mining site. Police superintendent Ankit Goyal said area domination exercises and combing operations have been initiated in the run-up to the Surjagarh agitation. “We are aware of the Naxalite’s plan and strategies, and are taking adequate measures,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/cops-on-toes-to-thwart-threat-of-naxalite-violence-at-surjagarh/articleshow/87245003.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Sorry state of affairs in Nagpur Jail: HC||Nagpur: Upset over Central Jail superintendent Anupkumar Kumre’s conduct of allowing parole to selected prisoners as per new rules implemented in view of Covid-19 pandemic “while keeping others in dark about it”, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has observed that there is “sorry state of affairs in the jail”. “Selected prisoners were picked up by the jail authorities to inform them about their right of being released on emergency parole in view of the May 8, 2020, notification. The remaining ones, who were not made aware of their right, were kept away from applying for it even after one-and-a- half years. This reflects a sorry state of affairs in Nagpur prison,” a division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar said. The bench added that ordinarily it would not enter into administrative affairs of prison authorities, but the glaring instances constrained it to take a stern view of the matter. “We called upon assistant government pleader NM Ghodeswar to take instructions about the future course to be adopted by superior authorities as regards the affairs of the Nagpur prison and arbitrary exercise of power on SP’s part.” While hearing a petition by prisoner Hanuman Pendam, who challenged rejection of his emergency parole, the justices pointed out that petitioner’s case was the third instance when the SP resorted to arbitrary exercise of power. Earlier, the respondent had released Somaji Bhoyar on parole, despite the fact that he surrendered late by seven days. “Since the core issue involved in petition is in relation to refusal of parole to prisoners, it needs to be noted that the Supreme Court from time to time has held that criminal justice falls under the umbrella of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. A constant endeavour of the apex court has been to humanize prison administration by various pronouncements by laying emphasis on rights of a prisoner to integrity of his physical and mental personality,” the court said. The bench pointed out that the first indicator of SP’s arbitrariness was noted in HC’s order of November 25, 2020, where justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote directed him to remain cautious in performing his duty and refrain from any attempt of giving false information or misleading the court while filing his reply on affidavit in future. The second instance came after justices Zaka Haq (retired) and Amit Borkar took a suo motu cognizance and filed a contempt plea against Kumre on February 26, on his refusal to release a jail inmate on bail in spite of its specific order. Though HC accepted his unconditional apology, an entry about the case was registered into his service book so that “officer of such high rank does not commit such a blunder”. “One more instance of his high handed behaviour was brought to the fore by the prisoner by writing a letter to HC on August 10, where he disclosed that jail inmates here were not communicated of their right of being released on emergency parole, though those in Pune and Nashik have been released on emergency parole,” the HC said. Justices Deshpande and Borkar then directed Kumre to file an affidavit providing details of prisoners, who were released on emergency parole. “On a close scrutiny of various affidavits filed by SP, we noticed some glaring contradictions which give an impression that he exercised his power in an arbitrary manner based on extraneous consideration. This shows an attempt on his part to mislead this court by stating incorrect facts on record on oath. Taking into consideration the previous conduct as noted on earlier two occasions, it is necessary that this court should take a strict view of the contradictory statement of facts which has material bearing on the issue involved,” the judges said. What HC said * Selected prisoners picked up by the jail authorities to inform about their right of being released on emergency parole * Remaining ones were not made aware of their right and kept away from applying for parole even after one-and-a half year * Some glaring contradictions noticed on a close scrutiny of various affidavits filed by SP * It gives impression that he exercised his power in arbitrary manner based on extraneous consideration * It shows an attempt on his part to mislead by stating incorrect facts on record on oath||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/sorry-state-of-affairs-in-nagpur-jail-hc/articleshow/87245010.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Goa||Don Bosco engg students design device to predict vulnerability to cardiac disease||Panaji: A group of students from the department of electronics and telecommunication engineering at Don Bosco College of Engineering, Fatorda, have designed an ‘ambulatory blood pressure monitoring system’ (ABPM), which can predict whether the patient has chances of suffering from cardiac disease in the future. The project has received funding from Goa State Innovation Council (GSInC). Using machine learning technology, the students, Valini D’Silva, Gautam Desai, Krystal Fernandes and Velton D’Silva, under assistant professors Anisha Cotta and Samantha Cardoso designed the device. The ABPM is a 24-hour continuous blood pressure monitoring device designed to monitor the BP of a patient and to predict if there is any possibility of the patient suffering from mild or chronic hypertension and cardiac disease in the present or in near future, the students explained. “The 24-hour BP data of a patient is stored in the cloud so that the doctor and the patient can view it anytime and anywhere. With the help of mathematical models that are implemented, the medical professional can analyse if the patient has any problems in his physical well-being, daily diet routine, etc. The device helps reduce the doctor’s workload, especially amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, as it is a fully automated system,” Valini said. An automatic email can be generated and sent to the doctor containing the predictions obtained from the machine, the students said. Another group of students, Suyog Borker, Adarsh Mishra and Miti Gaunekar, under guidance of assistant professors Mathilda Colaco and Anisha Cotta have similarly devised a ‘non-invasive body vitalities checking system’. This device can measure multiple health parameters using a single device non-invasively. “The project combines three parameters - blood glucose, blood pressure, and heart rate - to give out well-calibrated results in a short span of time. The results get displayed on a user-friendly mobile app accessible to the owner and doctors. The device has an accuracy of above 90% for all its parameters and is easy to use, painless and environmentally friendly,” Cotta said. With menstrual hygiene in mind, a third group of students from the same college, Viresh Vallabh Rao Valaulikar, Ninad Sambhaji Gaikwad, Siddhant Santosh Gurav and Shahil Ibrahim Ameer have designed an automated sanitary napkin dispenser. This dispenser is unique because it has a two-way payment system that accepts both coins and digital payments. Assistant professors Trima Fernandes e Fizardo and Kimberly Morais guided the students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/don-bosco-engg-students-design-device-to-predict-vulnerability-to-cardiac-disease/articleshow/87245055.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Dark Diwali for sex workers as CP issues fresh prohibitory order||Nagpur: Sex workers at Ganga Jamuna cried foul about their forthcoming Diwali season plunging into darkness, with city police chief (CP) Amitesh Kumar issuing fresh prohibitory orders for customers at the red-light area last week. Kumar, who is gearing up for another round of intensive dialogue with sex workers this week, had stopped flesh trade at the red-light area on August 11. The measure was also hailed by the state home minister Dilip Walse Patil during his visit last week. The Ganga Jamuna locality is witnessing a deadlock now as the sex workers are refusing police’s offer of rehabilitation — with the cops acting as facilitators. The sex workers want to continue plying their trade, while cops want a complete stoppage of such activities, triggering a unique conflict of interest situation at the three-century-old red-light area. Having refused attempts of police to help them adopt alternative modes of livelihood, the sex workers are now squarely blaming the cops for denying happiness to them and their family during the Diwali festivities ahead. “We have no means of livelihood now. I could not purchase new clothes for my children. Forget Diwali, we have no tomorrow now,” said a sex worker, lamenting that her children were waiting at home for her to arrive with new clothes for them. CP Kumar said police had opened a single-window system for receiving applications from sex workers for rehabilitation, and made announcements for sex workers to come forward and seek support, but no one came forward. “We had thrown our arms open to help the sex workers since the beginning of this action, but none of them showed interest in anything other than illegally pursuing flesh trade, which is strange,” he said. Kumar said a renewed attempt would be made for an intensive dialogue with the sex workers. “Police will catalyse multi-agency efforts at Ganga Jamuna for extending various kinds of assistance to sex workers. We also aim to involve district legal services authority (DLSA) in the dialogue process,” said the CP. “We have now registered an offence following a complaint of a minor, narrating how was she trafficked here and sold. These type of illegal activities would not be tolerated,” said the top cop. According to a sex worker, cops from Ganga Jamuna police chowkie harass the few customers who stray into the lane, seeking service. “Sometimes we make some living out of one or two customers managing to reach us, but most of the times cops whisk them away, leaving us with nothing in hand at the end of the day,” said another sex worker. A police officer from Lakadganj police station said there was no question of allowing any customers at Ganga Jamuna with CP’s prohibitory notification in force.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/dark-diwali-for-sex-workers-as-cp-issues-fresh-prohibitory-order/articleshow/87245015.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||E-ricks make up 17.82% of passenger autos||Nagpur: Even though the government is strongly advocating and announcing perks for switching to the electric mode of transport from the conventional fuel mode, the sale and registration of e-rickshaws is slowly picking up. Only 17.82% e-rickshaws are plying on roads in spite of many exemptions being offered to battery-operated vehicles like paying registration fees, annual fitness fees etc. As per the data procured from the regional transport offices of both Nagpur city and deputy RTO east, the city has 22,506 registered auto rickshaws, while only 4,012 e-rickshaws have been given the nod to operate. Sources, however, estimate that around 2,000 e-rickshaws are plying in the city illegally. Dealers of e-rickshaw vehicles in the city claimed that it is picking up slowly. As per statistics obtained from the regional transport department, the sale of e-rickshaw picked up in 2019-20 as both the east and city office registered 869 battery-operated passenger vehicles. However, due to the pandemic, like other vehicles, e-rickshaws too witnessed a southward trend. Dealers say with rise in fuel prices, especially petrol (which is over Rs 111 per litre), the sale of battery-operated passenger vehicles would surely have a bright future in the city. Even maintenance cost is very less, they claimed. Dealers pointed out that an autorickshaw owner spends at least Rs10,000 to Rs 15,000 per year for various fees like Rs 600 for the fitness test, Rs 9,000 for insurance, Rs 200 for pollution under control certificate, whereas for battery operated-vehicles there is no such fees. TOI toured many localities in the city and found that these e-rickshaws are more in use in old city localities, including Gandhibagh and Mahal areas, as a last mile connectivity. Even in north Nagpur, a large number of battery-operated rickhsaws were seen becoming a preference as a local mode of transportation. With autorickshaw drivers fleecing customers and inadequate Aapli Bus service, citizens from north, east and central Nagpur feel e-rickshaws have brought great relief. Commuters say an e-rickshaw is the most convenient mode of transport in this part of the city. With no city bus service in many localities, e-rickshaws have come a very affordable alternative. They charge between Rs5 and Rs10, depending on the distance. Endorsing commuters, Congress corproator Manoj Sangole pointed out that in North Nagpur, e-rickshaw drivers are flocking routes such as Sugat Nagar Chowk, Teka Naka, Samta Nagar Chowk etc. Similar is the scenario in east and central Nagpur. Even in old city areas, it has become an affordable option. However, when the government had authorized e-rickshaws to operate on city roads, the RTO had taken a decision not to allow plying of battery-operated vehicles on busy and major thoroughfares, including Central Avenue, Wardha Road and Amravati Road. Despite the guidelines for e-rickshaws that the vehicles can operate only in internal lanes, vehicles are seen operating even on main roads. Neither RTO nor the traffic police enforce the rules. * 22,506 registered auto rickshaws * 4,012 e-rickshaws * E-rickshaws allowed to ply on internal lanes only * Fare less compared to autos * Preferred in north, central & south Nagpur||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/e-ricks-make-up-17-82-of-passenger-autos/articleshow/87245018.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Need to stop tigers entering CSTPS, WCL areas: Panel||Nagpur: The recommendation of the technical committee report on tiger-human conflict to capture tigers in industrial areas like CSTPS and WCL and put them in zoos has not augured well with wildlife experts. The report was approved in the 17th state wildlife board (SWBL) meeting on October 12. In his submission to the PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye, SWBL member Kishor Rithe said, “The committee’s recommendation of dividing the entire Chandrapur district into zones was a good approach. However, the presence of resident tigers in areas like CSTPS and WCL which fall in Zone 4 needs to be discouraged.” Rithe feels there should be no extension. “The SBWL in its previous meeting has clearly asked the WCL/CSTPS to implement this decision. The expert committee could have explained the reasons behind not starting these works. The lease period of the underground and open cast mines of WCL and coal washeries should not be extended further,” he said. Though the report is comprehensive and covered almost all aspects, the past data on human-tiger conflict could have been used more efficiently to suggest the area-specific management interventions. The report has not thrown any light on whether males or females, adult or sub-adult tigers are involved in most of the negative interactions. Rithe said, “The report should have started considering the issues from core to buffer and from there to corridors. As per the NTCA guidelines of critical tiger habitat (CTH), a minimum inviolate space of 800-1000 sqkm should be maintained as core or CTH to support a viable population of tigers in a landscape. Hence, the area of the sanctuary or national parks should be established on the basis of scientific and objective criteria and to consider the scientific requirement of tigers.” On GIS maps and compensation, Rithe said, “The committee could have considered GIS maps based upon compensation records from 2005 to March 2020 and given a better understanding of the scenario in TATR-Bramhapuri-Wadsa landscapes. The incident locations were mapped but this does not provide any specific pattern. From this we can only deduce whether the incident took place inside the forest area, farmland, etc.” Regarding removal of tigers, Rithe said, “They should not be released in other areas. Experience has shown that all attempts to rehabilitate problem tigers have failed in the past. There are few success stories. Hence, the PCCF (wildlife) set up a committee to decide whether the animal needs to be released back into the wild or to be sent to captivity. The same approach should be continued.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/need-to-stop-tigers-entering-cstps-wcl-areas-panel/articleshow/87245039.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Politicians, patients, all those who had come in contact with Desai during his eight-year stint in GMC paid rich tributes. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said, “Saddened to learn about the demise of eminent cardiologist Dr Manjunath Desai. His medical skills saved the lives of thousands of patients. My deepest condolences to his family.” Health minister Vishwajit Rane said, “The demise of Dr Manjunath Desai is not only a loss to GMC, but it is a personal loss to me. He was an exceptional and wonderful person inside out who has touched so many lives. It is a great loss to Goa. We will miss Dr Manjunath!” Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat said that he was shocked by the passing away of one of the most respected, kindhearted young cardiologists of Goa. “Thank you, Dr Manjunath Desai, for saving so many lives. You will remain in our hearts forever. My condolences to his family, friends and patients.” Dr Shekhar Salkar said Desai was one of the cardiologists who was instrumental in setting up GMC’s cardiology department and appealed to the Goa government to consider naming GMC’s cardiologist department and catheterisation laboratory after Desai to remember his contribution to the facility.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/his-skills-saved-lives-of-thousands/articleshow/87245101.cms||---

In Atladara area of the city, things turned a tad ugly between a couple as the wife became jealous of reactions from women that her husband’s social media posts were attracting. The couple had their individual social media profiles and they used to regularly post there. For a long time, the woman had been noticing that within minutes of her husband putting up something on his social media account, women used to ‘like’ his posts. On October 22, the woman lost her patience out of jealousy and snatched away his phone. His wife’s action provoked the husband and they had a heated argument over it. Situation escalated when the man resorted to violence and beat his wife. Following the violence, the woman called Abhayam helpline and sought help as her husband was beating her. It was only when the helpline counsellors reached their home, they realized the situation. “Firstly, we warned the man to not beat his wife again or else he will have to face the law. And we told the woman to not misinterpret anything of what she notices on social media,” said a counsellor. The woman also told that if she has doubts over various other women’s reactions to her husband’s social media posts, then she should openly talk to her husband and clear all doubts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/wife-dislikes-womens-likes-on-hubbys-social-media/articleshow/87243745.cms||---
---||World||Facebook leaked papers show company didn’t act to stop Capitol riot calls||WASHINGTON: Sixteen months before last November’s presidential election, a researcher at Facebook described an alarming development. She was getting content about the conspiracy theory QAnon within a week of opening an experimental account, she wrote in an internal report. On November 5, two days after the election, another Facebook staffer posted a message alerting colleagues that comments with “combustible election misinformation” were visible below many posts. Four days after that, a company data scientist wrote in a note to his co-workers that 10% of all US views of political material — a startlingly high figure — were of posts that alleged the vote was fraudulent.  In each case, Facebook’s staffers sounded an alarm about misinformation and inflammatory content on the site and urged action — but the company failed or struggled toaddress the issues. New internal Facebook documents provided by former employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen provide a glimpse into how the firm appears to have stumbled into the January 6 riot. It quickly became clear that even after years under the microscope for insufficiently policing its platform, the firm had missed how riot participants spent weeks vowing — on Facebook itself — to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s election victory. Facebook has blamed the proliferation of poll falsehoods on former President Donald Trump and other social platforms. In January, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, said the January 6 Capitol riot was “largely organised on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate.” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, told lawmakers in March the firm “did our part to secure the integrity of our election”. But the documents show the degree to which Facebook knew of extremist groups on its site that were trying to polarise American voters . What the papers do not offer is a complete picture of decision-making inside Facebook. Some internal studies suggested that the firm struggled to exert control over how quickly information spread, while other reports hinted that Facebook was concerned about losing engagement. Yet what was unmistakable was that Facebook’s own employees believed the social network could have done more.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/facebook-leaked-papers-show-company-didnt-act-to-stop-capitol-riot-calls/articleshow/87246042.cms||---

The US National Hurricane Center said Rick had winds as high as 85 miles per hour (140 kph) and was expected to hit somewhere around the seaport of Lazaro Cardenas and the resort of Zihuatanejo. However, the hurricane's winds and rain could also affect the larger resort of Acapulco to the east. The hurricane was centred about 95 miles (155 kilometers) south of Zihuatanejo at midafternoon and was moving north at 5 mph (7 kph). The centre warned that Rick could produce flash floods and mudslides in the mountainous terrain on the coast. "During its passage over land, it will cause intense to torrential rains and possible mudslides and flooding, as well as rising levels in streams and rivers, in the states of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco," Mexico's National Water Commission said in a statement. The seaport of Lazaro Cardenas said it had opened six emergency shelters for residents who might want to leave low-lying areas. The neighbouring state of Guerrero said rains and wind had already knocked over some trees and damaged a road.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hurricane-rick-heads-toward-mexicos-pacific-coast/articleshow/87246231.cms||---

As a result, patients are compelled to approach the private radiology centres to get their MRI done which costs up to Rs10,000. The GMCH administration has failed to act despite repeated requests. Irked by this, people under the banner of Seva Foundation group, staged peaceful protests in front of the main gate of GMCH on Sunday. “After making requests to the government and administration for the last two years and despite the orders of the high court, no decision has been taken by the administration about the MRI machine. Poor patients coming to GMCH are being exploited financially and mentally,” said Raj Khandare, president of Seva Foundation. Non-availability of the MRI machine is affecting not only the patients but also doctors of radiology department. A resident doctor told TOI that they are unable to get hands-on experience of performing MRI as the machine is not available. The doctors doing MD and MS are also facing academic loss. In 2008, GMCH was the first government medical college in Vidarbha to have an MRI machine. It was functional for 10 years as per the contract with the service provider. After the contract ended in 2018 and the old MRI machine developed technical glitches, the administration decided to order new and advanced MRI machine in GMCH. The procurement process is still pending. Poor patients who can’t afford the MRI in private set up have to go to the Mayo Hospital. Officials at GMCH told TOI that the medical college has already deposited Rs15 crore for the MRI machine with the Haffkine Institute. But Haffkine is still to procure the machine. Recently, the Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court had rapped both the GMCH and Haffkine for the delay. Several other social organizations also supported the agitation. George Joseph of Ajni Vann initiative, activists Anusuya Kale, Sanjay Lahane, Kunal Maurya, Beti Shakti Foundation’s Sanjay Ade and Saidoot Parivar’s Anoop Muratkar also participated in the protest with their supporters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/protest-in-front-of-gmch-over-plight-of-patients-in-absence-of-mri-machine/articleshow/87244570.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

As per sources in the education department, local body school teachers in rural areas say that parents in villages are keen on sending their kids back to school. So far, only Std V-XII are permitted for physical classes in rural areas. In urban areas, Std VIII-XII have been allowed. Gaikwad tweeted that some zilla parishad (ZP) CEOs who were present in the review meet urged her to consider primary school reopening. The minister assured them that she would take up the issue with the chief minister’s office. In Vidarbha, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur district teachers have been pushing for reopening of primary schools since the start of the academic session. A ZP school teacher in Bhamragarh taluka of Gadchiroli said, “These kids anyway spend their entire day together in the village. Our teachers are visiting villages and conducting ‘home study’ sessions because we can’t keep these kids away from the education ecosystem.” Another teacher, who visits villages for these home study sessions, said, “I do not see the logic of keeping primary school closed now. They are already sitting together in somebody’s frontyard when I go there to hold these study sessions. This entire thing can be done inside a school too; what’s the difference? The state government is unnecessarily prolonging decisions and harming the students’ future.” In September, TOI had reported how even Unicef warned about a ‘generational catastrophe’ if schools continue to remain closed. A ZP teacher in Chandrapur, where majority of the students are from tribal community, said, “Those in Mumbai who make these decisions must look at the environment our kids live in. Majority of these kids’ parents only have school-level education, while some kids have illiterate parents too. The academic impetus is not there, and the longer these kids stay away from school, more the chances of them dropping out.” Sources in the education department say the reopening of primary section is impossible before Diwali, as authorities will first check if the festive season leads to a surge in number of cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/rural-areas-push-for-reopening-primary-schools/articleshow/87244583.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

He informed that Haryana state has taken a strategic policy to discontinue online school. “Online school is not even an option in Haryana. The state government has started schools for all classes and all kids are doing well,” he said. NNF president and acclaimed paediatrician Dr Ranjan Kumar Pejaver said Karnataka too has allowed reopening of primary schools from Monday. “There is no risk in opening schools as far as teachers and staffs are fully vaccinated. Children have learned to follow distancing and are accustomed to wearing masks. Parents and caretakers should also get vaccinated and all will be well,” he said. From October 23, Nagpur is hosting a conference of paediatricians ‘Neocon-2021’, the first major medical event in physical format after Covid-19. “As paediatricians, we have made it a point to have this conference in physical format instead of going virtual, just to instil confidence in people that the time to move towards normalcy is here,” said Dr Vijay Dhote, president of Nagpur Academy of Paediatricians (AOP). Veteran paediatrician Dr Satish Deopujari, who delivered Dr DG Gan oration, reasserted that there is no risk in sending kids to schools. “We have come all this way in the pandemic and now we understand this virus very well. Children are mostly safe. Majority of them have already been infected and recovered without even showing symptoms. Parents should send their wards to schools without any hesitation,” said Dr Deopujari. The paediatricians are discussing mainly neonatal intensive care in this conference. “Our aim is to bring down neonatal death rate in India from 20 per 1,000 to less than 10 per 1,000 live births by 2030,” said Dr Uday Bodhankar, patron of Nagpur AOP. For this, doctors have suggested simple educative measures like at least four hospital visits for a expecting mother during 9 months of pregnancy, encouraging institutional deliveries, and creating awareness about factors like kangaroo mother care in common people. BOX School Chale Hum Paediatricians confident children are mostly safe from Covid-19 Schools and physical interaction must for social, mental and psychological growth There is no harm in starting schools right away for even primary classes Parents should allow wards to join schools without any hesitation No need to wait for children’s Covid-19 vaccine as it will be launched in phase wise manner||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/over-60-kids-have-natural-antibodies-start-schools-immediately-say-doctors/articleshow/87244614.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Vadodara||MSU’s novel attempt to curb leopard-human conflicts||VADODARA: Leopard attacks which have held frightened residents of many districts in south Gujarat in suspended animation for the past several years, may finally get some relief. A study to understand and tackle the human-leopard conflict in Surat and Tapi has been initiated by the forest department jointly with M S University’s zoology department. The Gujarat Forestry Research Foundation (GFRF) has given a grant of Rs 20 lakh for the one-year first-of-its-kind project titled, ‘Ecology of Leopard in relation with prey abundance and land use pattern in Surat district, Gujarat’.  The population of leopards too has shot up by 30 per cent in the last 10 years in Gujarat which is posing a serious challenge for its co-existence with humans,” said Dr Chandni Valodkar of MSU’s zoology department and co-investigator in the project who had prepared and proposed the study to the GFRF. “The study aims at conservation and management planning of leopards in Surat and Tapi, and assessment of current threat levels. We will carry out a census of the leopards, study its feeding habits and determine their movement patterns to find mitigation measures for reducing man-leopard conflict in Surat and Tapi,” Valokdar told TOI. According to the researcher, the studies on the population status, prey abundance, land use and movement patterns of the species, are inadequate especially from Surat district which reports high rate of leopard-man conflict. To effectively conserve and manage the species, socio-spatial data is required from the diverse array of habitats and land-use systems in which they occur,” she said. Valodkar is doing the research jointly with Dr Chandni Roy from the same department. “The study will continue for one year following which we will prepare a report and submit it to GFRF. The idea is to ensure safety of both humans and leopards in this region,” Valodkar added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/msus-novel-attempt-to-curb-leopard-human-conflicts/articleshow/87243772.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Nagpur||State govt rapped for delay in installing MRI machine, fire equipment in GMCH, IGGMCH||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Friday flayed the Maharashtra government for failing to install an MRI machine at the government medical college and hospital (GMCH) despite orders (July 23) to do so within three months. The court also directed the government to float tenders in three weeks’ time. While hearing a petition (WP No. 3427/2000) wherein amicus curiae Anup Gilda pointed out the lack of efforts on the government’s part in procuring the MRI machine and not taking adequate fire preventive measures at GMCH and Indira Gandhi government medical college and hospital (IGGMCH), a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor further censured the authorities for delay in sanctioning funds for the installation of fire safety equipment. “We expect that the tender process for the MRI scan would be completed as expeditiously as possible and preferably within three weeks. To have clarity in the matter, we would like the government to place a calendar of events like opening of the price bids, their consideration and finalization, selection of the appropriate bidder, execution of the agreement and placing of the purchase order with dates given in respect of each of these events,” ruled the bench. The judges added that price bids are yet to be opened and that means there is still a long way to go before the tender process is completed in all respects. Earlier, additional government pleader Deepak Thakare contended that the delay for installation of the fire safety machinery took place because several procedures on the administrative side were required to be completed and for each, a certain time was required. He said now, most of those have been completed and in the next two weeks, administrative approval would be granted for providing funds. “We request Thakare to place before the court the calendar of events as indicated. As regards the directives given for sanction of Rs20 crore and Rs 7.27 crore for GMCH and IGGMCH respectively for installation of fire safety machinery and other necessary measures, we find again that here also, some delay has taken place in fund sanctioning,” the judges said. The bench directed the government to grant administrative approvals regarding the expenditure for installation of fire safety machinery at both government hospitals within two weeks. “The state needs to accord financial sanction in two weeks from the date of granting administrative approvals and release funds as per the rules. Immediately after granting of financial sanction, work for installation of fire safety measures and machinery should be undertaken by the concerned departments and completed as early as possible,” the justices said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/state-govt-rapped-for-delay-in-installing-mri-machine-fire-equipment-in-gmch-iggmch/articleshow/87244525.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Paid jabs down by 2/3rds, private hospitals in Maharashtra stuck with 47 lakh vax doses||MUMBAI: More than 47 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses are available with the private healthcare sector in the state as paid immunisation has hit a record low in October. Where once there used to be serpentine queues at many private hospitals, people are now having to wait for beneficiaries to gather in sufficient numbers before a vial is opened. In Mumbai, private sector vaccination has dropped by 73% in October over September. The daily average of private vaccinations in the state has dropped to under 25,000 lately, almost a third of the average during the peak. "The private sector has been administering 18,000 to 24,000 doses per day of late," Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary (health), said. While vaccination has slowed down at free centres too, the drop has been stark in the paid facilities, giving rise to concerns of doses going waste. Sources said some hospitals are also offering vaccine stocks to other centres at discounted rates. Considering the current rate of vaccination, it could take the private sector six months or more to exhaust the 47 lakh doses-most lying with Mumbai hospitals. Experts believe the state must find a way to mobilise the doses given that nearly 2.6 crore people are yet to get a single shot. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, an advisor to the state, said the state must give private hospitals a choice to either utilise the doses in the next one month or hand these over to the district health authority. Paid vaccine doses in city down by 73% this monthDr Salunkhe said: "The vaccine doses lying with private hospitals or providers must not be allowed to expire. Compensation or reimbursement should be arranged by the government of India to the concerned hospital (for handing over doses to the district health authority)." Mumbai, which has seen the highest share of paid vaccinations in the state, has seen the sharpest drop. Fewer than three lakh doses have been given at private centres in October, a 73% drop from September, when 11.1 lakh doses were administered. In August too, 11 lakh paid doses were given in Mumbai. Several hospital heads told TOI that they have stopped ordering fresh supplies given the lack of demand. Hospitals in Maharashtra have procured the highest number of doses in the country. Till the first week of October, private hospitals had administered more than 1.2 crore doses in the state. Mumbai saw the highest paid vaccinations (55.36 lakh), followed by Pune (40 lakh) and Thane (20 lakh). State officials said the lion's share of the 47 lakh doses in Maharashtra was lying with a handful of hospitals in Mumbai. In Mumbai, private doses are mainly being utilised under corporate social responsibility (CSR), said a hospital head. Joy Chakraborty, COO of PD Hinduja Hospital, said that barring CSR, the demand for paid vaccination is all but over. "People who can afford vaccination have already taken the doses. Most hospitals are not ordering fresh stocks now," he said. In Chakraborty's opinion, the demand for paid vaccination could see a revival only if the government approves a third shot for healthcare workers and immunocompromised people in 2022. At Hinduja, the daily vaccinations have dropped from 2,000 to 300 at present. Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital, who is facilitating vaccination under CSR, said that only those who cannot afford it or are unwilling to get vaccinated are left to receive doses in cities like Mumbai. He said hospitals would be willing to vaccinate outside Mumbai or bigger cities provided there was a demand for paid shots. "We don't think vaccines will be wasted. Now, hospitals are also allowed to transfer doses to other centres if they need it," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/paid-jabs-down-by-2/3rds-private-hospitals-in-maharashtra-stuck-with-47-lakh-vax-doses/articleshow/87246346.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Nagpur||I-T raids on onion traders, Rs24Cr cash seized||Nagpur: Income tax (I-T) raids on onion traders of Pimpalgaon in Nashik district has led to seizure of over Rs24 crore in cash. This is pegged to be the biggest haul during the recent times in the state, said sources. The action has also led to detection of unaccounted income to the tune of Rs100 crore, out of which the tax sleuths have got disclosure for Rs50 crore. This means the traders will be paying tax on the disclosed amount, while further assessment will continue for the remaining. Ten onion traders were covered in the raids. The action comes under the office of income tax department principal director (investigation) at Nagpur. The implementation took place from Nashik investigation unit. The raids are also reported to have made onions cheaper. The action began on Thursday and since last week, onion prices have come down by Rs10, touching Rs30 a kg. This is because the traders also began offloading the stock allegedly hoarded to be sold at a later date. Traders, who accepted the prices easing, also said fresh arrivals in the market have also impacted the rates. The action by taxmen has also exposed a practice by traders which not only left the farmers getting poor rate for their produce, but also made onions costlier for the consumers. Payment for purchase of agriculture commodity like onions can be made in cash. Taking advantage of this, the traders were found recording huge amount of cash paid towards onion purchases in their books. Even as huge payments were booked against individual farmer’s names, it did not lead to any tax liability on them. This is because agriculture income is exempt from tax. However, the farmers actually got small amount in hand. Showing purchases at higher rates in the books helped traders reduce their own income and cutting short the tax liability. Here is an example how it worked. A farmer was paid Rs10 a kg in cash for the produce. This was the final rate for the grower. However, in the books, the amount was inflated to say Rs30/kg. So finally, if the onions were sold further at Rs35 a kg, the profit on record would be Rs5 per kg. Though, actually the profit was much higher, but not disclosed. Taxmen are learnt to have come across evidence of real estate purchases through the unaccounted income. The dealings were spread across period of more than a year. Even as it was not part of the taxmen’s mandate, instances of hoarding of onions has also come to fore. The same stock is being liquidated after the raids, bringing down the rates, said sources. The taxmen have been keeping an eye on onion traders for the last several years. However, major success has been achieved only now, said sources. In less than a couple of months, cash to the tune of Rs30 crore has been seized through actions taken under the Nagpur office of principal director of investigation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/i-t-raids-on-onion-traders-rs24cr-cash-seized/articleshow/87244835.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Goa||Haphazard devpt, reclamations impact city’s mangrove ecology||Panaji: Large patches of an extensive mangrove forest along NH 66 in Merces and Santa Cruz are slowly dying. The cumulative impact of haphazard development and reclamations over a few decades appears to be taking a toll on the local ecology. The vast khazan, comprising agricultural land in Panaji, Ribandar, Chimbel, Merces, Santa Cruz and Taleigao, was a contiguous ecosystem before it was badly bisected by landfilling for a network of roads, highways and other infrastructure since 1970s. The dense patch of mangroves, at the centre of the khazan is losing its foliage and scores of trees are already dead or dying. “There is no influx of saline water feeding and flooding the mangroves,” Merces biodiversity management committee member Michael Felix Dias said. After the Panaji bus terminus was laid on the khazan’s northern rim in late 1970s, more paddy fields were buried for EDC Patto Plaza and later, for the Bambolim bypass in the late 1980s. The recent highway expansion, as well as the illegal landfilling that insensitively ignored the ecosystem’s water flow dynamics, is showing adverse impacts. “The new highway has blocked pre-existing channels and smaller creeks, curbing total flushing by regular tides. Daily supply of nutrients by diurnal tides has stopped,” said Antonio Mascarenhas, a former member of the Goa state biodiversity board. Mangrove formation in paddy fields itself is a process of atrophication triggered by non-cultivation of fields. Once a granary of food and fish for farmers, neglect and unscientific planning is triggering the degradation of an ingeniously engineered agricultural system. “The vast field area with interlinked water bodies in five villages and the city formed a composite ecosystem. The authorities, while planning the infrastructure including the bus terminus, did not assess the environmental damage or think of minimising it,” Dias said. Natural factors could also be wreaking damage, others point out. “Around this time, a teak moth, Hyblaea puera, at its caterpillar stage attacks Avecinnia marina species of mangroves, consuming all its foliage. After a few days, foliage reappears,” Vinod Dhargalkar, executive secretary of the Mangrove Society of India said. But Dhargalkar doesn’t rule out pollution of the water and other factors. Sources said that the water resources department has drawn water samples from the site, but no more details were available. On similar lines, Mascarenhas said that land-based sewage may have stagnated in blocked lagoons. “If so, the pneumatophores (specialised root structures) of the mangroves are likely to get poisoned. The issue needs a scientific field check,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/haphazard-devpt-reclamations-impact-citys-mangrove-ecology/articleshow/87244858.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Goa||Hospicio blood bank upgrade only after shift to South hosp||Panaji: The blood bank at Hospicio hospital in Margao will be upgraded to include components of blood once it is moved to the South Goa district hospital. Currently, the hospital’s blood bank only has provisions to stock whole blood, forcing patients and relatives in need of blood components to travel to Goa Medical College (GMC) or other blood banks in North Goa. “The blood bank cannot just shift to the new South Goa district hospital. It requires various approvals and procedures before it can function from there. It is being upgraded to include component therapy, which we don’t have in South Goa,” medical superintendent of the hospital, Dr Deepa Correia Afonso said. Components of blood — RBCs, platelets, etc — are usually required in bypass surgeries and dengue, cardiac and other cases where there is a request from the treating doctor. Besides GMC, the other government blood bank that stores blood components is at the Asilo hospital. All OPDs have already shifted to the new South Goa district hospital from the old Hospicio hospital except for casualty and surgery branches, which will be moving shortly. The South Goa district hospital has a separate casualty bay area where Covid-19 patients can get assessed. But admissions for Covid-19 patients have stopped with those requiring admission being referred to GMC much to the distress of citizens. Blood donation at Hospicio’s blood bank is slowly returning to normal. Donors who were not coming forward during the pandemic have begun to donate again. The hotel industry that used to undertake donation drives under corporate social responsibility have also restarted with hotels filing up again. The blood bank is hoping to get donations from colleges too, like it used to during pre-pandemic times. Although there was negligible donation during the pandemic, the requirement for blood had also dropped. The hospital also conducts various drives with around 6-8 held every month. With elections around the corner, additional blood donation drives are also being organised to the advantage of citizens.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hospicio-blood-bank-upgrade-only-after-shift-to-south-hosp/articleshow/87244878.cms||---

They have demanded that the government immediately scrap the MDS merit list that ‘illegally categorises’ students into two categories. The foundation has stated that the categorisation is without legal backing of law and without any direction from the government of Goa or Dental Council of India (DCI), as per RTI replies provided by the public information officer of the Goa Dental College. “The Goa Dental College illegally classifies eligible Goan domiciled students into Category A and B depending on their college of graduation whether in Goa or outside the state. This act of categorisation has no government directions nor brought about by any change in state regulations, though the DCI regulations do provide for such state privileges,” UGF president Dr Aashish Kamat stated. This illegal act has been carried out from the year 2017, putting in jeopardy the future of so many Goan students who secured higher ranking, eligibility and who had found mention in the merit list, Kamat said. “But these Goan students were subjected to Category B as they passed out from a college outside Goa and that too after the same categorisation not finding any mention in any of the prospectus details,” the foundation said. In the merit list for 2021-22, individuals from category B, who have secured 271, 323 and 586 NEET ranking should have logically figured in the first 10 in the merit list. But they have now been relegated to category B at unmentioned serial numbers of 21, 22, 23, without any chance of them getting selected for the nine seats available, the foundation stated. “If due action is not taken immediately by the Goa government, Goa Dental College and the DCI, then the UGF will be forced to pursue further legal action with the central and state vigilance as well as seek compensation for all the students who were illegally disqualified from undertaking PG studies in Goa due to the illegal categorisation,” UGF stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/pg-dental-merit-list-categories-illegal-and-arbitrary-scrap-it/articleshow/87244911.cms||---

The total cost of the project has gone up to Rs 2,615 crore because of delays due to judicial proceedings and the pandemic. Director of civil aviation Suresh Shanbhogue said that the aviation skill development centre will be inaugurated next month. “As per the report submitted by the GMR Goa International Airport Limited (GGIAL), 40% work of the airport has been completed till September,” he said. Shanbhogue said that work on the runway and building the air traffic control tower are going on simultaneously with the runway work is in the last stage. He said that the biggest aircraft can land in Goa once the airport is commissioned. An official said that even after the infrastructure is ready, it takes around six months to secure all the necessary permissions and clearances from all the authorities to start operations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the new greenfield international airport next year. GMR Airports Ltd, through its subsidiary GGIAL, is constructing the greenfield airport at the Mopa plateau in Pernem taluka. As per the concession agreement, the GGIAL will have the right to operate the business for 40 years, extendable by another 20 years. The airport project will be completed in four phases. Construction of the second phase will commence only after 80% of the passenger traffic is handled. In 2018, the Centre had given an in-principle approval for the construction of an 8km-long highway from Dhargali to Varconda. The project’s pace has been stalled by court proceedings, including judicial stay orders due to environmental issues. On January 16, 2020, the Supreme Court upheld the project’s environmental clearance (EC) and allowed construction to resume. The Prime Minister on Saturday said that the double-engine government at the Centre and the state is focusing on infrastructure development in villages, urban and coastal belt and projects like the second airport at Mopa, logistics hub, second largest cable stay bridge and expansion of national highways will provide new dimensions for national and international connectivity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/mopa-airport-40-complete-runway-work-in-final-stage/articleshow/87244891.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Another 22 inmates, all male, received their second jabs at the two shelter homes run by the NGO Street Providence. The NGO has tied up with the directorate of health services and is reaching out to other unvaccinated persons with disabilities, those who are bedridden and housebound at old-age homes, rehabilitation homes and shelter homes, providing them with transport and support to get them vaccinated. “Our NGO will bear the transportation cost in case there is a need for transportation, especially in far flung and remote places in Goa. The directorate of health services is going all out to help persons with disabilities, we are only mobilising the vaccination for them,” said Donald Fernandes of Street Providence that has close to 100 persons with disability at five of its shelter homes. Those who haven’t been vaccinated are requested to reach out to their local health centres or government hospital or get in touch with the NGO at 8380097564. The NGO is also helping persons with disabilities with formalities required to get their disability certificate and Unique Disability Identity (UDID) cards without any charges. “Our main purpose is that as many persons with disabilities as possible get their disability certificate and UDID cards made free of cost,” Fernandes said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/22-disabled-persons-get-fully-vaccinated-22-take-first-shot/articleshow/87244940.cms||---

---||Goa||North Goa police set to conduct survey of overstaying foreigners||PANAJI: North Goa police have decided to conduct a survey to identify foreigners involved in crime and residing without valid documents in the state. With footfalls of overseas tourist set to commence, North Goa police said that they want to act against these foreigners first. “Legal action will be taken against those foreigners who are involved in crime, residing in the state without documents and overstaying,” North Goa SP Shobhit Saxena said. To improve safety and security measures for tourists, Goa police have also decided to increase 24-hour pickets in coastal areas where more crimes are reported from. Police said that they have already mapped such places and that they will review all areas on a monthly basis to check for the crime rate there. The department has also decided to deploy additional staff where needed, to maintain law and order. As per the statistics report issued by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2020, the cases of crimes involving foreigners in Goa are around eight times that committed against them. Goa recorded 11 cases of crimes against foreigners last year as opposed to 80 cases of offences committed by them. The country as a whole saw a total 127 cases of crimes against foreigners as against 1,754 cases where the foreigners were involved in crime. NCRB said that there has been a decrease in crimes against foreigners as also crimes committed by foreigners, which Goa Police attributed to the pandemic saying that a negligible number of foreign tourists visited the state during this period. In 2019, 21 cases of crimes against foreigners were reported as compared to 110 cases of offences committed by them. In Goa, Russians and Nigerians are mostly involved in narcotics cases. As there are more foreigners involved in crime, the state government has opened a detention centre for them at Mapusa. To keep a check on habitual offenders, history-sheeters and to ensure the safety of citizens, Goa police have decided to conduct round-the-clock patrolling in coastal as well as urban areas. Police said that additional staff have been deployed for beat policing. Police said that they will also take action against illegal activities in the tourism belt.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/north-goa-police-set-to-conduct-survey-of-overstaying-foreigners/articleshow/87244947.cms||Murari Shetye

Dhankhar had been in Darjeeling from October 12 as part of a 2-week visit to north Bengal. He got a fever while in the Hills and was advised to take a blood test. Sources said the governor wanted to go to Delhi for his health and reached the capital on Friday. He underwent the blood test on Saturday. Dhankhar is currently staying at Banga Bhavan, where doctors are keeping a close watch on him and say he is stable. They were not clear, however, on whether the governor had contracted the disease in Delhi or Darjeeling.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dhankhar-tests-positive-for-malaria/articleshow/87244669.cms||---
---||Kolkata||PM Narendra Modi’s 100-crore vaccination brag, Covaxin silence double jumla: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||SILIGURI: Dubbing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 100-crore vaccination speech and silence over WHO’s approval for Covaxin as “double jumla”, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday said “self-praise and utensil-banging” should be saved for after India’s eligible population was fully vaccinated, and after the Centre took up the Covaxin issue with WHO. Speaking at a Bijoya gathering in Siliguri, Banerjee minced no words about BJP’s “silence” on spiralling fuel prices. “Should households go back to using cowdung cakes and coal?” she asked. Banerjee said it was misleading to harp on the 100-crore figure, as not all of it was full vaccinations. “Around 30 crore people of the 130 crore people have been completely vaccinated; 71 crore have received only their first dose,” she said, adding, “Until fully vaccinated, no one is safe. Unless given both doses, we cannot say people are fully vaccinated. It is too early to clang utensils and clap.” Referring to issue of a WHO approval to Covaxin for international travel, she said: “The Prime Minister has taken Covaxin. He had been to the US, while students and industrialists (who have taken Covaxin) could not. They can’t go for studies or work. Even elderly people who need to go to meet their children can’t. I have referred to this in my letter to the PM and even spoke about this in the CMs’ meeting. This issue needs to be resolved quickly.... The Centre needs to get it approved by WHO.” The CM said Bengal was “number one” in vaccinating citizens. “In Bengal, we need 14 crore doses. We have received around seven crore vaccines; we have vaccinated seven crore people. Our health workers have ensured not a single dose was wasted. Over five crore received their first dose, the rest both doses. In Kolkata and Siliguri, 40% people have been completely vaccinated.” We need to be very careful over the next two months. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have received more vaccines. Bengal, being more populated than other states, is like the neglected third child, and received less vaccine.” Banerjee said most people were “sad during the festive season” as the fuel price-hike was “unending”. “But not a word is being said on that. I know it is stinging every household. What do the Centre really want? No one is bothered. Ujjwala (Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, for offering LPG connections to impoverished families) has vanished. Do they want us to start using cowdung cakes and coal?” She also spoke about Tripura. “Bengal hasn’t become a Tripura. They beat people at will in Tripura, then deny them treatment and talk of human rights in Bengal. Last night, we had to bring an assaulted party leader to SSKM Hospital. They don’t allow people for meetings and rallies. They don’t let people go to UP. Charity, for them, should begin at home. They have even assaulted Santosh Mohan Dev’s daughter (MP Sushmita Dev),” she said. The CM also spoke about increased territorial jurisdiction for the BSF. “We are on very good terms with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. There is no problem. Why incite a problem? Earlier, BSF could act within 15 kilometres; now they can do so within 50 kilometres. I have nothing against central agencies, but this is an attempt to slyly step into state territory. They want more. Their demands are never-ending,” she said, adding, “Would people want this in Jalpaiguri, Siliguri and Alipurduar?” Without directly referring to the BJP’s demand for UT status for north Bengal, Banerjee said: “We always need to stay together. A divided family doesn’t even respect their own. A stronger family keeps us secure. In time of crisis, it is only our own who rush to help.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/didi-modis-100-cr-vax-brag-covaxin-silence-double-jumla/articleshow/87245257.cms||Roshan Gupta
---||Kolkata||Big-bang shift: Cracker traders in West Bengal move to ‘greener’ business in uncertain Covid times||KOLKATA: Covid has done what years of persuasion and threats failed to do: the pandemic has forced hundreds of small-scale cracker manufacturers and traders to make a livelihood transition from a polluting industry fraught with environmental challenges and legal hurdles to embrace more viable options. Those who have made the switch to other trades were faced with no option after incurring huge losses last year, when there was hardly any sale of crackers and fireworks, both because people were in no mood for celebrations, and due to health concerns that a deteriorating air quality would accentuate the respiratory crisis caused by Covid, which had triggered a nationwide oxygen shortage. Though Champahati, Chingripota and Nungi — where fireworks manufacture has been a cottage industry for years — are still hubs of the trade, several of those who were involved in manufacture quit after last year’s financial setback. Sheikh Rezaul of Chingripota, South 24 Parganas, is one such example. The 45-year-old, who had been making and selling crackers since childhood, suffered a loss of over Rs 5 lakh last year. With moneylenders hounding him to repay the debt, Rezaul is unwilling to risk any further money in crackers. He has instead begun selling fruit in several parts of the city since July. “I have five kids at home, and needed some form of income to sustain my family. Hence, I shifted to the business of selling fruit,” Rezaul said.  “I still have firecrackers worth several lakh stocked at home, and my other family members are somehow trying to sell it off even with minimum profit. But I am not investing any further in that business,” Rezaul, who also cultivates fish in a local pond, added. Last year, Calcutta High Court had banned all sorts of fireworks for Kali Puja, Diwali and Chhath Puja in Bengal, in the wake of the severity of the pandemic, barely 10 days before Kali Puja, leading to losses of several lakhs for almost all small and big manufacturers and retailers in and around the city. Only “wax- or oil-based diyas” would be allowed, the court had said. By his own admission, 40-year-old Anil Das, a resident of Nungi — one of the largest unorganised firecracker hubs of the city — used to “eat, sleep and breathe” fireworks since childhood. But not any more. From this year, he has made the shift from a polluting industry to ferrying passengers in a non-polluting Toto between Nungi station and the fireworks market. “Making and selling fireworks was not an option, but it was the only source of livelihood most people in this area knew. I, too, was not an exception. But after suffering paramount losses last year, and with the future of the industry as uncertain as it can get, I have come out of the system. I am happy with my new job,” Das said. At the Burrabazar fireworks market last weekend, there were barely two shops selling basic firecrackers — all unsold products from last year — while the majority of shops wares were shut. “Marginal workers associated with the fireworks industry have started doing 100 days’ work but are not manufacturing crackers this year. Even bigger sellers haven’t procured any fresh items this year and are struggling to sell off cartons of fireworks left over from last year. The uncertainty about last-minute court orders and government diktat has jeopardized the entire industry and is discouraging small and bigger traders alike from investing any further in the business,” said Santanu Dutta, joint secretary, Burrabazar fireworks dealers’ association. According to an estimate, more than 1,10,000 people of Nungi, Champahati, Haral and Chingripota in South 24 Parganas used to be associated with the trade of firecrackers. However, according to the local firecrackers’ association, the number has come down significantly this year. Although an official guideline is yet to be issued by the state, Kolkata Police has been asking organisers and revellers to maintain the restrictions of last year, in which firecrackers were banned and pandal-entry was regulated. CM Mamata Banerjee has also urged people to show restraint during Diwali. In her Bijoya greetings, she urged everyone to be careful and sensitive while enjouying the festive season. Fireworks during Kali Puja and Diwali have been a cause for concern over air and noise pollution in the state, like in several other parts of India. Fireworks emit sulphur dioxide, various oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, all of which affect the lungs and can especially be harmful for Covid patients, said pulmonologist Kaushik Chowdhury. Green crusader Subhas Datta said he was glad that many had shifted out of a trade that caused pollution, adding the government and society needed to step forward and encourage the rest by providing them a chance to adopt an alternative livelihood. “Let’s grab the opportunity and try to make the transition as painless as possible for the people involved in the trade,” said Datta who has been campaigning for over two decades against various types of pollution caused by crackers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/big-bang-shift-cracker-traders-move-to-greener-biz-in-uncertain-cov-times/articleshow/87245293.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

A negligible rise in the number of new cases had raised a few eyebrows, but since then the curve has gone down. Besides, hardly any new cases being reported, the number of active cases in the city and district has hit numbers that existed at the beginning of the first wave of the pandemic. Since Friday, the number of active cases has remained at 11. It was only in the beginning of the first wave in March that the city and district had witnessed active cases at this number. The number of active cases in the city and district had reached 12 on September 16, after which the count kept growing. Currently, though, no new cases were reported for four consecutive days — from Tuesday to Friday. On Saturday, only one new case was reported. Officials of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) said that out of the 11 active cases only two needed hospitalization. One patient was admitted to the SSG Hospital (SSGH) while the other is being treated at a private hospital. Only the patient at SSGH is on oxygen support. “Presently, the situation is very much under control. Most of the patients are being treated at home,” said VMC’s medical officer health Dr Devesh Patel. Patel added that the reason for the significant decline in the number of patients needing hospitalization is still not known. Earlier, VMC data had hinted that vaccinated people were getting infected but hardly any of them needed hospitalization.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/no-alarming-spike-in-cases-after-festivities/articleshow/87243784.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Eye on polls, Uttar Pradesh mulls free ration till March 2022||LUCKNOW: As the state assembly elections are round the corner, political parties are promising freebies to win over voters. While the Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra announced smartphones and e-scooters for girls and slashing of electricity bills, among others, the Yogi Adityanath government has announced distribution of free tablets and smartphones among the youth. The state government is also working on a plan to ensure free ration among the poor till March next year as an extension to the existing central food distribution scheme, PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, which was launched in view of Covid-19 pandemic. The scheme is being run till November, as per the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Earlier, during meetings with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, MLAs and office-bearers of various regional organisations appreciated the impact of the ration distribution scheme and even suggested that a scheme should continue till March next year. According to sources, the CM had then not reacted to the feedback but during a meeting with Team-9, he directed the officials to chalk out a plan and work on the economics to find out if a similar scheme can be implemented at the state level. He asked the officials to draft a proposal at the earliest. In addition to the existing 3kg wheat and 2kg rice currently being given under the central government scheme, the state government is planning to add 1kg pulse, 1litre edible oil and a packet of salt. In June this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the free ration distribution scheme for ration card holders be extended till Diwali (November 4). The scheme was extended keeping in view the increasing number of Covid positive cases and restrictions imposed by various states. According to political analysts, the scheme, if extended, could be a gamechanger as it had already evoked a positive response from the masses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/eye-on-polls-up-mulls-free-rationdistribution-till-march-next-year/articleshow/87245186.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

The GRP team, under the supervision of SP M Rajkumar, had camped in Assam for 20 days to nab Nayanmuni Medhi (26), Deepjyoti Medhi (22) and Sanjay Rathi (28). It is learnt that around a dozen offences have been registered in Tamil Nadu against the gangsters. The GRP team comprising head constable Deepak Dorlikar, Ravindra Saoji and others under PI Vikas Kanpalliwar and sub-inspector Pravin Bhimte had managed to zero down upon the gangsters after they had robbed two women passengers near Gondia in August this year. Police said the gangsters would travel in AC coaches and also fly from one place to another to take trains before targeting co-passengers. “Police had managed to establish the identities of three robbers with the help of CCTV footage and reservation charts of the coaches in which they had travelled,” said a cop, who was part of the team. “IRCTC agent, who had booked tickets for the trio, was another source from whom police had managed to extract information including their phone numbers,” said the cop. Based on the information, police had tracked girlfriend of one of the robbers, with whose help they rounded him up. It was upon questioning that the criminal shared the whereabouts of his two aides, leading to their arrest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/3-from-assam-who-robbed-railway-passengers-arrested/articleshow/87244631.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Pursue ED, CBI, I-T probe into NMC works: Activist to Somaiya||Nagpur: Activist Anil Wadpalliwar has asked BJP leader Kirit Somaiya to take initiative for initiating probe into the works of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) through Enforcement Directorate (ED), CBI and Income Tax department. He also took a jibe at Somaiya for raising issues against non-BJP ruled states. Wadpalliwar in a letter sent to Somaiya said, “I have high hopes from you in the fight against corruption and abuse of power even as your detractors may dub you as politically-motivated only against non-BJP parties. As a true crusader against corruption, I request your focus on the Second Capital of the state, which is also headquarters of RSS and hometown of Union minister Nitin Gadkari and former CM Devendra Fadnavis.” The activist said an “erudite” activist like Somaiya should train his guns towards the NMC which is ruled by BJP from 2007 to till date. “During these 15 years, the state government had sanctioned around Rs11,000 crore for various developmental projects in the Second Capital, including cement road projects, flyovers, 24x7 water supply scheme, Smart City etc. But there is hardly any visible difference in city’s infrastructure or cyber-vigilance created by private vendor,” he said. He pointed out that in most of these projects, the CAG and auditors have raised strong objections. “Public perception about shoddy quality of works is reflected in media reports during the last 10 years. The NMC also spent money collected through property and various other taxes. All these works needs to be audited and looked into due to the pathetic condition of roads, non-functional street lights, shabby crematoriums, hospitals without any staff or equipment, schools without students etc,” said Wadpalliwar. Wadpalliwar said that a “financial genius” like Somaiya can easily find out the extent of corruption in the NMC. He also invited Somaiya to visit the city to conduct a first-hand inquiry and “persuade the centre agencies like ED, CBI and I-T department to expose these black sheeps and recover the public money siphoned under the garb of development works”. He was sure that BJP leader will take up the task without any delay and help Nagpurians. “I am an ordinary resident of the city who has steadfastly opposed corruption at every sphere of life, from loot by oil companies to abuse of power by civic agencies in distributing public utility lands, shocking dealings by coal companies and equally mind-boggling irregularities by power companies. I tried to do whatever little I can do through public interest litigations and RTI. ln the same spirit, I have high hopes from you in fight against corruption and abuse of power,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/pursue-ed-cbi-i-t-probe-into-nmc-works-activist-to-somaiya/articleshow/87244668.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Noida||Car with Congo students rams bus on eway, 2 tourists die||Greater Noida: Two tourists died and four, including three students from Congo, were injured after a Honda Civic cruising at 110kmph crashed into a mini bus parked off the Yamuna Expressway on Sunday morning. The accident occurred around 8am at a spot 5km from the Zero Point. A mini bus, carrying 14 tourists to Delhi from Agra, had broken down on the expressway and two of them — Swapan Bhattacharya (56) and Saheb Mandal (24) — had got off the vehicle to look for an alternative transport. They were standing behind the bus when the sedan rammed the vehicle from behind. Bhattacharya and Mandal were sandwiched in between the Civic and the mini bus. Police said that of the 14 tourists in the bus, nine were from Howrah district in West Bengal. They had gone to see the Taj Mahal and were on their way back to Delhi when the accident occurred. The three Congo nationals, who are students of a college in Greater Noida, had gone on a long drive and were returning to their flat when they rammed into the bus. All three — Lucy (23), John (25) and Dieumerci (25) — suffered grievous injuries and are being treated at a private hospital. The fourth person who was injured was a tourist — Mandal’s sister Sneha (18). “Dieumerci was driving the car at over 110kmph. He failed to slam the brakes in time and crashed into the bus,” said Avesh Malik, the investigating officer in the case. “Initial investigation has revealed that the group of tourists had come to Delhi on a vacation and gone to see the Taj Mahal, for which they had booked the mini bus. They were returning when their vehicle broke down near Zero Point. As they waited for a mechanic, two tourists got off the vehicle to see if they could find any other transport. They were standing behind the bus when the car rammed them,” he added. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the sedan being driven by the students had also grazed past a patrol vehicle just 150 metres from the spot where they crashed into the bus. The police are trying to find out if the three were under the influence of alcohol or drugs. So far, the cops haven’t found any such substance from their car. “We have received a written complaint from the family of the deceased. An FIR would be registered soon,” Malik said. Quoting passersby, the police said that while Bhattacharya and Mandal were sandwiched in between the two vehicles, Sneha was flung in the air and landed 15-20 metres away after being hit by the sedan. “The car was badly damaged. One of the students was trapped inside while the others could be pulled out. We had to use a cutter to bring him out, which took almost an hour. All of them are in hospital,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/car-with-congo-students-rams-bus-on-eway-2-tourists-die/articleshow/87244779.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Anupama S Chandran and Ajith plan to file habeas corpus to get baby back||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A day after the government intervened in the case related to the ‘forced’ adoption of former SFI leader Anupama S Chandran’s baby, director of women and child welfare department TV Anupama summoned general secretary of state council for child welfare Shiju Khan on Sunday. He is learnt to have justified the actions of the council by denying the allegations raised by the mother. Khan spent around 30 minutes at her office and on his exit told the media that there was no breach of legal procedure in the adoption of the child in question. But, he refused to divulge more details citing that the issue has moved to court and that he has limitations in responding publicly. “I was summoned as part of a departmental inquiry in this matter,” he said, adding that he will give the council’s version at a later stage. Meanwhile, Anupama’s parents, her sister, brother-in-law and two CPM workers, who are alleged to be behind the forced adoption, approached the additional sessions court seeking anticipatory bail. The court asked the police to submit relevant documents on Oct 28, before considering their bail application. Meanwhile, the district family court, on Monday, will hear the arguments on the petition filed by state adoption resources authority seeking to stay the adoption procedures of the child who was given up for ‘adoption’ without the knowledge of his parents. The agency filed a petition in this regard on Saturday in the wake of police registering a kidnapping case based on the complaint filed by Anupama. Last Monday, Peroorkada police registered a case after Anupama filed a complaint accusing her parents and a few others of forcefully taking away her baby as it was born out of wedlock. The accused include her parents Jayachandran and Smitha, her sister, brother-in-law and two CPM party workers. Jayachandran is also a local CPM leader. On Saturday, Peroorkada police had conducted raids at a private hospital in Kattakada, where Anupama gave birth to the baby, and Kattakada grama panchayat where the birth was registered. They seized relevant documents, including the baby’s birth certificate. The investigation officer said there was no mismatching information on the documents seized from both places. He said the baby born on Oct 19, 2020 was handed over to the child welfare committee on Oct 23. The child welfare committee issued the legally-free for adoption (LFA) certificate in February this year. Police also said that when Anupama filed her first complaint in April, police conducted a petition enquiry without registering a case. During the probe, Jayachandran produced a notarized consent letter from Anupama that expressed her consent for her baby’s adoption. Now, police are planning to contact Central Adoption Resources Authority seeking details of the couple who adopted the baby. Meanwhile, Anupama and her partner Ajith are planning to file a habeas corpus petition before the high court to get back their child.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-anupama-s-chandran-and-ajith-plan-to-file-habeas-corpus-to-get-baby-back/articleshow/87246702.cms||---

This should be organized by adhering to Covid-19 protocol. School teachers and local body representatives should welcome students at the school gates,” Sivankutty said. The government has instructed the school authorities to keep the school atmosphere attractive and lively. Fitness is compulsory for school buildings. In case any school building lacks fitness certificate, options should be explored to accommodate students of such schools in nearby schools with fitness certificate, a statement from the minister said. Sivankutty said the guidelines to be followed by the schools would be out in a couple of days. The academic activities of the schools would be strictly based on this document. The minister asked the headmasters and principals to ensure that all preparations for the school reopening would be complete by October 27.

---||Chennai||Despite relaxations, need to follow Covid-19 rules for another year: Tamil Nadu health minister||The Tamil Nadu government’s relaxation in lockdown norms comes at a time when Covid-19 cases are low, but with festivals around the corner, the next four to six weeks will be crucial to check the spread of infection. Health minister Ma Subramanian tells TOI about the government’s plans to control the situation and expand the vaccination programme.Lockdown norms were eased as cases are reducing in Tamil Nadu. How is the government planning to keep it under control?First, we need to follow Covid-19 guidelines for at least another year. There should be no compromise. Developed countries like the US, UK and Russia are struggling once again now. In China, there are restrictions on running schools and flights. So, there is no guarantee that it will not happen once again in Tamil Nadu. Second, we need to continue the vaccination programme. Organisations like the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) say that a possible third wave could be prevented if 70% of the population has received at least one dose. In Tamil Nadu, almost 69% (of the eligible 5.8 crore) population has received their first dose. What about the second dose eligible beneficiaries?Till Saturday, 66 lakh people were due for their second dose in the state. Among them, we were able to inoculate only 14.5 lakh through the sixth mass vaccination drive. So far, around 29% of the population has been fully vaccinated. This was marginally less compared to the national figure. Throughout India, more than 31% of them have received both doses. Tamil Nadu would have topped the list if not for the slow start during the previous AIADMK regime. From January 16 to May 6, the average daily vaccinations was only 61,441. Also, 4.3 lakh vaccine doses were wasted. We have reduced the wastage. As a result, the Union government is sanctioning adequate doses to the state. Despite village-level campaigns by the government, why is there a drop in the average daily vaccinations of late? It was above 4.75 lakh last month.In places like Krishnagiri, data suggests that only 70% of the population have been inoculated. But the actual number could be 90%. This is because many people from Krishnagiri now work in Bengaluru. So, they would have got vaccinated over there and those numbers will not get accounted for in Tamil Nadu. However, it is true that the daily performance has reduced marginally. We have instructed the deputy directors of health services and collectors of all districts to speed up the work of finding and convincing eligible beneficiaries. We are planning to use doctors and nurses, deployed for the Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam scheme, in finding people who are hesitant to take the jab. Is it ok to pressure people who are hesitant to take the vaccine?In Kanyakumari, the district collector has announced that liquor will be sold at Tasmac stores only to those who are vaccinated. Many private companies have asked their employees to get inoculated. There is no ban on such efforts. There is nothing wrong in pressuring or compelling people to get vaccinated as it is done for their good. If we don’t continue to vaccinate, what happened to China can happen here too. With more workplaces opening up, more people are expected to come out for their livelihood. So, we hope it gets easier to find and convince many among the vaccine-hesitant people. How is the feedback from people to such efforts?In the past two months, I have inspected vaccine camps in more than 20 districts. Chief minister M K Stalin has personally overseen arrangements by visiting camps during three of the six special weekend drives. People understand when we explain about the need to get vaccinated. The special mass vaccination camps have helped a lot in this aspect. A constant feedback was that people, who have alcohol or meat on Sundays, were avoiding the Sunday camps. You can have non-vegetarian food on the day of getting vaccinated. Even then to bring in more such people to vaccination centres, the camp was shifted to Saturday this week. What is the status now after the sixth camp and are there any plans to conduct more camps in a week?In the first five camps, more than 1.1 crore vaccine doses were administered. On Saturday, another 23.5 lakh got inoculated. Regarding multiple camps in a week, it would be slightly difficult now because Covid-19 healthcare workers, who have worked for almost two years under immense pressure are overburdened and are requesting us to conduct special drivers on alternate weeks. If we are able to vaccinate 5 lakh to 6 lakh people in a day, then there is no need for such camps. But we hardly get 50,000 to 1.5 lakh during weekdays. So, continuing the special weekend camps is the only possible way to achieve our target. Will there be measures like ‘no vaccination, no ration or insurance’ campaigns?I feel there is no need for such measures in TN and I hope such a situation will not arise. We expected a low turnout on Saturday, but 23.5 lakh people arrived at the camps. So, we will continue to take the morally and ethically correct route.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/despite-relaxations-need-to-follow-covid-19-rules-for-another-year-tamil-nadu-health-minister/articleshow/87246789.cms||---

They vandalised the set and damaged several vehicles, including lead actor Bobby Deol's vanity van. Four suspects were arrested late at night, DIG Irshad Wali told TOI, adding that all the culprits will be nabbed and strict action taken against them. No complaint had been filed till then. The DIG said police can take action in cognizable offences without waiting for a complaint. A case under IPC 151 was registered at MP Nagar late at night. "No such incident will take place in the city in the future. All the crew members are safe," Wali said, adding, "We are taking proper measures to keep the city safe from those who are trying to defame it." VHP-Bajrang Dal Madhya Prant spokesperson Jitendra Chouhan said the 'protest' was carried out by Bajrang Dal. "We demand that the government refuse permission for the shooting of films that hurt Hindu sentiments," he said. The organisation issued a statement, saying it objects to the naming of the web series. The incident occurred in Old Jail area in Arera Hills. 50 activists barged into the set, manhandled bouncers  Around 50 alleged Bajrang Dal activists barged into the set, manhandled bouncers and also raised slogans against Jha and Bobby Deol, claiming that the web series "hurts Hindu sentiments". There was tension in the area and traffic was disrupted on the busy road. Senior police officers rushed to the spot and tried to defuse tension. Police used mild force to disperse the protesters, surrounded the area and forced the protesters out. Shooting for the web series started in Bhopal last week. Hindu organisations have opposed it all along, saying it shows Hinduism in a bad light. They demand a total ban on its shoot in Bhopal and wanted the series to be renamed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-bajrang-dal-barges-into-ashram-3-set-smears-ink-on-prakash-jha-4-held/articleshow/87246856.cms||---

The new law shields only the existing illegal structures built on public land and will not allow any new religious structures or construction in public place without permission. However, the law will not protect structures if the case is pending in court. The move comes one and a half months after Mysuru district administration started demolition of shrines which had come up on public land without authorization. Demolition of Mahadevamma temple in Nanjangud taluk in the district evoked strong reaction across political spectrum. MLA: Law needs to be more comprehensiveDemolition of a temple in Nanjangud taluk evoked strong reaction across political spectrum, forcing the government to hurriedly come up with a bill to protect such shrines. Both houses of the legislature passed the bill in the recently concluded session and the governor gave assent October 19. After the Nanjangud demolition row, the government transferred tahsildar Mohana Kumari to pacify protesters. Sources said 93 such structures had come up in Mysuru alone. According to the state gazette notification, the Act offers protection to places of worship belonging to all communities, including temples, churches, mosques and gurudwaras, constructed on public land ‘without the authority of law’. It says the district administration may allow religious activities in such protected structures subject to custom, law, usage and any other conditions as may be laid down by the state government. Krishnaraja MLA SA Ramadas said the law needs to be “more comprehensive” and added that it may allow government agencies to control private temples built in public places.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/law-to-protect-shrines-built-on-public-land-in-karnataka-kicks-in/articleshow/87246828.cms||---

The court allowed her to join her new posting after the session ended. The petitioner, Sandhya Marco, was transferred from Balaghat to Dindori, over 200km apart, on August 23, 2021. She moved HC, pleading that her transfer be stayed as her daughter's studies would be affected ahead of her board exams. She said she had applied to the higher authorities of her department for a stay on her transfer, but no decision had been taken yet. She also pointed out that no one has been posted in her place at Balaghat, and pleaded to be allowed to continue in the post till her daughter's exams. Advocate Sudha Gautam appeared for Marco and cited earlier Supreme Court rulings to support her plea. Justice Vishal Mishra granted her prayer and asked Marco to give an undertaking that she would join her new posting after the end of this academic session.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-hc-stays-officials-transfer-for-daughters-board-examination/articleshow/87246886.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Congress MLA joins BJP week ahead of bypolls||KHARGONE: In a blow to Congress less than a week ahead of bypolls in four seats, MLA Sachin Birla joined BJP at a rally of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Khargone's Bediya on Sunday. He is the 27th Congress legislator to join BJP since March 2020. "Calling Birla 'bikau' (saleable) is an insult to the soil of Nimar," Chouhan said, dismissing Congress's criticism of the switchover. Patriots are joining BJP, he said. The 41-year-old had won Badwaha seat by over 30,000 votes in 2018, wresting it from BJP's two-time winner Hitendra Singh Solanki. PCC chief and former CM Kamal Nath said BJP was resorting to "bargaining and auctions" yet again as it senses defeat in the October 30 bypolls. The young Gujjar politician's resignation from Congress comes just two days before the most powerful Gujjar politician in Congress, former Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot, is slated to address rallies in three bypoll areas, including Barwaha. Welcoming Birla on stage, Chouhan said: "Badi der bhai Nandlala. Kahan fanse the dushtan mein (Where were you trapped among the rogues for so long)?" Birla apologized to his constituents for "not being able to do anything for them" during 15 months of the Kamal Nath government. War of words after Cong MLA joins BJP  Birla's switchover triggered a war of words between Chouhan and Nath. The CM said that Birla had appealed to Nath several times for important irrigation projects and roads in his constituency and a modern market for the famous Bediya chilli, but Nath used to dismiss it, saying there was no money. "When there was no money, why did he become chief minister?" Chouhan wondered. Referring to Nath's 'bikau' remark, Chouhan said: "No one has the power to buy Sachin Birla. Kamal Nath had made Vallabh Bhavan a house of touts, where work was done only by negotiations of transactions. He didn't even have time for MLA Sachin Birla. Birla had no choice (but to join BJP). It is wrong to blame BJP for the weakness of Congress." "After Congress won, BJP had made up its mind to sit in the opposition for five years, but due to wrong policies and corruption, their government fell," Chouhan said, remarking that Rahul Gandhi and Navjot Siddhu have now "drowned Captain Amarinder Singh's government in Punjab". "Congress lacks in leadership in Madhya Pradesh as well as Centre. There is no hope for it. Congress isn't able to keep its house in order, yet it blames BJP," Chouhan remarked. Nath bit back by saying: "BJP formed the government in MP through bargaining and bidding after people rejected them in the elections and made them sit at home. Now, BJP has seen the mood of the people ahead of bypolls in four seats. To save its government, BJP is once again indulging in bargaining, thereby stigmatizing politics and insulting the citizen's right to vote." "Shivraj ji, no matter how much politics of bargaining you do to save your chair, you will fail because the public has rejected you and will give a befitting reply," Nath added. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-congress-mla-joins-bjp-week-ahead-of-bypolls/articleshow/87246906.cms||---

Parents of children from premier schools are apprehensive about sending children to school, according to managements. Several other schools have decided to resume only after Deepavali as a series of holidays are due next week. “Parents want to send children only after vaccines. While classes 10-12 have responded positively, parents of lower-grade children do not want to send their wards at all. We cannot manage both online and offline classes because we do not have so much staff. We will continue to offer only online class for some more months,” said Mansoor Ali Khan, board of members of Delhi Public Schools. Many schools in the city echoed the argument. Covid norms: Some schools have to make preparationsThey are not running physical classes for higher grades and students are required to come to campus only for exams. For others, there are preparations to be done because of the Covid protocol. In government schools, not all primary class students find their institution in the best of shape. With high enrolment in the past two years, and continuous non-use of the facilities, many schools are scrambling for infrastructure. Admissions soared in many government schools as parents struggled financially due to the pandemic and could not pay fees in the private schools. “Most budget schools (along with government ones) will reopen primary grades on Monday. The senior classes are going on smoothly. However, the attendance might be as less as 10%-20%. More importantly, admissions have not taken place for grades 1 and 2,” said D Shashi Kumar, secretary, Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka. ‘Need to rehire teachers’“We need to rehire teachers, rework timetables and finances to match additional costs, increase tech infrastructure to manage online and offline classes for those parents unwilling to send to school and those who are not in station as they have relocated. The biggest challenge is in accommodating the strength with the same infrastructure as before. If we could accommodate 30 students in a class, we can now have only 15. This is challenging as we will require more staff. There is a lot of planning work before we restart. We would probably look at reopening for primary grades after Deepavali,” said Jayant Gauri of Raintree chain of schools.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/class-1-5-reopens-today-private-schools-to-wait-till-deepavali/articleshow/87246913.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
