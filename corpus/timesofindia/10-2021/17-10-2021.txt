This observation was made regarding a petition filed by G Prashanth, a resident of Gottigere in Bengaluru. The petitioner claimed that his father GS Gundanna did not stand as surety for the release of Jabbir Ahmad, arraigned as accused no.1 in a criminal case, and sought for release of attached property, citing impersonation.  Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar noted that it is a clear case for inquiry, going by the documents and added that the petitioner being the son can definitely urge for release of the attached property as his father is no more now. “If section 446 CrPC is read, it can be understood that the person bound by a bond can be called upon to pay the penalty and show cause as to why it should not be paid. That means the surety may show cause that the bond amount cannot be recovered from him, and it is needless to say that the surety can also urge that his property cannot be attached for recovery of bond amount,” the judge said. Prashanth cited that Gundanna who stood as surety to Jabbir Ahmad is not his father, and the affidavit filed by the said surety stating that he is the son of Sampangirama Shastry and owner of 1 acre 8 guntas of land in Chikkammanahalli, Begur hobli, are false and it is a case of impersonation. Justice Kumar noted the date of birth of the petitioner’s father is September 24,1946, as forthcoming in the photo ID and he was an ‘archak’ in a temple. On the other hand, in the surety affidavit bearing the date June 11, 2015, the age of the surety is written as 41 and the facial features in the photo affixed on the affidavit do not match with those of the petitioner’s father as depicted in the ID. Therefore apparently, a case for inquiry is made out, the judge added. “The petitioner’s father died on September 29, 2020. But , when he was alive, he did address a letter to the registrar complaining of impersonation. He sought advancement of the case as evidenced by copy of the application produced before this court. It appears no action has been taken...,” the judge added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-court-passing-order-has-power-to-remedy-mischief/articleshow/87070513.cms||Vasantha Kumar

On Saturday, a seven-storey apartment, built for police personnel, in Magadi Road area, developed a major crack and titled dangerously to one side.While civil engineering and structural stability experts are examining if the building can be strengthened or would have to be brought down, everyone is shocked that the building is just three years old and had been approved by a committee comprising top-notch geotechnical professionals. Alarm bells started ringing last week when the fissure was seen last week in Unit-B, home to 32 families, of the quarters located near the erstwhile Binny Mills land. There are three high-rise units with 192 flats. “Though we’ve been seeing cracks in the wall for the past year, it started increasing following recent heavy rain. We didn’t want to take any chances as several buildings have crashed in the city over the past two weeks. We alerted everyone, including the Karnataka State Police Housing Corporation which built it,” said a police personnel, who didn’t want to be identified.City police commissioner Kamal Pant, who visited the spot, said: “There are technical lapses, it looks like there are problems in the foundation.” He added that families staying in the building for the past two years have been told to evacuate till a solution is found on experts’ recommendations.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Portion of park’s retention wall collapses||BENGALURU: Following incessant rain for over a week, a portion of the stone cladding of a 25-feet-high retention wall at Kempegowda Park in Dasarahalli zone collapsed in the wee hours of Saturday. However, no casualties were reported in the incident. Sources in BBMP said that the incident happened in a BBMP park in Mallasandra ward. The sudden disintegration and falling of masonry stones threatened the safety of a theatre building (rangamandira) abutting the wall. As a precautionary measure, civic officials evacuated three families living close to the wall. Lokesh N, former councillor of Mallasandra ward, told STOI: “There is no damage to the retention wall; only a part of it has fallen as recent rain washed away the soil beneath the structure.” The park is spread over 38 acres according to officials. “Out of 38 acres, eight acres have been allegedly encroached by a few people and houses have been built. Of the remaining 30 acres, BBMP could build the park only on 28 acres as another two acres are still under litigation,” they added. Lokesh claimed that in 2015, he had obtained permission from BBMP to set up a park in the area. “The retaining wall collapsed on the outside. Had the part of the wall collapsed inside, the rangamandira would have been damaged,” he added. Footfall in the park is increasing as it also has a yoga centre with a capacity to accommodate 500 people, an indoor badminton court, a three-acre empty ground, amphitheater, rangamandira and a BBMP office. Tree uprootedMeanwhile, a massive tree was uprooted near Mysuru Lamps in Yeshwantpur on Saturday morning.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka byelections: BJP bets on Bommai factor; Congress’s focus on fuel price||BENGALURU: While Congress will fight the upcoming byelections to Sindgi (Vijayapura) and Hangal (Haveri) on issues such as rising fuel prices, soaring unemployment and inflation, BJP is betting on development and popularity of CM Basavaraj Bommai. With diesel price touching Rs 100 per litre in the state, the Congress campaign revolves around cautioning people not to be misled by BJP’s promise to develop the constituencies. Instead, it wants them to focus on day-to-day issues. “We’ve been campaigning on corruption and poor governance. But the fuel price hike has become a prominent issue,’’ said KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed. Some Congress MLAs of Haveri and Vijayapura said people are feeling the impact of unemployment and price hikes, especially LPG and diesel, and they may reconsider their electoral choice. “How long can BJP harp about development and Lingayat votes if jobs are hard to get, people are facing poverty and prices of essential commodities are soaring?” said Congress MLA Shivanand Patil. He added: “The BJP succeeded in convincing people of KR Pet, Sira and RR Nagar about ensuring overall development. But now, people are aware about the problems.” BJP says inflation and unemployment won’t be major factors. “While I agree that fuel prices are high, inflation rate is still 4%-6% which is low. People are happy Bommai and how he has handled the state after taking charge about two months ago. His welfare schemes have struck a chord with the common man,’’ said BJP spokesperson Captain Ganesh Karnik. Experts said Bommai’s popularity will decide the outcome.  “The Congress using price rise and unemployment to woo voters may not cut ice this time. And JD(S) fielding an educated Muslim candidate in both constituencies will definitely split the secular vote which Congress banks on a lot. The denial of ticket to the Udasi family in Hangal has vitiated the atmosphere in the local BJP unit and it remains to be seen how Bommai handles it,’’ political analyst Prof Ravindra Reshme said. He added: “For the first time after a long period we have a CM from North Karnataka and Bommai is a familiar face for voters of the area who have seen him from his father SR Bommai’s tenure as CM. The Congress will have to counter the Bommai factor to wean away voters from BJP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bjp-bets-on-bommai-factor-congs-focus-on-fuel-price/articleshow/87070731.cms||Manu Aiyappa
---||Bengaluru||HD Kumaraswamy fires fresh salvo, says Congress sidelining Muslim leaders||BENGALURU: With the assembly elections are still one-and-a-half years away, the war of words between Congress and JDS has intensified over Muslim votes. Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Saturday unleashed a fresh attack on the Congress by accusing it and opposition leader Siddaramaiah of systematically sidelining Muslim leaders in the party. “From Iqbal Ahmed Saradagi to Roshan Baig to CM Ibrahim and Tanveer Sait, the political careers of all Muslim leaders in the Congress have been systematically finished by Siddaramaiah,” Kumaraswamy alleged in a series of tweets. The fresh round of attack is continuation of the war of words that ensued between the two parties after the JD(S) decided to field Muslim candidates in Sindagi and Hangal assembly segments which will go for bypolls on October 3.  The move did not go down well with the Congress as it thinks it would divide the Muslim votes and help the BJP.  The apprehensions of the Congress stemmed from the party’s defeat in the Basavakalyan bypoll where the JD(S) candidate, who was a Muslim, secured over 10,000 votes. As a result, the Congress leaders, especially Siddaramaiah, have been accusing the JD(S) as the B team of the BJP and it has deliberately been fielding Muslim candidates only to help the latter. According to political experts, both the parties are heavily dependent on Muslim votes to put up a good show in the 2023 hustings and the ongoing fight is to paint themselves as champions of the minorities’ cause and get a major share of votes. The Congress, which has lost a considerable chunk of its Dalit vote bank to the BJP over the years, is desperately wanting to keep its Muslim vote bank intact in its bid to return to power. But it is worried that the JD(S) may spoil its plans. “That is the reason why the party is repeatedly blaming the JD(S) for being in an understanding with the BJP. By doing so, it wants to send a message to Muslims that their votes to JD(S) will help the BJP. But they will not be successful,” said JD(S) state president HK Kumaraswamy. On the other hand, the JD(S) is hoping to damage the Congress' prospects as much as possible so that the 2023 assembly polls throw a fractured verdict so that the party has a say in the government formation. “The only way to achieve this is to denting Congress' Muslim vote bank to the maximum extent possible and that is what Kumaraswamy is doing by highlighting alleged ill-treatment meted out to minority leaders. A fractured verdict means an advantageous position for the JD(S),” said a political commentator. Senior Congress functionary BL Shankar said mere statements of Kumaraswamy will not take away Muslims votes from the Congress. “It is the actions not statements that matter when the community weighs options before it. Everybody knows Kumaraswamy can go with any party, including the BJP, for his benefit. Such being the case, his statements will have no impact on the Congress’ prospects,” he said. KPCC president DK Shivakumar said in Kalaburagi on Saturday that the Muslim voters are well informed and they know very well who to vote for their welfare. BJP govt has ulterior motive: Ex-MLAThe BJP government in the state has been targeting Christians through the Karnataka State Legislative Committee on Backward Classes and Minority Welfare, said former MLA JR Lobo. He told reporters here on Saturday that the committee has given directions seeking details on the functioning of all Christian missionaries and Catholic institutions. Lobo, who was the chairman of the committee during 2015-18, said the BJP government is trying to brand all Christian missionaries as propagators of religious conversion though they have been doing social work. “They (BJP) have been doing it with an ulterior motive. The committee in its recent meeting has directed its members to visit churches on Sunday. These decisions of the committee do not come under its purview,” he said. The committee should work on the welfare of the backward classes and minorities and not engage in policing, Lobo said. “The committee has a political motive to mislead people on the activities of Christian missionaries. The BJP government can act against those involved in forcible conversion using various sections of the law. However, BJP is engaged in divide and rule policy,” he alleged. Lobo said the percentage of the community population has not increased. “In the country, it is only 3.5 % while in Karnataka it is only 2.5%.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hdk-fires-fresh-salvo-says-cong-sidelining-muslim-leaders/articleshow/87070738.cms||Anil Gejji

The country is raising voice over methodology adopted in determining Global Hunger Index (GHI) rankings while the food producers are raising voice for its survival. While the country is facing the severe beating over the low ranking of 101st out of 116 countries that have been ranked for combating hunger, the food producers are unhappy making claims that are not getting its due despite filling the coffers of food pool. With a score of 27.5 on a scale of 100, India has level of hunger in serious category though it has improved from falling in alarming category, two decades ago. The union ministry of women and child development has objected the methodology of the GHI saying United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) devoid of ground reality, facts and suffers from serious methodological issues. There is no mention whether respondents had received support from government schemes during pandemic. Against it, food producers of the country are on the roads for close to a year and are on warpath against the central government while vehemently opposing the farm laws terming these to be anti-peasant (food producers) and saying these laws will provide alarming loss to them which could further impact India’ ranking in combating hunger and nutrition. The world food day was started to commemorate the founding of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in 1945. Since 1981 it started adopting a theme for the year with first theme in 1981 being ‘food comes first’ and for 2021 the theme is ‘safe food now for a healthy tomorrow’. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 2 talks about zero hunger. It says end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. The Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 was awarded to World Food Programme (WFP) for its efforts to combat hunger and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict. “The GHI has shown the country its real face as where we stand in properly feeding our countrymen. The FAO says that 15.3% population of country is under nourished and many others don’t even have access to food and go to sleep as hungry. Against it, the government is not ready to provide remunerative price to peasants for producing food. It is due to hard work of peasants that India has reached to 27.5 score from 38.8 in year 2000 but despite all this the government is hellbent in punishing the farmers instead of rewarding it and want to provide benefits to corporates by involving them (corporates) in the agriculture sector. The country’ leaders should concentrate more on ways to find to combat hunger and work with peasants than to look otherwise”, says peasant leader Jagmohan Singh. Another peasant leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan says peasants are ready to produce more and quality food if the government stands by them and provide various facilities which are being availed by food producers in various developed countries. It should not think of providing benefit to corporate sector only but look sympathetically towards its food producers. Echoing similar sentiments aquatic food champion and 2021 world food prize winner Shakuntala Haraksingh Thilsted in an interview with TOI on July 28 had said that much of the food produced in the world is by small farmers and small landholders which is more pronounced in Asia. The governments need to ensure that the small holders have good facilities to keep producing food. You need to have instruments like insurance schemes or low production costs. The government and other partners need to ensure food production Is profitable for small farmers because no one will produce food if it is not profitable. GHI is a tool designed to comprehensively measure and track hunger at various levels. Scores are calculated to assess progress and setbacks in combating hunger undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, child mortality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/world-food-day-india-at-101st-rank-in-ghi-country-angry-over-methodology-to-determine-hunger/articleshow/87071103.cms||Neel Kamal

The victim is Suma (name changed) of Rampur near Bidarahalli, outskirts of east Bengaluru. Suma told police that she was looking for a used Audi A3 and came to know that her son’s friend Rudresh was in the business of dealing used cars. So, she asked Rudresh to get an Audi for her. “Rudresh introduced her to a person identified as Chiranjeev, who claimed to be a manager with a private finance firm, and said he could arrange a used Audi for her. They claimed they could get vehicles for lower prices as many car owners were unable to clear EMIs. They showed me a car and documents at Mailasandra on September 2 and I agreed to purchase the vehicle for Rs 19 lakh. I gave Rs 10 lakh to a person, identified as Wasimulla Khan, on September 4 and applied for a loan for the remaining Rs 9 lakh,” Suma stated in her complaint. She alleged that the trio promised her that they would deliver the vehicle by September 12. But neither was the delivery made, nor the money returned. Suma approached Banaswadi police recently and filed a cheating case against Rudresh, Chiranjeevi and Khan. Police are making efforts to nab them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-trying-to-buy-used-audi-loses-10l/articleshow/87071153.cms||---

Ravish Gowda stated that he was driving a Range Rover and not an Audi, and that the biker had rammed his car and triggered the fight on Wednesday night near MS Ramaiah Hospital near Yeshwantpur. Police had earlier booked Gowda following a complaint from biker Anil Kumar. Now, a case has been registered against Kumar and his friend Sadiq under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 341 (wrongful restraint). Gowda stated in his complaint that he was on his way to his house from his hotel at 8.50pm when the incident took place at the back gate of the hospital on Mathikere Main Road. Two bike-borne persons, suspected to be under the influence of alcohol, were driving negligently and in a zigzag manner, he alleged. “When I slowed down, they stopped their bike right in front of my SUV. They got off the bike and attacked me with a lethal object. I sustained injury on my right thumb. So, I took out my licenced pistol. The duo pulled me out of my vehicle and started assaulting me. For self-protection, I fired a bullet to the ground. I was shocked by the attack and pulled the trigger and a bullet fell on the road. Soon, the duo escaped from the spot,” Gowda claimed. Gowda said he covered up the incident initially to avoid his family members from panicking on the occasion of Dasara festival.Kumar, an ambulance driver, in his complaint had stated that it was Gowda who slapped him first and then tried to kill him by firing with his pistol. Gowda has been arrested and sent to jail.

---||Bengaluru||Study shows migratory bird count falls due to urbanisation||Bengaluru: The number of migratory birds that once frequented the city’s lakes is fast reducing due to rapid urbanisation and change of the ecosystem around the water bodies, according to a study.Conducted with the help of data collected by Bengalureans and uploaded to the eBird portal, the study has found the number of migratory birds like northern pintail, green sandpiper and wood sandpiper is going down in Bengaluru, while that of lake-dependent resident birds has increased in the past five years. eBird is an online database where citizens, researchers and bird enthusiasts upload their bird observations. The researchers said urbanisation has a species-specific impact on lake-dependent birds in Bengaluru, with specific groups faring better than others. They said the study adds to the significant paucity of studies on the effects of urbanisation on biodiversity in urban tropics. “Urban planners could use findings from this study to improve the condition of lakes in and around Bengaluru to help city-dwelling birds,” they added.The study— ‘Relationship between lake area and distance from the city centre on lake-dependent resident and migratory birds in urban Bangalore, a tropical mega-city in Southern India’ — was published in the Journal of Urban Ecology. It investigates how the number of bird species found in Bengaluru’s lakes is related to the degree of urbanisation in surrounding areas. Authored by Ravi Jambhekar, visiting scientist, Center for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science; Kulbhushan Singh Suryawanshi, scientist, Nature Conservation Foundation; and Harini Nagendra, faculty member, Azim Premji University, the study found that larger lakes support more bird species and as the distance from the city centre increased (i.e. urbanisation decreases), the number of bird species went up. The scientists used data from 44 lakes in and around the city. A total of 263 species were observed from 2014 to 2019. They said larger lakes support more diversity as compared to smaller ones as they have more resting and breeding spaces, feeding resources and microhabitats. They also found that the number of birds that nest in tree canopies such as cormorants, painted stork, Brahminy kite and egrets is increasing. “This might be because of the availability of nesting sites in the islands created by the authorities with tall trees. Many of these species are also piscivores (fish-eaters) and another reason for their increase could be the increase of fish in the lakes,” they explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/study-shows-migratory-bird-count-falls-due-to-urbanisation/articleshow/87071161.cms||---

Footfall in the park is increasing as it also has a yoga centre with a capacity to accommodate 500 people, an indoor badminton court, a three-acre empty ground, amphitheater, rangamandira and a BBMP office.Tree uprootedMeanwhile, a massive tree was uprooted near Mysuru Lamps in Yeshwantpur on Saturday morning.

Ravish Gowda stated that he was driving a Range Rover and not an Audi, and that the biker had rammed his car and triggered the fight on Wednesday night near MS Ramaiah Hospital near Yeshwantpur. Police had earlier booked Gowda following a complaint from biker Anil Kumar. Now, a case has been registered against Kumar and his friend Sadiq under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 341 (wrongful restraint). Gowda stated in his complaint that he was on his way to his house from his hotel at 8.50pm when the incident took place at the back gate of the hospital on Mathikere Main Road. Two bike-borne persons, suspected to be under the influence of alcohol, were driving negligently and in a zigzag manner, he alleged. “When I slowed down, they stopped their bike right in front of my SUV. They got off the bike and attacked me with a lethal object. I sustained injury on my right thumb. So, I took out my licenced pistol. The duo pulled me out of my vehicle and started assaulting me. For self-protection, I fired a bullet to the ground. I was shocked by the attack and pulled the trigger and a bullet fell on the road. Soon, the duo escaped from the spot,” Gowda claimed. Gowda said he covered up the incident initially to avoid his family members from panicking on the occasion of Dasara festival.Kumar, an ambulance driver, in his complaint had stated that it was Gowda who slapped him first and then tried to kill him by firing with his pistol. Gowda has been arrested and sent to jail. Further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/biker-friend-attacked-meclaims-road-rage-accused/articleshow/87071971.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Study shows migratory bird count falls due to urbanisation||Bengaluru: The number of migratory birds that once frequented the city’s lakes is fast reducing due to rapid urbanisation and change of the ecosystem around the water bodies, according to a study.Conducted with the help of data collected by Bengalureans and uploaded to the eBird portal, the study has found the number of migratory birds like northern pintail, green sandpiper and wood sandpiper is going down in Bengaluru, while that of lake-dependent resident birds has increased in the past five years. eBird is an online database where citizens, researchers and bird enthusiasts upload their bird observations. The researchers said urbanisation has a species-specific impact on lake-dependent birds in Bengaluru, with specific groups faring better than others. They said the study adds to the significant paucity of studies on the effects of urbanisation on biodiversity in urban tropics. “Urban planners could use findings from this study to improve the condition of lakes in and around Bengaluru to help city-dwelling birds,” they added.The study— ‘Relationship between lake area and distance from the city centre on lake-dependent resident and migratory birds in urban Bangalore, a tropical mega-city in Southern India’ — was published in the Journal of Urban Ecology. It investigates how the number of bird species found in Bengaluru’s lakes is related to the degree of urbanisation in surrounding areas. Authored by Ravi Jambhekar, visiting scientist, Center for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science; Kulbhushan Singh Suryawanshi, scientist, Nature Conservation Foundation; and Harini Nagendra, faculty member, Azim Premji University, the study found that larger lakes support more bird species and as the distance from the city centre increased (i.e. urbanisation decreases), the number of bird species went up. The scientists used data from 44 lakes in and around the city. A total of 263 species were observed from 2014 to 2019. They said larger lakes support more diversity as compared to smaller ones as they have more resting and breeding spaces, feeding resources and microhabitats. They also found that the number of birds that nest in tree canopies such as cormorants, painted stork, Brahminy kite and egrets is increasing. “This might be because of the availability of nesting sites in the islands created by the authorities with tall trees. Many of these species are also piscivores (fish-eaters) and another reason for their increase could be the increase of fish in the lakes,” they explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/study-shows-migratory-bird-count-falls-due-to-urbanisation/articleshow/87071986.cms||---

---||World||Kashmiri Pandits in London stage protest outside Pak high commission over recent civilian killings in J&K||LONDON: British Kashmiri Hindus staged a protest outside the Pakistan high commission in London on Saturday calling for an end to Pakistan’s support of terror groups that have killed several civilians, including Hindus, in Kashmir this month, and an end to attempts by terrorists at ethnic cleansing of Hindus from Kashmir. The protesters, mostly Kashmiri Pandits, also want to see justice and reparations for the "historic genocide" and forced exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from the valley, for which they say no one has been prosecuted. They chanted "Pakistan bhikari hai (Pakistan is a beggar)" and "Kashmir hamara hai, aadha nahi, sara hai (Kashmir is ours, not just half, but all of it)" outside the Pakistan high commission in Knightsbridge. As Pakistan officials filmed them from inside, they pushed a letter through the door addressed to the Pakistan high commissioner Moazzam Ahmad Khan calling on the Pakistan government to "desist from promoting trouble and violence in Kashmir". The letter expressed concern about the "continued sponsorship of terror groups in Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan" and said the "ISI is behind this trans-national murder campaign". It was signed by Hindu Council UK, Indo-European Kashmir Forum, Kashmir Pandit Association of Europe and Kashmir Pandit Cultural Society. Many protesters told TOI their families had been forced to flee Kashmir in 1990, losing their property, which they said was now occupied by Muslims. They told TOI they did not feel safe returning and that an "ethnocide" was taking place. Sam Tukra (25) said he had heard many stories from his parents about Kashmir but had never been able to visit. His grandparents fled during the insurgency. "Most Hindus fear they won’t come back alive if they go to Kashmir," he said. Sonal Sher left Kashmir in March 1990 with nothing but the clothes on her back and fled to Jammu. She said: "British MPs have their Pakistan-origin constituents talking about Kashmir, but they don’t understand why the Indian Army went there in the first place. It was because so many Hindus were butchered. My grandfather died in exile in Jammu. This is the story of every Kashmir Hindu: our elders died pining for their homeland, our families separated and the children have never seen Kashmir. There are militants going round Kashmir with guns and, if they find you have a Hindu or Sikh name, they will shoot you." Sanjay Peshin was 10 years old in 1990 when he saw a Hindu killed in front of him and he said no one did anything. "Our properties have now been burnt or illegally occupied," he said. The Kashmiri Hindu group had planned to hold a vigil outside the India high commission in London on Saturday after the Pakistan protest to call for greater security for Kashmiri Hindus in Kashmir but called it off when they discovered British Sikhs would be staging a protest over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence at the same time. TOI witnessed a crowd of British Sikhs standing outside the Indian high commission holding placards promoting their unofficial Khalistan referendum, scheduled to take place in London on October 31, and placards blaming the recent farmer deaths on the BJP government.

---||World||Pak PM-military stand-off on new ISI chief drags on||ISLAMABAD: The relationship between Pakistan’s top civilian and military leadership has been under strain ever since PM Imran Khan refused to notify the Karachi corps commander Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum as the new director general of the ISI. Imran's cabinet members and aides repeatedly claim that the issue has been resolved in a meeting between the PM and the army chief, but the controversy refuses to die down. While they expect it to get resolved sooner or later, the stand-off appears to have caused enough damage to the government that has so far survived on the numerical strength of some smaller parties and independently elected lawmakers considered to be tacitly controlled by the powerful military establishment. On October 6, Pakistan’s army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had reshuffled the top military hierarchy, transferring ISI’s chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed to Peshawar as a corps commander, and appointing Karachi’s corps commander Lt Gen Nadeen Ahmed Anjum as the new director general of the spy agency. The move not to consult the PM on appointing someone to the post and Imran's subsequent reluctance to endorse that appointment "against the law and constitutional norms" has halted even routine military postings and transfers. Due to the civil-military impasse caused by Bajwa’s unilateral order, Hameed has not yet relinquished his job of a spymaster. The Peshawar corps commander Lt Gen Nauman Mehmood has not taken charge of his new assignment as president of the National Defence University. Nadeem Anjum still serves as Karachi’s corps commander. Similarly, Lt Gen Muhammad Saeed cannot assume charge as long as Anjum remains Karachi’s corps commander. Senior military officers familiar with the ongoing developments said that the army chief had asked the PM several times that Hameed would have to move out of the ISI, only for Imran to further defer taking the decision. Earlier this month, Gen Bajwa reportedly told the PM that he could not wait much longer as three lieutenant generals were retiring and he had to order the transfers. His order to change Hameed as ISI DG and Imran’s refusal, citing that the move was against the rule, has stressed the already imbalanced relations between the government and the military. Last Wednesday, two cabinet members confirmed that the PM had received a summary from the ministry of defence for the appointment of the new ISI chief. Now, the PM, according to one of his ministers, wants to meet all three candidates so he can reject two three-star generals after interviewing them. If the PM rejects Anjum's selection as the new ISI chief, defence analysts believe it would make the top military leadership more uncomfortable. Interior minister Sheikh Rasheed, however, said that the issue of appointment of the new ISI director general would be resolved within a week but was reluctant to give reasons for the delay. Lawmakers of Imran’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) revealed that many in the party were concerned about the events that had followed in the past 10 days. Their worries are not without a reason given that they enjoy a thin majority in the parliament and that too with the support of lawmakers who are loyal to the country’s powerful military establishment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-pm-military-stand-off-on-new-isi-chief-drags-on/articleshow/87072499.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The assumption of the party chief’s position is expected to potentially place Rahul Gandhi in a position to lead the party into the 2024 parliamentary elections. Read AlsoAt Congress helm for now, Sonia Gandhi faces host of challengesKeenly aware of her responsibilities towards the Nehru-Gandhi legacy, and the need to keep Congress intact, Sonia has helmed the party through some tough times, but the current phase may well prove the most challenging.For now, Sonia Gandhi will continue to be party chief. She rebuffed the dissident criticism that the party lacks a “full-time” leadership, saying she is very much “hands-on” and has taken on the government and worked with like-minded opposition parties. “So let us all have a free and honest discussion. But what should get communicated outside the four walls of this room is the collective decision of the CWC,” Sonia told a meeting of the party’s top body on Saturday. After a prolonged debate over organisational election, an issue that has been espoused by the dissident bloc, G-23, Congress on Saturday announced the poll schedule, which will culminate with the election of the party president by September 20, 2022. It means the new president will get elected on schedule as the five-year term of the earlier election ends then. Read AlsoRahul pitches for ‘ideological clarity’ among partymenNEW DELHI: While Rahul Gandhi was economical in his response to the demands of the CWC leaders that he take over the party reins again, he was explicit in saying that he had certain thoughts about how things should be and that he would be comfortable if all walked together. He also soughtCongress general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal said the internal electoral process would be set in motion from November 1 this year, with enrolment of primary membership. Elections to the block, district and state level Congress committees will be held between April and September next year, which will culminate in the election of the AICC president between August 21 and September 20, 2022. The next CWC, Venugopal said, will subsequently be constituted at the Congress plenary, the date of which will be announced later. At the CWC meeting, Rahul came under pressure from a unanimous view of the gathering that he become the party chief again. As the appeal reached a crescendo with the election schedule on the table for approval of the body, Rahul is reported to have said, “Let me think about it.” Read AlsoSecurity situation alarming, but govt in deep slumber: Sonia at CWC meetNEW DELHI: Expressing alarm over “the situation in the country”, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday said there has been rapid deterioration in internal and external security scenarios, led by continuing occupation of Indian territory by Chinese troops, 18 months after the GalwanThis is the closest he has come to agreeing to retake the top job since his resignation, when he said no member of the Gandhi family should hold the position again. It was after he refused to rescind his resignation that the CWC appointed Sonia Gandhi as interim president in June 2019. What stood out in the CWC meeting and which nudged Rahul to approve the schedule was an angry Sonia Gandhi, who slammed the G-23 claims that there was no party president — a charge levelled by Kapil Sibal at a recent press conference. While Sonia did not name anyone, her target was evident. “I am, if you will allow me to say so, a full-time and hands-on Congress President… You are aware that I have been taking them (issues) up with the Prime Minister as have Dr Manmohan Singh and Rahul ji. I have been interacting with like-minded political parties regularly. We have issued joint statements on national issues and coordinated our strategy in Parliament as well... I have always appreciated frankness. There is no need to speak to me through the media,” she said. Sonia came down hard on the G-23 allegations that the party was not conducting organisational elections. She said a roadmap for electing a regular president by June 30 this year was prepared, but the second wave of the pandemic sent the plans awry. The CWC meeting was called after G-23 leader Ghulam Nabi Azad wrote to Sonia Gandhi that the meeting be called to decide organisational elections and for discussions on the state of the party, a request he had made to Sonia in another letter last year. Interestingly, while Gandhi said she has been a full-time, hands-on president, she also gave a list of activities taken up by the party and initiatives she personally steered, including coordinating with the opposition, in the last two and a half years. She said, “Entire organisation wants a revival of Congress. But it requires unity and keeping party’s interest is paramount. Above all it requires self-control and discipline.” The announcement of the electoral process paves the way for settling the vexed issue that practically rendered Congress rudderless, with party leaders leaving the fold and Congress beset with repeated electoral defeats. The crisis-like situation faces further test with upcoming polls in five states in March next year. However, a sense that the party will find a leader again for future is expected to settle the nerves for insiders who have been worried about the lack of direction in the absence of a full-time president. On Saturday, the CWC also approved the launch of a continuous and intensive training programme for its workers and leaders focusing on ideology, grassroot messaging, election managements and countering propaganda for which an orientation camp for state trainers will be held next month. Additionally, Congress said it would launch a two week-long ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ between November 14 and 29 to address the issues of rising prices and inflation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-may-take-over-congress-reins-from-sonia-next-year/articleshow/87073319.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The civic bodies in the twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar made arrangements to immerse the idols in artificial ponds to prevent polluting the water bodies. “We prayed the goddess to remove Covid-19 from the world and keep everyone safe. This is not the way we should bid adieu to goddess Durga,” said Pradip Barisal, member of Rasulgarh Durga Puja Committee. As per Covid guidelines, maximum seven members of each puja committee were allowed to be present during the immersion. Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) had made as many as four artificial ponds — two at the Kuakhai riverside and one each at Tanka Pani Road and Daya river. All the temporary ponds were about 7 to 8 feet deep. The BMC had already intimated line departments like police, fire and ODRAF for necessary cooperation during immersion. The BMC staff were deployed near the ponds, which would be cleaned by sanitation team by Sunday. Similarly, Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) identified six places for the immersion of Durga idols — Devi Gada, Chahata, Kartikeshwara Gada, Ghata Kula and places near Jobra Museum. “Earlier, Durga Puja used to be organised by more than 100 committees in the capital city, but due to Covid restrictions, that number has gone down to half,” said Satya Prakas Das, a member of Saheed Nagar Durga Puja Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/low-key-end-to-a-muted-durga-puja-festivities/articleshow/87069163.cms||Minati Singha
---||Chandigarh||Singhu victim was alive for 30-45 minutes after attack, says accused||AMARKOT/ ROHTAK: A Nihang Sikh surrendered to Punjab Police on Saturday in the case related to the killing of a farm labourer near the farmers’ protest site at the Singhu border on Friday, becoming the second to be arrested for the grisly murder. Narayan Singh of Rakh Devidaspura village in Amritsar district confessed to the cops that he had chopped off the leg of Lakhbir Singh and that he wasn’t remorseful about what he had done. Lakhbir was brutally attacked after he allegedly desecrated a Sikh holy book on Friday. His body was discovered bound to a police barricade near the Singhu border. Another Nihang Sikh, Sarabjeet Singh, arrested on Friday, had admitted to chopping off Lakhbir’s wrist. While presenting him at a Sonipat court on Saturday, the cops submitted that the accused had revealed the names of four people from Punjab involved in the killing. Both Narayan and Sarabjeet were seen in police custody with garlands around their neck, their horrific acts evoking admiration among staunch Nihang Sikhs. Sonipat DSP Virender Singh said that Sarajbeet had been remanded in police custody for seven days. While police had recovered one sword, they were yet to retrieve the weapon used in the killing. On Saturday morning, following reports that Narayan Singh would surrender to police in Amritsar, policemen laid siege to Rakh Devidaspura village to apprehend him. Given the religious sensitivities surrounding the case, SSP Kaushal said care was taken when cornering Narayan in his village. Learning of the huge police presence, the Nihang Sikh apparently tried to hide. The SSP said that Narayan, however, ran out of options and so went to the local gurdwara at 4pm to pray and to announce his surrender through its public address system. Narayan told the media that he reached Delhi on October 15 at 5.35am. He found a group of people having a heated debate, so he stopped his car and asked what the matter was and was informed about the alleged sacrilege. The Nihang Sikh claimed that he first enquired whether Lakhbir was still alive. Learning he was, he drew this sword and hacked the labourer’s leg with three strokes. Others hanged his body on the police barricade. Narayan said the victim was alive for 30-45 minutes after the attack. “I have no remorse,” Narayan declared. “Sri Guru Granth Sahib is revered by the people of all religions, including Hindu, Muslims and Buddhists,” he said, adding that he wasn’t running away from the law and had given himself in. When asked how he was sure that Lakhbir was responsible for the act of sacrilege, Narayan claimed he was seen running away with the two saroops (copies) of the holy book by 200-400 people. A Nihang Sikh caught him and chopped off his hand, he said. Narayan Singh will be handed over to Haryana police for further investigations. Meanwhile, the postmortem report of Lakhbir revealed that he had died due to excessive bleeding. According to a police officer, the labourer’s body, including his legs, showed 35 to 40 injuries caused by sharp and blunt objects The officer said, “The investigation also revealed that he was first dragged for a distance and then beaten up.” Jashandeep Singh Randhawa, superintendent of police, Sonipat, said that the cops were ascertaining whether Sarabjeet, who had claimed to have severed Lakhbir’s hand, had any criminal history. “So far, we haven’t found any previous involvement in crime. But the inquiry is going on,” he said. While pursuing other people involved in the incident, police are also likely to interact with leaders of the protesting farmers about the incident. Meanwhile, Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) demanded an investigation into the incident, alleging a conspiracy to sabotage the movement through religious disharmony. "Media reports from the victim's village and family indicate he was secretively receiving mysterious phone calls,” one SKM leader said. “Lakhbir Singh is supposed to have told his sister that his reach ‘had increased now’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2nd-nihang-sikh-held-in-singhu-murder-case/articleshow/87073899.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||India||J&K sacks Geelani’s grandson from govt job over terror links||NEW DELHI: The Jammu & Kashmir administration on Saturday terminated the services of deceased Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani’s grandson Anees-ul-Islam, a research officer since late 2016 at Srinagar’s Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC) run by the J&K tourism department, under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India, citing irregularities in his appointment. Intelligence sources said Anees’s government job was “arranged” as a “reward” for his grandfather’s role in ending the cycle of violent protests that he had fuelled in Kashmir in July 2016 at the behest of Pakistan’s ISI, in the wake of the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani. The then Mehbooba-led government, through her aide Waheed-ud-din Parra, had offered the job to Anees. The government had issued an advertisement calling for applications from candidates with MBA degree for the post of research officer at SKICC. Though 140 candidates had applied, no one was called for interview except Anees. Anees was selected though he was already working on the same post as an ad havoc staff member, records reveal. “The appointment was done under pressure, flouting established norms and procedures. It appears Syed Ali Shah Geelani bartered violence for his grandson’s government job,” said a J&K government functionary. Technical inputs suggest Anees continues to be in touch with three terror suspects based in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, said another officer. Earlier in July 2021, the J&K government had sacked the two sons of Hizbul Mujahideen chief and banned individual terrorist Syed Salahuddin, under Article 311(2) (c). Syed Ahmad Shakeel and Shahid Yousuf, whose services were terminated over terror links, were employed as laboratory technician at the Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) in Srinagar and with the J&K agriculture department, respectively. Around two dozen J&K government staffers have been terminated so far under Article 311(2)(c) over alleged terror links. The J&K administration on Saturday also sacked a government school teacher in Doda, Farooq Ahmad Butt for his alleged terror links. His brother Mohd Amin Butt is an active Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist, operating from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Farooq, appointed in 2005, was about to carry out an attack on the behest of his brother, an intelligence officer told TOI. Another of his brothers, Safdar Ali, is in jail in a terror case. Anees, son of Geelani’s son Altaf Ahmad Shah alias Funtoosh, was appointed to government service in 2016 during Mehbooba Mufti’s tenure as CM. Sources claimed that Anees travelled to Pakistan between July 31, 2016, and August 7, 2016, just a few months before his appointment as government servant. He is said to have met Colonel Yasir of ISI on the behest of his maternal grandfather Syed Ali Shah Geelani. It is learnt that the whole recruitment process was manipulated, allegedly under pressure from separatist outfits backed by ISI. “It is an open secret that the 2016 protests subsequent to the killing of Burhan Wani in an encounter, were a brainchild of Jamaat-e-Islami and All Parties Hurriyat Conference faction headed by Geelani. Geelani, who died only recently, had fuelled the violent protests in which hundreds of youths were killed, to secure job for his grandson,” said an intelligence officer. Sources also alleged that Anees, prior to his appointment in government service, teamed up with his anti-India friends during 2016 protests to operate drones in and around Srinagar for shooting law and order incidents and other events. The drone footage was shared with Pak ISI, they added. A J&K government functionary said Anees’s appointment was found to be highly irregular. It is suspected that Anees’s appointment to a gazetted grade-equivalent position in the government-controlled SKICC was a deal struck between highly-placed government functionaries and Geelani, to bring down violence during Burhan Wani agitation. “There was no urgency of filling in the post which had been lying vacant since 2005. But officers appeared to be in a hurry after Anees’s return from Pakistan to look for any vacant position in SKICC. Any security agency under the given circumstances could not have granted security clearance to Anees for occupying a public position. But, he was cleared due to pressure,” an official alleged. SKICC is the most prestigious convention and conferencing facility run by J&K government that is used for high-level meetings and VVIP conferences. It is sensitive from the point of view of the topics and subjects dealt during seminars, symposia and workshops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-sacks-geelanis-grandson-from-govt-job-over-terror-links/articleshow/87074047.cms||Bharti Jain

Speaking at a book launch function here, he said society must reach out to this section so as to integrate it with “Bharat”. He visited Kashmir recently and saw that abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 has paved the way for development in the region, Bhagwat said. He also saw Muslim students from J&K stating during a programme in Mumbai last month that they wanted to be part of India and now they could be Indian without any barrier, he said. Earlier, Jammu and Ladakh faced “discrimination” and 80% of the resources spent on the Valley went into local leaders’ pockets, the RSS chief said. Article 370 also came in the way of taking action against terrorists but now nobody fears terrorists, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/integrate-those-seeking-azadi-with-bharat-bhagwat-on-jk/articleshow/87074124.cms||---

The 17th edition of Yudh Abhyas, which is the longest-running joint military training and defence cooperation endeavour between the two armies, is being held at the Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson in Alaska. Around 350 Indian soldiers from the 7 Madras infantry regiment and 300 American troops from the First Squadron (Airborne) of the 40th Cavalry Regiment are taking part in the 14-day exercise. Commander US Army (Alaska) Major General Brian Eifler, during the opening ceremony, asked both contingents to focus on “improving cohesion and interoperability” to achieve training objectives of the exercise. An Indian officer, in turn, said, “We have quite a bit of experience in high-altitude operations. We would like to share our experiences with them. We would like to imbibe lessons from the technological prowess of the US Army.” The joint exercise will facilitate both armies to know each other better, share their wide-ranging tactical experiences and enhance their situational awareness through information exchange. “This will help them in undertaking joint operations at the battalion level in mountainous terrain with cold climatic conditions,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-us-kick-off-military-drill-yudh-abhyas-in-alaska/articleshow/87074141.cms||---
---||India||Every region in India is ‘mainland’: Shah in Port Blair||NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Saturday said “yehi mainland hai”, in the context of descriptions like “northeast and mainland” or “Andamans and Island”, asserting that all the regions of the country are equally important and its people have made equal contributions in making India a great nation. “Whenever I come here or go to the northeast, people and even officers use the term mainland and northeast... and here Island and Andman but I want to make it clear that this is the mainland,” Shah said while interacting with BJP workers and intellectuals at Port Blair. “People should get out of this mindset of mainland and island. This place has made maximum sacrifices,” Shah said as he referred to Cellular Jail where several freedom fighters were imprisoned for years. Shah also said there was a deliberate attempt for years to belittle the contributions of several well-known freedom fighters and even Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel hadn’t been given due recognition. Inaugurating several projects here, Shah said Andaman and Nicobar Islands should be the “pilgrim centre” of India’s freedom movement, and youths of the country should know about the revolutionaries who were subjected to ‘Kala Pani’ punishment in the archipelago. “The islands are a very important place for patriots as Netaji had first hoisted the Tricolour on this soil in 1943 and kept it free from the British rule till 1945,” Shah said. He said the BJP government attempted to undo this by erecting the Statue of Unity in Gujarat, declaring January 23 (Netaji’s birthday) as ‘Parakram Divas’, and installing a massive Tricolour where Netaji had unfurled it in the archipelago. Shah said 14 projects worth Rs 299 crore have been inaugurated, and the foundation stone for 12 projects worth Rs 643 crore have been laid in the archipelago. He said tourism, coconut and fisheries are the three things that change the economic condition of the Islands. Shah took a swipe at Congress saying in its time, one government used to think, another government used to plan, and another used to inaugurate the projects. “Modi ji has created a new work culture, the foundation is also laid by his government and the inauguration is also done by his government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/every-region-in-india-is-mainland-shah-in-port-blair/articleshow/87074168.cms||---
---||India||IAF chief visits Ladakh amid LAC standoff||NEW DELHI: IAF chief Air Chief Marshal V R Chaudhari on Saturday visited Ladakh to review the operational situation and interact with personnel, amidst China’s obdurate stand in resolving the 17-month long military confrontation in the high-altitude region. ACM Chaudhari, in his first visit after taking over as the IAF chief on September 30, took stock of the operational readiness of his force, which included aircraft as well as forward-deployed radars, said sources. With no de-escalation yet in sight in eastern Ladakh, the Indian armed forces are maintaining a strict vigil along the frontier. Having commanded the crucial Western Air Command for a major part of the face-off with China since April-May last year, the IAF chief is well-versed with the operational situation there. Speaking earlier this month, ACM Chaudhari acknowledged China had upgraded its airbases facing India, with hardened shelters and other infrastructure to increase deployment of fighters and bombers there. But the PLAAF (Chinese air force) faces “a huge penalty” in operating from such high-altitude areas. “The PLAAF capability to launch multiple missions is limited. That is a weak area for them. We are fully prepared to deal with any situation and challengen the region,” he had added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iaf-chief-visits-ladakh-amid-lac-standoff/articleshow/87074255.cms||---

BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia also criticised the CWC for not reacting to the brutal murder of a Dalit man at the Singhu border, one of the sites for the farmers’ protests, and questioned if the opposition party stood with the “Talibani mindset” behind the killing. “Anarchic elements are using farmers for their politics, Bhatia said. The BJP leader said for the sake of petty and cheap vote-bank politics, opposition parties, especially Congress, will maintain deafening silence on this issue. “They will not have the courage to call a spade a spade because it does not suit their political narrative,” Bhatia said while also attacking farmer leader Rakesh Tikait for his reported remarks that organisers cannot be blamed for such an incident. Taking a swipe at Sonia Gandhi over her assertion that she was a “full-time and hands on” Congress chief, he noted her status as the interim president of the organisation and the demand of the group of disaffected party members, referred to as G-23, that it should have a full-time head. “It will not be wrong to say that it was less a Congress Working Committee and more a parivar bachao working committee (save family working committee),” he said, alleging that Gandhi’s opening remarks did not touch on a host of issues facing the party and left unanswered people’s questions about Congress-run governments in different states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-mocks-congress-with-parivar-bachao-working-committee-jibe/articleshow/87074288.cms||---
---||India||Security situation alarming, but govt in deep slumber: Sonia at CWC meet||NEW DELHI: Expressing alarm over “the situation in the country”, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday said there has been rapid deterioration in internal and external security scenarios, led by continuing occupation of Indian territory by Chinese troops, 18 months after the Galwan clashes in which India lost 20 soldiers. It said China has not vacated the territory nor has India recovered old positions. While Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said the Centre was “becho becho becho (sell sell sell)” of all assets built over 70 years to hide its failures, the party slammed the BJP government for the country’s economic downslide and spiralling inflation. It also said that India is no longer regarded as a democracy but is viewed as an “electoral autocracy”. Accusing the BJP regime of authoritarianism, the party said the judiciary has been debilitated by not filling the vacancies while watchdogs have been rendered toothless, media forced into submission with threats, and common people and political rivals targeted through surveillance. Congress called on all political parties to oppose the BJP regime in the interest of democracy. In the resolutions passed, Congress said aggressive posture of China and unabated infiltrations from Pakistan have resulted in dramatic deterioration in security of J&K. It said after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, the situation is “graver” but government seems to be “oblivious or in deep slumber”. Calling the J&K administration “incompetent”, the party said statehood was the way forward. It also pointed to security challenges in the North East and inter-state flareups in the region. Congress said the seizure of 3,000 kgs of heroin at Gujarat’s Adani port has exposed that drug trafficking has assumed monstrous proportions under the Narendra Modi regime. While pointing to sliding economy and growing joblessness, Congress said the farmers’ agitation is in its 10th month but the “arrogant” Centre has refused to engage with them while rogue BJP elements were inflicting violence on them as in the massacre in Lakhimpur Kheri. “The refusal of the PM to condemn the brutal murder of the farmers and to sack the MoS have shocked the conscience of the country,” it said. However, the party steered clear of any mention of the lynching at Singhu border near Delhi this week. Congress also slammed the recent home ministry amendments to empower the Border Security Force in states, calling it an atta-ck on federalism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/security-situation-alarming-but-govt-in-deep-slumber-sonia-at-cwc-meet/articleshow/87074561.cms||---
---||India||Cong’s first list of UP candidates may be out next week||NEW DELHI: In a move that can be interpreted in multiple ways, Congress is likely to announce its first batch of candidates for the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh next week, more than two months before the polls are to be announced. Well-placed sources said AICC’s election committee will meet early next week — possibly Tuesday or Wednesday — to finalise around 45-50 candidates, whose names would subsequently be announced. Elections in UP are likely to begin in February, along with Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur. For a party known for its much-criticised delay in selection of candidates, this new-found urgency in UP is surprising even to Congress insiders. A party manager said the idea is to clear the names in “strong” seats so that the candidates get time to win over voters. He said the seats likely to be discussed and finalised in the first instalment are the ones that, according to party feedback, are viewed as “strong” turfs despite years of Congress’s marginalisation in the state. The initiative by Congress comes in the backdrop of the aggression shown by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi in the wake of the Lakhimpur Kheri farmers’ massacre. Having managed to generate enthusiasm among workers and having forced BJP on the back foot, it is likely to be viewed as an attempt by the party to use its new-found recall value to position itself as a serious player in the elections. At the CWC meeting on Saturday, Priyanka raised the issue of early declaration of candidates in UP, adding that it will also help stop leaders from leaving. Many are also likely to see it as Congress’ attempt to push like-minded parties by showing a strong intent to tap voters. Any improved showing by Congress may come at the cost of other anti-BJP parties like Samajwadi Party. It could be seen as a proactive Congress strategy to nudge them into an alliance or into an understanding that they till now have been averse to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congs-first-list-of-up-candidates-may-be-out-next-week/articleshow/87074675.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

He also sought “ideological clarity” among party functionaries. Pointing to Punjab CM Charanjit Channi, Rahul said when he called to convey to Channi that he would replace Amarinder Singh, the latter broke down in disbelief. Channi apparently told Rahul that he could not believe a Dalit from a humble background was being appointed as the CM. With that anecdote, Rahul said caste consciousness still exists and was hard to accept. Narrating other incidents he had witnessed, Rahul said he does not believe in “untouchability” and that every helpless and persecuted person, including women who face discrimination and are not being heard, are oppressed. A CWC member said Rahul added that during the Akhlaq lynching episode, he wanted to visit the village as he was repulsed by the crime, but that some people had other views. The Gandhi scion said any helpless person denied hearing should be supported regardless of identity. As Rahul listed out his agenda in the wake of demands that he take over the leadership, the hot button issue of organisational elections, which has polarised the party and even created a dissident bloc G23, passed off rather peacefully. While party veteran AK Antony led the chorus for Rahul to take over the reins of the party, Ashok Gehlot said both Sonia and Priyanka had urged him to request Rahul to take over since he listens to his counsel. Channi said the decision to appoint him as president was for the CWC to take and that he should not resist, a request that met with concurrence from Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and Priyanka. Participants in the CWC said senior leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and Mukul Wasnik gave suggestions about the party’s functioning. AICC managers Randeep Surjewala, Jitendra Singh and Ajay Make lashed out at G23 for holding dinners and giving press statements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-pitches-for-ideological-clarity-among-partymen/articleshow/87074790.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Keenly aware of her responsibilities towards the Nehru-Gandhi legacy, and the need to keep Congress intact, Sonia has helmed the party through some tough times, but the current phase may well prove the most challenging.

The road transport and highways ministry has issued a list of conditions, including failure to complete rectifications and maintenance which will result in declaring contractors as “non-performers”. Attaching the tag of “non-performers” can be a roadblock to bid for future projects. As per a circular issued by the ministry, in the case of any minor failure of structure or highway resulting in any casualty, the contractor concerned will have to carry out rectification at its own cost. In addition, 5% of the contract value of the failed or defective work or 0.5% value of the entire project cost, whichever is more, will be imposed on such contractors. In the case of major failure of any structure or highway resulting in casualties, the contractor or concessionaire will be debarred from getting work for up to one year or till completion of the work. The highways authorities will also slap fines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deadline-misses-to-earn-national-highway-contractors-non-performer-tag/articleshow/87074932.cms||Dipak K Dash

Weather experts attributed the intense spell, which saw many places recording more than 5 cm of rainfall within a span of two hours, to a ‘mini-cloud burst event’. Peermade recorded the highest rainfall in the state with 24 cm followed by Cheruthoni, Chalakudy and Poonjar at 14 cm. Six districts were put on red alert on Saturday. As per IMD’s daily monsoon report, Kerala received 74% excess rainfall on Saturday. Between Oct 7 and October 13, the state has received 166% excess rainfall averaging about 19 cm rain. Several people were injured and displaced in rain-related incidents. Dams in many districts are nearing their full capacity and small towns and villages in hilly areas are cut off from the outside world. Kottayam and Pathanamthitta are the most affected districts as of now. “The situation is grievous,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The IAF and Army have deployed their assets in Kottayam, Idukki and Pathanamthitta. Army personnel from Pangode Military Station have been rushed to flood-affected areas. Mi-17 and Sarang helicopters are on standby to meet the requirements at Sulur air base. However, due to bad weather, they could not be operated till late evening. All bases under southern Air Command have been put on high alert in view of the prevalent weather situation, said a defence spokesperson. A high-level meeting chaired by Pinarayi resolved to ramp up rescue operations in places hit hard by heavy rain. He asked officials to keep a strict vigil on the water levels of dams Meanwhile, three members of a family were killed and nearly eight people were missing following a landslide in Plappally in Kottayam.

According to them, it is indeed an irony that while the country has been relegated to the 101st position in the Global Hunger Index this year, around 67 million tonnes of food worth around Rs92,000 crore is wasted every year. Besides, nearly 21 million metric tonnes of wheat rot in the country annually due to poor storage, they said. The situation is almost similar in Bihar where both raw foodgrains as well as cooked food are callously wasted every day. About one third of the foodgrains produced in the state is wasted every year and, in the process, 24% of food calories are lost, said Patna University biotechnology teacher Birendra Prasad. “People are in the habit of hoarding foodgrains in their homes for a longer period. But grains usually rot in the absence of proper storage facilities. Most farmers also adopt the classical methods of storage and distribution, which often lead to the wastage of foodgrains,” said Prasad, adding that a consumer awareness campaign should be launched in the state to educate the people about the necessity of conservation of foodgrains. In fact, awareness about stopping wastage of food should be created among schoolchildren to start with, he said. Patliputra Samaj Kalyan Sansthan’s secretary H K Singh said the per capita consumption of cereals is higher in Bihar than the all India average. But, in terms of nutritious food, the state lags behind other states. “In today’s time, the eating habits of people are not proper. Most of us love fast food, which is extremely harmful to our health. We must try to avoid refined food items, sugar, processed food and street food items from our diet,” he said. A retired economics teacher of Patna University, N K Choudhary, said food waste is an issue of importance to global food security and the environment. Every day, food suitable for human consumption is wasted in large quantities in medium and high-income group people. They order a large amount of food items in hotels and marriage and other social functions and consume only a part of it. The unconsumed food is wasted. Besides, a huge amount of foodgrains is wasted in FCI godowns and railway stations in he absence of foolproof storage and supply, he said. Choudhary pointed out that with the growth of tourism and hospitality industries in recent times, the wastage of food is likely to increase considerably. The concept of setting up “food bank” for collecting unconsumed food from hotels and parties and distributing the same among the needy would go a long way in reducing wastage of food. But this must be done under a well knit institutional framework, he said. Social activist and environmentalist Mehta Nagendra Singh said, “When we waste food, we waste all the resources that go into producing and transporting the food, such as land, water and fuel use. When food ends up in landfill, it also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, causing environmental concern. Hence, we must stop wasting food at all costs, in the larger interest of the teeming millions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/wastage-a-concern-as-people-celebrate-world-food-day/articleshow/87069117.cms||B K Mishra

Police said the girl was last seen on Thursday night when she had gone to a neighbour’s house for eating in a ‘bhandara’. Manjhagarh police station SHO Vishal Anand said the girl seems to have been strangled. Her clothes were torn. “Only the postmortem report would make it clear if she was raped before being murdered. However, her family members suspect that she was subjected to sexual assault before being killed,” he said. Anand said police have detained a few suspects for interrogation on Saturday. “The spot from where the body was recovered is around 3km away from her residence,” he added. One arrested: One Hari Rai (32) was arrested from Kalimpur under Vishambharpur police station area in Gopalganj district on Saturday for allegedly raping a 12-year-old girl. Vishambharpur police station SHO Dinesh Kumar Yadav said he was arrested from his residence in Kalimpur. “The minor was going to relieve herself on October 10 morning when she was kidnapped by two persons and kept hostage in a room in Hari’s house, where he had raped her,” he said, quoting the FIR lodged by the girl’s family. Yadav said the girl was released from captivity on October 13. “Then her family members approached the police. However, it is surprising that no one could hear the girl’s scream from Hari’s house,” he said. The SHO said the girl’s medical reports are awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4-year-old-girl-killed-in-gopalganj/articleshow/87069041.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: Over 2 lakh Bhavani devotees throng Kanaka Durga temple||VIJAYAWADA: The rush of Bhavani devotees continued on Saturday at the Kanaka Durga temple. Though festivities concluded with ‘Poorna Ahuti’ on Friday, lakhs of Bhavani devotees arrived at the temple from across the country. The nine-day-long Dasara festival at the Kanaka Durga temple drew around 4.8 lakh devotees. Officials had initially decided to permit only 10,000 devotees per day, but relaxed this number at the last minute. The Goddess Kanaka Durga was worshipped as Goddess Raja Rajeswari on Friday and officials performed Teppotsavam (boat ride) on the Krishna river. Around 20,000 devotees participated in the ritual. Police blocked traffic on Kanaka Durga flyover and permitted devotees to view the festivities. Teppotsavam was conducted on an anchored boat after flood levels in the Krishna crossed 1.6 lakh cusecs on Friday evening. Meanwhile, around 2.2 lakh Bhavani devotees had darshan till 6 pm on Saturday, posing a challenge in maintaining social distancing for police and temple officials. The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) distributed two lakh masks to Bhavani devotees and deployed volunteers to enforce Covid-19 protocols. Temple officials have cancelled VIP and protocol darshan till Monday. District collector J Nivas and police commissioner B Srinivasulu conducted a surprise inspection at queues and interacted with Bhavani devotees. Meanwhile, a few outsiders fleeced Bhavani devotees by arranging fake tonsuring and Deeksha Viramana counters. Devotees were charged Rs 150 for tonsuring, a service that the temple provides free of cost. Temple executive officer D Bramarambha said they are taking stringent action against persons looting Bhavani devotees. She said no ‘Viramana’ relinquishment counters have been arranged this year in view of the warning by health authorities, and asked devotees to relinquish Deeksha at their home towns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/festivities-over-bhavani-devotees-rush-to-durga-temple/articleshow/87070571.cms||Venu Lanka

The militant is 26-year-old Korra Kumari of Mettaguda village in GK Veedhi mandal in Vizag Agency. She was an area committee member (ACM) of the Pedabayalu Dalam of the outlawed CPI(Maoist). B Krishna Rao, Visakha rural SP, said Kumari was involved in 46 offences, including six murders, five exchanges of fire, two blasts, three cases of arson, two kidnappings and 28 other offences. Police said Kumari joined the outfit in Galikonda in 2009. Since 2015, she was working in Pedabayalu Dalam. She played a crucial role in recent exchanges of fire between Maoists and security forces at Thadakapalli, Teegalametta and Landulu.

The daily number of cases for three continuous days in the last days of Navratri remained at three or above. The last time that the city witnessed three or more cases for consecutive days was between September 25 and 27. After this, a similar situation has prevailed from Wednesday to Friday. On Saturday, however, only one case was reported again. But, if officials are to be believed, this rise may just be a coincidence. They say that the situation will have to be monitored for a few more days before reaching to any conclusion. While the mingling of people in the past may have led to spikes, officials said that the situation this time was different. They added that many had been exposed to the virus by now and the vaccinaton in the city and district had reached good numbers. This is expected to ensure that the spread to the disease is much lesser. Also, it has come to light that most cases in the past few days had come to light due to contract tracing or took ill after coming in touch with a Covid patient. The cases were not spread across the city. “Presently, we do not see it as a rise due to Navratri. The cases are from the same family. At times, the results of samples collected for contact tracing come over a couple of days. This may show higher numbers over a period of time, but it is actually a result of contact tracing,” said VMC’s medical officer (health), Dr Devesh Patel. Also, the number came down to one again on Saturday. “If there was a spread, this (one case) should not have happened ideally,” he said. Patel further said that testing had been doubled his month. “Despite aggressive testing, we are not finding any cases,” he said. From around 1,200 tests a day last month, the number has increased to around 3,000 in the recent past including 4,109 on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/spike-in-cases-spurs-questions-about-laxity/articleshow/87069943.cms||---

Assistant director of the child protection unit, Bhojpur, Vinod Kumar Thakur told the media on Saturday that all the 10 escapees had been traced and would be brought back to the child observation home very soon. According to the sources, the deceased had surrendered in a kidnapping case after the parents of a girl with whom he had allegedly eloped to Delhi, lodged an FIR against him. The in-charge superintendent of the observation home, Ravi Shankar Verma, told the media that the deceased from Buxar was brought to Ara on October 6. He was found hanging with his gamchha (scarf) in the bathroom of the quarantine ward. In another incident, 33 youths, who were juveniles at the time of committing crime, escaped from the ‘place of safety’ at Babhandi under Mufassil police station area of Aurangabad district late Friday night after creating ruckus allegedly over delay in getting food and proper clothes. However, police recovered 21 of them from different locations in Aurangabad and neighbouring districts till Saturday evening. “Efforts are on to trace the remaining 12 youths,” Aurangabad DM Saurabh Jorawal said. ‘Place of safety’ is an extended form of observation home where accused between 18 and 21 years of age are kept while facing trial for a heinous crime which they had committed while being a juvenile, the authorities explained. Bihar has two more places of safety, in Sheikhpura and Saharsa. When contacted, the superintendent of Aurangabad ‘place of safety’, Vikramaditya Paul, the youths created ruckus over delay in getting lunch and dinner on Friday and demanded proper clothes. “They were to be served fish for dinner. However, on their request, fish was served in lunch. Due to Dussehra, the market was closed and the lunch was delayed because of late preparations. They protested over it,” he said. Sadar SDPO Gautam Sharan Omi said an FIR was registered. He said the DM has constituted a four-member committee headed by the DDC to inquire into the incident and submit a report within a day.

---||Patna||Pashupati Kumar Paras skips reply to his bhabhi’s allegations||PATNA: Union minister and Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party chief Pashupati Kumar Paras preferred to maintain a low profile while reacting to the allegations levelled against him by Reena Paswan, the wife of his elder brother and former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan. “I have answered all the queries regarding the Lok Janshakti Party. There is no need to repeat the same all the time. I don’t intend to explain it further,” Paras said, while reacting to Reena Paswan’s allegations on Thursday that he split the LJP only to fulfil his political aspirations. “Paras had started maintaining distance ever since Ram Vilas ji was admitted to the hospital for treatment,” she added. In her first interaction with media after her husband’s death in October last year, Reena said Paras’ family members, including his wife, did not respond to her phone calls after his (Ram Vilas) death. “It hurts me from within when I have to explain my relationship with my husband after so many years of our marriage,” she said. She claimed that the the LJP founder had fielded Paras from Hajipur after she refused to plunge into politics. And he (Paras) won by the blessings of his elder brother, who had earlier won from the seat with record margins. “In fact, Ram Vilas ji wanted me to contest from Hajipur before finalizing Paras’s name,” she disclosed. Reena alleged that she was more apprehensive of her son Chirag Paswan’s life, who is fighting a lone battle for his political career. “That’s why I have asked Chirag to travel with his trusted friends,” she said, adding that she never expected such action from Paras, who more than often described the senior Paswan as his ‘bhagwan’ (God). Reena said even Ram Vilas had noticed a change in the ‘behaviour’ of Paras when he was alive. “He (Ram Vilas) wanted to know the reason for spreading fictitious stories about the party by Paras. Had he expressed his willingness to become a minister at the Centre, I would have helped him to cherish his dreams,” she asserted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/paras-skips-reply-to-his-bhabhis-allegations/articleshow/87069817.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Petrol, diesel prices hiked for 13th time this month||PATNA: Fuel prices continue to reach record highs as the oil companies made petrol and diesel costlier by 40 paise and 35 paise per litre, respectively, on Saturday, the 13th hike this month. With the fresh hike, petrol is being sold at Rs 109.06 per litre and diesel at above Rs 100 per litre in the city. The retail price of diesel has reached Rs 100.99 per litre. The fuel rates have been revised upwards 13 times this month. As a result, petrol has become costlier by Rs 4.20 per litre and diesel by 4.38 per litre so far this month. The oil companies and fuel stations have blamed rise in prices of international crude oil for the hike. Global crude oil price is trading at $84.86 per barrel. Experts said fuel prices would continue to increase at least till December. Sudhanshu Kumar, an economist at the Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance, Patna, said unless there are changes in taxes on petroleum products, the fuel prices would continue upward trend. “The fiscal health of the state government does not provide room for any reduction in taxes in near future. Also, it is clear that the petroleum products are not going to come under goods and services tax (GST) easily. Therefore, the prices will keep changing with the crude oil prices with little manipulation by the central government through control over oil PSUs, mostly during the upcoming state elections,” Sudhanshu told this newspaper. The continuous surge in oil prices has irked transporters, commuters and citizens. Residents are already suffering from financial constraints caused by Covid-19 pandemic and the rising fuel prices have added to their woes. Sneha Jain, a resident of Makhaniyakuan, said she used to pay Rs 350 to refill her two-wheeler’s fuel tank in every 15-20 days, but it now costs Rs 500. “Still, the petrol does not last for more than 10 days. As a result of fuel price rise, prices of essential commodities have also skyrocketed. It has become difficult for us to manage household budget,” she said. Deepak Kumar, a bank employee, said, “Saving money has become difficult as rise in fuel prices has also made other essential commodities costlier. There is no way we can cut our daily needs.” Raj Kumar Jha, general secretary of All India Road Transport Workers’ Federation- Bihar, said less than 50% autorickshaws are plying on the roads in Patna. “Many have changed their profession due to rise in prices of fuel. The state government is not coming to our rescue,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/petrol-diesel-prices-hiked-for-13th-time-this-month/articleshow/87068870.cms||Faryal Rumi

At Chowk Mor in Patna City, one Vicky Choudhary (23) was shot dead while taking part in an idol immersion procession late on Friday evening. Patna City SDPO Amit Sharan said Vicky had picked up a verbal fight with an unidentified youth which snowballed into a scuffle. “The youth opened fire targeting Vicky, killing him on the spot,” he said. At Nanpur in Sitamarhi, at least four cops, including sub-inspector Vijay Kumar Ram, were injured when villagers pelted stones targeting a police team. The villagers also attacked the cops with sticks and rods. The police team had gone to Raipur Pokhar village to free members of a Puja committee who were held hostage by the locals. Nanpur SHO Ram Vinay Kumar said the Puja committee members had immersed two of the four idols in the pond when the villagers objected and asked them do a ‘parikrama’ with the idols as per the rituals. “As the Puja committee members refused to do so citing Covid restrictions, they were held hostage by the villagers,” the SHO added. Though sources said police fired in the air to disperse the mob, the SHO denied the allegation. He said an FIR was lodged against 27 villagers and 150 unknown people on the basis of the injured SI’s statement. Meanwhile, four cops were injured in a clash between police and anti-social elements near Warisaliganj railway station in Nawada on Friday night. The incident took place when the anti-social elements allegedly attempted to harass girls near a Puja pandal. SHO of Warisaliganj police station Pawan Kumar said one person was arrested in connection with the clash. At Don Bazaar under the Darauli police station area in Siwan, irate villagers pelted stones when officials tried to stop an orchestra programme. Some government vehicles were damaged in the attack.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: CFO, CHRO & administrative executive are ‘assistant professors’ at PDEU||AHMEDABAD: In the latest NIRF rankings for 2021, the Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) at Gandhinagar ranked 68th in engineering category, jumping an impressive 109 spots from 177th rank in NIRF 2020. The PDEU, which did not figure in the top 300 university category last year, also ranks 73rd across India in NIRF 2021. Excellence in performance on a number of parameters, namely research work, student placements, inclusivity and outreach and a good student-teacher ratio among others, are being credited for the feat. PDEU had 313 teaching staff members in 2020 which rose by 43% to 449 in 2021. To put the increase in perspective, the NIRF submissions by Nirma University saw the number of faculty rise from 525 to 528, a mere 0.5%, and IIT Gandhinagar 111 to 122, a rise of 9%. MS University on the other hand recorded a drop of 60% in faculty numbers from 1,457 to 589. A section of senior academicians who have analysed NIRF submissions by key universities have red-flagged that PDEU doubled up a number of administrative staff members as assistant professors. “Analysis of the details uploaded by PDEU revealed that the chief human resources officer (CHRO), chief finance officer (CFO), administrative executive, examination staff and even personal assistant and secretary have been listed as ‘assistant professors’,” said a senior academician. “This effectively means that many of the key administrative staff were full-time faculties teaching at the university along with imparting their non-teaching duties,” said sources. In a query by TOI as to why many administrative staff were shown as assistant professors, PDEU registrar Prof Tarun Shah said that there is no discrepancy in the details submitted to the NIRF for assessment. “...National Education Policy 2020 is being followed wherein in-house talent is being used to impart skill-based and experiential learning courses...” All submissions made to the NIRF are available on the university’s website. “It is to note that the CFO is also discharging the responsibility as director of Innovation and Incubation Centre of the University, and thereby spearheading skill-based and entrepreneurship programs to the students. He has also been delivering courses relevant to his expertise at the university for many years. CHRO is also mandated with teaching responsibility and is also the senior mentor at the same centre,” mentioned the email. About 10-plus administrative staff members are listed as assistant professors – an academic position that requires permanent employment with PhD degree or special expertise – the registrar said that they have the qualification and competency to impart academic progression. “Such staff undertake language courses for the foreign students/ student mentoring in Student Research Programmes/ field exploration, data collection and other learning modules. Some of them also prepare students for developing innovative proposals for its incubation, soft skills and professional skill development as well,’ mentioned the email. PDEU top management said that such members of the staff have been appropriated as a part of the teaching fraternity in line with skill training modules as per National Education Policy 2020. Answering about the pay scale of the ‘assistant professors,’ the authorities confirmed that they do draw the salary for the teaching work conducted. “As per the NEP guideline, 35% of courses were modified as skill-based and experiential learning courses, requiring a new set of teaching-learning resources (TLR)… A significant take in the HR policy is needed to achieve NEP objectives in addition to the regular teaching pattern. Since 35% of skill-based courses are appropriated in our curriculum, we need proficiency in several verticals, including co-curricular and extracurricular courses, which are to be embedded in the main design of curriculum 2020 at PDEU,” mentioned the registrar in email response. “In this endeavour, we have given top priority to adopt an appropriate in-house expertise available for several of these courses. We have a highly talented skillset from both the Academic & admin staff, to this end.” The practice – however – is unique to PDEU, said academia experts. The Registrar of a top private university told TOI that there are three categories to be listed for NIRF and they don’t generally overlap. “The categories include teaching, administration and science. Thus, if the other categories are involved in teaching, it surely is a unique idea,” said the registrar. PDEU officials said that the submission was duly checked by NIRF authorities and all due care is taken to ensure that all the right information is provided for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cfo-chro-administrative-executive-are-assistant-professors-at-pdeu/articleshow/87069625.cms||Parth Shastri

Meanwhile, Atkur cops received a complaint from Chalapaka Ramana Murthy, manager of the cooperative federation, who said Rs 5 crore worth fixed deposits were liquidated through fabricated documents. In both cases, the accused forged employees’ signatures to liquidate the FDs, which bore similarity to the recent Telugu Akademi fraud unearthed in Hyderabad where Rs 64 crore worth of fixed deposits were liquidated.

---||Delhi||‘My big break came late, I didn’t play my cards well’||Neena Gupta is often described as rebellious, but she doesn’t consider herself to be a rebel. “I have done these ‘rebellious things’ because of the circumstances I was in. It wasn’t in my hands to do the things I wanted to do so I made the most of what my luck gave me at that time.” She revealed that she began writing her memoir Sach Kahun Toh many times over the last 10-15 years, but it was the pandemic that enabled her to finish it. “I had time to think about my life, what I have done and what I want to do,” she told Vinita Dawra Nangia at a session of the Times Literature Festival. Though she’s considered successful today, Gupta spoke about how her timidity and lack of self-esteem affected her initially. “In college, I knew I was a much better actor than the other girls in the play, but I didn’t have the courage to go to the director and say, can you let me try,” she says. “I am still a little bit like that – I don’t have the courage to say main achhi hun, mujhe do.” Gupta reflected on how the lack of a mentor impacted her own career, such as the time she lost a film role when she didn’t call Shekhar Kapoor because she thought he would call her back. “There was no one to help me so I made a lot of mistakes,” she says. “I was also too shy. I came with the idea that I will do one film and people will come to me but nothing like that happened. That is why the one break I was looking for -- Badhaai Ho -- came so late because I didn’t play my cards well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/my-big-break-came-late-i-didnt-play-my-cards-well/articleshow/87074287.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to the police. accused Shailesh Panchasara called the police control room himself after killing his ex-wife Neha Parmar at around midnight on Friday and surrendered. The couple who has a three-year-old daughter out of their five years of marriage, had recently got divorced five months ago. The daughter was living with the deceased. Shailesh, who started to have doubts on his paternity as he suspected Neha of having an extra marital affair, had gone to his house in Ghanteshwar area at around 9pm on Friday to clear his misgivings. Neha, who was living with her parents, did not tell them that she was going to meet Shailesh. She informed her parents that she was going to meet her cousin in Bajrangwadi area and will go to her work directly from her house the next day. From Ghanteshwar, Shailesh took Neha to an isolated place near Atal Sarovar on the new Ring Road. Here, he stabbed her but Neha started to scream after which he throttled her with a cloth piece. Assistant commissioner of police (west), P K Diyora said, “After killing his wife, the accused informed the police control room. A police van went to the spot and he showed cops the body. The police then called up Neha’s parents to reach the crime spot to identify the body.” During interrogation, the accused, who drives light commercial vehicles, alleged his ex-wife of having an affair and not taking proper care of their daughter. He was in search of an opportunity to confront her and sometime in between, Neha invited him to meet her, he said. However, cops are collecting evidences like call detail record and CCTV footage to substantiate the statement of the accused. Meanwhile, father of the deceased woman who drives an autorickshaw, has alleged that the accused kept harassing his daughter even after divorce. He had also threatened to kill her even in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-suspects-ex-wife-of-affair-stabs-her-to-death/articleshow/87070431.cms||---

Tej Pratap on Saturday released an official statement on his newly floated Chhatra Janshakti Parishad (CJP) letter pad and stated that he along with CJP members will support Atirek Kumar from Kusheshwar Asthan. However, he will back RJD’s Arun Kumar in Tarapur. Earlier this month, Tej had met Congress working president and Atirek’s father Ashok Ram, who had lost to JD(U) in the 2020 assembly polls. CJP’s state president Prashant Pratap Yadav said by supporting Congress, Tej was following the coalition dharma. “The Congress-RJD alliance had been made by Lalu ji and Tej Pratap is trying to carry forward this relation. Few in the RJD have made a mistake by not allowing Congress to fight from Kusheshwar Asthan,” said Prashant. The announcement is set to widen the gap in the Lalu’s family, especially between Tej Pratp and his younger brother and leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. While the two brothers have differences over several issues, the decision by Tej seems to have jeopardised the plan of Lalu, who was to visit Bihar and campaign for his party candidates in the Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies. Now, Lalu will not come from Delhi, where he is recuperating at the residence of his daughter and Rajya Sabha member, Misa Bharti, his wife and former CM Rabri Devi said. A party source said the anti-party activity by Tej was a reason why Lalu was sad and this could bring the party on the back foot. His presence may even mar the stature of Tejashwi, who had already proved his mettle in the last assembly election. However, RJD’s state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan cited health issues as the reason for Lalu not coming to Bihar. “He is supposed to stay on just one litre of liquid, including water, in a day. His doctor has yet not advised him for travelling. For us his health is most important,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tej-to-support-cong-in-kusheshwar-asthan/articleshow/87068933.cms||Sheezan Nezami

It also claimed light rainfall at a few places in the south-central and southeast Bihar in the last 24 hours. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issued yellow alert for Patna and several other districts in northwest, southwest, north-central and south-central parts of Bihar, indicating thunderstorm accompanied with lightning till Monday due to prevailing weather systems and convective activity over the Bay of Bengal. West Champaran, Gopalganj, Siwan, Saran and Buxar may experience heavy rainfall at isolated places on October 18 and 19. The authorities concerned have been asked to be watchful for extreme weather developments. “A low pressure area hase been developed over the west-central Bay of Bengal and Northwest Bay of Bengal off north Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha coast. The associated cyclonic circulation extends up to 5.8km above the mean sea level, tilting southwestwards with height. Under the influence of this weather system, light rainfall may occur at one or two places in southern districts of Bihar, including Patna, during the next 24 hours whereas northern parts of the state would remain dry,” an official at the Patna MeT office, Dinesh Kumar Bharti, said. According to weather scientists, the day and night temperatures in most parts of Bihar would remain below the normal due to convective activity during the next 48 hours. Sanjay Kumar, a weather scientist at Patna MeT Centre, said the low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal likely to bring rain over the state on October 18 and 19. “Southern parts will be affected due to cyclonic circulation while some districts in northern parts, especially near the Himalayan foothills, may experience heavy rainfall in some isolated places due to temperatures constrast,” he told this newspaper on Saturday. “During this period, the easterly wind becomes more strong and cloud formation would be seen. However, the temperature will not fall much. Once the westerly wind sets in from October 21, we will see significant change in day and night temperatures,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/imd-predicts-rain-till-monday/articleshow/87068823.cms||Faryal Rumi

Inaugurating the new ICU, AIIMS-P director Dr P K Singh said it was the need of the hour. “In cases road accidents, many people get head injuries and need immediate treatment by experts of different branches, including neurosurgery, in a special facility,” he said. The trauma and emergency department of the AIIMS-P, which functions 24x7, already has 37 beds equipped with all life-support systems, but the new 16-bed ICU would be used only for neurotrauma cases. After remaining closed for about eight months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the trauma and emergency department resumed service on August 23. Since then, there has been a regular flow of patients from across the state. Dr Anil Kumar, head of the hospital’s department of trauma and emergency, said on an average 150 patients reach the department per day. “These patients include victims of road accident (mainly bikers), gunshot injuries and snake bites, besides those suffering from kidney failure, serious pneumonia, breathlessness, advance stages of cancer and brain haemorrhage,” he said. “Patients with brain injuries require immediate attention. The line of treatment requires teamwork of different branches like surgery, neurosurgery, anaesthesia, medicine and ICU. While 10 beds of the neurotrauma ICU are equipped with ventilators, the remaining six are high-dependency unit beds with monitors,” Dr Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/neurotrauma-icu-opens-at-aiims-p/articleshow/87068711.cms||VK Tripathi

Police said it was a monetary dispute and are investigating the matter. A commission agent by profession, Sanjay Bajaj, had taken a loan on interest and was being harassed by a relative after he failed to repay the amount, according to sources. The incident took place under Adarsh Mandi police station area of Shamli on Friday evening. He was rushed to a local hospital where his health condition is said to be stable. His wife, however, alleged that police were not taking appropriate action and had favoured the moneylender. "We paid more than Rs 17 lakh to him with interest, but he kept on asking for more. My husband is an honest man and didn't want to create any trouble. He sold his shop and paid him whatever he demanded," she said. The victim's kin later blocked a road in protest. Additional superintendent of police (ASP), OP Singh, rushed to the site to calm things. On Saturday, the ASP said, "There was a monetary dispute between two businessmen. It was being probed by the local police. But, Sanjay Bajaj consumed a poisonous substance. He is receiving treatment at a private hospital and is out of danger. An investigation is currently underway." There have been several such incidents in the past where debtors were pushed to take the extreme step. For instance, in June, a family of four had committed suicide in Shahjahanpur. Similarly, a fruit-seller in Lucknow had killed himself in August 2020 and so did a 65-year-old man from Bareilly in June this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bizman-tries-to-kill-self-after-harassment-by-moneylender/articleshow/87068623.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Thiruvananthapuram||CPR training for traffic wing members||Thiruvananthapuram: A special training session was conducted here on Saturday in which policemen from the traffic wing of the city were provided training on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as part of imparting basic responders skills among the police officers. The training session was conducted by Brain Wire, a medical research company based in Kochi. The police are often the first responders to any emergencies that occur in public places. This sometimes includes medical emergencies too, hence the significance of such training programmes. Under present conditions, when someone experiences a cardiac arrest or heart attack in public places, it would take at least 10 to 15 minutes before an ambulance with the emergency medical team reaches the patient. With each passing minute, the brain suffers 7 to 10% damage. Police officers who are present on road manning traffic could become lifesavers in situations like this. The training was conducted through innovative measures using 3D virtual reality video. During the session, cops were given training in restarting the heart and thereby the blood circulation. The training session was led by emergency medicine expert Dr Mohammed Haneef M. Brain Wire has given shape to the training programme with a vision to reduce deaths due to heart ailments such as cardiac arrests and heart attacks. According to its directors Kiran N M and Raj, the training programme is intended for the public and not just police officers alone. Because, more than 60% of cardiac arrests happen within households and in most of these cases as the family members are unaware of basic first aid measures to be taken. The training session was inaugurated by state police chief Anil Kant. ADGP (Headquarters) Manoj Abraham also attended the inauguration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpr-training-for-traffic-wing-members/articleshow/87070475.cms||---

The names of neither Ranjan nor Yadav figured in the list of 20 star campaigners of the party released last week. Sources in the party said both the leaders have been nominated observers keeping in mind the ‘Yadav’ votes, which are in sizeable numbers in both the constituencies going to the polls on October 30. Atirek Kumar, the son of former MLA Ashok Ram, is the Congress candidate against Aman Bhushan Hazari of JD(U), Ganesh Bharti of RJD and Anshu Devi of LJP (Ram Vilas) in Kusheshwar Asthan, which, besides having a sizeable population of Dalits, is also home to a large number of Yadavs. The Congress is relying on an upper caste leader Rajesh Mishra in Tarapur against RJD’s Arun Kumar, Rajiv Kumar Singh of JD(U) and Kumar Chandan of LJP (Ram Vilas). With announcing the names of party observers for both the seats, the Congress has given enough indications that it is fighting the election with the aim of winning both the seats. Congress MLC and chief spokesperson Prem Chandra Mishra said the party was hopeful of its victory in the bypolls. However, only time will tell whether the Congress’s decision to contest both the seats in the bypolls against ally RJD besides opponent JD(U), one thing is sure that the results will certainly affect its relationship with its alliance partner. Meanwhile, former Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav, the husband of Ranjeet Ranjan, said he will campaign for his party candidate Yogi Chaupal from Kusheshwar Asthan. Meanwhile, Sanjay Kumar withdrew his nomination papers from Tarapur on the last day of withdrawal of papers on Saturday. Sanjay had filed papers against RJD’s Arun Kumar, but later joined the party led by Lalu Prasad. Md Jasimuddin, who had filed his papers as a Rashtriya Justice Party candidate, also withdrew his nomination, RJD Youth wing’s national general secretary Avinash Kumar Vidyarthi said. “Their presence in the fray would have split the RJD’s ‘Yadav-Muslim’ votes,” a senior RJD leader said. According to the election commission, eight contestants remained in the fray from Kusheshwar Asthan and nine from Tarapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congress-names-observers-for-assembly-bypolls/articleshow/87068971.cms||Ramashankar

INLD state president Nafe Singh Rathi claimed that Kanda was using scare tactics againt the voters by moving about with the government machinery and excessive security, while his brother, Haryana Lokhit Party legislator Gopal Kanda, also had a well-protected and large convoy. He asked why the BJP candidate needed so much security and under what provision a Haryana MLA had received it. Rathi said: “This terrifying election campaign betrays the intent of the ruling party’s candidate.” The complaint carries an attached video of October 14, showing eight buses of rapid action force (RAF) and other paramilitary squads in Govind Kanda’s convoy at Mamera and other villages in the Ellenabad assembly constituency. The INLD called it “a misuse of official machinery to create fear among the voters and defeat the purpose of free and fair elections”. Rathi said all candidates should get equal personal security, and to protect just one candidate was a violation of the model code of conduct. During his campaign, Govid Kanda had run-ins with aggressive farmers several times, so much so that the deputy commissioner had to request the former panches and sarpanches to let him campaign. The farmers have been attacking the meeting venues and convoys of BJP-JJP members to have the agri-marketing laws repealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kandas-security-excessive-violation-of-poll-code-inld/articleshow/87072800.cms||---

As a result of the accident a foreign body was lodged inside his urinary bladder. The operation by six experts was critical since the 19 -year-old also suffered from a congenital anomaly of the intestines. The youngster while playing cricket was trying to take a catch when he landed on a wooden stub that entered the bottom of his rectum, the doctors said. The youngster’s abdomen had torn when he met with the accident. An ultrasound scan revealed a strange object in his urinary bladder, leading the patient to be brought to this hospital for advanced evaluation. The lower part of the foreign body had lodged in the prostatic vascular plexus, and disturbing it could lead to severe bleeding. Surgical access to this area was difficult. With multiple options in mind, the team of doctors proceeded with the surgery. They cut open the urinary bladder and found a piece of wood lying in it. The stick was meticulously removed, avoiding bleeding or injury to surrounding tissues and prostatic plexus. “Postoperatively, the patient has recovered well,” said Dr Sanoop K. Zachariah, senior consultant, general and minimal access surgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/youth-undergoes-rare-surgery/articleshow/87070576.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Day on, Singhu border lynching victim’s cremation sans Sikh rites||CHEEMA KALAN: After the lynching of the Tarn Taran farm labourer near the Singhu border for alleged desecration of the Sikh holy book, religious bodies opposed his cremation as per the Sikh rehat maryada (Sikh code of religious living). Lakhbir Singh, also known as Titu, was cremated at his native village Cheema Kalan in police presence late on Saturday evening, without any ‘’ardas” in the absence of the panchayat by his family members. In absence of lighting at the cremation ground, a few local youths came forward and arranged a light while a few others switched on torches of their mobile phones for the cremation. Lakhbir’s widow Jaspreet Kaur attempted to see his face several times but no one dared to remove the plastic covering the body. Earlier, Tarlochan Singh, president of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee, Kasel, Taran Taran district had made it clear that they would not allow the murder victim’s cremation as per religious rites. “We will not allow the family of Titu to cremate him as per the Sikh rehat maryada. His cremation will take place in the village, but his last rites will not be allowed to be performed in the Sikh tradition,” he said and added the decision was taken following a ‘gurmata’ passed by the committee after holding a meeting in the village. Echoing this view, village sarpanch Manish Kumar said, “We totally agree with the decision taken by the Satkar committee and denounce the alleged desecration by Titu.” He said they would do everything to maintain communal harmony. Justifying the decision of Tarlochan Singh, president of Amritsar-based Sri Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee Balbir Singh Muchhal said, “There’s no way we can allow ardas, path or akhand path for a person allegedly responsible for sacrilege of our living guru.” He said that they could not allow the cremation of a person with the recital of gurbani as he was responsible for showing disrespect to the gurbani. When asked how Lakhbir’s family would conduct his last rites under these circumstances, he said they could either burn his body, throw it in the river or bury it. He added that neither the village panchayat nor responsible village elders would attend the cremation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/day-on-lynching-victims-cremation-sans-sikh-rites/articleshow/87072825.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Deepak Singh Aulakh (20), a former office assistant of the musician, was arrested from Amroha in UP on Wednesday and brought to the city on transit remand. The singer’s driver Avinash Kumar Bharti (24) was arrested from Kolkata on Thursday. According to Khan’s wife Joyeeta Basu, the first call came on October 9. “The WhatsApp call came at 1.29 pm on my daughter’s number that has been issued by her office. At that time, both Khan and my son were not at home. That was the beginning. There after, multiple calls came, where the accused said a sniper was stationed outside our house. The caller threatened to carry out a drone attack. He said since our residence has several glass windows, we can be spotted and attacked. My daughter was so paranoid that she refused to let my son use our music room,” said Joyeeta. Deepak had quit after working for a few days, saying his mother has cancer. But he kept in touch with Avinash, who hailed from Bihar and lived in Netaji Nagar. “That is how Deepak learnt about the Khan family whereabouts. He used several numbers to make the calls to prevent being identified. He initially demanded Rs 50 lakh but eventually brought it down to Rs 20 lakh. He kept threatening Khan that he would murder him,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Joyeeta said the episode has traumatised them. “Like everyone, Durga Puja is very close to our hearts but we could not venture out till Dashami. We are really thankful to police for the prompt action. They arranged for security and nabbed the accused at a time when the city was celebrating Ashtami and Navami,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-held-for-threat-calls-to-ustad-rashid-khan/articleshow/87070531.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: I insisted that Uddhav Thackeray become CM, says Sharad Pawar||Hours after former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis claimed that Uddhav Thackeray covertly nurtured ambitions to become a CM and that Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was the most corrupt government in Maharashtra’s history, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said it was he who insisted Uddhav become chief minister. “I thought, why not the son of a person (Bal Thackeray) who had contributed for Maharashtra should become the CM, and I insisted Uddhav become chief minister,” said Pawar in Pune. Pawar said Fadnavis was making these allegations as he could not become a CM again. He iterated that BJP was suppressing non-BJP states by misusing investigation agencies. Pawar said MVA will complete its 5-year term and will come to power again. Pawar took a jibe at the Centre over spiralling fuel prices and pending GST compensation of Rs 35,000 crore towards the state. “The central government is not concerned about price rise. One can see that around six months back international crude oil prices had gone down, but the Union government did not cut the price of petrol and diesel,” said Pawar. Pawar said that when Manmohan Singh was prime minister, due to a rise in international crude oil rate, they were planning to increase fuel rates, but BJP, which was in Opposition then, opposed the move, but now they are increasing prices of fuel every day. Pawar, attacking Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), said some ‘panch’ (witnesses) used by the agency were criminals. He gave the example in the case of the son-in-law of NCP leader and state minister Nawab Malik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-i-insisted-that-uddhav-become-cm-says-pawar/articleshow/87072812.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Yellow alert issued for 6 Marathwada districts||AURANGABAD: As many as six districts of Marathwada, including Aurangabad, have received the ‘yellow alert’ from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to the IMD, heavy rain, accompanied by thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds, was very likely at isolated places for at least the next 24 hours from Sunday. The yellow alert urges people to watch and stay updated on the weather conditions. Jalna, Beed, Parbhani, Hingoli and Nanded are the other districts in the region which are expected to witness such conditions whereas the remaining two districts — Latur and Osmanabad — are very likely to get light to moderate rainfall. Shriniwas Aundhkar, the director of APJ Abdul Kalam Astro Space and Science Centre, said the depression developed over the Bay of Bengal could produce showers in Marathwada for at least a couple of days. “The rainfall could be of varying intensity with few areas likely to get heavy showers,” he said. The likely rainfall activity in Marathwada will be independent of weather condition in Kerala, which is getting heavy rain due to the low-pressure area over the Arabian sea. While the region has already received over 1081 mm rainfall since June 1, which is 151% of expected showers, the official forecast of fresh showers could further compound the rain-related damage to crops. As per the official data, Nanded (1,194 mm), Jalna (1,177 mm), Parbhani (1,161 mm), Hingoli (1,114 mm), Beed (1,076 mm) and Aurangabad (1,011 mm) districts have already crossed the 1,000mm-mark of rainfall during the current monsoon. Latur (970 mm) and Osmanabad (912 mm) districts have also recorded surplus showers. The rainfall received in Marathwada (1,081 mm) has crossed the quota of 772mm rainfall between June and December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/yellow-alert-issued-for-6-marathwada-districts/articleshow/87068666.cms||---

IO J Surender Reddy on Saturday also stated that only after watching the videos and photos furnished by the Clues Team on December 10, 2019, he realised that despite his instructions, the videographer did not record the entire proceedings related to the alleged encounter on December 6. Responding to the summons issued by the commission to produce all video and photo evidence recorded on December 6, 2019 at Chattanpally, Surender Reddy furnished 25 video clips and 51 photographs before the commission. The video clippings, spanning less than 10 seconds to about a minute, were recorded by Ramachandrudu of Clues Team on December 6, 2019 and Clues Team Hyderabad head N Venkanna gave it to the IO on December 10, 2019. The IO was asked by the commission’s chairman VS Sirpurkar, “Did it not occur to you that topography of the entire area including the point from where police fired at the accused, where panchas stood, and embankments on the spot at the alleged encounter site should have been recorded for proper investigation?” Reddy responded, saying, “Yes it occurred to me. I instructed the Clues Team to record the entire topography of the scene of crime. Later, I found out that it was not recorded.” In response to the subsequent questions, Reddy said that after instructing the Clues Team, he became busy in managing the mob, which was causing disturbance at the scene of crime and when a panel member pointed out that there was no crowd near the cordoned off area, Reddy stated that the mob was present but it was not covered in the video clippings. The IO also stated that his instructions to the Clues Team and the videographer, to properly record the video of the bodies, scene of occurrence, path through which the accused, police and panchas entered the site, were not followed and he realised it only after seeing the videos on December 10, 2019. At the end of Saturday’s depositions, the commission chairman asked Reddy, “Did you not consider it necessary to cover by videography the spot from where Disha’s articles were recovered?” As Reddy responded saying, “the spot is not covered,” the chairman posed a subsequent question, “This question is being asked to you as according to one version the whole incident was sparked at that spot. What do you say?” and asked Reddy to think and give an answer on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/clues-team-did-not-record-topography-of-crime-scene-io/articleshow/87070543.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The CM who termed the situation grievous, however, said the latest weather forecast did indicate a possible improvement in the situation in the coming hours. Vijayan asked district collectors to take urgent steps for evacuating people from places prone to landslides. The meeting attended by chief secretary, police chief, revenue secretary and district collectors reviewed the progress of rescue activities in rainhit areas. Instructions were given to explore all options to rescue and evacuate people trapped due to the rain, especially in the severely-hit Kottayam district. “The situation is grievous. But there are reasons for solace in the latest weather forecast. The forecast indicates that we are not heading to a more serious situation. Situation is only likely to improve in the coming hours,” the chief minister said. It was decided to keep high vigil and prepare ground for setting up of shelter camps wherever necessary. District collectors were asked to increase the number of camps to avoid rush and violation of Covid protocol. According to the decisions taken in the meeting, regular alerts should be issued in coastal areas. The meeting decided to seek the help of national disaster response force (NDRF) wherever it is deemed necessary. The district administrations have been asked to make use of the state disaster response force (SDRF). The administrations should prepare a list of countryboats and motorised boats available for rescue operations. CM asked the officials concerned to keep a strict vigil on the water level of dams and asked the district collectors to ensure that people living on river banks are warned in advance. “People should be given warning in advance and should be given enough time to move away from their home, in case of emergency,” he said. The meeting called for coordinated work by district collectors, KSEB and KWA in dam management. In Palakkad district, where red alert has been sounded, the CM said the fire force should be prepared to ensure enough pump sets to pump off water from low lying areas.

Randhawa said this was a sensitive issue related to the religious beliefs of people and also associated with the farmers who had been peacefully protesting for almost a year against the draconian farm laws of the central government. “At this crucial juncture, it was very important to identify anti-social elements inciting religious sentiments and defaming the farmers agitation as these kind of desperate attempts aimed at sabotaging the most peaceful and well-disciplined agitation were already being made by some disgruntled elements,” said Randhawa. Randhawa, who also heads the state home department, said the Haryana government as well as police could not disassociate themselves from this incident as the responsibility of maintaining law and order lies with the concerned state government. He also questioned the Haryana Police for not making strict security arrangements at places where a large number of people were gathered and religious scriptures were kept.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/singhu-lynching-must-be-probed-by-sitting-judge-says-punjab-deputy-cm/articleshow/87072837.cms||---

Justice Rekha Palli directed that the chief wildlife warden, wildlife warden and deputy conservator of forests (south division) pass an order on the representation made by Verhaen Khanna within six weeks. In his petition seeking action on the representation, Khanna stated that the fence was placed in such a manner that it was preventing wildlife inside Sanjay Van from approaching a lake and thus, hampering their movement. The Delhi government’s counsel said that there was no objection to deciding the petitioner’s representation expeditiously. “In light of the stand taken by the learned counsel for the respondents, the writ petition is disposed of by directing the respondents to decide the petitioner’s representation dated 25.06.2019 by passing a reasoned and speaking order within a period of six weeks from today,” the judge said in her order dated October 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sanjay-van-govt-to-reply-on-barbed-wires/articleshow/87074289.cms||---

She accused the BJP’s central government of putting the country into difficult circumstances and claimed that people had made up their mind that its ouster will start from Mandi. During election meetings at Dutt Nagar, Nirath, and Taklech in the Rampur assembly constituency, she accused the BJP of doing regional politics and confusing the public, while not talking to the farmers who were out on road for a year against the agri-marketing laws. About the state government’s policies, she said these had hurt the apple producers and provided people with no relief during the Covid-19 pandemic. She said the government had no control over price rise and unemployment, while the scheme for cheap rations had died out. To strike a chord with the voters, she said she had always visited Mandi with her late husband, former CM Virbhadra Singh, and today not only her but also the entire state felt his absence. She claimed that in her earlier term as MP from Mandi, she had made it one of most developed constituencies with the help of Virbhadra Singh and her victory would be a tribute to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/mandi-bypoll-referendum-against-price-rise-pratibha/articleshow/87072833.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Farmers’ groups unhappy with state govt’s rain relief||Aurangabad: As the state government announced a relief aid worth Rs 10,000 crore for the rain-hit parts of Maharashtra, farmers’ groups in Marathwada have termed the measure inadequate while highlighting the widespread damage in the region alone. Rajan Kshirsagar, of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha, on Saturday said, “The flood-hit areas of western Maharashtra had received more help in recent past when compared to what is expected for Marathwada now. While farmers were expecting compensation worth Rs 40,000 per hectare and waiver in power bills among other measures, the government has announced insufficient help,” he said. People, who are engaged in contractual farming were omitted from the aid. “An official consideration was expected for such contractual farmers but they have been neglected. In a way, around 50% of the rural population, who were hit by the rain fury, have been left in the lurch,” he said. Claiming that Marathwada has witnessed over 500 incidents of cloudbursts, Jayaji Suryawanshi of ‘Annadata’ farmers said those farmers, whose agricultural land was eroded due to such natural calamity, have failed to get official attention. “The entire panchanama process in Marathwada was defective and could not give an actual projection of the damage. While 44,000 villages from the region have been affected due to the rain, the sum of Rs 10,000 crore to be disbursed across Maharashtra is inadequate,” he said. Farmers’ groups have announced protests to demand more help. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said the district has received more help from the state government when compared to NDRF norms. “Aurangabad district is entitled to get Rs 555.39 crore from the total relief aid, which is Rs 170.46 crore more than relief aid expected as per NDRF norm. ,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/farmers-groups-unhappy-with-state-govts-rain-relief/articleshow/87068693.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The ecotourism project has natural features preserved by the forest department and the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA). The park falls under the Vidhyadhar Nagar region, which is nearly 15km away from the city. Dhariwal said, "The park is one of its kind in the country, where sand dunes and desert species are grown and preserved. It will be soon in the bucket lists of tourists visiting to Jaipur." For the upkeep of indigenous plants in the biodiversity park, the JDA plans to spend Rs 2.65 crore. Once thrown open, residents can relish the desert tranquillity in the periphery of Pink City without travelling distances. Kishan Bagh, the city’s first desert park project, was initiated in August 2016. A forest official said, "The park has dhok habitat, granite habitat, nursery, rock and fossil exhibits to name few." The area was developed without disturbing the topography. The park will represent a unique desert ecosystem. "We have developed natural vegetation resembling that of the Thar desert. Seeds and sand were brought from Jaisalmer to develop flora in the park. A total of 18 native species of trees have been planted," the official added. Trees from Barmer, Sirohi, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Chittorgarh and Banswara are also being planted at the park. An official said, "There are many natural treks in the vicinity of the park and residents can cherish nature in safe environment with their families," said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajs-1st-desert-park-to-open-for-visitors-before-diwali/articleshow/87072871.cms||---

While the Navratra and Dasara festivals were celebrated on an enthusiastic note, most of the people on the streets and marketplaces were seen without a mask or even if they were wearing masks, it not covering their nose or mouth. Many people said at least seven of the 10 people in public places were not wearing mask. Also, amid the rush of people in the city markets, social distancing had gone for a toss. Atul Patil, a resident of the Cidco area, said people are not worried about contracting the infection as cases have reduced significantly in Nashik district. As a result, neither the people nor the government machinery is serious about ensuring strict implementation of the use of masks or maintaining social distancing. He said since the peak time of Covid second wave during April and May, cases have reduced significantly all over the city and the district now. The cases have been consistently declining for more than three to four months now, which has made a section of people a bit negligent towards the use of masks. Bhasusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), admitted that a section of people is not seen wearing masks. He said people should not be negligent towards observing Covid-appropriate behaviour. “They are under the impression that Covid is now almost gone. The same thing had happened before the second wave,” said Nagargoje. As the rate of vaccination is continuously increasing and cases are reducing, there is a feeling among people that they will not contract the infection. However, fully vaccinated people can also contract Covid though they may not be seriously ill, said the official. He added that while the NMC is still takes action against people found not wearing masks, this action would definitely be stepped up if cases begin to increase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/many-people-seen-without-masks-in-nashik-city/articleshow/87068736.cms||Santosh Sonawane

According to figures released by the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) on Saturday, the export of gems and jewellery grew to Rs 1.41 lakh crore in the first half of 2021-22 compared to Rs 1.27 lakh crore for the first half of 2019-20. Studded gold jewellery exports shot up by 60% to Rs 17,761 crore during the same period. “With US$ 18,984.49 million exports during April-September, the sector has already achieved nearly half (46%) of the US$ 41.66 billion gems and jewellery exports target set by the government. The sentiment in the industry is incredibly positive with markets opening up and demand gradually returning to normal,” said GJEPC chairman, Colin Shah. He added that GJEPC successfully concluded the International Gem & Jewellery Show (IGJS) in Dubai recently where they received good feedback from the exhibitors and buyers. “Moreover, with the festive season coming up, we are optimistic to achieve the export target by the end of the financial year,” said Shah. GJEPC claimed that the gems and jewellery sector was getting support from the union government and how commerce minister Piyush Goyal was closely working for the industry’s growth. On September 17, Goyal visited the Surat Diamond Bourse and later attended the 37th edition of India International Jewellery Show held in Bengaluru. Less than a week later, on September 23 Goyal visited SEEPZ in Mumbai, where he met with officials from GJEPC and SEEPZ along with jewellery exporters. Goyal had also announced a Rs 200 crore grant for upgrading the SEEPZ infrastructure and an additional Rs 70 crore for developing an on-site Common Facility Centre (CFC). The space transfer policy announced earlier this month by the ministry of commerce and industry is expected to facilitate SEZs that account for 30% share in the country’s total gem and jewellery exports, according to GJEPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gems-jewellery-exports-up-11-in-h1/articleshow/87070650.cms||---

Some injuries have led to cell degradation which in turn may cause septicaemia.” Niraj, who visited the rescue centre, said the tiger seemed to be fine when that reached Mysore zoo. “The tiger had recovered from the sedation and was roaring loudly and charging from the cage. I had a detailed discussion with the veterinarians and rescue officials at the zoo.” After stabilizing the tiger on Saturday morning, the veterinarians conducted tests to identify the health issues of MDT-23. The tiger was in a dehydrated condition and the level of hemoglobin seemed to be falling down gradually. Niraj said the canines of the tiger had to be restored as the erosion had resulted in its ability to eat properly, especially harder objects such as bones. “Its front legs have swelled because of colitis and it has to be treated. After stabilizing the tiger further by feeding it, the veterinarians will start treatments on Sunday.” The rescue centre is a modern facility equipped with operation theatre and diagnostic instruments. The tiger was put in a cell that comes with an open space filled with trees, the official said. “The open space will allow the animal to move around freely.” The tiger had killed three people and 10 head of cattle in the past two months in the Nilgiris.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tiger-reaches-mysore-zoo-treatment-may-begin-today/articleshow/87072840.cms||---

What were they doing when the episode of murder was going on for hours?” asked Tikait, who was attending Kisan Mahapanchayat here on Saturday. Responding to a query on who should take responsibility for the killing, Tikait said it was the responsibility of the Centre to see what was happening. He alleged that the central government had invested heavily in breaking the peaceful agitation by farmers on the Delhi borders. On the inconvenience being caused due to the blockade of roads at the protest site, Tikait said they had not blocked any road, but it was the police department that had constructed walls and laid barricades. “We have not come with barricades; it is the police that have blocked the roads. The farmers would happily shift their agitation to India Gate, like our predecessors in 1988,” he added. Gurnam Singh Charuni, the BKU (Charuni) leader, said it was not a coincidence that Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar had invoked his party members to pick up sticks against farmers, and then the Lakhimpur incident also took place. “CM Khattar is exhorting his party members to pick up sticks but we would continue to do our agitation peacefully”, he added. Commenting on the murder of the Dalit man at the Singhu border, Charuni said that he had not been to the protest site after the murder and would respond only after visiting the spot after finding out the ground reality. Independent MLA Sombir Sangwan and Balraj Kundu also attended the mahapanchayat along with farmer leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-responsible-for-singhu-murder-tikait/articleshow/87072947.cms||Sat Singh

Each morning, only one-third of over 2,000 cadets have breakfast together at the mess here. The rest of the cadets patiently wait for their turn. This is part of the NDA’s strategy to prevent crowding among cadets and adhere to social distancing norms on the campus. The process is repeated for lunch and dinner. “We divided cadets into one-third batches. At any given time only one-third of cadets conduct their respective activities. Only one-third of cadets go for dining in the mess. They finish their meal and step out. In the next 15 minutes, the staffers sanitise chairs and tables. Then the next batch is allowed,” Lt Gen Asit Mistry, Commandant, NDA, told TOI. “Our top priority is safety of 2,000 plus cadets. They live in a commune kind of environment. Like a big large family. If there are cases among cadets, then the lateral spread among them would be like a wildfire. Thus, we had to develop a mechanism for each activity to continue the training and finish it within the stipulated time,” Mistry added. The General officer said that during the first wave of the pandemic last year, and all activities had to be stopped completely for a few weeks. “We did not have any standard operating procedure to follow then. Gradually, as time passed, we learned and came up with a formula to deal with the situation. We implemented it successfully. Hence, we could send cadets to the respective training academies for further training,” said Mistry. “The IT infrastructure of the academy, and provisioning of Thin Clients (a virtual desktop computing model) 24x7 in every cabin were put to maximum utilisation for online training,” said deputy commandant Rear Admiral Sanjay Vatsayan. Afternoon and evening time, which were earlier left free for squadron activities, were now quantified and periods were allotted for academics as well as service classes for completion of syllabus, officials said. “When restrictions eased, a hybrid model of training was adopted with part contact and part online classes. To ensure social distancing, each class of approximately 30 cadets was split into two, with one part attending contact classes (one cadet on a bench), the other studying the same topic online,” officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nda-redesigns-training-activities-for-safety-of-cadets-on-campus/articleshow/87070619.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Goa||Oppn trains guns on govt, CM after Ponda murder||Panaji: The quick succession of ghastly murders in Goa prompted the opposition to once again flay the government for the rise in serious crime in the state. Congress, Goa Forward Party (GFP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said that the murders prove that anti-social elements no longer fear the long arm of the law. Two senior citizen sisters were found murdered on Saturday at their residence at Ponda by an unknown person and the police are hunting the accused. “The double murder at Ponda is a testimony that BJP has converted Goa into a crime destination, beyond expectation,” said state Congress president Girish Chodankar. The double-murder at Ponda came just a day after a pay-parking attendant was bashed to death at Anjuna by five tourists from Karnataka over a tiff over the parking fee. Chodankar said that the murder of the pay parking attendant, which coincided with Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit is yet another indicator of BJP’s misrule in Goa. “Goa is numb. Three murders in two days after BJP MP and union home minister Amit Shah met chief minister Pramod Sawant,” said Sardesai. “The double engine can offer only double the crime and double the criminals. In 2022, Goenkars will send this incompetent Goa chief minister to the place he belongs, his own home.” Referring the murder case of parking attendant in Anjuna, Congress’ youth wing president Varad Mardolkar said that tourists are coming and blatantly killing Goans. “This is happening because there is no fear of law in Goa. This is yet another example of the deteriorating law and order in the state,” he said. AAP’s state convenor Rahul Mhambre blamed Sawant’s leadership for the rise in crime. Sawant holds the home department in the state. “Crime is at its peak in Goa. From kidnapping to dacoity to murder to gang shootouts, the Bollywood movie scenes have descended on streets of Goa. Thanks to the accidental chief minister,” said Mhambre. “It is evident that the government has failed to promptly investigate crimes and bring to justice the culprits. This very act of the police is encouraging criminals,” Mardolkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-trains-guns-on-govt-cm-after-ponda-murder/articleshow/87072924.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

More than 150 workers with the highways department had toiled round-the-clock all these days, braving continuous downpour, to restore the stretches that were affected by landslides with sand bags and supporting poles.They said small vehicles could now ply on the stretch. Heavy vehicles are, meanwhile, diverted via Kuppanur route from Salem.District collector S Karmegam, who had visited the stretch on Friday evening along with revenue and highway department officials, said landslides had occurred at several places on the Salem-Yercaud ghat section. “The one that occurred between hairpin bends two and three had damaged the road very badly. Trees that were uprooted in the heavy rain and wind had fallen on electric lines, disrupting power supply. Electricity department staff were, however, quick to restore the power supply after clearing the trees.”The collector has appealed the motorists to limit the speed of vehicles to 30kmph while crossing the areas hit by landslides.

Police said that the girl had confided in two of her female teachers posted in the same school. She shared her ordeal with them, and also showed a series of lewd messages sent by the principal. “The two teachers compelled the girl to delete messages from her phone to shield the principal. This is tantamount to the destruction of evidence and we arrested them today (Saturday),” said an official, adding that both the teachers were aware of the horrendous acts of the principal but tried to cover up the matter. On Saturday, Jhunjhunu collectors and the superintendent of police (SP) both visited the school and also met the girl. “The two teachers had learned about the matter on October 9 itself. We had already arrested the principal on Friday morning and subsequently arrested the female teachers too,” said district SP, Manish Tripathi. Sources said they are also investigating the allegations that the teachers had intimidated the girl. “The preliminary investigations indicate that the principal had been harassing the girl and sending her messages. She had alerted two of her teachers but they did not act,” an official said. Meanwhile, the principal was arrested on Friday after an FIR was filed against him at a local police station. Police claimed that the accused raped his student on October 5 and threatened her not to speak about the matter. The district head of CWC (Child Welfare Committee), Archana Choudhary, said that as soon as the CWC learned about the case, they sent a team to provide counselling to the girl and alerted senior police officials of Jhunjhunu. Assistant director, child rights, Priya Choudhary said that the girl and her family were scared to go to the police station. “The girl saw the child helpline number 1098 on her textbook and informed about the incident. Prompt action was taken and two women councillors visited her,” she said.

---||Pune||Pune: SCERT makes books for out-of-school children||PUNE: State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT) has come up with books for all classes which give guidelines to teachers on what all needs to be taught to children who have been out of school, and also for children to understand concepts taught in previous classes better. Due to the pandemic, many children in the age group of 6-14 had dropped out of school. This had led to the education department conducting various surveys at state, district and local level to bring back children to school. However, enrolling these children in age-appropriate classes would not be enough as they also need to be taught the learning objectives of the previous classes. Kamaladevi Awate, deputy director, equity and language department of the SCERT, said, “We have made books for students enrolled in classes till VIII to make them understand the language and arithmancy. Hence, we have books in Marathi, Hindi, English and Mathematics and also books in Urdu medium. This year, we have over 12,000 students registered as out of school who will benefit from these books. We have asked the teachers to use these book to help physically challenged students and those who could not attend online classes.” The SCERT will conduct online training for teachers on October 21 and 22. A book has been published by the SCERT to make teachers aware of the various laws regarding children and their safety. “It mentions the rights of a child and the responsibility of teachers ,” said Awate. Apart from this, about 2,800 balrakshaks working in the state will also get identity cards. “Balrakshaks are teachers and volunteers who bring children back to school. Due to Covid-19, the distribution of I-cards was delayed but now, we have started distributing them,” said Awate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/scert-makes-books-for-out-of-school-children/articleshow/87070673.cms||Ardhra Nair

The Ganga Canal, which largely supplies water for drinking and irrigation purposes to several districts of western Uttar Pradesh, including Ghaziabad, was shut for maintenance on Friday. DJB roughly supplies around 900-950 MGD (Million Gallons per Day) water in the national capital. According to DJB officials, apart from groundwater, Delhi depends largely on Yamuna river and partially on Ganga river for water supply. It also gets water from western Yamuna canal, they said. A senior DJB official said there is no need to panic as only a small percentage of water comes to Delhi from Ganga Canal, which can be balanced thorough supply from Yamuna river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/water-supply-wont-be-affected-djb/articleshow/87074294.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Ban on business activity at Nahargarh Fort: Rajasthan government to move SC against NGT order||JAIPUR: As the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directs that all restaurants operating in the notified forest area of Nahargarh Wildlife Sanctuary/Nahargarh Fort be discontinued with effect from December 01, 2021, the archaeology department plans to approach the Supreme Court against the orders. The tribunal also directed to discontinue light-andsound programme in the area of wildlife sanctuary. However, the idea has not gone well with both tourism and archaeology departments. A senior official, who confirmed about the development said, restaurants such as ‘Padao’ and ‘Once Upon A time’ are run under government regulations and RTPP Act, and the facilities contribute towards adding value to the pleasurable experience for guests and are being operated without impacting wildlife health. The said restaurants are operating since 1982. Moreover, the light-andsound show held at Kesar Kyari is a peculiar attraction of the Amer Fort. The show highlights the local legends, folklore and celebrates the maestros of folk music. The timing of the show is 45 minutes and the sound pressure level is below 98 decibels, tantamount to the sound pressure of motorcycle. For the show, speakers are placed away from the forest to protect the wildlife which diminishes the possibility of noise pollution. Further, no tree is cut, uprooted or relocated for the show. A source said, “Facilities and services offered by the archaeology and museums department are required for eco tourism. It is not only creating employment for thousands, but has also brought Jaipur on the world map.” Rajendra Tiwari, an environmentalist who filed public interest litigation (PIL) had further alleged that the illegal commercial activities that are carried out at the reserved forest and fort are in violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The forest department has communicated various notices to restrict unlawful activities in reserved forest areas but all efforts are to no avail. The commercial activities are a grave concern for wildlife and shall be stopped, for the protection of wildlife. “I will also file a caveat in the Supreme Court as the department plans to approach there in support of commercial activities,” said Tiwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ban-on-biz-activity-at-nahargarh-raj-to-move-sc-against-ngt-order/articleshow/87072879.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi HC caps vendor count, but many more at Sarojini Nagar Market||NEW DELHI: Despite Delhi high court directing the New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Police not to allow more than 80 vendors at Sarojini Nagar Market on October 8, when TOI visited the popular commercial centre on Saturday, there was a horde of street hawkers in addition to the authorised vendors. Near Gate No 1, vendors occupied not only both sides of the road but also the middle. The rest of the space was taken up by shoppers, and nowhere was compliance to the social distancing norm in evidence. It was the same at the other gates too. The functioning of the metal detectors could be said to be suspect. While the court has now asked NDMC to respond to a show-cause notice in 10 days, it has also directed the civic agencies to comply with its previous order. The court will next hear the matter on November 9. “As soon as the order was issued, we approached the agencies concerned and apprised them of the 1,500 vendors and hawkers in the market, a majority of them illegal operators,” said Ashok Randhawa, president, Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Association. “Their presence not only affects the sales of the shops, but also increases the risk of spreading Covid.” Randhawa carried on, “On Saturday, NDMC carried out an awareness drive on plastics and we are eager to cooperate in this, but what about our demand on removing the illegal hawkers? With entry points to the market choked due to festival-season shopping, we requested NDMC and sub-divisional magistrate, Vasant Vihar, to take necessary steps to decongest the market.” While the high court has allowed 60-80 vendors at the market, an NDMC official claimed there were 434 authorised vendors currently. “Of them, 100 were authorised by the Thareja Committee, 30 were given authorisation in 1989 and 304 got relief under the court’s order of 2016,” the official said. “Even if the last order may not be effective anymore, we can’t remove the vendors unless their count and locations are identified according to the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014.” The official said despite this, the municipal council was “still taking repeated action against squatters and body hawkers” who had no documents. “There is zero tolerance of hawking beyond 4x6 feet spaces,” the officer said. “Regarding seizure of the vendors’ wares, we have approached police and they have asked for 2-3 days to identify storage space for the seized items.” Gaurav Sharma, DCP (South-West), added, “The authorised vendors also rent their allotted space to illegal hawkers, and this causes a lot of chaos. We regularly act against them under provisions of the Indian Penal Code. We are also planning a drive against encroachments.” Some NDMC officials also alleged that permanent shopkeepers too were using or renting space outside their shops. To this, Kuldeep Singh Sawhney, president, Sarojini Market Shopkeeper Association, said they welcomed action “against all encroachments”. Sawhney said, “We are ready to cooperate provided NDMC acts against illegal encroachers of all sorts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-caps-vendor-count-but-many-more-at-sarojini-mkt/articleshow/87072917.cms||Vibha Sharma

A 17-year-old boy had updated his status saying that he was ending his life along with his girlfriend. This update was noticed by his friends, who rushed to the couple’s rescue and managed to save them. Nonetheless, both the teenagers have been booked under section 309 of the IPC for attempting suicide. They are currently admitted to a hospital in Malegaon and their condition is said to be stable and out of danger. The couple had consumed pesticide in a hotel room in Deola on Thursday afternoon. The boy had then written “Gelo” (meaning I am no more) as his WhatsApp status. PI Devidas Bhoj of the Deola police station said some of the boy’s friends saw the WhatsApp status. They apparently knew where the boy and the girl could be, or perhaps someone spotted the couple around the hotel. Within a few minutes, the friends rushed to the hotel. The teenagers were unconscious when their friends entered the room. They were initially taken to a hospital in Deola and then to another hospital in Malegaon. PI Bhoj said both the teenagers were apparently worried that their relationship had no future as they were from different castes. As a result, they decided to end their lives. Meanwhile, the police have booked the under section 309 of the IPC for attempting to commit suicide. The operator of the hotel has also been booked under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC for giving a room to the teenagers without checking their identity cards, age, etc or making the entry of their names in the hotel register. The police are investigating the case further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/social-media-status-update-saves-lives-of-teens-who-had-attempted-suicide/articleshow/87068793.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Repair in limbo, respite from bad roads not likely this festive season||JAIPUR: This festive season, residents of the city will have to put up with the dug-up roads in markets and colonies, because the municipal corporation is yet to start repairing them. Since April, Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) has dug up the roads in Tilak Nagar to change the small size of water pipelines as per the current population requirement. Similarly, under Jal Jeevan Mission, many areas of Walled City were dug up for getting tap connections to all the households. This work has impacted the daily lives of people who are not able to commute properly.  A road dug up from the middle at Chandpol Market In Bapu Market, Johri market and Sanjay Circle areas, roads are completely broken due the ongoing work of Jal Jeevan Mission. Traders and residents of the area are facing problems, for which they have even met the authorities. Ram Chandra Mangani, a shopkeeper at Bapu market said, “We have complained to the corporation and our traders’ association. During festive season, when the public comes to the market for shopping, the pathetic roads make it difficult to park. Already the market is down due to the pandemic.” TimesViewThe roads in several parts of the area were dug up six months ago to lay water pipelines and since the conditions of the roads have only deteriorated further. While everybody is talking about it, no serious attempt has been made to repair the roads. The Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) in August had claimed that work of repairing and recarpeting will begin on September 15 but later postponed it due to an extended monsoon. One month later and right during the festive season, JMC is caught napping as it has not even managed to find a contractor to do the work. Though no party showed an interest the first time the corporation had invited tenders, officials are making no attempts to invite tenders again and hasten the work ahead of Diwali. Officials must wake up from their slumber and act fast to ensure that the roads are repaired immediately.Additional chief engineer at JMC-Heritage SK Verma said, “We will soon be inviting tenders for the construction of the pipeline. The file is under process and the moment contract is given, road repairing work will begin.” In Tilak Nagar, PHED has laid down pipelines in the middle of the road as on roads’ sides, electricity and other utility lines were already functioning. This has now made it difficult to drive on roads with the middle portion dug up. Although money for road repair has been already deposited in the municipal corporation. The heritage city is yet to float tenders but JMC-Greater has already given the contract and claims that the work will begin from Saturday onwards or next week as per the officials. The entire project is of around Rs 30 lakh. Shankar Kumar, an auto driver at Tilak Nagar said, “The roads are pathetic. In monsoon season, there was waterlogging everywhere, making it accident-prone. It has become a headache to drive on these roads.” Roads are also dug up in Shyam Nagar, Sodala and Khatipura area, where the rising population demands the change of pipelines as per modern requirement. These areas come under the JDA, where PHED has deposited the money but the pipeline work is incomplete, so the people will have to put up with the uneven roads till after Diwali. It remains to be seen if the roads can be repaired before Diwali or the people of the city have to travel on uneven roads for the entire festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/repair-in-limbo-respite-from-bad-roads-not-likely-this-festive-season/articleshow/87072922.cms||---

The students — Soham Joshi (AIR 46), Naman Agrawal (AIR 81), Shlok Pande (AIR 94) and Santosh Deshineni (AIR 99) — were among the probable to four ranks in Pune. “With 25 students in the top 1,000 AIR from Bakliwal Tutorials alone, this is the best ever result for Pune city ever. We are so proud of our students, who stayed motivated and attended all lectures till the last day, despite everything being online and exams getting delayed,” Vaibhav Bakliwal, the director of Bakliwal Tutorials, said. Around 13 students from Bakliwal Tutorials secured AIR within 500 and 25 students secured AIR within 1,000. Over 61 Prime Academy students cleared JEE Advanced 2021, said Lalit Kumar, the academy’s director. Aditya Bangar was the top performer from Prime Academy with AIR 1,005. Durgesh Mangeshkar, the director of IITians Prashikshan Kendra, said over 100 students from their academy qualified the exam and the best performer was Advait Rege with AIR 357. “The JEE Advanced 2021 was perhaps the toughest since 2006, in terms of pattern and difficulty level. Despite this, the cut-off marks corresponding to benchmark ranks in the higher range (like 1,000, 2,000, etc) have increased by 2-5% as compared to JEE Advanced 2020. However, the merit list cut-off remained the same at 17.5%,” Mangeshkar said. Mangeshkar said sincere and bright students had managed to adapt to online coaching very well and the extra five-month period might have helped improve the overall performance of students this year, despite a tough paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-students-from-pune-score-high-among-top-100-in-jee-advanced/articleshow/87070703.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Work from home: Back problems hit young people||AHMEDABAD: Covid affected lungs and the bloodstream, and the subsequent lockdown gave rise to the work from home (WFH) culture that caused several other problems, said city-based spine surgeons. October 16 is observed as the World Spine Day to create awareness about spinal problems and the treatments available. Dr Bharat Dave, chief spine surgeon at Stavya Spine Hospital, said that a large number of patients who came with backache and other spine-related issues were from the younger age group. “A patient we saw recently worked with odd postures for a long time and reached a stage where he required corrective surgery,” he said. Dr Dave added that spine surgeons began to be trained on real spine models from Saturday. “About 40% of the patients with infection had prior history of Covid-19,” he said. Covid-19 also caused increased instances of typhoid and TB infections, said Dr Niraj Vasavada, the head of spine surgery at Shalby Hospital. “Lower immunity due to Covid infection led to other infections among the patients,” he said. “We, however, also attribute the rise in neck, back and spinal issues to factors such as stress and improper posture. Many had to work for longer periods in unfamiliar environments.” Dr J P Modi, former medical superintendent of Civil Hospital and senior spine surgeon, said that doctors saw many patients in their twenties and thirties with spinal issues which are typical in senior citizens. “Some even needed surgery. The primary issue faced by the professionals was severe backache and change in the spinal shape,” he said. “It was to do with the work-life balance going completely haywire, muscle fatigue, stiffness due to sitting in the same position for long, and increase in weight.” Experts said that spinal issues, primarily lower back problems, increased manifold in 2020 due to several factors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wfh-back-problems-hit-young-people/articleshow/87070833.cms||Parth Shastri

Whenever the upper canal is closed, which is an annual affair, pilgrims move to Rishikesh to perform rituals and take a dip in the Ganga. Meanwhile, a long queue of vehicles could be seen on Rishikesh-Dehradun highway as tourists from Delhi and NCR made a beeline for Rishikesh on Saturday, giving traffic police a tough time. SDO, upper Ganga canal, Shiv Kumar Kaushik told TOI, "During these 20 days, the canal will be de-silted and other repair works will be carried out. As far as Har ki Pauri is concerned, we will release sufficient water from Bhimgoda barrage.” Tirth Purohit Ujjwal Pandit told TOI, “As per the 1916 pact, adequate water should be supplied to Har ki Pauri around this but Uttar Pradesh irrigation department often violates the agreement.

---||Delhi||Sextortion: Rajasthan man poses as cops, dupes many||NEW DELHI: A 24-year-old man was arrested from Bharatpur in Rajasthan for allegedly extorting people using photographs of senior police officers. Investigators claimed that he was recently using a photograph of Delhi Police commissioner as his profile pic to commit crimes. The accused was identified as Hakmuddin, a native of Bharatpur. DCP (cyber) KPS Malhotra said they received a complaint from a man saying he received a friend request from a woman on Facebook, who later sought his phone number. “After sometime, he got a video call on WhatsApp from an unknown number with pornographic content and later, he received a morphed and objectionable video,” the DCP said. The caller used the display picture of commissioner Rakesh Asthana and demanded money for not uploading the lewd video morphed with the complainant’s face on the internet. The complainant paid up Rs 1.96 lakh out of fear. A case was registered, and a team under ACP Raman Lamba was formed for investigation. “Technical probe found that the phone numbers used to call the complainant were from Assam and were being used in Bharatpur,” the officer said. The money trail led the cops to Hakmuddin, and he was arrested. Three others involved in the racket are on the run. “The arrested man was also found to be involved in another cheating case registered with Special Cell. He used the same modus operandi in that case and nine other complainants were found linked to the case,” police said. The cops said that gangs operating from Bharatpur send Facebook friend requests from women’s profiles to random people and ask them for their number. “After some time, they would lure the person into engaging in phone sex or sexual acts on video call. The gang members then recorded those acts and used the videos to extort the targets,” a police officer said. “It is advised to the people that do not accept friend requests of any unknown people on social media,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sextortion-man-poses-as-cops-dupes-many/articleshow/87073018.cms||---

The sluice valve of Peringalkuthu was opened as a precaution, after Tamil Nadu officials raised the discharge to 2,500cusecs from Parambikulam, according to district collector Haritha V Kumar. This has intensified anxieties of people living along Chalakudy river banks. However, the discharge from Parambikulam was reduced to 1,500cusecs by evening. The shutters of the Peechi and Vazhani dams have been raised further, following rising water levels in the reservoirs. However, the water level in Chimmony dam was below the danger mark. The water level in Bharathapuzha river had risen after Aliyar dam shutters were opened. People staying on the banks have been asked to remain alert and the situation is being monitored continuously, said the collector. The district authorities have kept systems on standby to evacuate people, in case of any emergency situation.

SHO Virendra Kureel said that six bicycles were recovered from the accused Rahul Swami alias Kabbu. Police claimed that branded bicycles, which cost up to Rs 20,000, were a special target of Swami. As per Kureel, the accused sold stolen items to pay for his drug addiction. Vidhaydhar Nagar police had received numerous complaints about bicycles missing from parks and residential colonies. A team of five cops was constituted to earmark locations where incidents were reported. The team then examined several CCTVs to zero in on suspects. One youth emerged as a possible suspect because he was seen loitering around and stealing bicycles after breaking chain locks.The team then searched around several areas around Vidhyadhar Nagar and nabbed Swami. Police said that bicycles thefts have gone down in the city in the last several years. However, with the increase in bicycle sales after the second spell of the pandemic, these gangs have returned to steal bikes that are sold for Rs 2,000 in grey markets.“A lot of people have begun relying on bicycles as part of their workout regimes. Some affluent neighbourhoods have expensive bikes that cost up to Rs 30,000. These bikes have drawn the interest of petty thieves,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-held-for-stealing-expensive-bicycles/articleshow/87072994.cms||---

These include the MoEFCC, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh administration. A decision to the effect was taken in a recent meeting. Sources said that UT adviser Dharam Pal raised the matter with authorities concerned during his previous visit to Delhi. Now, the UT administration has decided to press for a joint meeting to solve this longstanding issue. Sources said that the meeting could be held in the physical or virtual mode, which would be decided upon by the Union ministry. Recently, the UT administration urged the ministry to take up the matter with Punjab and Haryana. In 2017, the UT administration had notified to mark an area of two to 2.75 kilometres radius from the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary as the eco-sensitive zone. Chief conservator of forests, UT Debendra Dalai, in a recent letter to ministry, stated, “It was requested to expedite the notification for ESZ around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary for the area falling in the states of Punjab and Haryana, which is yet to be notified.” UT pointed out that since 90% sanctuary area falls in Punjab and Haryana, it is important to notify the ESZ for the area in Punjab and Haryana immediately to protect the sanctuary. In response to the UT’s letter, the ministry said that it was pursuing the matter with Punjab and Haryana. Recently, UT adviser Dharam Pal directed the UT forest and wildlife department officials to take up the issue of early declaration of eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary by Punjab and Haryana afresh with the Union government. Last year, during a meeting convened by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), wildlife division, to discuss issues related to forest and wildlife management being undertaken in states and union territories, the UT administration submitted its demand to declare the ESZ around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary at the earliest. The ministry has issued a final notification on the ESZ around the sanctuary only for Chandigarh, while Punjab and Haryana have not declared such zones in their respective territories so far. The UT wants both states to follow its lead of declaring the area from 2km to 2.75km from the sanctuary boundary as ESZ. In the past, the Chandigarh administration urged the two states to regulate human activities in the catchment area as the Supreme Court upheld that large-scale construction could not be allowed close to the sanctuary. In December 2019, UT urged the ministry to expedite the process of ESZ. Recently, Haryana planned to mark areas ranging from 1km to 1.5 km as ESZ and comments were sought from the departments concerned. Besides, the UT administration has opposed Punjab government’s proposal to declare only a 100m ESZ on its side. On January 25, 2017, the Union ministry issued the ESZ notification for Chandigarh. On September 17, 2015, the ministry had issued a draft notification for the sanctuary area under the UT and not for the section under Punjab and Haryana. Thereafter, the UT submitted its objections, urging the ministry to issue a notification for the entire ESZ to protect the sanctuary. Turning down its demand, the ministry declared ESZ only for Chandigarh. Integrated plan for wetland The Chandigarh Wetland Authority recently gave the go-ahead for Worldwide Fund For Nature (WWF) preparing an integrated management plan for Sukhna wetland. The UT forest and wildlife department signed an agreement with WWF on March 25, 2021 for preparation of such a management plan within the stipulated time period, i.e. upto March 2022. The department has already sent basic information required by the WWF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-wants-eco-sensitive-zone-around-sukhna-notified-in-pb-hry/articleshow/87070746.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Jaipur||Even with five more judges joining, Rajasthan high court is short of half of its strength||JAIPUR: Five newly appointed judges of the high court are to take oath of office on Monday. Farjand Ali, Sudesh Bansal, Anoop Kumar Dhand, Vinod Kumar Bharwani and Madan Gopal Vyas will be administered oath of office by chief Justice Akil Kureshi on Monday. Even after they assume office, there is a shortfall of over 50% as against the sanctioned strength of 50 judges in the high court. Currently, the working strength of judges is only 21, the lowest. But one of them, Justice SP Sharma is under transfer to the Patna High Court while another judge Govardhan Bardar is to retire next month. So, there will be a vacancy of 26 judges even after the appointment of these five judges and it is a long way to fill up the total strength of judges in the high court. According to the Supreme Court annual report 2019-20, as on June 30, 2020, there are 88,478 cases more than 10 years old pending in the high court. The total pendency of cases in the high court is 4,88,805 which includes 3,63,508 civil and 1,25,297 criminal petitions. President of the high court bar association, Jaipur, Bhuvnesh Sharma said, “The appointment of five new judges is like a drop in the ocean. These new judges will sit only in the division bench for at least six months to get experienced. So this new appointment will not reduce the huge pendency of cases in the high court in the near future.” He said the Supreme Court collegium had to take urgent steps to fill up the remaining vacancies and also make sure that such a huge backlog of vacancies should not be allowed to be accumulated. Appointment of judges should be a continuous, constant process as retirement of judges. The situation in the subordinate courts is not different. The total strength of judicial officers in the subordinate courts is 1,430 of which 318 are vacant while the total pendency of cases is 18,23,034 in which civil cases are 4,47,426 and criminal 13,75,608. The high court has to urgently take steps to fill up the vacancies in the subordinate courts as well and constantly upgrade infrastructure to reduce pendency and provide justice to the aggrieved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/even-with-five-more-judges-joining-high-court-is-short-of-half-of-its-strength/articleshow/87070777.cms||Joychen Joseph
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: GAD issues directive to ‘reunite’ working couples||AHMEDABAD: In a move aimed at reuniting married couples who are separated by distance due to their postings in different locations, the Gujarat government has come out with a policy where such couples can be posted at one location by their department or organization. The general administration department, in a circular dated October 16, said that for couples employed in state services, panchayat services and Gujarat public sector enterprises, efforts should be made to ensure that they work in a single location wherever possible. “The decision has been taken to ensure that working couples are not caught up in the challenges of living apart due to their postings. Their output at work also gets improved when living together,” said A K Rakesh, additional chief secretary, GAD. The order is applicable to all departments and those finding difficulty in its implementation are to consult GAD for further directions. A large number of teachers in the state stand to benefit from this decision, however more clarity is needed in this direction, said a government official. In the case of husbands, a minimum service period of two years is required before they can apply for transfer and in the case of wives, the criterion is one-year service. In the case of state boards, corporations and PSUs, postings are often non-transferable. In such cases where one spouse has a non-transferable job, even if the service period criteria are not met, the other partner can be transferred so they can reunite at one location, as per the circular.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gad-issues-directive-to-reunite-working-couples/articleshow/87070824.cms||---

For this, the students have to make an online application. The annual convocation will be held on October 18 on the Vidyapith campus, at which 505 of the 1,565 candidates will personally receive their degrees. The remaining candidates will get their degrees online. “Last year, the annual convocation event could not be held due to the Covid-19 situation,” said Rajendra Khimani, the vice-chancellor of Gujarat Vidyapith. “This year, we had to break away from the age-old tradition of handing out certificates personally keeping in mind the prevailing pandemic situation.” Explaining the rationale behind giving certificates to students at an in-person ceremony, Khimani said students have to take an oath that they will uphold the values preached by Gandhiji. “All candidates are required to sign their certificates after taking the oath. This year, we have the provision of digital signatures for students wishing to get their degrees online,” said Khimani. Of the 505 candidates to be awarded their degrees on Monday, 80 meritorious students will be given their certificates at the main convocation event. That will be done in the presence of the chief guest, Pankaj Chandra, the vice-chancellor of Ahmedabad University and former director of IIM-Bangalore. For the remaining 425 candidates, the university has set up eight centres within the campus from where the students can collect the degrees in person. This arrangement has been done to ensure that social distancing and other Covid-19 measures are strictly followed. Candidates who have successfully submitted their application for the online event will be virtually connected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-normal-gujarat-vidyapith-to-give-degrees-online-too/articleshow/87070828.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Desi students pay 3x pre-Covid fares for winter trip home from US, UK||MUMBAI: Indian students studying abroad continue to bear the brunt of travel restrictions imposed by India on scheduled airline international flights. The latest comes in the form of high airfares for return to India during the winter holiday around year-end. With high demand and low supply, return air fare for travel to India from countries such as the US, the UK and Canada are currently priced about three times the pre-Covid fares, say parents. The worst hit are students bound for India from the US west coast. “This year, with Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok shut to Indian flyers, students from the US west coast are left with no option but to transit via Europe and Middle East,” said a travel agent. On Saturday, the cheapest return fare for mid-December-early-January return travel on San Francisco-Delhi non-stop flight began at Rs 2.3 lakh, offered by Air India. A cheaper option was a transit via Dubai, priced at Rs 1.9 lakh, but entailed 25-hour travel each way. The cheapest fare on San Francisco-Mumbai return flights began at Rs 2.2 lakh, an Air India transit via Delhi. Other fares are expensive too. The cheapest available round fare on New York-Mumbai began at Rs 1.6 lakh and involved a Dubai transit and a 23-hour journey each way. The cheapest fares on non-stop return flights from New York to Delhi began at Rs 1.7 lakh. Similarly, for a Boston-Mumbai round trip, fares began at Rs 1.7 lakh while Chicago-Mumbai via Dubai was the cheapest option with fares at Rs 1.9 lakh. The cheapest return on London-Mumbai non-stop began at Rs 1.4 lakh on Air India, the cheaper fare for Rs 1.15 lakh involved a Dubai transit. Delhi has better non-stop connectivity, with Toronto-Delhi non-stop return priced at Rs 2 lakh and Chicago-Delhi non-stop return at Rs 1.8 lakh. Navin Bhatia (name changed on request), a parent who divides his time between the UK and India said he has decided to meet his children—one studying in Canada and the other in the US, that is—in Dubai this winter. “It’s a lot cheaper to fly to Dubai than to India from here in the UK,” he said. “I’ll try to do a round trip to India from there if the fares are better. Currently, a Dubai-Mumbai return for the last week of December is priced at Rs 65,700,” he said. Three weeks ago, he booked the tickets for mid-December travel and January return. A London-Dubai round trip in economy class cost Rs 80,000 while economy class fares on London- Mumbai began at Rs 2 lakh. His daughter’s Vancouver-Dubai return via Toronto cost Rs 1.4 lakh while his son’s Boston-Dubai return cost Rs 1.2 lakh. “Fares for travel this winter are at least three times the pre-Covid fares. In some cases they are even four times the year 2019 fares,” he added. India suspended scheduled international airline flight operations on March 23 last year. Currently, international flight operations are carried out under ‘Air Bubble Agreements’ that India has signed with 28 countries that provide direct/indirect connectivity to over hundred international destinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-desi-students-pay-3x-pre-covid-fares-for-winter-trip-home-from-us-uk/articleshow/87072992.cms||Manju V
---||Kolkata||Suicide by Physics Honours student:||Kolkata: A 20-year-old Physics Honours student allegedly committed suicide at his Regent Place residence - located close to Golf Green - late night on October 11. Police said the victim has been identified as Mrinmoy Mukherjee who studied at a reputed college at Narendrapur. Though cops are investigating all options, the family said that the victim - who was undergoing treatment for depression - was worried about financial insecurity. "His father was working as a chef at a popular restaurant in Salt Lake. But the pandemic saw his father losing his job. He now works at a hotel at Jasidih in Jharkhand. He also used to miss his father," stated an officer from Golf Green police. "We received information from SSKM outpost that Mukherjee. It was learnt from the mother of the victim that Mukherjee always had an excellent academic career. He was residing with his parents at the rented house for the past five years. His father earlier used to work in a hotel at Saltlake but since the lockdown he became jobless and now they were facing a financial crisis. Since then, the deceased has gone into a mental depression and always used to think about how to sponsor his education and family expenditure. His treatment was going on under psychiatrist Arghya Das. On October 11, around 6.30 pm, his mother went for some work outside. She knocked but received no reply. She went to check if he had gone outside. After half an hour she again repeatedly called her son but got no response.

The department has instructed all chief education officers to conduct an enquiry and book principals and parents involved in the malpractice. An official at the education department, who did not wish to be named, told TOI, “The matter was reported by the representatives of CBSE and ICSE schools to us. Due to the pandemic and a subsequent reduction in family incomes, there was a spike in drop-outs from private schools. Families started shifting wards from private to government schools and in the last 18 months, an enrollment scam, where proper procedure for transfer was not followed, surfaced.” As per the allegations, the maximum number of these cases are related to Haridwar-based schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/students-transfer-from-pvt-to-govt-schools-without-tcs-govt-sets-up-probe/articleshow/87068882.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Varanasi||Ram temple in Ayodhya will be most magnificent: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||GORAKHPUR: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said here on Friday that centuries old clouds over Ayodhya have dispersed after a long struggle of Ram bhakts. Once constructed, Ram temple in Ayodhya will be the most magnificent in the world, he added. Yogi was addressing devotees who had lined up along the roads to welcome the grand Vijayadashmi shobha yatra taken out by him from Gorakhnath temple amidst thunderous beats of dhols and nagadas. Hundreds of people, including those from the Muslim and Sindhi communities, had assembled to welcome the yatra, which culminated at the Ramlila maidan (ground). After reaching Mansarovar Ramlila maidan, Yogi performed puja of Dev Vigrah inside the Mansarovar temple. He also performed raj tilak of Lord Ram. “The clouds of 500 years over Ayodhaya have been dispersed. It was a long struggle and Ram bhakts left no stone unturned to ensure the construction of Ram temple. The distinction between religion, caste and creed could be erased by following the ideals of Shri Ram,” he said addressing the devotees. “Truth prevails because it is accompanied by justice. And to attain both truth and justice, the path of religion is necessary. At present the construction work of Ram temple is underway on a war-footing. Once built, it will be the most magnificent temple in the world,” he added among loud cheers. Yogi also said that the foundation of cultural development of the country is Lord Ram. “The foundation of cultural development in the country is Lord Ram. Both new Uttar Pradesh and new India are touching development peaks by following the ideals of Shri Ram.” The CM, while citing the example of Lord Ram’s life, said: “Although challenges do come while walking the path of truth, but with patience, will power and commitment, success becomes certain.” He added, “Religion is not limited to the method of worship, but inspires us to move on the path of righteousness and commitment towards duty and the ideals of Sri Ram inspire us towards path of righteousness.” Thousands of people of different communities welcomed Gorakshpeethadhishwer (Yogi), including people of the Muslim and Sindhi communities. The newly appointed president of Urdu Academy, Chowdhary Kaifulwara, garland the chief minister while a large number of people of Muslim weaver’s community stood with him in CM’s welcome. Many Muslim women watched the yatra from the balconies and terraces of houses and took pictures of the CM moving in the procession. A large number of people of Sindhi community welcomed Yogi with flowers and garlands at the under-construction Jhulelal temple. The Shobha yatra is a tradition of Gorakshpeeth and all mahants, including Yogi, have been been leading the yatra twice a year, on Vijaydashmi and on Holi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/clouds-over-ayodhya-dispersed-ram-temple-will-be-most-magnificent-yogi/articleshow/87068910.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Mumbai||Murals & marine playscapes reinvent 1,000-year-old Banganga||Just off the buzzy stretch at the tip of Malabar Hill, home to one of Mumbai’s oldest heritage precincts — the 1000-year-old Banganga that has been the focus of conservationists since the 1980s — has recently received a makeover that pays homage to the myths, people and community built around the ancient talao. “Our focus was to revive the area, bring its stories alive and educate people of the history of the tank and the temples around it. We aren’t physically changing or restoring any structure there but bringing the stories and the history to the experience,” explained Radha Goenka, director of RPG Foundation that launched ‘The Heritage Project this year with Walkeshwar’s stepped freshwater tank as their first initiative of reviving the experience of a heritage site. “Having lived in South Bombay and interacted with the Banganga tank and the beautiful temples around it built according to the architecture of different periods that many aren’t aware of, I picked this site as our first project,” said Goenka. In its new avatar, a vivid blue-and-gold mural has submerged the once dull and dreary passage to the stone tank in deep blues of the ocean. Hand-painted by Shilo Shiv Suleman, a visual artist and founder-director of ‘The Fearless Collective’ that engages with art for social change, the expansive wall painting titled ‘Pyaas’ draws attention to the role of water in the life and livelihoods of Banganga’s people. If portraits of Lord Ram shooting his arrow into the ground that caused this fresh water spring to burst forth, Ganga (in human form) riding a fish in an imagined current of the spring and Lord Vishnu watching over them are depictions of the mythology that define Banganga’s charm; accentuating the fresco are also portraits of women from the region — an elderly lady with folded hands and young girls with their backs to each other — that allude to their urge to survive. An old BMC playground beside the Rameshwar Temple has sprung into a fun marine-themed playscape with climber ropes, spring toys, slides and swings in sync with its surroundings of the Arabian sea and material to withstand the corrosive coastal weather. In keeping with the heritage of the neighbourhood — listed as a protected monument by the state archaeological department in 1991 — ornate lamp posts, cast iron wooden benches and signage planted across the surrounds now trigger curiosity about Banganga’s origins going back to 9th century Kolis, the 118 temples dotting its boundary, the dhobi ghat and a special graveyard for sanyasis. “We’ve also launched an app called Amble with self-guided walking tours that’ll allow visitors to experience deeper stories via augmented reality features taking them back in time,” added Goenka stressing that that water in Banganga being from a natural spring is common knowledge but the idea of it also as a river deity released from her trappings by an epic hero has enchanted visitors and historians through decades. While the Foundation is working with the ASI and BMC to lend a fresh lease of life to the neighbourhood, they may have hit a wrong chord once more with the Goud Saraswat Brahman (GSB) Temple Trust, which owns the Banganga tank as well as its surrounding precinct. “This place is about community sentiments. The temple trust was formed in 1879 and has a history. If someone wants to do some good here, we’d promote that development but why omit owners from the discussion? They never approached us properly and that’s our issue,” says Rutvik Aurangabadkar, chief executive (projects), GSB Trust. Their first attempt at revamping Banganga had fallen through the cracks in 2019 when a 10-year agreement signed between the Foundation and the state Directorate of Archaeology and Museums for the conservation, restoration and maintenance of the heritage tank was revoked following objections by the GSB Trust. “They had filed a draft under the Maharashtra Vaibhav State Protected Monuments Adoption Scheme where the ownership rights were not with a private entity. There were huge errors in certain clauses because GSB Trust holds the Banganga property card in its name,” adds Aurangabadkar. The challenge, Goenka says, is working with a living community. “It has lots of players — those who take care of the temple, the dhobi ghat, slum community, owners, heritage cell, and BMC. We’re happy to facilitate the change and have the community take over,” reasoned Goenka who continues to be optimistic about their revival efforts. “If we get a positive response from the community there, we’ll continue to do more work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/murals-marine-playscapes-reinvent-1000-yr-old-banganga/articleshow/87073028.cms||Mohua Das

---||Jaipur||Traders in Jaipur rejoice as ban on crackers lifted, many confused about norms||JAIPUR: As the state government on Friday lifted the ban on firecrackers saying that bursting of the green crackers will be allowed for two hours, the firecracker traders with permanent license are upbeat and are expecting a good business. However, many traders on the other hand, are confused over the specifications on the green firecrackers and are clueless on how they will exhaust the last year’s stock. After the lifting of ban, TOI on Saturday visited Walled City markets where many firecracker traders have the permanent license, to know what would be the way ahead for them. “There is a strict direction that firecrackers other than green ones won’t be allowed in the market. Thus, we have ordered for the green firecrackers, which produce sound not more than 100 decibels and have lesser harmful chemicals. This is a welcome step taken by the government but the traders should be abiding by all the rules,” said Mustafa Saeed, a cracker shop owner at Hawa Mahal market. However, traders also said that there is no clarity on the firecrackers they had purchased last year. “Government so far has said that they will only allow green firecrackers, which means other crackers won’t be allowed. I am yet to apply for the license. Hopefully, things would be clarified by the administration soon,” said Mahesh Samtani, a fireworks trader at Kishanpole Bazaar, who will apply for the license soon. Meanwhile, those who apply for firecracker license every year are still confused. “Things are not clear yet and Diwali is almost a fortnight away. We will meet the senior officers of Jaipur police on Monday to get clarity on this,” said Rambabu Dusaad, president of Asthayee Patakha Vikreta Sangh. In Jaipur, nearly 107 shops across the city have permanent licenses, while on an average, Jaipur police issues 2,000 firecracker licenses every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/traders-rejoice-as-ban-on-crackers-lifted-many-confused-about-norms/articleshow/87073014.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Veggies get 40% costlier in a fortnight||AHMEDABAD: Surging prices of petrol and diesel are not only trampling over monthly fuel budgets but even household budgets are going for a toss. Increased transportation cost as a function of fuel price hike, coupled with an extended, erratic rainfall this monsoon has led prices of vegetables and grains to skyrocket. Retail prices of basic vegetables such as onion and tomato have almost surged 40% over the past couple of weeks and winter greens are costlier by a similar proportion. According to data provided by Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Ahmedabad, onion price grew to Rs 38 a kilogram in the wholesale market which has near-doubled in the retail market to Rs 70 a kg. Similarly, tomato prices grew to Rs 90 a kg! The price of greens such as long beans, cluster beans, coccinia and brinjals has increased to more than Rs 100 a kg. Explaining reasons for the surge, Deepak Patel, secretary, APMC Ahmedabad, said, “Over the last fortnight, wholesale price of vegetables increased by 15-20% primarily due to the heavy rainfall towards the fag-end of the monsoon season. Farmers were unable to get timely harvest due to which prices showed a steep increase.” Surging fuel costs are also adding to wholesale and retail costs of vegetables. A vegetable trader in APMC said, “Onions are largely procured from Nasik over and above the local crop. However, the cost of transportation from Nashik to Ahmedabad has increased by 20% because of which both wholesale and retail prices are witnessing an inflation for onions.” A similar effect is seen on other vegetable crops as well. Deepchand Bindran, a trader in APMC, said, “The recent cyclonic weather also led to increase in tomato prices. Due to the rains, the crop in Kadi is late by a month, whereas that in Idar has completely failed. Ahmedabad’s requirements will therefore be met by procuring tomato crop from Maharashtra, where there is shortage of crop due to heavy rains.” With increase in prices of onion and tomato, which are the most common staples consumed in homes, household budgets as well as those of restaurants are going for a toss, especially in the run up to the festive season when consumption will increase. Restaurateurs who procure vegetables on wholesale prices are also facing the heat with surge in prices. An Ahmedabad-based restaurateur said, “When prices of basic vegetables such as onions, tomatoes and potatoes increase, restaurateurs always bear the brunt. These vegetables are widely used for making gravies, curries, salads and a host of other preparations.” “This time, due to relaxation on import of pulses, wholesale prices are not drastically high. However, there is an increase on the retail front and fuel price surge has also marginally impacted retail prices in addition to higher dealer margins,” said Bimal Kothari, vice-chairman, India Pulses and Grain Association (IPGA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/veggies-get-40-costlier-in-a-fortnight/articleshow/87070819.cms||Niyati Parikh

Bsed on experts’ report, a financial estimate of around Rs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh has been prepared, which covers technical works required. Non-functional boom barriers of the underground multi-level parking lots will be made functional, sources said. Besides, devices will be installed to ensure that the system has details of vehicles on each floor. There is also a plan to install sensors for direct entry and exit of vehicles. “Some facilities are there at the underground parking lot but these have been non-functional for the past many days. Therefore, experts have visited each and every point and submitted their detailed advice to the authority. They also suggested some new devices. Based on that, we are going to call the tender. After going through the laid down tender process, work will be allotted to the successful company,” sources said. The multi-level parking lot has a capacity of around 900 cars, but is not being utilised optimally. On an average, between 400 and 500 vehicles utilise this facility on a regular basis. Adviser to the Chandigarh administrator, Dharam Pal recently visited the underground multi-level parking lot of Sector 17 as well as other surface lots and directed MC officials to improve the underground parking lot, mainly by installation of technical devices to make it completely automatised. Thereafter, the MC enlisted experts and is now going to start improvement work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-all-set-to-automate-underground-parking-in-sec-17/articleshow/87070812.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Lucknow||Actor Farrukh Jaffer of 'Gulabo Sitabo' fame passes away at 88 in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Amitabh Bacchan’s ‘Begum’, Rekha’s mother in Umrao Jaan, ‘Badi Apa’ in Secret Superstar — veteran actress Farrukh Jaffer passed away on Friday here at the age of 88. Jaffer was not keeping well for some and breathed her last at a private hospital. Best known for her energy, vigour and full of life nature and her recent portrayal of Amitabh Bachhan’s wife ‘Fatima Begum’ in the movie ‘Gulabo Sitabo’ directed by Shoojit Sircar, the octogenarian started her acting career in 1981 with Muzaffar Ali’s ‘Umrao Jaan’, in which she played Rekha’s biological mother. After Umrao Jaan, she went on winning hearts of her audiences with her different roles in ‘Swades’, ‘Peepli Live’, ‘Secret Superstar’, ‘Sultan’, her recent starrer ‘Mehrunisa’. The list goes on. In March this year, she also won the Filmfare award for the best supporting actress for her role in ‘Gulabo Sitabo’. As soon as the news of her death spread, tributes poured in from her colleagues, friends, family members, co-stars, including actor Ayyushman Khurana and screenwriter Juhi Chaturvedi, who wrote Sircar’s film. Remembering the time he spent with Jaffer on the sets of Umrao Jaan and other short films, director Muzaffar Ali said that she will always stay as an important figure and a part of his creative works. “She was not just a character in my films. She was a part of our production team as well in the film, her diction and command over Urdu language was so strong that we learnt from her everyday. She was so full of humour that the set always felt lively when she was around. The last scene of Umrao Jaan when she meets Rekha is very memorable for me,” added Ali. Jaffer was born in 1933 in Jaunpur and moved to Lucknow after her marriage to journalist and freedom fighter SM Jaffer at the age of 14. She graduated from Lucknow University. Before becoming a household name with her acting, she landed a job at the All India Radio (AIR) as a radio announcer. She later moved to Delhi when her husband was posted there and joined AIR Urdu Service, while also attending acting classes by Ebrahim Alkazi from National School of Drama. But, soon left her job and moved back to Jaunpur where she spent 15 years as a ‘pradhan’. Jaffer was also socially active and was a part of several campaigns and protests. She continued to work and get roles till the end of her days. “She lived her life fully, especially the latter years of her life. She used to go to the university wearing ‘gharara’ on a bicycle.

In the green room, while getting ready, she continued to say dialogues of Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand and sing her favourite song ‘Hawa me udhta jaye mera laal dupattaa’.

---||Jaipur||2 held for beating 29-yr-old to death in VKI||Jaipur: City police Saturday arrested two accused for beating a 29-year-old man to death on road number 17 under Vishwakarma industrial area (VKI) police area. ACP (Chomu) Rajendra Singh said that Irshad Ali (29) and Karan Nayak (18) were arrested for the murder of Ramesh Chandra Gurjar. “The accused had a quarrel over the phone with Gurjar on Thursday. They came and beat him up, leading to his death in the hospital on Friday,” Singh said. Singh said that police were looking for the remaining accused. “The entire incident took place when the accused and victim had exchanged invectives at each other on Thursday,” he said. Gurjar worked as a travel agent and had died in SMS Hospital on Friday after he was trashed with sticks and iron rods. Ramesh was taken to Kanwatia Hospital immediately after the incident where he soon fell unconscious. The doctors ran medical tests and referred him to SMS Hospital for treatment. He was brought to the SMS Hospital at around 12.30am, but he died on Friday morning at about 4 am. Police had initially identified four accused who were part of the gang that beat up Gurjar. Three other suspects were unnamed. A CCTV footage was examined based on which the police began their investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-held-for-beating-29-yr-old-to-death-in-vki/articleshow/87070845.cms||---

The accused, Shoral Bobby Dass, was arrested from the Civil Lines area in Banda (Uttar Pradesh) recently. Additional commissioner of police (EOW) RK Singh said that one Sulochana Prakash, president of Women’s Christian Temperance of India, had earlier claimed that her organisation was the bona fide owner of the property at Rajpur Road. “She alleged that one Ramesh Chander Aggarwal in connivance with one Sunil Kumar and one Ajay Gupta hatched a criminal conspiracy and prepared false and fabricated documents about the property,” Singh said. During investigation, the role of co-accused John Augustine and Dass emerged. On April 6, 2005, a general power of attorney (GPA) was executed by “Indian Church Trustees chairman Augustine” in favour of Dass. However, further probe revealed that Augustine never held the post of chairman of Indian Church Trustees nor the post of Metropolitan. “Augustine was never given any right or authority to manage any of the church or the property of the church, so the GPA executed by Augustine in favour of the accused, Dass, and further execution of GPA in favour of Ramesh Aggarwal was null and void,” police said. The team that arrested the accused was led by DCP (EOW) Rajeev Ranjan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-50cr-church-property-sold-man-arrested/articleshow/87073050.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Women are born warriors, can play role in def strategy’||Lucknow: The role of women in military forces has changed from sympathizers to armed combat over the years. The change is evident in many areas, said panelists during a discussion at the Military Literature Festival on Saturday. Continuing their weekend online sessions, the panelists of the session titled ‘War As Seen From The Pen of Women’ included poet and novelist Easterine Kire, writer Anuja Chauhan, and journalist Rashmi Saxena. The trio discussed the state of women in the military forces. The panelists also discussed warriorhood villages where all the villagers turn into warriors to safeguard the women and children. “Women are warriors in themselves. During colonial times, the women of Naga tribes did not fight on the battlefield, but they fought a different battle altogether, from being an early widow to raising their children single handedly. The role of women was crucial then and it is even today. They trained their kids to become warriors,” said Kire “The counter insurgency operations have always been guided and supported by women. In fact, the role of women has now changed from sympathizers to combatants. Military tactics can improve by bringing women on the decision tables,” said author Rashmi Saxena. “While investigating, visiting and living with the women in combat roles in insurgent groups during research for my books, I came to know that their tenure is just about four years because they either die in that time or they lose their flexibility and capacity to work. These women even begin craving for normal life after some time,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/women-are-born-warriors-can-play-role-in-def-strategy/articleshow/87073059.cms||---
---||Kolkata||CISCE to train proctors, prepare principals for upcoming November semester exams, guidelines for physical practical exams also comes in||Kolkata: The guidelines on how the first semester exams of ISC and ICSE are to be conducted, will be released by the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations on Tuesday, October 19. School heads have received a communique from the Council regarding this and have also been told that training sessions will also start from Tuesday onwards for all the proctors, super proctors, buffer proctors, support executives, who will assist in the conduct of the first semester exams that will happen from November 15 onwards. Guidelines for physical practical examinations to be conducted in batches in school between October 25 and February 2022 also reached school heads on Saturday. It specifies how visiting supervisors will have to be appointed and how question papers have to be prepared following sample papers that school heads will receive. On October 21, the Council will hold a virtual meeting with affiliated school heads of the state to “familiarise” them with the modalities of the new format, said a letter from Council chief executive and secretary, Gerry Arathoon. These virtual meetings are being held in clusters of states on different dates. On October 21, school heads from West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim, will attend the meeting from 10 am. This year the two board exams have been split into two semesters in the wake of the Covid situation. The first semester will start from November 15 and go on till December. It will be an online app based exam, school heads said, though they are awaiting detailed guidelines on how the Council plans to conduct it. Candidates have the choice of writing the papers from home or from school and have already indicated their choice to school heads who have in turn informed the Council about the choice made by parents of each candidate. They will have to write the exams using electronic devices like laptops, tablets or cell phones that have cameras and microphones, the details of which have also been shared by the schools with the Council. The questions will be in the MCQ format. Guidelines regarding the ratio of proctors, buffer proctors and super proctors to candidates had earlier been announced by the Council and most schools have already provided details of the teachers who have been nominated for these positions, with the Council. They will start getting trained from Tuesday about how to invigilate the examination to ensure that no unfair means are being adopted while the candidates are writing their papers. “This training is especially needed because we have always conducted pen and paper exams but this one is an app based online test, which is new to all of us. Any false step on anyone’s part might lead to marks loss,” said a principal. “While on the one hand we will get trained, on the other the children also need to get familiarised because they might know the answer but press a wrong key. This needs a lot of mechanical practice and the Council will arrange for a mock test before they finally write the first semester,” said another principal. eom||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cisce-to-train-proctors-prepare-principals-for-upcoming-november-semester-exams-guidelines-for-physical-practical-exams-also-comes-in/articleshow/87070912.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Skyscrapers lift up lives at redeveloped Bhendi Bazaar||Clad in a faded purple rida, the traditional dress of the Bohra women, Rashida Saifuddin Kudrati gazes outside the window of her 13th floor room. She lovingly looks at the white-domed Raudat Tahera, the tomb that houses graves of two past leaders---51st Syedna Taher Saifuddin and his son and successor 52nd Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin—of the one-million worldwide Dawoodi Bohras. “Many of my community members travel from far to see Raudat Tahera. I feel blessed as I see it innumerable times daily,” says an emotional Kudrati, a homemaker. The Kudratis are among 650 families and 128 shop owners who have moved from transit accommodations to two skyscrapers—Al-Saadah A (36 storeys) and B (41 storeys)—at the Bhendi Bazaar being redeveloped by Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust (SBUT). A dream project of Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin and spread over 16.5 acres in the heart of the city, the clustered project, on completion, will free 3200 families and 1250 shop owners from their rented, crammed, crowded living in 250 dilapidated buildings. They have begun moving into self-owned ultra-modern, infrastructure-endowed (attached bathrooms in each room, two level basement as well as three to six levels parking, high street shopping experience, to name just a few) residences. “A total of 11 towers will come up on the plot which we got after demolishing 250 buildings. Out of 11, six will be rehab buildings while the rest will be for sale and reserved for government’s use as per the norms,” says an SBUT spokesperson. The entire area, adds the spokesperson, has been divided into 9 clusters. Of these, cluster 3 (having Al-Saadah A and B) is operational, cluster 1 and 6 are under construction, cluster 2 is an onsite commercial transit while work on remaining clusters will commence soon. “By 2025, all the six rehab buildings will be ready,” says the spokesperson. “The crowded 6-7-meter-wide roads are being replaced by 18-meter roads. The nine roads inside the complex connect the main road under the JJ Flyover.” Contrary to a misconception, it is not a gated, exclusive Bohra community complex. While the Bohras comprise 70% of the residents, the commercial establishments are divided equally among Bohra and non-Bohra owners. Once the SBUT bought the buildings from landlords, the tenants were shifted to three transit residences, each at Mazgaon, Sewri and Sion. “There has never been any discrimination against non-Bohra or non-Muslim residents or shop owners. Earlier, I was a bit embarrassed to tell others that I had a shop at Bhendi Bazaar because of its negative image. Now I say with pride that I own an establishment there,” enthuses Bhavesh Makwana whose father set up a tailoring shop here six decades ago. Here Sunni Zulekha Mansuri is as happy as her co-resident Hatim Rashid, a Bohra. Seated under framed photographs of three Syednas—Taher Saifuddin, Mohammed Burhanuddin and the present Mufaddal Saifuddin--Rashid, 69, says he has witnessed many momentous events at Bhendi Bazaar. “I was a young volunteer when then President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed visited Bhendi Bazaar to inaugurate Raudat Tahera (on April 19,1975). I witnessed two Syednas being buried there. From here I can see the Arabian sea and the Saifee Masjid,” says Rashid. The over-a-century-old Saifee Masjid was demolished as part of the redevelopment plan and faces Raudat Tahera with no obstruction in between the two monuments. They comprise the nerve Centre of the global Dawoodi Bohra community and, like a magnet, attract the faithful from India and abroad. Elders are probably the happiest lot here. We meet four senior citizens-Sheikh Ibrahim Plumber (76), Asghhar Lakdawala (75), Shabbir Bootwala (73), Hasanali Arsiwala (80)—seated on a stone bench on an airy podium on the seventh floor. “Open space, non-stop water supply, lifts, fire alarms, CCTv-installed passages and attached toilets are boons,” says octogenarian Arsiwala who would, a decade ago, queue up outside common toilets and spend water frugally as the taps would run barely for an hour daily.

Food and accommodation for the successful candidates will be provided by the MP’s office. Interns will be deployed mostly in the fieldwork covering the Karur constituency which includes Karur, Manapparai in Trichy, Viralimalai in Pudukottai and Vedasandur in Dindigul districts. “Other MPs and MLAs can also offer such internship opportunities for the youths who want to get into politics, bureaucracy and policymaking. The exposure gained during the internship in working with various departments will give them confidence,” Jothimani said. The MP added that she is also considering availing fund support through corporate social responsibility (CSR) for paying a minimum stipend for the successful interns to manage their expenses.

---||Lucknow||Minimally invasive tech effective for slip disc and sciatica, says RMLIMS study||Lucknow: Minimally invasive technique for the treatment of ‘single level’ slip disc and sciatica is as effective as open conventional surgery, revealed a study by the doctors of Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS). The study was conducted by the anaesthesiology, CCM & pain medicine department on 64 patients suffering from sciatica and slip discs in two years (2017-2019) and its results were published recently in Indian Journal of Pain. Patients selected for the study were experiencing excruciating pain, burning sensations and tingling in one or both legs. Medicines and physiotherapy were not effective. Doctors under Prof Deepak Malviya, head of the department, decided to treat them with minimally invasive pain & spine intervention (MIPSI) technique. Prof Anurag Agrawal, who led the study, said, “We removed a portion of the disc which was compressing the nerve causing pain and burning sensation by making only a seven-eight mm ‘button-size’ hole in the body through an endoscope. Over 90% (58) patients got instant relief after the procedure.” “The advantage of MIPSI is that the blood loss is minimal, chances of infections are less and a patient gets discharged the same day. In comparison, in open surgery, a four-six-cm-long incision is made to reach the perforated disc and hospital stay is three to five days. It takes at least 15 to 20 days for full recovery,” he added. “On comparing the results with the conventional spine surgery, we found that MIPSI is equally effective,” said Prof Shivani Rastogi, another team member. SGPGIMS and RMLIMS are the two public sector institutes that are using this technique at present. KGMU also has a dedicated pain medicine service. Doctors said the state capital has the potential of becoming a hub of pain medicine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/minimally-invasive-tech-effective-for-slip-disc-and-sciatica-says-rmlims-study/articleshow/87073095.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Nagpur||Nagpur district sees zero Covid cases on Friday, second time in 16 days||NAGPUR: For the second time in 16 days, the district recorded zero Covid cases on October 15. Earlier, no cases were detected from over 4,300 tests on September 29, which had happened for the first time in 547 days (since May 16, 2020). There has been no death due to Covid among the residents of the district since August 12. Nagpur rural has not recorded a Covid fatality at least since July 30. Between August 12 and October 15, the only Covid death recorded in Nagpur’s count was of an outside district patient who passed away in the city on September 29. In the last two and half months, the district has reported 487 cases, which comes to an average of six cases per day, and four deaths, including three of outside district persons. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has been documenting the vaccination status of new patients found in its jurisdiction since August-end. The unvaccinated persons testing positive also comprise those below the age of 18. Among the vaccinated persons who tested positive, many have taken both their doses between February and July this year. Not only the vaccinated but unvaccinated patients also have remained mild to moderate, and didn’t need oxygen or heavy medication, as per officials. The district is reporting fewer cases amid unlocking of nearly all public places and educational institutions, beside easing of cap on attendance. Another positive development observed during this span is that no new variant of the virus has been reported. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, a member of district tasks force, said, “As I have been saying, the spurt would largely depend on human behaviour and characteristics of virus.” Dr Sarnaik said vaccination will do a balancing act. “If we have to continue with zero figure more frequently, we have to scale up vaccination for other age groups. Asymptomatic carriers are likely to be found more among those below 18 years of age. The government has permitted a vaccine for 12 to 18 group. This will further cover a large number of population. Once young persons are vaccinated, the transmission will remain low,” he said. On virus mutation, Dr Sarnaik said it depends on number of virion particles (virus particles) in a patient’s body. “The more the number of virion particles, the more number of people will be affected. Severity of infection, high transmission and mutation risk will increase. Right now, all the patients are mild. Many positive patients are travellers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/on-friday-zero-covid-cases-in-dist-second-time-in-16-days/articleshow/87068997.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

So far, these localities were depending on the TWAD Board for water supply.Officials said that around 4 MLD of water is being supplied by TWAD in wards 40, 41 and 45 for which the corporation is paying Rs 1.5 crore per year. However, there have been constant complaints from the residents about poor quality, leakage, and irregular water supply. To solve the issue, the corporation has planned to address the water needs of the three wards by utilising the state finance commission grant of Rs 4.5 crore. New pipelines for a 8km stretch will be established between Periyar Nagar (Kambarasampettai) head works to a new overhead water tank planned near the railway junction, for which the foundation stone was laid by minister for municipal administration minister K N Nehru.The water sourced will be shared with five OHTs to ensure drinking water supply throughout the year. “The new OHT will have a capacity to store 5 lakh litres of water sourced from the main head works. The main objective is to supply uninterrupted water to the residents every day,” a corporation official said. Meanwhile, Nehru handed over cash assistance of Rs 25 lakh each to the family members of two doctors and a frontline worker who succumbed to Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/water-project-launched-for-3-areas-in-trichy-city/articleshow/87073146.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Complacency in festive seasion can lead to Covid spike after Diwali’||LUCKNOW: If the overcrowding and negligence towards Covid protocols witnessed during Navratri and Dussehra would continue in the rest of the festival season, it may lead to surge in the infection rate post-Diwali, experts here have warned while drawing attention to the huge footfall in pandals and for Ravana dahan with utter disregard to safety protocols. Experts advised people not to be complacent during the festival season because fresh cases are still being reported in the city and if it continues, there is a chance of mutation in the virus, which can spell trouble. “People should understand that despite being vaccinated, the risk of catching Covid-19 is always there. Once the virus enters the body, it tries to defeat the vaccine induced antibodies through mutation. As the virus circulates from one person to another, the mutation becomes stronger, which in turn can give rise to a dominant variant. Such a variant can play havoc as we witnessed in the second wave in April and May this year,” explained Dr Amit Singh, epidemiologist and general secretary UP Provincial Medical Association, Lucknow. “Vaccination is to prevent serious illness, but not a guarantee that a person will not get infected. A vaccinated person can not only contract the virus, but can also circulate it by infecting others. People with low immunity such as cancer, drug-resistant TB and transplant patients along with those who could not take Covid vaccine due to various health issues might be at greater risk,” Prof Virendra Atam, head of medicine department at King George’s Medical University (KGMU). Former head of the department of microbiology department, Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU Prof Anil Kumar Gulati said that even though cases have reached a negligible level, citizens should not provide an opportunity to the novel coronavirus by ditching Covid protocols — masks, social distancing and hand hygiene. “If the virus breaches the defence system of a vaccinated person, it means either the person hasn’t developed enough antibodies against it or she/he has been infected by a mutated version. The circulation of the mutated variant can be checked if only a limited number of people are infected. However, large gatherings without social distancing and masks can infect many persons at a time. This will create a situation like March when we saw cases surging from negligible levels to over 5,000 daily,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/complacency-in-festive-seasion-can-lead-to-covid-spike-after-diwali/articleshow/87073159.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Mumbai||NCB zonal chief’s kith and kin made witnesses, says Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik on Saturday fired a fresh salvo against Narcotics Control Bureau zonal director Sameer Wankhede, saying his family friend is a main witness in three raids conducted by the NCB in the recent past. “It appears to be a family affair. A person who has put up his own pictures along with a lady don on social media is a witness in three cases registered by NCB. We demand that Wankhede explain his relationship with this person and if it is legally allowed to call a person as a witness in three different cases,” Malik told mediapersons. Malik shared pictures of witness Fletcher Patel and a woman, Yasmeen Wankhede, sister of Sameer Wankhede. “I have taken these pictures from social media, where Patel has described her as lady don. Our allegation is that most of the raids conducted by the NCB are fake and fabricated, most of the witnesses too are fake. In the past, we had established that Kiran Gosavi, the main witness in the Aryan Khan case, is a criminal and has been described as wanted by law-enforcing agencies,” Malik said. Malik said the NCB had registered three different cases, first on January 2, 2021, second on November 25, 2020, and third on October 12, 2021, and in all the three cases, Fletcher Patel is the main witness. “All this appears to be strange and shocking. How a family friend can be a witness and that too in three cases? NCB must come out with a specific clarification on Patel and Yasmeen Wankhede, who is also the office-bearer of MNS’s film branch. Many in the film industry attend her office on a regular basis. We feel that Sameer Wankhede is targeting the film industry,” Malik said. Sameer Wankhede declined to comment on Malik’s allegations, saying, he has no authority to interact with media. Patel and Yasmeen reacted sharply against Malik. “I am an ex-serviceman, it is unfortunate that Malik is challenging my integrity. We do not need Malik’s permission to undertake drug free Maharashtra campaign. Please do not defame ex-servicemen. We are associated with Wankhede in his campaign against drugs. In fact we are proud of him and Yasmeen, whom I call lady don,’’ Patel said. Patel said he along with Yasmeen had done much social work in the pandemic, when Malik never came in the picture. “We have been knocking at the doors of Malik for assistance to an ex-serviceman, but he never responded. Suddenly, now that his son-in-law is in the dock, Malik has raised his voice against Wankhede and his sister,” Patel said. Yasmeen said Malik’s charges were baseless. “We will take appropriate legal action against Malik,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-zonal-chiefs-kith-and-kin-made-witnesses-says-malik/articleshow/87073165.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

Three gardens — “Rashi Vatika”, “Nakshtra Vatika” and “Sugandh Vatika” — will be the main attraction of this entire project. Gupta said to raise public awareness, an information centre, a library, a museum and a souvenir shop would be established . “All these buildings will be seen as big leaves from the sky,” said Gupta. Gian Chand Gupta directed WAPCOS, administration and forest department officials to speed up the work and complete it within the best time possible.

The 18 year old did her Class XII from Tehri-based Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV), Pokhal. To prepare for the JEE Advanced, she got herself enrolled in government-run centre for social responsibility and leadership (CSRL) Super 30, which takes students strictly on the basis of merit. The centre bears all expenses as most aspirants are from families with annual income below Rs 2.5 lakh. Rajnandni took the entrance exam conducted by CSRL Super 30 and came through with flying colours.Running out of words to express his happiness, Ravinder Singh, Rajnandni’s father, said, "My daughter always aimed to crack the exam. She was focused and skipped most family gatherings. Last year, she kept off Diwali celebrations and decided to stay back in Dehradun to prepare for exams. She has been a bright student." Singh, a teacher at Saraswati Vidya Mandir in Tehri, said his daughter had managed to crack the exam with limited resources. "Rajnandni secured 98% in Class 12 exams. The girl is an inspiration for one and all," said Adesh Kumar Sharma, principal, JNV Pokhal. Speaking to TOI, Rajnandni said, "I studied 14 hours a day. I’d never thought of performing so well.

While the zero transfer counselling was completed for district education officers based on seniority recently, a new transfer policy is being drafted to address the requests received from the school teachers, he said.“We have discussed the possibility of zero transfer counselling for teachers with senior bureaucrats, but it seems unviable for now. Some transfer requests we received were genuine. A policy is being formulated to address the requests,” Poyyamozhi said in Thiruverumbur after inaugurating the new air-conditioned bus service in the city. The minister asserted the Kalvi Tholaikatchi programme being aired for government school students will continue irrespective of the Covid-19 situation in the state as some of the parents are still hesitant to send their children to school. On the corporal punishment meted out to a student by a teacher in Chidambaram, the minister said that school managements were reiterated not to punish the students physically. “Students should not be punished and shown partiality in schools. They should be encouraged to attend the classes, and certainly should not be sent back,” the minister added. Whether there will be a change in the number of education districts in the state, Poyyazmozhi said that the existing 120 education districts will continue and remain unchanged.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/zero-transfer-counselling-unlikely-for-teachers/articleshow/87073167.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Uddhav always aspired to be CM, must stop pretending now: Fadnavis||Nagpur: After CM Uddhav Thackeray’s jibes at the BJP during the Dussera rally speech on Friday, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis shot back saying the former always aspired to be state’s CM and must ‘stop pretending’ now. Speaking with reporters in Nagpur, Fadnavis alleged that in hindsight, Uddhav’s political aspirations are apparent and may have led to exit of leaders like Raj Thackeray and Narayan Rane from the Shiv Sena. “While there is nothing wrong in having aspirations (to be CM), the problem is when you create a false narrative to achieve that goal,” said Fadnavis. The BJP-Sena alliance fell apart post-polls in 2019, after Sena alleged that their partners have gone back on the promise of sharing the CM seat. Fadnavis said if having a Shiv Sainik as a CM was the moot issue, then why did Uddhav only get the post. “Any Shiv Sainik, like Diwakar Raote, Subhash Desai, Eknath Shinde, could have sat on that chair,” he said.The leader of opposition said that a quick glance at Shiv Sena’s history provides a perspective on these ‘aspirations’. “If you (Uddhav) did not want to become CM, then why did Narayan Rane have to leave the party. Rane never wanted to be Shiv Sena’s supremo. Also, why did Raj Thackeray have to leave. It’s alright, you had an aspiration (to be CM) and you fulfilled it. But for that you must stop blaming the BJP. Since two years you have been saying it, so now no point in continuing it,” said Fadnavis. He countered CM’s statement that BJP has been ‘rejected’ by the people by citing the pre-poll alliance equations. “We won in over 70% of the contested seats whereas Sena won in around 45%. Fact is that in the exam, BJP passed, and Sena got promoted. It is the Congress and NCP which was rejected by the people, but by cheating the voters, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) came to power,” said Fadnavis. Responding to allegations that central agencies are being deliberately put on the trail of MVA leaders, Fadnavis said, “ED and CBI has not been brought by BJP, but by the order of the high court. Fact is Uddhavji, the government you are leading is the most corrupt in the state’s history. MVA’s only agenda is extortion. From the IT raids it has come to the fore that some ministers have a software which gives information as to how much money is to be recovered and from whom.” On the CM’s statement about the state-centre sovereignty, Fadnavis alleged that this line of thinking was against the Constitution. “You are now questioning the Constitution whose architect was Babasaheb Ambedkar. We will never allow such hidden agendas of changing the Constitution to succeed,” said Fadnavis. PM Modi against misuse of central agencies: Ex-CMReacting to statements from MVA leaders that central agencies are being used for political vendetta, Devendra Fadnavis said that PM Narendra Modi is against such ‘misuse’. “Neither does PM misuse these central agencies, nor does he let anyone do it. Modi never interferes with their functioning and does not allow anyone to misuse these agencies for political gains,” said Fadnavis. “Had we started misusing the central agencies, then half of MVA cabinet ministers would be in jail. However, we believe in democracy and frankly, those who have done nothing wrong should not be afraid. But remember this, PM Modi will not rest till corruption is weeded out,” added Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/uddhav-always-aspired-to-be-cm-must-stop-pretending-now-fadnavis/articleshow/87067612.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Singh’s statement on Savarkar bid to divert focus from key issues: Patole||Nagpur: Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Nana Patole joined opposition parties and historians in slamming Union defence minister Rajnath Singh for his statements regarding Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. Patole said Singh was trying to divert attention from more important issues like inflation, unemployment, farmers’ demands and threat to nation’s security from neighbouring countries.Patole stated that China is preparing for a war against India and sought to imply that Singh should be focusing on these matters. On Savarkar, Patole said, “He had sought pardon from the British government in 1911 and for that he used to get Rs60 as pension. That time Gandhi was not even in India. He was in South Africa fighting against the colonial regime there and returned only in 1915.”Patole was addressing media at the airport here on Friday.Continuing his tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, the former assembly speaker sarcastically said that both, along with Singh, “must have received some emails or mobile message from Savarkar in this regard”. “Such (misleading) statements are expected from Modi and Shah, who want to change the nation's history. People have started to ignore them, but scuh statements coming from a very senior minister like Singh is baffling. How did Singh learned about Savarkar acting on Gandhi’s advice when there was no mobile, internet, digital camera or fax during that period?” he said.Speaking on opposition’s charge that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had released a pittance in name of compensation to farmers who suffered due to incessant rains and drought, the Sakoli MLA said they had done their best in the limited financial resources.Citing the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Patole said it was Central government’s responsibility to provide aid to such affected farmers. “However, as everyone knows, the BJP-led NDA government has often meted out partial treatment to Maharashtra. The BJP leaders in the state are often criticising the three-party coalition government over inadequate compensation to the farmers. They should ideally divert their energies and efforts in bringing funds from the centre to help the aggrieved farmers,” he said.Patole further said that whenever state’s financial situation improves, Congress would be the first to seek more funds for farmers and request the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led government in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/singhs-statement-on-savarkar-bid-to-divert-focus-from-key-issues-patole/articleshow/87067622.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The probable top three in the city are Raiwat Bapat (AIR 325), Ayush Shrivastava (AIR 472) and Parth Kasture (AIR 593). Ifrah Khan (AIR 874), so far, has the highest rank in female category. TOI always ranks these students as ‘probables’ because no official ranking list is released for city level. The toppers list is prepared by TOI based only on the information received voluntarily from coaching institutes and parents. Raiwat, who may very well be the Vidarbha topper, said, “I did my coaching at ICAD and worked very hard in the last few months to get this rank. I want to attend one of the top IITs but don’t have a fixed inclination towards any particular course.” Ayush is hoping to land a seat in IIT-Delhi. His father Abhay said, “Ayush did his coaching from Allen Career Institute and is interested in electrical engineering and computer science. Let’s see which one he can get.” Parth is hoping to get into any one of two specific IITs in north India. “I too am a student of Allen Career Institute and with these marks, I am hoping to get a seat in IIT-Delhi or Varanasi. Would prefer to study electrical engineering but I am keeping my options open,” said Kasture. Ifrah, a student of Indian Olympiad School where she also got trained for JEE, is hoping to get into one of the top five IITs and pursue computer science. A total of 1,41,699 candidates appeared in both papers 1 and 2 in JEE (Advanced) 2021. Of them, 41,862 candidates have qualified, of which 6,452 are females.

I did not want to break her heart and so I went along in the lanes,” said Borkar who had soon became ‘Swati Aunty’.Borkar, posted at Mankapur police station, had gone to Ganga Jamuna within the limits of Lakadganj police station for additional reinforcement to enforce Kumar’s order prohibiting sex work.An avid dog lover, Borkar always tries to find some abandoned or distressed canine to offer help but here it was, perhaps for the first time, children.On ‘Pola’, the children wanted Borkar to give them a party. “I declined to give them a party but took permission from my seniors to go to Itwari and purchase stationaries and notebooks which I distributed among 15-20 children. Their unbridled happiness was very touching. It brought tears to my eyes,” said Borkar, a mother of two. Senior inspector of Lakadganj police station Parag Pote also assigned Borkar the task to make announcements in the red-light area about police’s eagerness to extend assistance for any rehabilitation plan instead of sex work.Borkar, who is invited to sing at any police function, said she would love to return to the red-light area on duty. “I used to speak to the sex workers and counsel them to chose some vocation in life that might not harm their children’s future. That’s how I became close to the children too after realizing their plight as families don’t have a steady income now due to legal issues,” said Borkar, who is also an avid dog lover.“I can vouch for the lessons I have learnt in life that giving joy to children and love to animals can left one from depression and sadness,” said Borkar.‘Swati ka kutta’ was the name given a to a stray whom Borkar nurtured at Sitabuldi police station.“I watched videos on YouTube to learn about canines, how to handle them, take care of them and understand their body language,” she said, adding, the plight of female stray dogs made her spend Rs 3,000 on two occasions to sterilize them as NMC decided to discontinue its drive.

---||Delhi||Delhi University: Popular courses get over even for reserved groups||NEW DELHI: In the third cutoff list released by Delhi University (DU) on Saturday, several courses across colleges were not offered for admissions under the reserved categories as well. Popular courses like BA (H) political science did not open for most of the categories under the third list in colleges like Bhagini Nivedita College, Aryabhatta College and Gargi College. At Lady Shri Ram College for Women, BA (H) sociology remained closed for the ST and EWS categories while it remained open for all the other categories. BA (H) economics at College of Vocational Studies was closed for the SC, ST and OBC categories. Kirori Mal College (KMC), on the other hand, saw BA (H) economics close for the EWS category while BA (H) English closed for the SC category. Additionally, BA (H) history in the college closed for the SC, ST and OBC categories and BA (H) geography closed for the SC category while the rest remained open. Several principals had earlier said that this year colleges were seeing a rush in the reserved categories from the initial cutoff lists itself. After the release of the second cutoff list in the varsity, Suman Sharma, principal of Lady Shri Ram College for Women, had said, “For the first time, we are seeing certain reserved category seats being taken before the unreserved category. This is not something that happens usually as admissions under the categories tend to continue till the last few lists.” This year, the university is expected to release a special cutoff list before the fourth list is announced. The varsity has specified that the list will be dependent on the availability of seats. After the second list, 51,000 out of the 70,000 seats are already taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/popular-courses-get-over-even-for-reserved-groups/articleshow/87073259.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Blazing costs fuel processors’ woes||After the lockdown slump, there has been a revival in domestic and export demand. However, industries across sectors are unable to fully reap its benefits as they battle skyrocketing prices of coal, natural gas and petroleum products (petrol and diesel). Steep jumps in the prices of imported coal, natural gas as well as petroleum products have increased the production cost across industrial sectors at a time when manufacturers are already battling high cost of raw materials. Sectors such as power, textiles, ceramics, cement, engineering and transport among others have been hit by the surge in fuel cost. Power plants struggle to generate electricitySeveral coal-based thermal power plants across Gujarat have been struggling to produce electricity due to fuel shortage and high prices of imported coal. The coal-fired power plants — both state and private sector — could produce only one-third of the targeted generation in September. The actual production in September was 66% lower than the electricity produced during the same period last year, according to the tentative data compiled by Central Electricity Authority (CEA). The power generation continued to be hampered in October because of the paucity of coal. As of Wednesday, several units of imported coal-based power plants — run by Tata Power, Adani Power and Essar Power — in Gujarat had halted production owing to high coal prices and fuel shortage. As these imported coal-fired power plants discontinued the supply of electricity under the power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL), the state electricity regulation board has to procure costly power from the energy exchanges to avoid power cuts. GUVNL bought electricity worth Rs 1,244 crore from the Indian Energy Exchange during the first 13 days of October. Tile makers raise prices as production expenses up 30-40%The recent increase in natural gas prices combined with a surge in coal, transportation and raw material prices have pushed up production cost of ceramic tile makers by 30-40% over the past six months.Ceramic tile makers in Morbi — India’s largest cluster of ceramic units — use natural gas as fuel to run their plants. The price of natural gas supplied to them has gone up by around 41% or Rs 13.14 per stan dard cubic meter over the past two months, following a steep increase in the price of natural gas in the international market. Surge in prices of diesel and coal has further added to their cost of production. "We raised tile prices by 30-40% recently after hike in price of natural gas. The prices of wall tiles have been revised from Rs 100 per box to Rs 130, and vitrified tile prices have risen from Rs 21 to Rs 26 per foot," said Nilesh Jetpariya, president (wall tiles division) of Morbi Ceramic Association. Morbi-based manufacturers also raised tile prices by 10-15% from September after Gujarat Gas Limited — the natural gas supplier — raised prices in August. "Several units are facing issues as this effects working capital," Jetpariya added. Fabrics to become more expensiveCoal is a key raw material used in textile processing houses. In the absence of availability of coal and steep surge in its price, textile processors are compelled to downsize production and increase job charges i.e. dyeing, processing and printing costs by 25%. Gujarat is home to nearly 4,000 textile processing units located in Surat, Ahmedabad and Jetpur. Estimates by textile processors suggest that price of imported coal from Indonesia has surged 230% from Rs 5,000 a tonne to Rs 16,500 a tonne over the past few months. Pramod Chaudhary, ex-president of South Gujarat Textile Processors’ Association (SGTPA), said, "Coal accounts for 25% of our production cost. Unlike the 30-60 day window to make payments for coal earlier, we now barely get five-day time frame to pay for coal due to volatility in prices. As a result, smaller units are facing liquidity crunch due to increased working capital needs." Apparel likely to be 15% dearerDespite upbeat consumer sentiment, clothing manufacturers are unable to cash in on the resurgence in demand due to high production cost. Imported coal got costlier at a time when apparel makers are already paying high prices for yarn and cotton. Coal price increase will have a direct impact on the cost of finished fabric, be it cotton or polyester or rayon, say manufacturers. Rahul Mehta, chief mentor, Clothing Manufacturers’ Association of India (CMAI), said, "An estimated 15% increase in apparel price is expected. Cotton and yarn prices are already up and there is a revision in the GST rates likely. At such a time, fabric costs are beginning to increase due to a steep surge in coal prices because of which apparel prices are expected to increase as a cascading effect." Transporters feel the heat tooWith increasing prices of petrol and diesel, transporters are feeling the heat and forced to absorb costs. "Diesel accounts for 50% of cost component for transporters. We don’t restructure our charges every day. Since prices are surging almost daily, we are compelled to absorb part of incremental fuel costs. At a time when we are getting business with some revival in demand in the run up to festive season, our revenues are drying up due to fuel price rise," said Mukesh Dave, president, Akhil Gujarat Truck Transporters’ Association (AGTTA). Increasing transport costs will come as another blow to industries across all sectors, as higher logistics and freight costs have increased working capital needs. In the wake of increased fuel costs, several industry bodies have passed on suggestions to the government seeking to bring petroleum products under the ambit of Goods and Services Tax (GST), so that they can avail benefit of input tax credit. Dyes, chemical makers battle added cost pressure: Natural gas price increase coupled with that of coal, fuel as well as raw materials used in manufacturing dyes and intermediates has left industries in a lurch with at least 40% increase in input costs. "Amid ongoing cost pressures, surge in fuel, gas and coal prices have further added to manufacturers’ cost of production, compliance and logistics by 40% or more. Manufacturers are meeting existing order commitments at high input costs, taking a hit in revenue. Due to this, fresh order inflow has taken a hit, as a result of which, some have already downsized production," said Yogesh Parikh, president, GDMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/blazing-costs-fuel-processors-woes/articleshow/87071047.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Nagpur||RPI to fight BMC polls with BJP: Athawale||Nagpur: Union minister of State for social Justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale on Saturday said his party RPI would jointly fight next year’s Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls with BJP.Interacting with the media during his visit to historic Deekshabhoomi, the MP said together both parties were aiming to grab about 100-125 seats in the all-important polls.“In 1992, we joined hands with the Congress and won the BMC polls. This time, we will be with the BJP. It will help the saffron party in winning more seats, as the opposition parties (Congress, NCP and Sena) are likely to fight the polls individually. It’s a fact that we cannot win the election on our own. It is always better to fight the polls to win rather than on the losing side,” the minister said.Reiterating his call to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for re-joining hands with the old ally BJP, Athwale said a majority of Shiv Sainiks too, want to leave Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and come back to saffron alliance. “I request him to rejoin us on the formula of sharing the CM’s chair for two and half years, if he wants to fulfil late Balasaheb Thackeray’s dream. We can split it between him and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. It would be beneficial for both parties in forthcoming municipal corporation and council polls in Maharashtra.”Endorsing union home minister Amit Shah’s stand of launching surgical strikes against Pakistan if terrorists continue to target the minorities in Jammu and Kashmir, the MP said after abrogation of Article 370 from the troubled state, development was taking place. “However, the terrorists did not want normalcy to return there and are targeting innocent civilians. The neighbours should not forget that Jammu and Kashmir is an inseparable part of India and they should be careful while indulging in any misadventure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rpi-to-fight-bmc-polls-with-bjp-athawale/articleshow/87067625.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Additional sessions judge M K Upadhyay allowed the appeals of all three — Nima Acharya, Kanti Amrutiya and Manoj Panara — challenging the additional chief judicial magistrate’s order convicting them in 2018 under section 171 B of Indian Penal Code and sentencing them to one year of imprisonment along with fine of Rs 1,000. The trio was accused of offering bribes to lure voters at a public meeting held near Bhaktinagar circle in Morbi in 2009. According to a complaint registered by the then deputy election officer A J Patel under Section 171 B of IPC, in her speech, Acharya had announced that grants would be allotted to the areas of first three voting booths which would procure maximum leads. The amounts of Rs 5 lakh to the first leading booth, Rs 3 lakh to the second and Rs 2 lakh to the third would be granted under member of parliament funds. The magisterial court order was based on the argument that the evidence implicitly proves that the accused tried to encourage and provoke party’s workers at various booths towards intense competition. It was also argued that the words spoken by the accused cannot be said was not with the intent to give gratification to any person or individual or voter. On Saturday, Acharya’s advocate A R Desai contended before the sessions court that the magisterial court’s judgment ‘is erroneous, illegal and perverse and that it requires the interference of this court’. Desai told TOI that the court set aside the order of the additional chief judicial magistrate and allowed their appeal. “The court ordered to acquit all the three accused including Nima Acharya, Kanti Amrutiya and Manoj Panara,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/assembly-speaker-among-3-acquitted-in-vote-lure-case/articleshow/87070482.cms||---

The much-hyped project has been in limbo due to various reasons. Vizag fishing harbour is one of the oldest in the country, but it now lacks proper sanitation facility, toilets, drainage system, storage facility, proper road, lighting, platform to dry fish and even rubber fenders to tag the boats safely. It may be recalled that cyclone Hudhud had caused damage to the harbour in October 2014. The fisheries department had submitted a DPR prepared by Marine Products Export Development Authority under the Union ministry of commerce and industry to the Centre in 2016. It proposed development of the harbour by adding modern amenities at a cost of Rs 100 crore. But, the project failed to take off. Speaking to TOI, joint director of fisheries department, P Laxman Rao, said the New Delhi-based agency recently visited the Vizag fishing harbour and Visakhapatnam Port to prepare the DPR. In the previous DPR, the total cost of project was pegged at Rs 100 crore. As per the new DPR, the cost is between Rs 150 and Rs 200 crore . The agency will visit the harbour again and submit the fresh DPR to the Union government by next month, Rao, added. “Though Vizag city made big strides on the development front in the past few years, the fishing harbour remained in poor state. It has now turned into a dumping yard. During rainy seasons, situation slips from bad to worse. There is an urgent need to develop the fishing harbour to create better opportunities to the fishermen said, Ch Satyanarayana Murthy, president, Dolphin Boat Operators’ Welfare Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/dpr-for-vizag-harbour-facelift-by-next-month/articleshow/87071033.cms||Nalla.Babu

This is the second letter by the Patidar leader in which he has claimed negligence in maintenance of Bhestan garden, where the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is considering redevelopment. Kanani demanded that Maharana Pratap Chowpati Garden in Varachha should also be redeveloped if Bhestan garden, which was developed 11 years ago, is required to be redeveloped for Rs 3 crore. The post followed soon after chief minister Bhupendra Patel left the city on Friday. Kanani also posted another letter on the same day to the municipal commissioner in which he highlighted the issue of providing basic infrastructure of water and drainage in the newly included villages within city limits. He claimed that it is the responsibility of the SMC to provide basic infrastructure to Laskana, Pasodara, Abrama and Velanja villages. “We are spending crores of rupees for maintenance, then why is the condition of the garden such that it requires Rs 3 crore expense for redevelopment? Due to the pandemic, SMC’s financial condition is not good and is it reasonable to spend crores for redevelopment after neglect? It should find out who is responsible for the neglect,” Kanani wrote in his letter. Despite several attempts, Kanani, however, remained unavailable for his comments. Earlier on October 4, the leader raised concerns about condition of roads in the city which were damaged due to rain. He demanded immediate repair and criticised AAP municipal councillors for focusing only on illegal constructions. In August, when he was a junior minister for health, Kanani had threatened to start a campaign if traffic police continued to fine those carrying textile bales on motorcycles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/kanani-targets-smc-over-redevelopment/articleshow/87070280.cms||---

An NCB team led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede carried out a search of a place at Chinchoti phata in Vasai and seized 205gm of MD and arrested Ejaz Yakub Shaikh, a resident of Imambara, near JJ hospital. In a followup operation, the team raided a place in Nalasopara and seized 300gm of MD. During interrogation it transpired that Shaikh was a drug peddler who used to buy drugs from a Nigerian. “Prima facie the Nigerian is manufacturing synthetic drugs from a kitchen factory in suburbs and selling them to peddlers,’’ said an officer. NCB is on the lookout for him. Meanwhile, Anti-Narcotics Cell of Mumbai Police arrested another person in connection with the seizure of contraband worth Rs 5 crore in June. An ANC team of Bandra had seized 1.80kg of heroin worth Rs 3.24 crore and 1.100kg of MD worth Rs 2.2 crore and Rs65,000, and had arrested Nimai Sarkar alias Raja Sarkar and Salim Khan alias Salman.

---||Nagpur||No funds from MSTC, NMC begins Empress Van road work||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started work for the new road planned at Empress Van though it yet to receive funds from the Maharashtra State Textile Corporation (MSTC). Around Rs5 crore are required for the project. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari has announced the project would be completed before municipal elections slated in January next year. Leader of opposition in assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, and Tiwari along with slew of guests performed bhoomipuja of the road at the proposed site at Bajeria in Central Nagpur on Saturday. In his speech itself, Tiwari said MSTC was yet to give funds required for the road. Stating that works are done smoothly if people with similar mindset and principles are in the state government and civic body, Tiwari said, “MSTC handed over land after directives of the then CM Fadnavis but is delaying release of funds. Only after directive of Fadnavis, MSTC approved funds. I request Fadnavis to ensure release of funds,” he said. MSTC had got approval for the road as part of its industrial layout in 2005. It is not in city’s development plan, so it is not mandatory on the NMC to construct it. The MSTC is supposed to construct the road on its own. Talks for the road gained momentum after MSTC auctioned plot no. 1, 2 and 8 to Royal Sandesh Business Park LLP, Orange City Garment Park and Acharya Shree Vidyasagar Garment Vyapari Welfare Society, respectively, a couple of years ago. It was the responsibility of NMC to take over and develop open space and public utility (PU) land in the layout but it concentrated only on the road. In 2019, the NMC had issued tender to award contract for road’s construction. Following a series of stories in TOI, the civic chief had stalled the tender. The civic body took over the open space and PU land a few months ago and work order was issued for the road. Tiwari claimed NMC will not spend a single penny on the road. “ Bills of contractor will be cleared only after disbursement of money from the MSTC,” he said. Despite strong objections from activists including advocate Ankita Shah, the NMC cut 365 trees early this year for the road. “There is a wide road in front of Empress Mall just 20 metre from proposed new road. There is also another road on opposite side. It seems the NMC is constructing the road only to benefit companies that procured plots in the layout. Commercial projects on the plots will gain only if there is a road,” she said. Refuting the allegations, Tiwari said 15-metre wide road is mandatory in any industrial layout. The companies had applied with the NMC seeking user change from industrial to commercial. Residential and commercial complexes have already came up on a few plots. So, the layout is no more an industrial one. Tiwari said he had proposed the road in 2004. “This road has saved 164 houses in Bajeria. As per DP, NMC will have to construct road in the same area but in different place which needs demolition of 164 houses. After construction of this road, the DP road can be deleted,” he said. The new road is likely to cause congestion in front of Rajwada Palace as it will connect the road there without any proper plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-funds-from-mstc-nmc-begins-empress-van-road-work/articleshow/87069131.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Vijayawada||Covid reason? Tuberculosis hits 9 organs of Andhra Pradesh woman||VIJAYAWADA: In a rare case, an asymptomatic Covid-19 patient developed disseminated tuberculosis (TB) with as many as nine body parts infected with TB lesions. These included reproductive organs. This Covid-19-triggered disseminated TB case reported at a Hyderabad hospital is perhaps the first such incident during the pandemic in these parts. TB normally infects one organ, mostly lungs. If it infects multiple organs simultaneously, it is called disseminated tuberculosis or DTB. Generally, DTB cases are triggered by viruses like cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C and human herpes, which cause temporary or transient immunosuppression. But, no case of DTB caused by Covid-19 has so far been documented. Although, Covid-19 virus infecting multiple body parts has been reported this is the first case where it has facilitated the TB bacteria to spread to several organs. The young woman from Andhra Pradesh was admitted to a corporate hospital in Hyderabad with a complaint of pain in the neck and right hand. She and her family members did not have any Covid-19 symptoms. The antibody test revealed that she had the novel coronavirus in her body but without any symptoms. She was non-diabetic and immune-competent. She underwent two major spine surgeries and recovered despite nine of her body party infected by TB. Dr P Ranganadham, senior neurosurgeon, Sunshine Hospitals, Gachibowli, told STOI the case was unique as the patient was perfectly immunocompetent. A PET scan revealed multiple TB lesions including three spots in the spinal cord. The lungs, fallopian tubes, uterine cavity, brain and bones were also infected. “The obvious cause of disseminated TB could not be elucidated, but we hypothesise the role of transient immunosuppression leading to the dissemination of infection by changing the immunity to TB bacteria in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. “There were significant titres of Covid-19 antibodies in the patient in the absence of either Covid-19 affection (symptomatic) in her or her family members,” he said. Dr Ranganadham said the transient immunosuppression may have been caused by Covid-19 as antibodies for the pandemic virus were found in the patient. He said DTB may have spread by either progressive primary infection or reactivation of latent TB with subsequent spread. It could also be due to iatrogenic (drug side-effects) reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-reason-tb-hits-9-organs-of-woman/articleshow/87071105.cms||Syed Akbar

Police could do little as thousands of devotees wielding sticks and clubs clashed fiercely with one another during the procession at Mala Malleswara Swamy temple around midnight. It is believed that Lord Shiva killed two demons - Mani and Mallasura - by clobbering them with sticks. Vijayadasami is celebrated on a grand note at Devaragattu with Banni festival. It draws huge crowds even from the neighbouring states of Karnataka and Telangana. While the festival was a low-key affair last year due to Covid-19 restrictions, thousands of devotees from at least 11 villages gathered in large numbers at Devaragattu on Friday night. When the procession began, villagers from Neradiki, Neradiki Thanda and Kothapet, who were carrying idols of Swamy, clashed with the devotees from Ellarthy, Arikeri, Maddigeri, Nitranatta and Sulavai villages. The clash between two groups for the possession of the idol left at least a hundred people wounded. The injured were rushed to the nearby hospitals by the district administration and the local police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/many-injured-as-groups-relive-mythical-clash-at-banni-festival/articleshow/87071186.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Goa||Goa: Physical sessions for class IX-XII students likely post Diwali||PANAJI: As the directorate of education (DoE) has permitted schools to start offline classes for students from Class IX to XII, most schools with high enrollment are expected to begin conducting full-fledged physical sessions only post Diwali vacations. Because the instructions allowing offline exams for Class XI and XII came first, a majority of the higher secondary schools already have exams scheduled from Monday. For Class IX and X students too, online exams are presently in progress. School managements said that, besides the exam being on, the DoE instructions for offline classes have come at short notice and they need time to work out schedule for full-fledged classes. “We held a meeting with the teachers on Saturday and there it was discussed that we have a high enrolment of over 1,000 students. We need time to work out a pattern for the offline classes. The offline classes should also not disturb the online sessions for Class V to VIII. So after we work out an appropriate schedule, full-fledged classes will be held post Diwali vacations,” said Satyesh Kakodkar, manager of New Educational Institute, Curchorem. He said having classes for Class IX and X students in the offline mode for one or two hours may also disturb their ongoing exams, if there are any cases of Covid-19 infections. “We have to be careful as we are a high enrolment school. Students have been home for almost 20 months now, so we intend to make a gradual transition, and we plan to start with a mix of online and offline sessions first,” said Kakodkar. Rahul Deshpande, trustee of People’s High School, Panaji, too said that the institute is still in the process of putting in place a protocol for full-fledged offline classes. “For Class XII, offline exams will start from October 18 and for students of Class IX and X exams had already started and only two papers are left. Once the Class IX and X exams are over, we will first call them to school only to address any difficulties they have. Classes will be held in a blended mode at first and after Diwali it will be full-fledged classes,” Deshpande said. Ramchandra ‘Sudan’ Barve of Shri Kamaleshwar Higher Secondary School, Korgao, said that many schools, especially in the rural areas, summon Class X and XII students during Diwali vacations to provide them added teaching assistance in the run up to the public exams. He said that once the exams come to an end, any classes held during the vacations will be held in the offline mode, following Covid protocol. “The actual classes will start around the time Diwali vacations end. The government has taken the right decision in allowing offline classes. The decision is as per the representation and request to the chief minister made by higher secondary school principals’ forum,” said Barve, who has recently retired as the school principal and continues to be association with the institute. Dr K B Hedgewar High School, whose parents, teachers and students recently held a protest in Panaji demanding offline classes and exams, wasted no time. The school began its offline exams for Class X students from Saturday itself, just one day after the DoE circular was issued. “We started our offline exam for 120 students of Class X. As we are a large school, only 12 to 15 students were seated per classroom. Post the exams, we will start offline classes after Diwali vacations,” said headmaster Vilas Satarkar. In some rural schools in Bicholim and Canacona, institutes have already begun offline classes with parents’ written consent, as the students were unable to regularly log into online classes due to poor connectivity. “I have taken written consent from each and every parent. We have started offline classes more than a month ago, based on parents’ demand. In Gaondongrim, 50% students could not get connectivity. In Mashem, 25% students could not attend because of connectivity. We were following all Covid protocols by seating only child per bench and monitoring their temperature. When cases began going up in Canacona, we had also temporarily suspended the classes as a precaution,” said Prashant Naik, chairman, Nirakar Education Society, which manages Tudal High School, Gaondongrim, Nirakar High School, Canacona and SS Angle Higher Secondary School, Mashem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/physical-sessions-for-ix-xii-students-likely-post-diwali/articleshow/87071222.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Lucknow||UP: Barabanki lawyer’s teenage son killed for ransom, two held||LUCKNOW: A day after the body of a Barabanki lawyer’s teenage son, who was held hostage for 24 hours, was found in the village fields, police busted the kidnap plot and nabbed the masterminds. The accused, Satyendra Kumar and Nagendra Kumar, who were relatives of the lawyer, Boondilal Gautam, had demanded Rs 60lakh ransom for releasing his 17-year-old son from captivity. When Gautam failed to cough up the ransom within the deadline, the duo murdered their hostage and dumped his body. Electronic surveillance helped nabbed the captors late Friday. Kingpin Satyendra, a mason by profession, smashed the boy’s skull with an iron pan and his accomplice strangled him to death. The murder weapon, the boy’s cell phone and slippers and a motorcycle were seized by police. “The deceased, a resident of Barabanki’s Fatehabad locality, was missing since 2 pm on Thursday and his mobile phone was switched off by his captors after the last call by the boy’s elder brother, Anurag. The accused answered the call and sought Rs 60 lakh ransom posing as Rafique. The phone went dead after that,” said, superintendent of police, Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad. “The kidnap plan was chalked out on October 13, when Satyendra and Nagendra met at a marriage party and talked about the lawyer’s wealth and ways to extort by ransom,” said Prasad. The boy, who enrolled in an IAS coaching institute in Lucknow, was lured by Satyendra for an outing and took him to his rented house in Lakhpedabagh, where Nagendra too was present, police said. After a binge drinking session, the accused asked the boy to call his parents for money. When he denied, sparks flew. Satyendra hit the boy on his head with the iron pan and Nagendra then strangled him and dumped his body in a village drain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/barabanki-lawyers-teen-son-killed-for-ransom-two-held/articleshow/87073407.cms||---

---||Jaipur||After man’s hand transplant, kin may have to sell farm to meet cost||Mumbai: Rajasthan youngster, Jagdev Singh (22), is stable after undergoing hand transplant — the third in the city — that lasted 12 hours as against the usual 16-18 hours. The operation began around 8pm at Global Hospital, Parel, on Friday after the hands, which belonged to a 50-year-old man, were transferred from Ahmedabad Civil Hospital within two hours. While his father and brother-in-law were happy to hear about blood flowing through his newly transplanted arms, they were tied up with making arrangements to stay in the city for a year for the much-needed rehabilitation. “We may need to sell our farm if we are not able to raise adequate funds,” said Nirmal Dhillon, who is married to Jagdev’s sister. Hand transplants cost between Rs 22 lakh and Rs 26 lakh. However, the hospital has started a donation drive to help Jagdev’s family with finances.In January 2020, Jagdev was trying to fix the borewell in the family’s farm in Hanumangarh, close to the Pakistan border, when he came in contact with a high-tension wire. He was in a hospital in Rajasthan for a month before his arms and legs had to be amputated. “He was in second-year BA, but had to stop,” said Dhillon, adding that the youngster was a kabaddi champion. “His only aim after the accident was to see his own pair of hands. It has thankfully come true,” said Dhillon. Jagdev read about Global Hospital’s hand transplant programme on the internet and came down to Mumbai for the first time in August and registered for the transplant. The family got a call late on Thursday about the potential donor in Ahmedabad and rushed to Mumbai immediately. According to Dr Nilesh Satbhai, the plastic surgeon who carried about the transplant, Jagdev’s procedure was not only shorter than usual, but he needed six units of blood as against 20 needed during the city’s first hand transplant carried out in August 2020. “The surgery was challenging as both the limbs had different levels of amputation and we couldn’t do mirror activity on them,” he said. While his right arm was amputated below the elbow, the left is above the elbow. It will take another four to five days before the doctor can breathe easy. “We have to wait that long to check the survival of the transplanted organ,” said Dr Satbhai. Jagdev will stay in hospital for a month. Dhillon said that the whole family had kept the youngster motivated with words. “He has family support and believes in solving problems rather than dwell on them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-mans-hand-transplant-kin-may-have-to-sell-farm-to-meet-cost/articleshow/87073484.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rains likely in Rajasthan for three days from today||JAIPUR: With dipping temperatures, many places in eastern and western Rajasthan are likely to receive showers from Sunday for three days. This is mainly due to the prevailing active upper air cyclonic circulation, the Met reports said. Sikar remained coldest in the state where a minimum temperature of 13.2°C, the Met reports said. Due to the active upper air cyclonic circulation many places in the state witnessed cloudy conditions and rising humidity levels in the afternoon. On Sunday, there is a possibility of rainfall in Kota division, Jaipur division and some parts of the Udaipur division. People in Jaipur woke up to a comparatively chilly morning as a minimum temperature of 20.5°C was recorded. However, in the afternoon a maximum temperature of 35.2°C was recorded in the city. In Jaipur, people have started experiencing chilly weather especially in the late evening and early morning hours. “Within a week there is a possibility of further dip in the minimum temperatures in Jaipur. Also there is a possibility of mild showers in Jaipur in scattered form on Sunday,” said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. Many places in Shehkawati region including Sikar, Jhunjhunu and Churu have already stated experiencing winters. “It appears that within a week almost 70 % of the state is likely to witness winters,” said an officer. Sikar was followed by Chittorgarh where a minimum temperature of 14.6°C was recorded, Churu and Udaipur 15°C each, Ajmer and Pilani 16.5°C each, Bikaner and Sriganganagar 17.4°C each, Jodhpur 18°C, Kota and Jaisalmer 18.4°C each and at Barmer a minimum temperature of 20°C was recorded. In its forecast Jaipur Met office stated that mild to moderate showers will occur in some places of eastern and western Rajasthan for the next three days from Sunday. No heavy rainfall would be witnessed during the three-day period which will aggravate the upper air cyclonic circulation, said the forecast. Udaipur on Saturday witnessed a sudden dip in the temperature and rose up to a Chill morning as the temperature dipped by almost 6 degrees. The temperature started dipping from Friday. On Thursday the city recorded a minimum temperature of 21 degree which dropped to 15.6 degree on Friday. This was a sudden drop of 5.4 degrees on a single day. On Saturday morning the chill could be felt as the temperature dropped further. The sudden drop in the temperature is attributed to the clear sky in the past few days and early snowfall and rain in Kashmir region. The sudden drop however does not signify the early onset of winters. According to the experts the temperature is likely to rise further in the coming days because of the western disturbances in the Arabic ocean post Diwali. Along with the drop in minimum temperature, the maximum or day time temperature has been dipping too, but not as significantly as night time temperatures and with frequent fluctuations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/temp-dips-shower-likely-for-3-days-from-today/articleshow/87071249.cms||---

---||Goa||In touch with Kishor, open to all options: Vijai||Panaji: Confirming that his party is in touch with poll strategist Prashant Kishor and the I-PAC (Indian Political Action Committee), Goa Forward Party (GFP) president Vijai Sardesai that all options for the 2022 assembly elections are on the table. He said that Congress’ indecisiveness has prompted him to look at TMC as a strong and credible alternative against BJP. Sardesai said that TMC and I-PAC chose to enter Goa’s political battleground only because Congress failed to shoulder the role of the principal opposition party in the state. “I don’t know if a third front is possible, but an alternative of a single party is the way to go ahead,” he said. “TMC is a good alternative, it has a leader who is uncompromising, who is willing to take on BJP not only in press conferences, but on the ground too. So, we are weighing our options. I have met Prashant Kishor and not only me, but he has talked to our candidates too,” Sardesai told TOI. The former deputy chief minister, who has been calling for an alliance against BJP since January 2020, said that Congress has treated GFP as a “party that needs a prop” even though Congress could not keep its own flock together. He said that Congress has attempted to poach GFP’s candidates, while also encouraging multiple candidates in every constituency, which is a recipe for disappointment. “In constituencies where the writing is on the wall, they should create a consensus on one candidate. Instead, Congress is making the candidates jostle for the party ticket,” the GFP president said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-touch-with-kishor-open-to-all-options-vijai/articleshow/87071250.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Sand mining in Chapora river can resume in four zones||PANAJI: Legal mining can finally resume in four stretches of the Chapora river, after the Goa State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (Goa-SEIAA) approved the proposal at its meeting held on October 5. However, SEIAA has asked for further scientific studies to be carried out in the case of two other zones in the Chapora. Applications was received from the North Goa collector for six zones in the river for sand mining. “After considering the committee’s recommendation and scrutinising the application and documents submitted by project proponent. the authority decided to recommend a proposal for extraction of sand at Chapora river by traditional (manual) method only at zone 1, 2, 5 and 6,” Goa-SEIAA said at its meeting. To begin with, sand extraction in these four zones will take up only at 50% capacity for the first three years. The capacity thereafter will be decided after the three-year period ends. “Whereas, proposals pertaining to zones 3 (part 1 and part 2) and 4 may be referred back to the Goa State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) to conduct further scientific study in the matter,” Goa-SEIAA said. Taking note of a report by scientists of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa-SEAC – an advisory body to state on environment clearances – had earlier given the go-ahead to resume extraction at four locations in the Chapora river. However, the committee has laid down restrictions, including installing CCTV systems to monitor extraction. Under the Goa Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1985, permissions for sand extractions were granted on a yearly basis. But after the CRZ Notification 2011 was issued, granting of permissions for sand extraction was stopped from 2011-12 onwards. Two different committees under the two district collectors were constituted by the state environment department to grant permissions for sand extractions. In August 2013, some stretches of the Mandovi, Chapora and Tiracol rivers were identified for sand extraction. In 2017-18, 323 permits in North Goa and 11 in South Goa were either issued or renewed, and were valid till May 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sand-mining-in-chapora-river-can-resume-in-4-zones/articleshow/87073562.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Brothers who shaped Gujarati cinema over four decades||With the demise of Arvind Trivedi, popularly known as Lankesh, for his role of Ravan in the 1980’s television series ‘Ramayan’, a four-decade era of two pairs of brothers — Mahesh and Naresh Kanodia and Upendra and Arvind Trivedi — who came from the same region in Gujarat, trained on the theatre stage, forayed into the Gujarati film industry and shaped it, has come to an end. While Upendra Trivedi died in 2015, his younger brother Arvind Trivedi passed away on October 6 this year. Film musician and singer Mahesh Kanodia passed away on October 25, 2020 and two days later, his younger brother actor Naresh Kanodia breathed his last. "In a year, we lost three of the four artists who shaped Gujarati cinema since the 1970s. These duos did a commendable job bringing cinema to rural audiences. Gujarati cinema’s history goes back 80 years, 40 of which were ruled by these brothers," says actor Hiten Kumar.  Kumar said that Gujarati films, mostly black and white, made before the time of Upendra-Arvind and Mahesh-Naresh, had more urban backdrops. "Characters in these films were educated and from cities. The rural audience could not relate to themand their stories and stayed away from cinema. These two pairs came from rural areas and understood what the rural audience could relate to. They made films which appealed to rural viewers, who make up 85% of Gujarat," Hitenkumar said. The actor said there was no competition between these two pairs as they were of two different types. "While Upendra-Arvind were refined actors, Mahesh-Naresh were big entertainers. Mahesbhai brought peppy music to Gujarati films and Nareshbhai danced to those tunes. Gujarati cinemagoers for the first time got an actor who could dance and they loved it," he said. Kumar said they taught discipline to the younger generation of actors. "I learnt a lot from them. They were never late for shoots and were humble and well-behaved on set," Kumar said. "One thing that I learnt from my father (Naresh Kanodia) was discipline. He was never late to shoots. In fact, he would arrive earlier than scheduled. In those times, they didn’t have many facilities. They shot films in harsh weather without the comforts that are available nowadays," says actor Hitu Kanodia. Kanodia said while his father charmed audiences with his acting and dance skills, his uncle Mahesh brought tunes that were mixes of classical, sugam sangeet (simplified classical music) and folk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/brothers-who-shaped-gujarati-cinema-over-four-decades/articleshow/87071278.cms||Soumitra Trivedi
---||Goa||Goa: Ready for pre-poll talks with MGP, GFP, says BJP||PANAJI: A day after Union home minister Amit Shah exuded confidence that his party will form the next government in Goa on its own and nearly two years after chief minister Pramod Sawant unceremoniously dumped MGP and GFP from his government, BJP on Saturday made overtures to its former allies and invited them for pre-poll alliance talks. “We are open for discussion on pre-poll alliances with like-minded parties, because we want to maintain the essence of democracy, cultural and religious harmony, among other things,” BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said. If any of the political parties want to protect Goemkarponn, they can come to us for discussion,” he added. He said the preliminary discussion over alliance will take place “at our level”, while the final call on a pre-poll alliance will be taken by the parliamentary board. “Today, some elements are luring people with various benefits and there is chaos. If we want to protect Goemkarponn from this chaos, we have to come together. We want to have clean politics in Goa,” he said. In a direct hit at Trinamool Congress, without taking its name, Tanavade said: “There is posterbaazi going on in the state. To get the best understanding of democracy, one should visit West Bengal.” Tanavade said various parties are trying to take politics to a different level, and to tackle this, regional parties (MGP and GFP) have to unite with BJP. GFP general secretary (organisation) Durgadas Kamat said they were very clear that they want to ensure that a non-BJP government comes into office in 2022. “Our president Vijai Sardesai will take the lead to facilitate a political alternative to BJP. That will put to rest doubts prevailing among the public that opposition MLAs tend to split or are bought over by the ruling party, postpolls,” he said. TOI on Friday reported that MGP had firmly said they would not ally with BJP. GFP has already apologised to the people of the state for its postpoll alliance with BJP. On Wednesday, BJP’s Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis said the party has “not closed its doors to anyone” regarding alliances. “We are not a party with closed doors,” Fadnavis had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-ready-for-pre-poll-talks-with-mgp-gfp/articleshow/87071285.cms||Murari Shetye

He also said that he didn’t try to finish off Congress in Goa, but that its 10 MLAs joined BJP because they have faith in his leadership and that of PM Narendra Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-cong-will-be-main-oppn-party-in-polls/articleshow/87071261.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Ahead of Rabi season, farmers face fertilizer shortage||Jaisalmer: More than two lakh farmers in Jaisalmer and Barmer districts, who were reeling under power cuts ahead of the Rabi (winter) crop sowing season, are now having to deal with acute di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser shortage. Barmer and Jaisalmer districts had sent a demand of 10,000 metric tonnes of DAP each. However, Barmer has received 1,200 metric tonnes, while Jaisalmer has received 2,000 metric tonnes of DAP. Though the state government is advising farmers to use a mixture of urea-single super phosphate, the use of DAP is popular among them and they are not willing to make a shift. The farmers are forced to visit the Kray Vikray Cooperatives and gram seva sahkari samitis to procure DAP. When the DAP supply reached on Thursday, many farmers gathered outside the centres. Through lottery, each farmer was given 3 to 4 sacks of the feriliser. The Barmer farmers are worried as a target of 3.75 lakh hectares has been fixed for the season and the sowing will start by the last week of October. Meanwhile, Jaisalmer district collector Ashish Modi directed officials concerned in this regard. Barmer deputy director of agriculture, VS Solanki, said DAP compensated for phosphorus and nitrogen elements, but there was a scarcity in the entire state. In such a situation, farmers can replace DAP with single super phosphate, he said. "A bag of DAP costs Rs 1,200, while three bags of SSP and a bag of urea cost Rs 1,166. Using SSP will also fulfil sulphur necessities which will enhance the quality and quantity of yield in oilseed crops," he said. Sources said the country was dependent on China for DAP. The producers and country's supplier companies did not have agreement due to which the import is in abeyance. The Kray Vikray and gram seva sahkari samitis are not receiving even 20% of the DAP supplies. At present, preparations are on for sowing mustard. The sowing of Jeera, isabgol and other crops will start around Diwali. DAP is used prior to sowing of Rabi crops. The farmers are busy stocking DAP expecting unavailability. A meeting was held under the chairmanship of PM Modi in Jaisalmer to discuss issues related to supply, availability and distribution of seeds and fertilisers. In the meeting, directions were given to ensure that jodhpur rake point took sufficient fertilisers by contacting cooperative societies and private input suppliers from the rakes put out by NFL, Kribhco and IPL, so that farmers could get the fertilisers easily at the time of sowing. The PM also directed that in case of limited supply, there should not be black marketing of fertilisers. He said there should be a coordination among police, agriculture and cooperative departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ahead-of-rabi-season-farmers-face-fertilizer-shortage/articleshow/87071305.cms||---

The deceased woman has been identified as Asha Kavdati, a resident of Ramna locality in Narkhed town. Police said Asha had opened an RD account in Sahara Credit Cooperative Society Limited through an agent Dhananjay Madankar, a resident of Narkhed. Asha’s RD account got matured in 2020 last year, said constable Manoj Gadve from Narkhed police station. Gadve said that the deceased was very disappointed over alleged delay in getting the RD amount as she was debt ridden due to marriage of her daughter some months back. Asha had also visited the branch office of the cooperative bank in Katol town to know the status of receiving her invested amount. But in vain. On October 12 she again visited house of the agent--Madankar, who too failed to give satisfactory reply. After returning from Madankar’s house, a dejected Asha allegedly consumed poison and fell unconscious. Soon her younger son Ajay rushed her to a government hospital in Narkhed from where she was referred to Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital. However, she died on October 13, said the police. The Narkhed police have registered a case of accidental death and probing further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/woman-ends-life-over-alleged-delay-in-receiving-rd-amount/articleshow/87071263.cms||---

In fact, normal movement of the joint may be restored in 25%-30% of such patients with the partial knee replacement option that is available now. “The knee joint is made up of three compartments — inner, outer and the one with the kneecap. Quite often, especially in the Indian population, only the inner compartment gets affected and other two compartments are normal (Medial Arthritis). Even in these cases of extreme arthritis of one compartment (Medial Arthritis), traditionally total knee replacement is offered whereas we don’t need to do that. Fact of the matter is that in about 30% of cases where total knee replacement is done, the patient will benefit much more by change of just one compartment, i.e., partial or half or knee replacement,” said Dr Yash Gulati, arthroplastic surgeon and faculty, Indian Arthroplasty Association. Partial knee replacement is gaining popularity in India because of its advantages, Dr Gulati added. “It is patient-friendly, bone preserving, gives much better rehabilitation and with normal gait and walk. Patients can walk fast, play light sports and even sit cross-legged,” he said. City-based joint replacement surgeon who has undertaken more than 10,000 procedures — Dr Sandeep Kapoor — said that selection of the patient for partial knee replacement is no child’s play. “It is a good option for those who suffer problems at an early age, as in the 40s, due to medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or injury. But it may not serve much purpose in elderly patients. It leaves the option for revision surgery open among the young. It can be used in patients in whom involvement of just one of the three compartments is clearly indicated,” he added. Experts said that if all three compartments are involved, then, total knee replacement is the operation of choice and gives desired results in the majority of patients. On the cost of the procedure, Dr Gulati said that the expenditure in total and partial is same, as the price of the implant fixed by the Union government for both procedures is also the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/partial-knee-replacement-more-effective-in-the-young/articleshow/87073519.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Vijayawada||Free accommodation for government staff in Amaravati extended till April 2022||VIJAYAWADA: The state government has issued orders extending the time for free accommodation to its employees in Amaravati. Though the government had earlier decided to dispense with the free accommodation to its employees in Amaravati on November 1, 2021, it has now extended the time till April 2022, following the request of the employees. The state government provided free accommodation to secretariat employees, heads of departments, corporations, assembly and high court staff in 2016 after the capital was shifted to here from Hyderabad. The then government had provided transit accommodation to the employees as shifting of the capital was made when the 10 year tenure of the common capital was still in force. The government hired several flats in more than half-a-dozen apartment complexes paying monthly rental ranging from Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000. The government was also paying electricity, maintenance, cable, and drinking water bills in these flats for the benefit of the employees. However, having paid for so many months, the state government decided in September this year to dispense with the transit accommodation from November 1. The government had directed all its employees to make their own accommodation as the amount had become a burden on the exchequer. The employees, who initially accepted the government’s decision, then made a special request to continue the facility for one more year. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who reviewed the request of the AP secretariat employees, agreed to extend the facility for another six months. Principal secretary Praveen Prakash communicated the chief minister’s decision to the employees. However, he told the staff that a formal order would be issued by the competent authority later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/free-accommodation-for-government-staff-extended-till-april-22/articleshow/87071303.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Jaipur||Rebels press for ‘Sachin Pilot as Rajasthan CM’ amid Ashok Gehlot-brass talks||JAIPUR: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot held discussions on Rajasthan politics with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at the latter’s residence in New Delhi on Saturday night, after attending the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting earlier in the day. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal and AICC general secretary in-charge Rajasthan Ajay Maken were present at the meeting, which discussed the state’s political scenario in the light of demand by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot for a change of guard. Pilot reached Delhi while Gehlot reached Jaipur late Saturday night. Sources said the Congress senior leaders discussed cabinet expansion and reshuffle, state-level political appointments and expansion of the party state unit in Rajasthan. The changes were demanded by Pilot and his loyalists in August 2020, but, with a delay of more than a year, the demands have lost relevance. The Congress government has completed almost three years in power and the disgruntled group now seeks nothing less than the CM’s post for Pilot, said party sources. Read AlsoRajasthan: Sachin Pilot retorts to Ashok Gehlot for projecting himself next CMThe latest round of war of words between Gehlot and Pilot started on the Gandhi Jayanti when the former publicly said he would remain active in politics for at least 15-20 years more “even if that made some people unhappy”.Going by last month’s statements of Maken and revenue minister Harish Chaudhary, a close Rahul aide, the cabinet rejig is almost certain in the coming days as Gehlot has finally held discussions with the Congress central leadership. The deliberations were avoided for nearly a year citing covid and ill health of Gehlot. The cabinet changes may take place after Diwali, considering that the results of the assembly bypolls on two seats in the state would be out on November 2. There are already nine vacancies in Gehlot’s council of ministers and one more may get created as health minister Raghu Sharma was appointed AICC in-charge of poll-bound Gujarat last week. The party leadership would be attempting a reasonably proportionate representation for Gehlot and Pilot loyalists against the vacancies. Read AlsoNot leaving Rajasthan for next 50 years, says Sachin PilotEver since chief minister Ashok Gehlot alluded that he would retain the top post in state’s next Congress government as well, his former deputy Sachin Pilot has been retorting the claim.“It is too late for the cabinet rejig or political appointments now. If the Congress high command really wants to retain power in the state in the 2023 elections, it ought to push a change of guard now,” said a senior Pilot loyalist, who did not wish to be named. The Gehlot government would be completing three years on December 17. New ministers and heads of commissions or boards appointed now would effectively get just a year to work as 2023 would be an election year when administrative decisions would be subject to scrutiny.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-finally-discusses-cabinet-rejig-with-cong-leadership/articleshow/87073545.cms||Bhanupratap Singh

The campaign inspired several volunteers to come forward and adopt Indian breeds. The campaign was organised to help people realise that Indie dogs too can be amazing pets. The campaign promoted by Suri, urged people to adopt a stray dog instead of buying one from a pet shop. ‘Adopt, don’t shop’ was the theme of the campaign, which is internationally popular and is meant to raise awareness about the benefits of adopting rescued pets. It is promoted by a growing number of animal rights’ proponents. A street dog, Audio, was adopted by a family during Dussehra. The campaign ended with a ceremony wherein 50 volunteers, who had been instrumental in rescuing the stray animals, were felicitated. The volunteers raised awareness about the unconditional love from such pets. The campaign popularised the fact that for every one dog adopted from a rescue centre, another dog was taken in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mission-possible-campaign-concludes-inspires-pet-lovers-to-adopt/articleshow/87071356.cms||---

The father of the survivor is also accused of raping her. Police on Friday announced that they have apprehended SP district president, Tilak Yadav, BSP district president, Deepak Ahirwar and a junior engineer (JE), Mahendra Dubey. All the three were absconding and police teams were searching for them. All the three had fled to Mirzapur after escaping from Lalitpur and were trying to contact some lawyers. Police raided the hotel where they were staying and apprehended them. SP Lalitpur, Nikhil Pathak, said: “Our SOG team has arrested the three main accused from Mirzapur where they were hiding. In all seven accused have been caught so far and our teams are continuously raiding other hideouts to catch the rest of the named accused. We are also digging up their past criminal records.” On Tuesday, a 17-year-old girl had lodged a report against 28 persons including her father, and sitting party leaders of SP and BSP along with some close relatives for raping her for the past few years. These include the district president of SP and BSP and few other local leaders. On Thursday, the mother of the girl also lodged an FIR against her husband and in-laws labelling serious allegations of domestic violence and continuous torture along with sodomy of her son by the accused father.

---||Goa||Goa: CAG to probe GYA’s ‘illegal occupation’ of prime land||PANAJI: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has opened an inquiry to estimate the quantum of revenue loss to the state exchequer due to the Goa Yachting Association’s (GYA) “illegal occupation” of the river navigation department’s (RND) property at Dona Paula. A rough estimate by the government says that RND could have earned Rs 20.9 lakh per year as rent from the property. The principal accountant general, in an audit enquiry opened on September 30, said that the GYA is taking undue benefit of the RND’s property without paying rent. GYA runs a restaurant and bar along with a Goan boutique and its main office on this property. The CAG has also raised question marks over the intervention of the revenue minister in the 40-year-long dispute over the 250 sq m plot of land. The CAG’s office asked the RND department to assess the rental value of all properties rented out to private parties, including the land near the Dona Paula jetty. PWD undertook a rent assessment for the premises on behalf of RND and estimated the rent value of the land occupied by GYA at Rs 1.74 lakh per month. GYA president Siddharth Satardekar claimed that the association has helped train and prepare sailors, particularly Dayne and Katya Coelho, who represented India at the Asian Games 2018 at Jakarta. Pearl Colvalcar, another trainee with the GYA, won the silver medal in the laser radial class at the senior national sailing championship, and GYA is now trying to prepare sailors for the Asian Games 2022 and Paris Olympics 2024. On June 24, deputy collector Gurudas Desai rejected the GYA’s claim on the land, but immediately after that, on August 25, revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate stayed Desai’s order, which would have led to GYA’s eviction. The CAG, in its audit enquiry, states that a revenue minister does not have the jurisdiction to try and entertain applications after the deputy collector passes an order and after the administrative tribunal has dismissed an appeal. “The administrative tribunal is the highest court under the land revenue code, and only the high court has jurisdiction to entertain such an application for challenging the administrative tribunal,” said an administrative officer from the office of the principal accountant general. The observation is not directed against Monserrate’s recent decision but holds weight. In November 1995, the then revenue minister stayed an order passed by the deputy collector in September 1989, where RND was adjudged as the rightful owner of the land. The CAG said that GYA’s act of filing a review petition before the revenue minister in 1995 “was illegal, void and amounts to contempt of the (administrative) tribunal”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cag-to-probe-gyas-illegal-occupation-of-prime-land/articleshow/87071313.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Claim on Savarkar bid to divert focus from key issues, says Nana Patole||Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Nana Patole joined Opposition parties and historians in slamming Union defence minister Rajnath Singh for his statements on Vinayak Savarkar. Patole said Singh was trying to divert attention from more important issues like inflation, unemployment, farmers’ demands and threat to national security from neighbouring countries. Patole stated that China was preparing for war against India and sought to imply that Singh should be focusing on that. Patole said, “Savarkar had sought pardon from the British government in 1911, and for that he used to get Rs60 as pension. That time Gandhi was not even in India. He was in South Africa fighting against the colonial regime there and returned only in 1915.” Patole was addressing media at the airport in Nagpur on Friday. Continuing his tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, the former assembly speaker sarcastically said that both, along with Singh, “must have received emails or a mobile message from Savarkar in this regard”. “Such (misleading) statements are expected from Modi and Shah, who want to change the nation’s history. People have started to ignore them, but such statements coming from a very senior minister like Singh are baffling. How did Singh learn about Savarkar acting on Gandhi’s advice when there was no mobile, Internet, digital camera or fax during that period?” he said. On Opposition’s charge that Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had released a pittance in name of compensation to farmers who suffered due to incessant rain and drought, the Sakoli MLA said they had done their best with limited financial resources. Citing Disaster Management Act, 2005, Patole said the Central government had to provide aid to affected farmers. “But, as all know, BJP-led NDA government has often meted out partial treatment to Maharashtra.” “BJP leaders in the state are often criticising the three-party coalition government over inadequate compensation to farmers. They should ideally divert their energy and efforts in bringing funds from the Centre to help aggrieved farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-claim-on-savarkar-bid-to-divert-focus-from-key-issues-says-patole/articleshow/87073569.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The Singhu and Tikri borders have turned into areas of heinous crimes with murder, beatings, looting and disgracing women, he said, adding that every time a crime is committed, the union leaders immediately distance themselves from it. The recent brutal murder of a Scheduled Caste man from Tarn Taran district is a prime example, as the leaders have distanced themselves from Nihangs, said Sharma. The BJP leader said this is a democracy and the law of the country cannot be taken into hands by people who further their political ambitions. “The people have suffered immensely for a year, as this agitation has created huge hurdles in their daily lives. BJP leaders and workers have been subjected to harassment and attempts to physically harm them are numerous,” he added. tnn Attacking the Congress government in Punjab, Sharma said the law and order of the state is in shambles, but the chief minister is more concerned to travel to other states in protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-leaders-oppn-parties-holding-nation-to-ransom/articleshow/87073556.cms||---

After holding the sermons online last year owing to pandemic norms, the masses this year will be held in the physical mode. While the outdoor seating arrangements usually can accommodate roughly 10,000 people, only 50% of the devotees will be allowed inside in a bid to ensure that there is social distancing between attendees in the church premises, said Fr Patricio Fernandes, rector of the Basilica of Bom Jesus, Old Goa. “Only those wearing masks will be permitted inside and they will be encouraged to sanitise themselves,” he said. Earlier, back to back novenas were held in a day to accommodate devotees that attended the prayers from distant areas of Goa. However, the basilica this year may make changes to the manner in which the entire process is orchestrated. “Things are different now and we will have to adapt to the new normal. Besides the pandemic, we will also have to take care of the postmonsoon management of the premises by trimming branches and cleaning up,” he said. Even the stalls lined outside the church will be placed distantly to ensure safety. Preparations of the feast day mass – on December 3 – are also being taken up, SOPs for which will be formulated soon. “We are yet to take a decision on the main celebrant. There are a few more meetings yet to take place. This has been a very tough year for Goans since many people have lost their loved ones. We will pray to the ‘Goencho Saib’ to protect us and our loved ones,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/masks-sanitisers-distancing-must-at-old-goa-novenas/articleshow/87071414.cms||---
---||Delhi||Winter knocking, Delhi air turns ‘poor’||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality entered the “poor” category on Saturday, with the AQI touching 284, the highest so far this winter season. Track the pollution level in your cityThe overall AQI of the capital was 198 on Friday. After the wind speed dropped to almost nil, a “haze” also appeared over the city during the afternoon. However, 18 monitoring stations recorded “very poor” air quality on Saturday evening. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said fire counts were gradually increasing and the share of stubble burning to PM2.5 was 14%. CPCB’s central control room data showed that 24-hour average PM10 concentration for Delhi-NCR was 283.6 micrograms per cubic metre at 7 pm as against the standard 100 micrograms per cubic metre. The 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration was 143.2 micrograms per cubic metre at 7 pm. The standard for PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre. Experts said stubble burning and meteorological factors played a key role in deterioration of air quality. Despite the ban, firecrackers were burned in a few parts of the city on Friday on Dussehra. SAFAR said, “PM2.5 has returned as the lead pollutant in Delhi’s air. Favourable meteorological conditions led to intrusion of stubble burning-related air mass. With 1,572 effective fire counts as per SAFAR harmonised methodology, which includes data of two ISRO satellites, the stubble burning contribution in Delhi’s air has suddenly increased to 14%. Fire counts are gradually increasing and wind direction is favourable and coming from north-west direction at transport level (900 mb) for intrusion.” V K Soni, head, environment and research centre, India Meteorological Department, said, “The fire counts in Punjab, Haryana and Pakistan are on the rise and the current wind direction is favourable for transport of pollutants from biomass burning to Delhi. Calm wind was recorded during the night and the wind speed again dipped to nil during the afternoon and evening, affecting dispersion of pollutants.” Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “With the winter conditions setting in, pollution buildup is going to rise. Under these circumstances, polluting activities like crackers or any form of open burning that will impact air quality require strong vigilance and early action.” As the Met department has predicted north-westerly winds to change to easterly on Saturday night and light to moderate rain on Sunday, the air quality is expected to improve. Rain helps in washing out the pollutants. SAFAR said, “AQI will remain in the ‘poor’ on Sunday but thereafter it is likely to be ‘moderate’ for the next three days.” While an AQI reading of 50 or below is classified as “good”, readings between 51 and 100 fall in the “satisfactory” category and those between 101 and 200 are classified as “moderate”. “Poor” air ranges from 201 to 300, “very poor” from 301 to 400 and “severe” from 401 to 500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/winter-knocking-delhi-air-turns-poor/articleshow/87074092.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Goa||Goa: After 58 years, martyr’s son gets to visit dad’s memorial in Arunachal Pradesh||COLVA: In November 1963, soon after the Indo-China 1962 war, Major Edward Diego Fernandez from Anjuna of The Corps of Engineers was killed in a helicopter crash near the Chinese border at the age of 35 years, leaving behind his wife Norma and three little children – Franco,4, Agnello, 3, and daughter Rita, 11 months. The incident took place during the construction of an airfield for the Air Force in the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA), now Arunachal Pradesh. Franco himself a civil engineer, who retired as PWD executive engineer in 2019, recalls that the army had at that time (after his father died) sent his family a photograph of the memorial constructed by them in memory of his father and two others who died along with him in the crash, kindling in him as a little boy a wish to see it. Meanwhile, his mother passed away in 2018. He tried at every given opportunity to get a clue of the whereabouts of his father’s memorial. His wish started materializing in July this year when his cousin Farah, married to Brigadier Sumer D’Cunha from Curtorim, now posted at Guwahati – Assam, mentioned that she and her husband visited Arunachal Pradesh. Farah’s dad Major General Eustace Fernandez, the youngest brother of late Major Edward was in the Army too. He was killed in Kashmir in 1994 just three days before being elevated as Lt General to take over as the Director-General of Military Intelligence. Farah informed that she remembered her dad and her uncle Edward as they were both posted in the area during their service in the army. Seeing a ray of hope in fulfilling his dream, Franco claims that he sent her the picture of the memorial. Brigadier D’Cunha immediately networked his colleagues and asked them to do the needful. Within two days the army located the memorial in the midst of a thick vegetation. Franco reveals that the army informed him that the said airfield is now cut by the River Brahmaputra (known as River Siang in Arunachal Pradesh) and the area is handed over to civilians. One side of the airfield is cultivated by locals while the other side where the memorial is located is covered with thick vegetation. “I immediately requested the Army officials to allow me to visit the place and pay respects to my dad and they readily agreed.” It was planned during the Ganesh Chaturthi holidays this September and army officials made all the arrangements for our visit and stay. “On September 8, accompanied by my son Edward (named after Major Edward), flew out of Goa to Dibrugarh via Guwahati. The next morning on landing, a young Major received us at the airport and drove us to Likabali where the General Officer Commanding Major General Rajiv Ghai along with other officers hosted lunch for us. After lunch, the Major and his men drove us to Rayang where we spent the night as it was too late to proceed to Yinkiyong, the place where the memorial is located.” On September 10 morning, they reached Yinkiyong where soldiers had arranged a small but solemn ceremony with wreaths for us to be placed on the memorial, he informed. “While paying respects to my dad, the emotions overwhelmed me, and I broke down.” The Major was so supportive and involved that he urged us to spend as much time possible since it has been 58 years. The soldiers described the lay of the land showing how The River Siang has cut through the airfield.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-58-years-martyrs-son-gets-to-visit-dads-memorial-in-arunachal/articleshow/87071374.cms||Nisser Dias
---||Lucknow||Shaping robust framework for a water-sensitive policy||The Times Water Conclave, organised by the Times of India Group, brought policy-makers, community leaders, naturalists, technical experts and champions on a common platform to brainstorm on various facets of water conservation. The shared vision was to make UP a water positive state. The event held in Varanasi on October 6 was marked by the presentation of status reports, situation analysis, success stories and models for saving, reviving and rejuvenating water bodies in the state. The event, which was attended by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, cabinet minister for water resources and Jal Shakti Mahendra Singh, his deputy Dinesh Khatik and other dignitaries, concluded with a run through by VK Madhavan, head of Wateraid India – the knowledge partner for the initiative. The key takeaways from the event are: Declare rivers, ponds & wetlands shared legacyDuring the event, experts said rivers and ponds are a shared legacy of the people who reside along it. The inhabitants need to be sensitised towards this and its importance on the overall quality of life. For instance, the importance of fresh air and oxygen pockets in polluted cities can be driven to make people understand the need of a park, pond or wetland in the neighbourhood. Ganga, the lifeline and fate line of IndiaStating that Ganga is the lifeline and fate line of northern India and an identity of Indians across the world, experts said collaborative steps are needed to save the divine river and its biodiversity. They said while governments at the Centre and in the state are implementing a well-planned strategy to check pollution in the river and its tributaries, any support from the community is most welcome. Political leadership a game-changerA committed political leadership can turn programmes into campaigns and change the approach with which the same government machinery deals with schemes. The movement towards achievement of targets is accelerated and the ripple effect on stakeholders and community is fuelled with minimal efforts. The conclusion that UP has done a lot for water conservation was unanimous. Water policy: The iron frameworkUP’s policy on water conservation and its optimal utilisation is in its final stages. Experts said the draft has been formulated through a consultative process which involved brainstorming and deliberations from domain experts in the presence of government functionaries. The policy is set to be promulgated and experts are looking forward to it. Champions uphold the message in communityWater being an essential element of life cannot be claimed by a single entity, not even by the government. Its conservation must be a team effort with champions (seven of whom were felicitated during the conclave) advocating the cause wherever they can. Experts believed that champions are harbingers of the change that is targeted through official programmes. Community sustains models of changePresence of champions committed to the cause of water conservation can have a trickle-down effect in the community. Once people start reaping the benefits of the intervention, the community embraces it as a way of life which brings sustainability to the idea or model of change. System facilitates and rechargesThe active involvement of official and administrative framework is crucial to any programme but experience from the field has indicated that in case of causes like water conservation, the administrative machinery should play the role of a facilitator and a reinforcer. Community must lead while the system should follow instead of officers leading and community following. This ensures that the idea doesn’t fizzle out upon change of guards in the district or state. Groundwater-sensitive urban planningConsidering the fact that Uttar Pradesh is witnessing one of the fastest rates of urbanisation in the country, there is a need to re-imagine cities. Instead of designing them to repel water out of the cities, the urban planners and developers must adopt a water-sensitive approach to design and planning.  The basic building plan must include systems to limit exploitation of groundwater and guarantee its recharge through proper arrangements to store and conserve rainwater for future use and health of aquifers. It must include systems that allow recycle and reuse of grey water to check wastage/overuse of clean water and plan for its treatment before being released into the environment. Inter-departmental coordinationThe official framework may have challenges of different verticals of water conservation falling under different departments but the system must bring diverse stakeholders on a common plane for the larger cause. Incentives to aid transitionExperts said while there are legislations that make measures for conservation of water mandatory, as in the case of groundwater, there is a need to incentivise it in a way that encourages people and groups to adopt it and embrace the public-interest way of seeing things.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shaping-robust-framework-for-a-water-sensitive-policy/articleshow/87073575.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Vijayawada||Odisha liquor seeps into north Andhra Pradesh districts||VISAKHAPATNAM: Despite regular checks at various locations, the flow of liquor from Odisha into parts of north Andhra Pradesh comprising Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, and Srikakulam districts continues.  The enforcement teams are now chalking out new strategies to curb the menace. Recently, the officials of the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) seized over 1,700 bottles of liquor made in Odisha and arrested six people in Vizag city. The gang stored the non-duty paid liquor (NDPL) at KRM colony in the city. Investigation revealed that the gang, led by B Giri, procured NDPL from one Sahu in Berhampur in Odisha. The other day, the SEB officials seized over Rs 1 lakh worth Odisha origin NDPL at Poram village under Pusapatirega mandal in Vizianagaram district. A four-member gang procured the NDPL from Odisha and tried to sell them at high prices during the Dasara festival season. Taking advantage of the shortage of popular brands of beers and liquor in north Andhra Pradesh, some gangs are exploring new ways to procure various brands from Odisha and sell them in state. The inflow of Odisha-made liquor has been increasing in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts. SEB officials said some gangs are involved in transporting the NDPL from Odisha to Andhra Pradesh and are making good profits. They continue their illegal trade despite arrest of bootleggers and seizures and destruction of liquor. The SEB and the police personnel have been seizing at least 100 to 150 Odisha-origin liquor bottles in north Andhra Pradesh a week. But this is only the tip of the iceberg as a majority of cases go undetected in the region. “We are chalking out plans to increase surprise checks at some strategic locations to seize NDPL and nab the members involved in the illegal trade,” said a senior officer with SEB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/odisha-liquor-seeps-into-north-ap-dists/articleshow/87071392.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Goa||Goa: Senior citizen sisters murdered in Ponda||PANAJI: Two sisters, both senior citizens, were murdered by unidentified assailants who gained entry into a flat on the first floor of Kamat Residency, Ponda, where the siblings were staying. The deceased were identified as Mangala Tulshidas Kamat, 76, and Jeevan Venkatesh Kamat, 68. Police said that they are examining all angles to unearth the motive of the killings and establish the identities of the assailants. Police sources said that the incident came to light when one of Mangala’s sons, who lives on the second floor of the same building with his family, went to visit his mother as was his routine. The two women were found lying in a pool of blood, leading police to surmise that a heavy object was used to kill them. Ponda police, who are investigating the case, said that the postmortem will reveal the cause of the deaths. Sources said that the two sisters lived together in the flat for over 20 years. The Kamat sisters are originally from Dhavali, Ponda. South Goa SP Pankaj Kumar Singh, who visited the crime scene, said that there were no signs of any “forced entry” into the flat by the accused. This has led police to suspect that the accused were known to the deceased. “We are exploring and examining the case from all angles, including if there was any family dispute. We are examining everybody — the deceased’s family members, relatives, friends and acquaintances,” Singh said. Ponda PI Mohan Gaude said that the motive of the crime was murder. The accused did not touch any valuables inside the flat, including the gold worn by the deceased. The police summoned the services of the dog squad and forensic experts. The sniffer dogs followed the trail to a starred hotel about 50m away and returned. However, the forensic team was investigating at the crime scene until late evening. The area known as ‘supermarket’ is known to be quite busy, and shopkeepers around the building expressed surprise as to how the assailants dared commit the crime. The building also has lodging facilities, and people visit the building continuously. The two bodies have been sent for preservation to the mortuary of Goa Medical College and Hospital, Bambolim, for autopsies likely to be conducted on Sunday. Police have also obtained video footage from surveillance cameras installed at nearby business establishments in a bid to obtain leads in the case. Earlier this year, on March 8, two senior citizens — Miguel Miranda, 62, and his mother-in-law, Catarina Pinto, 85 — were brutally killed by assailants in their house at Ambaji, Fatorda. Police solved the case with the arrest of three migrant labourers who lived in a room behind Miranda’s house. They were nabbed at Dadar, Mumbai, with the help of Mumbai police just as they were preparing to board a train to Jharkhand. Goa’s proportion of senior citizens is among the highest in India, with 11.6% of the population over 60. Police maintain that they have various measures put in place to ensure the safety and security of the state’s elderly population. Singh had earlier told TOI that police maintain a record of elderly people staying alone with the help of beat police personnel and citizen welfare groups. As per the system, every week, beat police personnel visit these senior citizens to check on their well-being, and in certain cases, beat police also visit the elderly who are living with their families. The Goa Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Rules, 2009, mandates that each police station maintain an up-to-date list of senior citizens living by themselves, where a police station representative along with a social worker or volunteer visit them at “regular intervals of at least once a month”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-senior-citizen-sisters-murdered-in-ponda/articleshow/87071371.cms||---

The Niti Aayog is a public policy think tank of the central government headed by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. DR Mehta, founder and chief patron of BMVSS, said that for the last 10 days, BMVSS in collaboration with the Indian Army had conducted six on-the-spot limb fitment camps at Kupwara, Uri and Badgam in Kashmir valley, all known for high security risks and provided artificial limbs to a thousand people. "BMVSS will hold similar camps in Sukhma and other dangerous Naxal-affected areas of Chhattisgarh," said Mehta. He apprised the deputy chairman of the Niti Aayog of about 20 lakh people, who had been rehabilitated by providing artificial limbs, callipers and other aids in India and abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/niti-aayog-official-visits-jaipur-foot/articleshow/87071416.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||No plotting angle found in many sacrilege cases||Patiala: In many recent cases of sacrilege, police are yet to establish any conspiracy angle and catch the actual plotters. Many of the accused have turned out to deranged or dissociated with a dera to which complainants had linked them. They did arrest a physically and mentally challenged cancer patient for attempted desecration at Dittupur Jattan village gurdwara in Patiala district on October 2 after CCTV caught him trying to remove Rumala Sahib (the cloth over Guru Granth Sahib). The gurdwara staff accused this man, Jagdeep Singh (45), also of picking up a sword kept near Guru Granth Sahib when they tried to stop him. Cops said he was under treatment in Ludhiana for mental illness and cancer, but they had booked him on the complaint of a gurdwara committee member, even though they had found no conspiracy angle. On September 13, Paramjeet Singh of Ludhiana violated sanctity of Takht Kesgarh Sahib in Ropar district by smoking on its premises. Devotees and staff handed him over to police, who added Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) to the FIR registered under the IPC after pressure from the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). Akal Takht jathedar has accused Paramjeet of being linked with Dera Sacha Sauda, claiming his father was not only on dera’s core committee but also sending him money from the US since 2013. Police, however, found him to be a drug addict under treatment for schizophrenia. Ropar SSP Viveksheel Soni said: "So far, we have not found any conspiracy angle... but we’ll not reach any conclusion before the brain mapping and narco tests, for which we have requested the court." Last October, Fatehgarh Sahib police had booked a 20-year-old man under UAPA for hurting religious sentiments in Jallah and Tarkhan Majra villages, where Sikh protesters had, later, smashed his car. On June 25, a woman of Jaulian village in Sangrur district was arrested based on CCTV evidence that she set a Bir of Guru Granth Sahib on fire in the gurdwara. Kulwant Singh of the Jaulian gurdwara committee said police had dismissed the woman as unstable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-plotting-angle-found-in-many-sacrilege-cases/articleshow/87073635.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Pune||Pune: Survey unvaccinated people, says PCMC mayor||Pune: With only a few thousand adult citizens remaining to get their first Covid-19 jab, Pimpri Chinchwad mayor Usha Dhore has asked the civic body’s task force to conduct a door-to-door survey to identify such people. At a recent meeting with the task force members of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, the mayor said students, construction workers and residents from the slum areas and a few housing societies needed to be vaccinated on priority to emsure 100% vaccination coverage in the twin towns. Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) additional commissioner Vikas Dhakane said the civic body had provided the health department with additional manpower and transportation services to speed up the vaccination drive. On the ongoing ‘Mission kavach kundal’ in the district, Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We got very little time to plan and execute this special vaccination drive. But nonetheless we are happy with the current progress of vaccination. The district received around four lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin from Monday. This will give the necessary push to the routine vaccination drive.” A health official said the reason for the slowdown in the daily vaccination was the festive season and the saturation point in the programme. “We have already achieved around 90% vaccination with the first jab, which could be the tipping point for the drive,” said the official. Of the 83.44 lakh beneficiaries in Pune district, 39 lakh beneficiaries are in rural areas, 26.45 lakh beneficiaries are in the Pune Municipal Corporation area and 17.6 lakh in the PCMC region. As part of the state’s ‘Mission kavach kundal’, the government is making a major push to vaccinate maximum citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/survey-unvaccinated-people-says-pcmc-mayor/articleshow/87071450.cms||---

Reacting to certain MLAs demanding BJP tickets for their spouses, Sawant said, “Winnability would be the criteria for selection of candidates, and the ticket will be decided by the parliamentary board”. Asked whether BJP would ally with MGP, the chief minister said that the central leadership would take a decision on the alliance issue, but in the interest of the state. He also said that anti-incumbency is not a concern for him, as the people have seen him working hard during the Covid pandemic and cyclone Tauktae even during a financial crisis. When asked how he would tackle the issue of senior BJP candidates demanding the party ticket when MGP has sitting MLAs, Sawant said that when BJP forms the government, there are a lot of opportunities at the state as well as central level. He said that recently, senior BJP functionary Rajendra Arlekar was appointed governor of Himachal Pradesh. “We will give justice to all BJP karyakartas,” he said. Sawant also said that he would invite suggestions from the public to solve their issues. “In my next tenure, I will resolve all the problems faced by the public,” he said. He reiterated that BJP would get 22+ seats and form the next government in Goa. He also said that the people of the state are with BJP, and that in 2022, many big development projects, including the Mopa airport, would be inaugurated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-two-from-same-family-will-get-tkt-party-to-decide/articleshow/87071448.cms||---

This has clearly shown that the government has failed to act on illegal bull trawling since last two years in the territorial waters of Goa. Rodrigues had joined the BJP under the pretext of development, but today it looks like he and his government are all out to finish the fishing community of Goa,” he said. He further voiced his concern over the security threat posed by bull trawling activities in the state as he said that vessels could be carrying illegal goods like drugs, weapons, etc. Devsurabhee Yaduvanshi, State Leadership Development Coordinator of All India Unorganised Workers Congress, accused the state government of being “hell bent on destroying the livelihoods of Goan fishermen.” “They have played a sick joke by providing Rs 5,000 as a one-time Covid settlement to the unorganised sector, and then they have allowed Malpe boats to fish in our territorial waters, effectively destroying our fishermen's chance of earning a decent livelihood,” she said. Congress has demanded strict action against the violators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-slams-fisheries-mantri-for-bull-trawling/articleshow/87073738.cms||---

Sampla has asked Punjab’s officiating DGP, Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, and Tarn Taran SSP Harvinder Singh Virk to ensure cremation of the deceased with religious rites and without any protests. Representatives of SC organisations condemned the heinous crime and demanded immediate arrest of the culprits. “Lakhbir Singh was murdered with brutality and the victim’s family should be brought to justice as soon as possible,” the NGOs, who are fighting for the rights of scheduled castes, appealed to Sampla. These representatives also requested Sampla to take strict legal action against the culprits in this case, and to press charges of SC Act against them. “SKM, farmer leaders and activists, who are sitting on the Singhu border, must be held responsible of this brutal incident as the man was killed despite their high-level security,” said these SC organisations’ members. These SC organisations were: Bhartiya Baudh Sangh, Rashtriya Bhantu Sansi Samaj, Shri Guru Ravidas Vishwa Mahapeeth (Delhi Province), Jai Baba Rama Peer Janmotsav Committee, National Scheduled Caste Alliance, Delhi Prantiya Raigar Panchayat and Valmiki Mahapanchayat. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ensure-justice-in-singhu-lynching-case-sc-groups-to-sampla/articleshow/87073658.cms||---
---||Thane||Thane: Family of trucker killed in mishap to get Rs 15.8 lakh||THANE: The kin of a tipper truck driver from Karnataka, who was killed in a freak accident while at work in Panvel in 2019, was awarded a compensation of Rs 15.8 lakh by the Thane Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT). The claimants the aged parents and four teenaged kids of the deceased man, Somaraya Mahur pleaded that the untimely death of the family’s breadwinner had cast a shadow of gloom over them. Mahur was a native of Kakkalameli in the Vijayapur district of Karnataka. The claimants stated that on May 20, 2019, around 2.30 pm, Mahur had parked his tipper truck in a row at a stone crusher site in Bombaipada, Panvel, while waiting for his next load of grit. In the meantime, another tipper reversed at high speed and hit him. He was rushed to the hospital, where he died during treatment on the same day. Panvel city police station booked the other driver for the offence. The family said that Mahur was 38 years old at the time, and drew a salary of Rs 25,000 per month. The counsel for the insurance company, advocate KV Poojari, contested the claim on various grounds. MACT member R N Rokade, after hearing both sides, asked the owner of the tipper truck and the private insurance company to jointly pay the compensation amount to the family, along with 8% interest from the date of filing of the compensation claim. The order stated: “At present, minor applicants are residing with their grandparents. It is bounden duty of the Tribunal to protect the interest of minor applicants.

---||Delhi||Twin trouble: Tomato, onion costlier in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The prices of vegetables like tomato and onion have seen a steep hike with the former selling for Rs 80-90 per kg in the retail market and the latter for Rs 50-60 per kg due to crop damages in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and some other states. Apart from crop damages, surging fuel prices have also pushed up the cost of the staples that are brought to the capital from remote states. Adil Khan, chairman of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee, Azadpur, said that the transportation cost of vegetables from different states to Delhi had increased by up to 18% due to a steep hike in diesel prices over the past few months. “Transporters are charging more and the traders do not have any other option but to sell the products at higher rates to adjust the hiked transportation costs,” said Khan. “Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states witnessed heavy rain during monsoon, which damaged the tomato crops as well as vegetables in the fields. It caused a shortage of supply while the demands remained the same,” said a trader. On October 16, the wholesale price of tomatoes was Rs 29.5 per kg in Azadpur market. On September 16, the wholesale price of tomatoes was just Rs 13.5 per kg in the same market. People, however, can expect relief in the prices from next month. “The new crops are likely to be available in the market from November, which will lead to a decline in the prices of tomatoes as well as onions,” said Khan. Onion is selling at Rs 25-35 per kg in the wholesale market while it is retailing at Rs 50-60 per kg. Delhi receives onions from Nasik, Rajasthan, various places of Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat. Srikant Mishra of Azadpur Union Traders’ Association said that while the prices of tomatoes were likely to cool off soon, the prices of onions could stay high for some time. Across the capital as well as in NCR towns, good quality tomatoes’ prices varied from Rs 80-90 per kg in the retail market on Saturday. “Tomato prices have witnessed a steep hike in the last fortnight. By September 15, we sold tomatoes at Rs 20-30 per kg,” said Mohammed Imran, a vegetable vendor near Ramlila Maidan. Umesh Kumar, another vendor who runs a stall in Mayur Vihar, said the sale of tomatoes had decreased over the last two weeks due to the price hike. “I used to sell 30-40 kg tomatoes per day before October, but now, the demands have come down and I hardly manage to sell 20-30 kg tomatoes in a day,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/twin-trouble-tomato-onion-costlier-in-city/articleshow/87074115.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||SDMC plans 2 plants to utilise its waste||NEW DELHI: To ensure proper utilisation of plastic and wet municipal waste generated from its areas, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has decided to set up a compressed biogas plant and a plastic waste processing facility plant as part of a CSR activity at two different sites. It has allocated nearly 1,500 sqm land free of cost at Hastsal for setting up an integrated compressed biogas plant for utilising wet municipal waste and around 2,000 sq metre area at Madipur for setting up a plastic recycle plant. The proposals have received approval in the standing committee meeting recently. “We had done an inspection of the site before allocating land. While we will bear no cost on the project, the concessionaires will need to tie up with the contractor collecting waste from SDMC areas for getting wet waste or plastic for their plants. At the plastic waste facility, granules will be produced,” said Col. BK Oberoi, standing committee chairman, SDMC. For implementing the biogas plant project, the civic body had signed an MoU with IGL last month, which would help in producing compressed biogas by utilising organic waste with primary feedstock like municipal solid waste and horticulture waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-plans-2-plants-to-utilise-its-waste/articleshow/87074118.cms||Vibha Sharma

Nashik city recorded 16.3 degrees celsius, while the minimum in Aurangabad was 18.4 degrees celsius. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the minimum temperature recorded in Nashik city was second only to Mahabaleshwar that recorded 15.8 degrees celsius. According to KS Hosalikar, the head of climate research and services, Pune, temperatures across the state have dropped since the withdrawal of the monsoon. However, the IMD also has warned of rainfall in some areas of the Nashik district. “Partially cloudy with one of two spells of rain and thundershower,” read the warning issued by IMD, Pune, for Sunday. Thereafter, the skies are likely to remain partly cloudy. “The minimum temperature in Nashik had been between 20 and 25 degrees since the summer ended. The new low suggests the possibility of the temperature remaining at these levels till October 22,” the officials of the IMD, Pune, said. The minimum temperature was 3 degrees below normal. It may be noted that last year, the mercury had dropped to these levels by October 23 and the low measured in that month was 14.1 degrees celsius. “The morning was refreshing. There was that slight nip in the air when outdoors and it was warm indoors. It was lovely weather,” said Shaunak Pethe, a local businessman. The bright sun, however, increased the maximum temperature to 33.5 degrees celsius, which was higher than 33 degrees celsius recorded a day earlier in Nashik city. Aurangabad city, known as the tourism capital of Maharashtra, has, meanwhile, also started registering a gradual decline in the maximum temperature, which was at 31.7 degrees celsius, show the official data. Pune too reported minimum temperature same as Aurangabad, whereas Jalgaon (18.5 degrees celsius), Solapur (18.6 degrees celsius) and Beed (18.7 degrees celsius) in Marathwada were among other cities with relatively lower temperature in the state, revealed the IMD data. Weather experts said the gradual arrival of the westerly winds was setting the tone for the winter in Aurangabad and some other parts of the state. “The current depression over the Bay of Bengal and chances of rainfall amid cloudy weather over the next couple of days, however, could prevent the onset of winter in Marathwada,” weather analyst Shriniwas Aundhkar said. Many parts of Aurangabad city also observed fog during the early morning hours. As per IMD data, Aurangabad had observed the lowest minimum temperature of 16.4 degrees during October last year on the 27th day of the month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/minimum-temperatures-drop-as-winter-approaches/articleshow/87069471.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Corridors of justice at high court open for weekend heritage walks||MUMBAI: The state tourism directorate has thrown open a heritage walk of the Bombay high court building to tourists, especially those interested in heritage architecture and the rich tradition of the Indian judiciary. The high court and the Tourists Guide Association have jointly taken this initiative. One of the oldest courts in the country, the Bombay high court was built over a period of seven years in Gothic revival in the early English style architecture and was commissioned in services in 1878. It has been declared as a world heritage by Unesco. The walk-through of the site is available only on Saturdays and Sundays at Rs 100 for domestic tourists and Rs 200 for international tourists. The visit can be booked on bookmyshow.com. According to tourism officials, a similar walk will be arranged for the adjacent Mumbai University campus very soon. The court was founded on August 14, 1862. The construction of the building was started in 1871 and belongs to Victorian and Art Deco structures. In 2018, Unesco included it in its list of heritages. The structure of the building has been designed akin to a courtroom of a judge. The Bombay high court was one of the three high courts in India established at the Presidency Towns by letters patent granted by Queen Victoria. The structure was designed by British engineer Col. James A Fuller and the first sitting in this building was on January, 10, 1879. Justice M C Chagla was the first Indian permanent Chief Justice of Bombay high court after Independence. To the west of the central tower are two octagonal towers. The statues of Justice and Mercy are atop this building. The application made by Mahatma Gandhi in 1890 to study law and a certificate along with degree in law awarded to Sardar Vallabh-bhai Patel in 1891 has been put on display. Dhananjay Sawalkar, joint director at Directorate of Tourism, said each heritage walk will be of one hour and has been scheduled between 10am and 2pm on Saturdays and Sundays. These walks will be available in Marathi, English and Hindi languages. To showcase rich heritage and culture besides architecture is the motto behind the initiative, he added. According to tourists, great Indian leaders like Tilak, Dr Ambedkar, Gandhi and Sardar Patel were associated with this court and to visit it will be an honour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-corridors-of-justice-at-high-court-open-for-weekend-heritage-walks/articleshow/87073665.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

Deshmukh courted controversy just last month during the local body by-polls, after a photo of him with a Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) candidate went viral. It is this incident which is prominently mentioned in the show-cause notice, signed by MPCC joint secretary Devanand Pawar. Speaking to TOI, Pawar said, “We have given Deshmukh a week's time to respond, failing which he will be expelled from the party.” Deshmukh did not respond to calls.

As per the Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS) data, till 8pm, LB Nagar had received the highest rainfall with 106.3mm, followed by Bathukamma Kunta (105.5); Maruthi Nagar (102.5); Kachiguda and Cherlapally (82.3). Other areas such as Malakpet, Moulali, Balanagar, Nagole, Begumpet, West Marredpally, Malkajgiri recorded rainfall between 20mm and 80 mm. The Moosarambagh bridge in Malakpet was briefly submerged with commuters travelling via Malakpet TV tower towards Amberpet seen wading through the stretch. Water receded within an hour, said an official. Meanwhile, in areas of Mangalghat, a 30-minute spell of rainfall led to massive waterlogging. “Water was gushing into the lanes in Dhoolpet. After a point, people were barely able to cross the road, or even reach their houses which were meters away as the water was flowing with high intensity,” said Vinod Boppa, a resident of Aramghar Colony in Dhoolpet. A huge tree fell right in front of the Amberpet police station. This was subsequently cleared by GHMC’s disaster response team. Special instructions were issued to mandal tahsildars of Amberpet, Himayathnagar, Bahadurpura and Golconda to evacuate people from low-lying areas. “Our revenue officials are patrolling by coordinating with GHMC-DRF wings in flood affected areas. Hyderabad collector L Sharvan also monitored the situation for an hour and instructed us to keep a close watch,” Hyderabad in-charge revenue sub-divisional officer, G Venkateswarlu told STOI. Meanwhile, the water board is operating a total of eight floodgates of Osmansagar (four floodgates) and Himayatsagar (four floodgates) at a height of two-feet and discharging 960 cusecs from Osmansagar and 2,800 cusecs of floodwater from the Himayatsagar reservoir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monsoons-parting-shot-city-gets-more-than-100mm-rain-within-hrs/articleshow/87070889.cms||---

Kalamna police have identified the deceased as Chetan Thakur. Senior police inspector Vinod Patil said Thakur and his accomplice Dipesh Pache were in jail some time ago after committing a crime together. The two were history sheeters and had committed several criminal activities under the jurisdiction of Kalamna police station. Pache was released from jail around a month ago, while Thakur was out recently. On Saturday afternoon, Thakur met Pache at a paan kiosk owned by their common friend Sahil Shah near Pratibha Lawn, under the jurisdiction of Kalamna police station. Thakur then allegedly started abusing Pache for the latter’s “lack of efforts” to get him released from jail, which forced Thakur to stay in prison for more than a month. The situation soon turned violent. Before Thakur could understand anything, Pache along with Shah allegedly attacked Thakur with an iron rod kept there. He sustained serious stab injuries. On being informed, Kalamna police reached there and rushed the profusely bleeding Thakur to Mayo hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The cops have detained Pache and Shah, and are probing further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/goon-murdered-2-friends-detained/articleshow/87067945.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: From vax drive in Kamathipura to music videos, housing society spread cheer||MUMBAI: Earlier this year, a girl from Kamathipura who “hadn’t seen the sun in six years” helped two women from a South Mumbai high-rise see the light. In the story of this young migrant girl who sells her body for “Rs 20 to Rs 30 for five minutes”, the women who live in a self-confessed bubble of high teas and brunches found not only renewed respect for the “value of money” but also the primary fear that had kept the red light district’s sex workers from getting the Covid-19 vaccine: the loss of two days of income to post-vaccine recovery. Soon, ‘Vivarea Gives’ a charitable building network from the over-400-flat-strong Vivarea at Jacob Circle decided that the best way to make science trump commerce in this hungry underbelly of Mumbai would be through the belly. The group, whose unofficial ‘CEO’ is cardiac surgeon Dr Meera Razdan, supplied free kits of wheat flour, daal, rice, pao and chai to close to 120 women for a month. This nearly Rs 2 lakh gesture made it easier for the sex workers to see the economic, if not scientific, sense in queuing up for their free first dose of Covishield. Razdan’s friend at Vivarea, the managing director of Wockhardt Hospitals, sent her team led by Khyati Desai and Shiva Khattar to Kamathipura for the drive held in July. At a similar camp later this month, the girls will be getting their second jab too for free. Even as the threat of a third wave of Covid-19 looms large, informal housing society networks such ‘Vivarea Gives’ and Powai’s ‘Ministry of Happiness Atlantis’ are continuing to check on the well-being of those within and beyond the building. For proof, look up ‘Mile Sur Mera Tumhara Revisited’ online. You will stumble upon a unity-in-diversity video created not by the ministry of culture, but by the Ministry of Happiness (MOH) Atlantis a microcosm of residents of the 200-plus-flats-strong Atlantis in Powai’s Hiranandani Gardens that decided to mark India’s 75 years of Independence with a personal recreation of the 33-year-old iconic song of national integration. “The idea of the video was born out of the hunger for connection that we are all feeling in these times of social distancing,” says Ajay Kulkarni of MOH Atlantis. Created to spread “cheer and sunshine” during the lockdown, the team has gone beyond arranging for hospital beds and home-cooked meals for Covid-affected patients. The group organised a live video-conferencing session for residents on the importance of creating life goals two months ago. Recently, members of this ministry grooved to Jamaican legend Bob Marley’s ‘Don’t worry, be happy’, and hand-delivered roses and healthy juices to women in all flats on Women’s Day.  Meanwhile, Vivarea Gives which has raised funds for multiple causes, from Kashmir floods to Latur famine over four years also enabled free Covid vaccinations for the family members of the staff at Agripada and Nagpada police stations. “If other societies start similar initiatives, it can become a movement,” says Razdan of Vivarea Gives, whose donated blankets and bedsheets are now keeping abandoned elderly persons warm at an old-age home in Chembur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-from-vax-drive-in-kamathipura-to-music-videos-hsg-socs-spread-cheer/articleshow/87073708.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Dengue patients face platelet shortage as demand shoots||HYDERABAD: Dengue patients have now been stung by shortage of platelets as demand has hit the roof. Many families have had to ring up their relatives and friends from other cities to come and donate. The hunt for the all-important blood component has also been hit by several hospitals not willing to accept it from blood banks other than their own. “The doctors said they were not accepting blood or platelets from outside as they were not sure if all blood banks were testing donors for Covid-19. With this a long exercise of reaching out to relatives, friends and support groups began. Ultimately, we could get a relative from Nizamabad to donate,” said Yousuf Shareef who was desperately looking for an O-negative donor. In another instance, a family had to fly in a relative from Bangalore. “We reached out to all our contacts. Although we could connect to a few donors from the A-positive group, but either they were not in town or had recently donated. Ultimately, a friend brought forward his travel plans and came to donate,” said Mithra Rao. While normally a person has a platelet range of 1.5 lakh to 4.5 lakh, in case of dengue patients, this can drop to as low as 5,000. “Platelets play a vital role in preventing bleeding. Bleeding seldom occurs for platelet count above 30,000/cc, but a lower count might require transfusion,” said Dr Arshad Punjani, consultant physician and diabetologist, Yashoda Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dengue-patients-face-platelet-shortage-as-demand-shoots/articleshow/87071171.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||JEE-Advanced: 27 students from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh among top 100 rankers||HYDERABAD: Marginally bettering their run at the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE-Advanced) from last year, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh saw 27 students from the two states making it to the top-100 list. Three of the top 10 rankers in the overall list were also from the Telugu states. The JEE results were announced on October 15. In 2020, the two states contributed 25 candidates to the top-100 list. Ramaswamy Santhosh Reddy from Telangana’s Pochampally mandal walked away with the all India rank (AIR) 4, while Polu Lakshmi Sai Lokesh Reddy from Ongole and Modulla Hrushikesh Reddy from Proddatur secured an AIR of 5 and 10 respectively. The AIR 11 and AIR 17 too were bagged by Telugu students. Apart from the general category, Telangana and AP students aced the test in other categories too. Nandigama Nikhil secured AIR 1 in the scheduled caste category, while Bijili Prachothan Varma secured AIR 1 in scheduled tribe category. The AIR 1 in OBC-NCL-PwD category too has been bagged by Telugu student Gorle Krishna Chaitanya. With AIR 107, Palle Bhavana emerged as the female topper in the IIT-Hyderabad zone. An analysis of the results shared by the Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur indicates that 135 candidates from the IIT-Hyderabad zone figure in the top 500. In fact, according to rough estimates from coaching institutions, about 175 students from the two states figured in the top 1,000. “The cut-off marks for JEE was slightly lower this year due to the complexity of the paper. When the question paper is tougher, the cut-off tends to drop and vice-versa. The qualifying percentage was reduced by almost five resulting in more candidates getting qualified in JEE,” said P Prameela, academic director, Narayana Group of Institutions. This year a total of 41,862 candidates qualified in JEE (A) compared to 43,204 last year. Of the total qualified students this year, 6,452 are female candidates. Computer Science still the top choice The top choice among students who cracked the exam continues to be computer science engineering, with most eyeing a seat in IIT-Bombay. “I studied for 8 to 10 hours everyday and concentrated more on maths as I was slightly weak in it. My brother who himself is pursuing engineering from International Institute of Information Technology also guided me to clear JEE. I intend to seek admission in computer science engineering at IIT-Bombay,” said Bhavana Palle, a student of Narayana Group of Institutions. Ditto, Savaram Divakar Sai, from Sri Chaitanya Group of Institutions who secured an AIR of 13. “Appearing for multiple competitive exams amid a pandemic was slightly frustrating. However, with constant support from my parents and teachers, I was able to crack the JEE. Also, the paper this year was slightly more scoring than last year,” he said. With 348 marks, Mridul Agarwal from IIT-Delhi zone emerged as the topper in the exam this year. Kavya Chopra of IIT-Delhi zone obtained 286 marks and was declared as the female topper with AIR 98.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jee-adv-27-students-from-t-and-ap-among-top-100-rankers/articleshow/87073731.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Hyderabad||No point solving more Qs & mock tests if fundas not clear||Focus on core concepts, the topper’s trick Hailing from an agriculture family, Ramaswamy Santhosh Reddy, was confident of figuring in top 50 in the joint entrance examination (advanced) results. To his surprise, he secured the all India rank 4, making him the state topper for Telangana. A student of Narayana Group of Institutions, he attributes his success to having a strong foundation. “I always focused on having core concepts to be clear. I strongly believe that unless our concepts are not cleared, there is no point in solving more questions and rushing into appearing for mock tests,” said Reddy, who plans to pursue computer science engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. The student, who originally hails from Pochampally district in Telangana, and now lives in Vanasthalipuram, had secured fourth rank in the Telangana engineering, agriculture and medical common entrance test and first rank in the economically backward sections (general) in JEE (A). In his free time, he likes to watch Telugu movies. Self-assessment and lots of practice the key Appearing for numerous mock tests and regularly rectifying mistakes is what got Lokesh Reddy the all India fifth rank in the joint entrance exams (JEE) (advanced) results declared on October 15. A native of Ongole, Andhra Pradesh, Lokesh has been preparing for the JEE since class 8. “Soon after appearing for JEE (Advanced), I wasn’t too confident about securing good marks. However, when I checked the answer key, I was confident that I’d secure a rank in top five,” said Reddy, who has his eyes set on computer science engineering at the coveted Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. The student attributed his success to thorough rectification of his mistakes. “Soon after the exams, I would dedicate an entire day to identify and rectify my mistakes. I understood very early during my academics that the key to success is by not repeating the same mistakes,” said Reddy, who would swear by his class notes by Narayana Group of Institutions. Lokesh secured 17th rank in the Telangana engineering, agriculture and medical common entrance test (Eamcet), 23rd rank in the AP Eamcet and scored 422 out of 450 in Birla Institute of Technology Science Admission Test. Objective studying the mantra for success Andhra Pradesh boy Modulla Hrushikesh Reddy bagged all India 10th rank in the joint entrance examination (Advanced). A native of Proddatur in Kadapa district, he attributes his success to objective studying. “I would dedicate equal amount of time for all the subjects and then focus on my strengths and weaknesses. Since I had a strong hold in maths and physics, I focused more on chemistry to ensure that all my concepts were clear,” said Reddy, a student of Sri Chaitanya Educational Institutions. He has been preparing for the JEE since class 8. Taking inspiration from his brother who is pursuing third year BTech at International Institute of Information Technology, Bengaluru, Hrushikesh says he wants to pursue computer science engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. After his BTech, Hrushikesh wishes to pursue his entrepreneurship dreams. “I want to start my own firm after completing BTech from IIT-B. However, I would like to explore all options during my academics to come to a conclusion,” said Reddy, who secured 25th rank in both engineering, agriculture and medical common entrance tests in Telangana and AP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-point-solving-more-qs-mock-tests-if-fundas-not-clear/articleshow/87070840.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Plea to arrest kingpin duo junked||VADODARA: Vadodara police landed in an embarrassing situation in a judicial magistrate’s court on Saturday when the Uttar Pradesh police brought religious conversion racket accused Umar Gautam and Salauddin Shaikh on transit warrant and produced them before the court here. The court turned down the Vadodara police's request to arrest the accused in case registered in the city and produce them for remand on Sunday. Gautam and Shaikh, who are accused of promoting enmity between different communities, forgery, money laundering and criminal conspiracy by Vadodara police, were lodged in UP jail. The court in Lucknow had allowed their transit remand and had ordered UP police to produce them before a court here. On Saturday, when the UP police produced Gautam and Shaikh before the court, the special investigation team requested the court to arrest them formally. Police were planning to interrogate them for 24 hours and produce them before the court again to seek their further custody. However, the request made by Vadodara police to arrest them was opposed by the duo’s lawyers. “When the accused were produced before the court by UP police, it means that they are in judicial custody. And if the police want to interrogate them, they cannot ask the court to arrest them. Our argument was that the proper way is to seek their remand through a remand application which police did not submit to the court,” said Gautam’s lawyer Arsh Shaikh. The duo was produced before the court in the afternoon and the arguments over their custody went on for hours. The court, late in the evening, turned down the police’s request to arrest them and produce them the next day for remand. However, the investigating officer was allowed an hour’s time to prepare a remand report and seek their custody and until then the two accused were to remain in judicial custody. “We said that we have not arrested them yet in connection with our case so how can we seek their remand. So, we wanted to arrest them first,” said assistant commissioner of police D S Chauhan. Officials had to go back to their offices late in the evening so prepare a fresh remand demand and place it before the court. Sources said that the police are planning to seek their custody for 14 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/drama-ensues-in-courtroom-over-two-kingpins-custody/articleshow/87070175.cms||---

Following this, dry weather conditions are likely to prevail throughout Telangana due to complete withdrawal of south-west monsoon over the coming days. According to IMD, Hyderabad, the low pressure area over Bay of Bengal is likely to weaken thereby subsiding the rainfall activity over Telangana. “After two days of rainfall, we can expect complete withdrawal of south-west monsoon from Telangana,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, IMD, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/more-rains-likely-over-next-2-days/articleshow/87070916.cms||---
---||Surat||Gems & jewellery exports up 11% in H1||Surat: There seems to be something to cheer for the gems and jewellery industry as the total exports in the first half of 2021-22 (April to September) has seen a jump of 11% compared to the same period in 2019-20, the pre-Covid period. According to figures released by the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) on Saturday, the export of gems and jewellery grew to Rs 1.41 lakh crore in the first half of 2021-22 compared to Rs 1.27 lakh crore for the first half of 2019-20. Studded gold jewellery exports shot up by 60% to Rs 17,761 crore during the same period. “With US$ 18,984.49 million exports during April-September, the sector has already achieved nearly half (46%) of the US$ 41.66 billion gems and jewellery exports target set by the government. The sentiment in the industry is incredibly positive with markets opening up and demand gradually returning to normal,” said GJEPC chairman, Colin Shah. He added that GJEPC successfully concluded the International Gem & Jewellery Show (IGJS) in Dubai recently where they received good feedback from the exhibitors and buyers. “Moreover, with the festive season coming up, we are optimistic to achieve the export target by the end of the financial year,” said Shah. GJEPC claimed that the gems and jewellery sector was getting support from the union government and how commerce minister Piyush Goyal was closely working for the industry’s growth. On September 17, Goyal visited the Surat Diamond Bourse and later attended the 37th edition of India International Jewellery Show held in Bengaluru. Less than a week later, on September 23 Goyal visited SEEPZ in Mumbai, where he met with officials from GJEPC and SEEPZ along with jewellery exporters. Goyal had also announced a Rs 200 crore grant for upgrading the SEEPZ infrastructure and an additional Rs 70 crore for developing an on-site Common Facility Centre (CFC). The space transfer policy announced earlier this month by the ministry of commerce and industry is expected to facilitate SEZs that account for 30% share in the country’s total gem and jewellery exports, according to GJEPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gems-jewellery-exports-up-11-in-h1/articleshow/87070317.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Amid Covid norms, Kolhapur holds royal Dasara celebrations with limited invitees||KOLHAPUR: The ‘Shahi Dasara’ of Kolhapur city was celebrated on Friday as per tradition at Dasara chowk ground. The royal family of Kolhapur arrived in a 1932-make Maybach car to perform the ritual of worshipping the ‘Apta’ tree and then distributing its leaves to the invitees, marking the start of the Dasara festival. Last year, in view of the pandemic, celebrations were kept low-key at the Tulja Bhawani temple in Bhawani Mandap. The celebrations took place amidst only some invitees. The Dasara Chowk ground was barricaded from all sides along with the heavy police deployment to avoid people from gathering. Only a few organising committee members along with the invited guests and the media were allowed to witness the celebrations. The event was also live telecast for other devotees on LED screens installed by the district administration at various locations across the city streets. On Friday evening, after all necessary preparations, the palanquins of the goddesses Mahalaxmi, Tulja Bhawani, and Guru Maharaj arrived at the ground followed by the royal family of Kolhapur in a colourful procession. The royal family of Kolhapur comprising Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj, MP Sambhaji Raje Chhatrapati, Maloji Raje Chhatrapati, Shahaji Raje, Yash Raje and Yashaswini Raje were given a salutation upon their arrival at the Dasara Chowk ground while a traditional song was played. The rituals were carried out later. Kolhapur guardian minister Satej Patil, rural development minister Hasan Mushriff, former governor of Tripura D Y Patil, Sanjay D Patil, MP Sanjay Mandlik, MLA Chandrakant Jadhav, district collector Rahul Rekhawar, superintendent of Kolhapur police Shailesh Balkawade, KMC administrator Kadambari Balkawade attended the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/amid-covid-norms-kolhapur-holds-royal-dasara-celebrations-with-limited-invitees/articleshow/87069577.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Covid reason? TB hits 9 organs of Andhra Pradesh woman||HYDERABAD: In a rare case, an asymptomatic Covid-19 patient developed disseminated tuberculosis (TB) with as many as nine body parts infected with TB lesions. These included reproductive organs. This Covid-19-triggered disseminated TB case reported at a city hospital is perhaps the first such incident during the pandemic in these parts. TB normally infects lungs. If it infects multiple organs simultaneously, it is called disseminated tuberculosis or DTB. Generally, DTB cases are triggered by viruses like cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C and human herpes, which cause temporary immunosuppression. But, no case of DTB caused by Covid-19 has so far been documented. Although, Covid-19 virus infecting multiple body parts has been reported this is the first case where it has facilitated the TB bacteria to spread to several organs. The young woman patient from Andhra Pradesh was admitted to a corporate hospital in Hyderabad with a complaint of pain in the neck and right hand. She and her family members did not have any Covid-19 symptoms. The antibody test revealed that she had the novel coronavirus in her body but without any symptoms. She was non-diabetic and immune-competent. She underwent two major spine surgeries and recovered despite nine of her body party infected by TB. Dr P Ranganadham, senior neurosurgeon, Sunshine Hospitals, Gachibowli, told TOI that the case was unique as the patient was perfectly immunocompetent (good immunity). A PET scan revealed multiple TB lesions including three spots in the spinal cord. Besides the spinal cord, lungs, fallopian tubes, uterine cavity, brain and bones were also infected. “The obvious cause of disseminated TB could not be elucidated, but we hypothesise the role of transient immunosuppression leading to the dissemination of infection by changing the immunity to TB bacteria in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. “There were significant titres of Covid-19 antibodies in the patient in the absence of either Covid-19 affection (symptomatic) in her or her family members,” he said. Dr Ranganadham said the transient immunosuppression may have been caused by Covid-19 as antibodies for the pandemic virus were found in the patient. He said DTB may have spread by either progressive primary infection or reactivation of latent TB with subsequent spread. It could also be due to iatrogenic (drug side-effects) reasons. The TB bacteria may have spread to multiple organs through lymph nodes or pulmonary vein.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-reason-tb-hits-9-organs-of-ap-woman/articleshow/87073734.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Aurangabad||Beed: Three firearms, eight live rounds seized||AURANGABAD: The Parli police in Beed district arrested a man hailing from Madhya Pradesh late on Friday night and seized three firearms and eight live rounds from him. Police suspect that the accused is a part of an inter-state racket involved in illegal trade and supply of firearms. The accused has been identified as Rohit Solanki (25), a resident of Sendwa, Madhya Pradesh. Following the arrest, R Raja, the superintendent of police, has ordered the cops to uncover the racket and take the suspects on record, on the basis of technical evidence. Hemant Kadam, inspector at Parli police station, said the process is underway to ascertain the manufacturers, as well as, the prospective customers of these illegal firearms. While calling the success in seizing firearms a major one, Kadam said, “Without prospective customers, no one would carry three firearms at one time.” An officer privy to the probe maintained that in most of the cases, the suspects pose as industrial and farm workers while travelling from one state to another and supply the firearms. “In some cases, these illegal suppliers rope in gullible farmworkers to transport these firearms from one place to another,” said the officer. The seized firearms have been sent for forensic analysis to ascertain if they have been used in any of the known crimes anywhere across the state. The ballistic experts will also confirm if any rounds have been fired from these weapons. An officer from the crime branch said that the possibility of these firearms being procured for committing some offence cannot be ruled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beed-three-firearms-eight-live-rounds-seized/articleshow/87069611.cms||---
---||Pune||Puneites feel the heat as mercury rises in October||PUNE: October heat has made a comeback. Day temperatures have soared to 33-34°C in most parts of the city. “October is a transitional month, with the post-monsoon period gradually moving to winter. The monsoon’s retreat from Pune has cleared the skies, and the partly cloudy to mainly clear skies have caused the maximum temperatures to cross 33°C in most locations in Pune,” Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting division at IMD Pune, told TOI. He said clear skies, usually seen in the latter half of October, cause not only a rise in maximum temperatures, but also a slight dip in night temperatures. “Mainly clear skies cause the night temperature to drop as the warm, outgoing long-wave radiation gets a chance to escape into the atmosphere, partially unhindered during clear nights. Conversely, clear skies in the daytime cause the solar radiation to directly reach the earth surface, making it warmer,” Kashyapi explained. Kashyapi said that there was still considerable humidity in the air. “Days feel warmer than they actually are because the rise in humidity has pushed the ‘heat index’ or real feel temperature. Pune may be recording a day temperature of around 33°C, but it feels like 36-37°C due to the humidity levels,” he said. Gradually, the day temperature may go up to the threshold value of 35°C with the advent of the second fortnight of October, he said. “Similarly, minimum temperatures may gradually hover below 19-20°C. The minimum temperatures have already dipped to 18-19°C in the city. Diurnal variation is prominent in the city during October,” he said. Kashyapi said that the system over Bay of Bengal is likely to cause some clouding over Pune on Sunday but would not cause any significant drop in day temperatures. “The clouding would persist only for a day. But since the system would cause moisture incursion, and there may not be much of a controlling effect on day temperatures, the real feel temperatures may seem higher,” he said. On Saturday, Chinchwad was the warmest location in Pune with a day temperature of 34.6°C, followed by Magarpatta at 33.8°C, Lohegaon at 33.5°C and Shivajinagar at 33.4°C. The India Meteorological Department has forecast maximum temperatures in the range of 33°C and 35°C in the city during the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/puneites-feel-the-heat-as-mercury-rises-in-october/articleshow/87071696.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Techie drags cop on bonnet over Rs 400 fine, arrested||PUNE: The Mundhwa police on Saturday arrested a 43-year-old IT professional on the charge of bid to kill a policeman by dragging him on his car bonnet for around 800 metres, between Mundhwa Chowk and Kharadi Bypass Chowk, after he was asked to pay a pending traffic fine of Rs 400 on Friday afternoon. The suspect, who works at an IT firm in Kharadi, was remanded in police custody till October 20. “The suspect was not drunk, but he risked the life of police havaldar Sheshrao Jaybhay by dragging him on his car bonnet while driving at high speed,” said sub-inspector Gajanan Bhosale, who is investigating the case. “Jaybhay sustained injuries to two fingers on his right hand and left leg. The suspect tendered an apology after he was taken into custody, but his acts are not pardonable. He is involved in a serious crime and his questioning will help us establish the motive behind misbehaving with the cop in such a manner,” said Bhosale. Jaybhay, posted with the traffic police control room, told TOI that he was on duty with other cops at the Mundhwa traffic signal. “The traffic police had launched a special drive to check vehicles to recover pending fines. We stopped an IT employee’s car heading towards Kharadi from Hadapsar and upon checking the registration number of the vehicle on a police application, I found that he had not paid a fine of Rs 400 even after an e-challan was issued,” said Jaybhay. “I requested him to pay the fine via debit/credit card, but he refused and picked a fight with me. He accused the policemen of being incapable of doing their duty and trying to extort motorists,” said Jaybhay. “The suspect suddenly started the car and was about to knock me down, but I caught hold of the wiper and ended up on the bonnet,” said Jaybhay. A chase ensued, according to Jaybhay. “The suspect began driving at high speed in a zig-zag manner. A policeman chased him on a bike and signalled him to stop but in vain. Passers-by on their two-wheelers also chased him,” said Jaybhay. Upon realising that he was being chased, the suspect slowed down and Jaybhay said he was able to get down from the vehicle. “The IT professional was intercepted at the Kharadi bypass chowk and into custody. He was handed over to the Mundhwa police for further action,” he added. An FIR relating to bid to kill a policeman, preventing him from discharging his duty and endangering life under sections 307, 353 and 336 of the IPC and Motor Vehicles Act was registered on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/techie-drags-officer-on-bonnet-over-rs-400-fine/articleshow/87071725.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Nagpur||‘Emotional stability should be priority, not curriculum’||As more and more schools reopen in physical mode, both students and teachers are trying to adapt to the new normal. Though physical classroom teaching has always been the norm, the conditions in which it is being held pose a new set of challenges. Right from having students back on the campus after a long gap, the psychological fear which the devastating second wave has instilled and the pressure to keep the wheels of education rolling is something all stakeholders are trying to get used to. Senior academic Neeru Kapai speaks to TOI on priorities for teachers now that schools have reopened in physical mode. Excerpts... Q. Though it’s back to the classrooms, it’s actually a very different set-up now. A. Physical classrooms are now operating under certain guidelines issued by the government and that’s why it will be different from what they looked like in 2019. Though there’s a limit to the number of students present in the class, a simultaneous webcast is being conducted to ensure that students at home do not miss out. Hybrid teaching methods too are being adapted to. So, overall it’s a new experience, but there is no denying that having students back in the classrooms is much better. Q. Is the situation better because it eases the learning process? A. Better because teachers can take care of students’ emotional as well as academic needs in an optimized way. You have to understand that teachers play an important role in the overall development of students. Teachers are always observing the body language of students, how they interact with peers and seniors. This observation gives teachers a very clear idea on which student is acting aloof, depressed etc. And then, a bit of counselling or a pep talk or giving specific responsibilities to that student which draws him/her out of that shell is all part of a trained teacher response to such situations. However, in a virtual classroom, making such observations is very difficult. Q. Will students need a lot of hand-holding even after they are back on campus? A. For all schools now, the priority should not be curriculum completion but to provide emotional stability and boost self-esteem of students. There was never a greater need for students to be trained in the 21st century life skills. Parents and teachers will have to ensure that they put in all the efforts to help their children learn how to be responsible and accountable for their behaviour and decisions. What has happened during this prolonged Covid-induced lockdown is that students have been affected mentally, because their normal routine, their life with friends etc was suddenly snatched from them. For adolescents, such sharp changes and that too for a prolonged time are hard to deal with. Q. So, dealing with students at an emotional level, rather than only academic, will be a priority now? A. All good teachers always connect with their students at both levels. But yes, the need to do so will be much greater now. Covid has played havoc with the feelings and emotions of students. Uncertainty of their future dreams is increasing anxiety. This is leading to frustration and depression which is compelling them to commit suicide. Hence, change in the mindset of both parents and teachers is now required to deal with all these things. Q. Will this be a slow process for everyone? A. It need not be. The biggest problem in solving any issue is that the stakeholders don’t want to accept that there is a problem. Be it a parent or a student, there should not be a hesitancy is recognizing that there is a serious issue which needs to be dealt with. I always say the first step is to accept that there is a problem. Don’t delay this because it will get worse. Once you have accepted that there is an issue, then we can start changing the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/emotional-stability-should-be-priority-not-curriculum/articleshow/87069627.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Student’s wait for scholarship exam results continues||AURANGABAD: Lakhs of students from Classes V to VIII in the state are still awaiting the results of the scholarship examinations that were held on August 12 after being repeatedly postponed. Every year, middle school and high school scholarship exams for Classes V and VIII respectively are conducted by the Maharashtra State Council of Examinations (MSCE), which is the competent authority. More than 10 lakh students appear for these tests. Pointing out an already disrupted schedule of the scholarship tests, educational activists, on behalf of the parents, have questioned the delay in declaring the results. “The scholarship examinations use the Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) system, which enables speedy assessment. While a period of at most one month is enough to declare the result, the authorities concerned are unnecessarily taking extra time,” said Prashant Sathe, an activist. Notably, the MSCE had declared the final answer-keys for both middle school and high school scholarship exams on September 9 and accordingly, results were expected within a few days. Held in eight different languages, many students appear for scholarship examinations across the state as it offers the students early orientation towards preparation for the competitive examinations. When contacted, MSCE commissioner Tukaram Supe admitted that the results were unusually late and blamed Covid-related issues for the delay. “We have been facing manpower issues while accomplishing different tasks and completing the necessary formalities. We would like to assure the students and parents that the results will be out before this month ends,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/students-wait-for-scholarship-exam-results-continues/articleshow/87069671.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Pune||Pune: Festive shoppers flock to stores for gold, garments; uptick in home sales||PUNE: The high tide of shoppers witnessed in the lead-up to Dasara didn’t recede even a day after the festival, with Puneites thronging shops across the city in what some traders called the biggest shopping spree since the pandemic began. People splurged on gold, clothes and even homes across Pune. Local traders’ bodies expect the rush to continue till Diwali and even beyond, when the wedding season is slated to begin. Some attributed the rush to the 7% hike in GST on readymade garments, set to come into effect on November 1. Prerna Goyal, a homemaker, said shopping at brick-and-mortar stores was a welcome change from buying things online. “Festivals are not only about rituals at home, but also the general happy buzz outside. Going to a shop with the entire family, trying out various outfits, haggling with shopkeepers, eating out afterwards – all of these are an essential part of the festive season. My entire family is vaccinated. We wore masks, took precautions and enjoyed Navaratra shopping,” Goyal said. Fatehchand Ranka, president of Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP) and head of a state association, said people were buying gold in the form of jewellery and as an investment. “This will go on till Diwali. This is the best festive season we have had since the pandemic started,” Ranka said. Seema Belokar, a Katraj resident who bought gold ornaments on Laxmi Road, said, “There’s relief mixed with the enjoyment of the festive atmosphere. After a long quarantine, it feels nice to see so many people going about their business on a bustling Laxmi Road,” she said. Ranka said he expects the shopping spree to continue till the wedding season, which starts 15 days after Diwali. “So instead of shopping twice, some families are buying in bulk now,” he said, adding that the impending rise in GST on readymade clothes too played a role. “People must be thinking why wait till next month when they can buy clothes for a lower price now,” he surmised. Meanwhile, there was also an uptick in home sales in the city. Anil Pharande, president, Credai-Pune Metro, credited this to vaccination drives, low interest home loans, and stamp duty benefits for women “People have realised the importance of owning a home during the pandemic; those with their own house are moving to bigger homes. A report by Credai-Pune Metro and CRE Matrix recently revealed that Pune’s real estate sales have grown by almost 8%, with a 27% increase in the value of sales, in 2021 when compared to 2019. We expect the festive surge in demand to gain momentum in the coming months,” Pharande said, cautioning that rise in input costs – steel, cement and PVC – may cause prices to increase. Pharande said good offers by developers too fuelled the rise in homebuying. “This year, along with homes in good locations, we offered office spaces at an ultramodern commercial complex coming up in Kothrud. We saw an equally good response in the commercial space,” said Vishal Gokhale, CMD of Gokhale Constructions, said. Shravan Hardikar, the state inspector-general of registration and stamps (IGR), said high-value property registrations in the city have been on the rise since after ‘Pitrupaksh’ ended on October 6, and expects the trend to continue till Diwali. “People did not buy homes during Pitrupaksh. However, registrations started picking up after the ritual. We compile the data monthly and will know the exact figures after this month-end,” Hardikar said. The only low point this festive season was seen in vehicle sales. A combination of restrictions and global semiconductor shortage has caused the registration of vehicles, especially cars, to drop drastically before Dasara. As per RTO figures, car registrations dropped by 15% in Pune and 32% in Pimpri Chinchwad; two-wheeler sales increased by 5% in Pune and plunged by 31% in Pimpri Chinchwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/festive-shoppers-flock-to-stores-for-gold-garments-uptick-in-home-sales/articleshow/87071754.cms||---

The MSRTC deployed 55 buses, which at 50% seating capacity made 9,330 trips and transported 1.91 lakh passengers during these nine days. The MSRTC had not operated any buses last year as temples were closed due to the pandemic. “This comes as a huge relief to the corporation.

The mother was weeping inconsolably because the state failed to provide the financial assistance promised to them under victim compensation. Her 14-year-old speech and hearing impaired daughter was raped and impregnated by a constable. Though the accused was sent to jail to serve a 30-year term, the victim was not given the compensation package. The initial relief meant for meeting their daily needs was also not released. Police helped the girl by arranging for an abortion but later the much-needed succour did not arrive. The grief-stricken mother and child ran from pillar to post for the last three months and realised that the promised package would never arrive. Hence, they decided to end their lives. But then, she suddenly remembered the advice of a neighbour a few days ago asking her to contact a paralegal volunteer to avail legal services . The neighbour came to know about the legal services authority when he attended a legal awareness programme held by Hyderabad city civil court legal services authority (CCCLSA) as part of ‘Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’. The paralegal volunteer, on receiving the call from the mother, immediately dialled 100 and sought their help and the former was refusing disclose the area from where she was speaking. Then, he informed Hyderabad CCCLSA secretary K Murali Mohan and apprised him of the plight of the duo. He roped in a team of legal officials and paralegal volunteers. The tahsildar and local circle inspector provided immediate succour to the family and the CCCLSA addressed a letter to the state asking it to disburse Rs 14 lakh immediately to the girl as she is eligible for the same under two or three categories of the scheme. Though the compensation has not arrived, hopes of the mother-daughter duo have been revived.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/paralegal-volunteer-rescues-mother-daughter-duo/articleshow/87069766.cms||---

Ashish is already under arrest and is being interrogated. Firearms recovered from Das, a Lucknow-based contractor who was allegedly in a car that was part of the convoy which plunged into a group of protesting farmers on October 3, and Lateef, Das’s bodyguard, have been sent for forensic ballistics, a branch of the science involving the examination of evidence -- bullets, cartridges, guns -- in shooting incidents. Special prosecution officer SP Yadav told TOI, “Counsels of all the three accused had applied for bail in the CJM court. But the applications were disposed of under section 437 of the CrPC. Bail is unlikely to be given by a lower court in cases where sections of murder, attempt to murder or any other heinous acts have been invoked.” Meanwhile, another key suspect may have been detained by a police team, according to sources. And it could be Sumit Jaiswal, one of the suspects who was in one of the SUVs in the convoy. However, his detention is yet to be officially confirmed by the special investigation team (SIT). A senior official in the SIT told TOI, “The SIT in Lakhimpur Kheri has not arrested Sumit Jaiswal, but we cannot confirm if any other police team did. So far, we have not received information about it.” Jaiswal, a ward member from Lakhimpur Kheri, is believed to be close to Ashish and his father. He had earlier filed a complaint, on the basis of which an FIR was filed by police against unidentified farmers, regarding the death of three BJP workers on the day the violence flared up. In a video that went viral, purportedly of the Lakhimpur Kheri clashes, Jaiswal, in a blue kurta, was seen coming out of an SUV (Thar) that ran farmers over. The day the SIT was formed he went missing. Another suspect, Satyam Tripathi, who was in the second SUV (a black Fortuner) is believed to have fled the spot and is absconding. The SIT on Saturday also released posters and circulated information through social media requesting people to come forward and share any evidence they may have regarding the killings. Over 50 videos have been handed over so far and are being examined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/bail-for-3-in-kheri-case-rejected/articleshow/87068128.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Though the district has not witnessed any major casualties, the rain evoked fear in the minds of people as neighbouring districts reported landslides in hilly regions. Other than uprooting of two trees in Panampilly Nagar and Malayidamthuruthu in Perumbavoor, one house got damaged in North Paravoor and stormwater entered into some of the houses at P&T Colony.

If this continues in the manner in which it is going on, then the fish stock in the sea will completely reduce,” the traditional fishermen said. Explaining the situation, a fisherman said that they venture out in the sea using their small boats with outboard motors when it is high tide at night so that when they return in the morning with their catch the fish can be sold fresh. “When we go out, we find these big trawlers using LED lights and bull-trawling well within the 5km limit. In bull-trawling, the net is tied between two trawlers and the fish is simply swept into the net. The fish catch is larger during high tide and they use LED lights to lure the fish close to the surface. This affects our catch,” they said. “This has been going on for a long time and no action is being taken,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/outstation-trawlers-fishing-in-goa/articleshow/87073830.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A slew of activities, including survivors’ talk, talk series by doctors, awareness classes in colleges are being held by the volunteers as part of the campaign. A social media campaign with the hashtag ‘mypinkvow’ too has been started alongside and various organizations like the Progressive Techies are promoting it through their social media handles. Avinash Ashok, programme and outreach manager, The Social Town, said that there has been a sharp increase in the number of breast cancer cases that are being reported every year. A recent report published by the national cancer registry programme (NCRP) estimated that the number of cancer cases is likely to increase from 13.9 lakh in 2020 to 15.7 lakh by 2025, an increase of nearly 20%. “Therefore the need for breast cancer awareness is important. #mypinkvow is a pledge anyone can take to join the fight against breast cancer. This campaign aims to spread awareness about breast cancer and the importance of early detection through self-examination,” he said. Every year, October is commemorated as the breast cancer awareness month around the word to promote know-how and emphasize the need for early-detection, treatment and palliative care. However, if the cancer is not detected in the early stages, the chances of survivability is very less. “It is a one-month campaign. We are associating with Apothecary, the association of students at Calicut Medical College, who will be taking awareness session with the help of experts. We have identified several breast cancer survivors who would share their experience to inspire those who are struggling to survive. We also have pink volunteers, pink ambassadors and pink partners, who associate with us at various levels as part of the campaign,” Ashok said. The Social Town is an online networking platform for community builders and social change makers. The startup enables them to connect, learn about each other, assist, support, exchange resources and offer services. It is a Kerala startup mission (KSUM) recognized startup.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/my-pink-vow-to-raise-awareness-on-cancer/articleshow/87069795.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Doctor residents help two housing complexes beat Covid-19 blues||PUNE: Having medical professionals as residents proved to be a blessing for the members of Shri Vitthal Heritage Cooperative Housing Society in Dattanagar and MSR Olive society in Ambegaon during the two waves of Covid-19 pandemic. These professionals not only helped the neighbours in times of health emergency, but, in case of Dattanagar housing society, also established a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) soon after the first Covid case was detected in a Pune couple on March 9, 2020. With the help of these SOPs, the Shri Vitthal Heritage Cooperative Housing Society members managed to keep the Covid-19 infection to the minimum, with just 25 out of 1,300-odd residents testing positive for the contagion so far. “The medical professionals proved to be a source of strength, moral support and awareness for the society members. Among them, anaesthetist Jayant Patil, who is also the secretary of our housing society, helped us in forming the SOPs quite early in the pandemic,” said society chairman Prakash Babar. Society office-bearers also ensured that every person involved in the upkeep of the society, including domestic helps, security guards and sweepers, were supported financially. “We ensured that each one of them was vaccinated and stayed healthy,” Babar said. When contacted, anaesthetist Jayant Patil said nothing would have been possible without the support of all the residents. Patil worked tirelessly during the early phase of the pandemic at Civil hospital in Aundh, while simultaneously keeping a close watch on the society premises. The society also provided groceries to 100 poor families (outside the society) during the initial days of the pandemic-induced lockdown. In the case of MSR Olive, the doctors living in the housing complex helped by providing timely medical advice to positive patients. “We tied up with a medical store in the vicinity for the supply of medicines, especially for the senior citizens,” said society secretary Vijay Suryawanshi. With measures like these and more, the residents of MSR Olive created a self-sustaining system to deal with the pandemic and lockdowns. Suryawanshi said necessities like fruits and vegetables were made available on the society premises to reduce the need for venturing out. Society chairman Ravindra Akolkar said all the society members worked as a cohesive unit during the trying times. “From helping the patients to monitoring the entry of people, all the tasks were done as a team by the members. A number of practices introduced during the nationwide lockdown, such as monitoring of temperature and oxygen levels at the entry gate, are still being followed,” he said. Akolkar said the society also distributed food packets and grocery packages among the needy. The housing complex has 180 flats, with nearly 800 people residing in them. The residents also ensured testing of domestic helps and other support staffers at regular intervals. Financial help was provided to them, even when they couldn’t report to work during the lockdown last year. The society members used social media, including cellphone messaging apps, for spreading awareness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doctor-residents-help-two-housing-complexes-beat-the-covid-blues/articleshow/87071862.cms||---

In the past, the number of immersions on Dashami used to be fewer either because it sometimes coincided with other festivals or major Pujas waited for the Durga Puja Carnival held days later. This time, however, the situation is different. With a Sunday deadline to complete all immersions, organizers of several big Pujas queued up at various ghats along the Hooghly on Dashami itself. The immersion continued till 1.30am on Saturday. “Immersion of 60% idols was completed on Dashami,” a KMC official said. Bisarjan resumed on Sunday noon. Gautam Neogi, a key organizer of Bagbazar Sarbojanin Durgotsav committee, was happy at the end of a successful immersion process at Bagbazar ghat on Friday night. The committee members adhered to Covid-safety rules and did not make much fanfare. Similarly, Tridhara near Deshapriya Park decided to carried out the immersion silently without any pomp. “This year, we completed the immersion on Friday itself to discourage people from gathering at our pandal,” said Tridhara Puja committee secretary Debasis Kumar. While Bajekadamtolla ghat (Babughat) recorded immersion of 500 idols, majority of which belonged to community Pujas, the adjacent Judges’ Ghat saw the immersion of 550 idols, most of them household Pujas. The other major ghats were Bagbazar, Nimtola, Ahiritola ghat and Doi Ghat at Kidderpore. Elaborate arrangements were made by the KMC and Kolkata Police, keeping in mind the Covid protocols. While the KMC brass engaged hundreds of trained porters, along with separate teams from the solid waste management department equipped with cranes and payloaders, at the major ghats, police engaged around 150 officers, led by deputy commissioners, to keep a watch. This apart, the KP brass deployed DMG teams, each of whom have specialized divers and swimmers.  KMC and police restricted crowding at the ghats. “We are trying to restrict the number of people for home Pujas to three and from community Pujas to six-10 at the ghats. For others, we are setting up guard walls,” said a joint commissioner. Among other arrangements, special watch towers, drone monitoring and river patrolling have been set up. Four specialized vessels are being used for river patrolling at both Kolkata and Howrah ghats. Two specialized rescue teams on speed boats, each with five DMG men with scuba diving equipment, have been stationed near RTP jetty. A large number of KMC workers were found at all river banks in Kolkata and the flowers and infrastructure were removed immediately. Payloaders have been fishing out the idols structures to prevent pollution of the water. Port authorities said arrangements were made at Baje Kadamtala Ghat and Judges’ Ghat, where pontoon-mounted cranes and three mechanized boats were kept.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-carnival-this-yr-60-idols-given-send-off-on-dashami/articleshow/87071892.cms||Saikat Ray

Ali Daruwalla, national spokesperson of the All India Petrol Dealers Association, said diesel cost Rs 100.08 per litre on Saturday, an increase of 36 paise in a day. Petrol, which had crossed Rs110 per litre on Thursday, stood at Rs110.58 per litre on Saturday — a 33-paise increase. Petrol had crossed the Rs100-mark per litre in May this year. The increase in fuel prices was blamed on high international crude oil prices. However, high central and state government taxes levied on fuel are also among the main reasons, a source associated with the said. Different transport unions have been demanding that fuel be brought under the ambit of GST. But at a recent meeting, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the time was not right to bring petrol and diesel under GST. Transporters said the continuous rise in the fuel prices would affect all. “Transportation costs will further increase, and this will lead to a hike in prices of all commodities. Transporters cannot operate under losses and costs will be increased,” said Baba Shinde, president of Maharashtra State Vahan Chalak Malak Pratinidhi Sanghatna and Maharashtra director of AIMTC. “We have held talks with senior members of the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) and are planning an agitation — a nationwide protest or ‘chakka jam’. We should be able to decide our course of action by Sunday,” he told TOI. Another transporter said the per-km transportation cost of all commodities would increase further. “A 30% hike is expected looking at the current condition,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/diesel-price-in-pune-breaches-rs-100/l-mark-litre-of-petrol-costs-rs-110-58/articleshow/87071888.cms||Joy Sengupta

But this encounter could lead to a series of encounters in the southern region, like the past,” he said.The government should not make police personnel in the lower ranks scapegoats in the two incidents but fix responsibility on the SPs, deputy inspector general of police and the inspector general of police, he said. While expressing concern that the encounter could be used against political enemies, he said the human rights commission should probe both the encounters in the state this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/encounter-search-on-for-two-aides-of-history-sheeter/articleshow/87071889.cms||---

The BMC’s K-West Ward (Andheri) launched its vaccine-on-wheels drive this past Thursday where an AC BEST minibus, given to the ward to ferry Covid patients to quarantine centres at the peak of the pandemic, has now been converted into a vaccination van with doctors, civic staff and a fridge to store the vaccines. The van will provide both Covishield and Covaxin. Prithviraj Chavan, assistant municipal commissioner of K-West Ward, said the response has been “very good”. On October 15, the van could vaccinate 145 persons. “We have 27 civic vaccination centres which will continue and in addition the vaccination can will also be on the move. Apart from high footfall areas such as Juhu beach, we also plan to vaccinate those gathered near religious places, markets and housing societies,” he said, adding in those societies where maximum people are vaccinated, they will try to ensure 100% targets are met through the drive. An ambulance will be kept on standby in case of any adverse event following immunization. Rajul Patel, Shiv Sena corporator from the K-West Ward, said in case the housing society provides some space in the complex, the civic team of doctors will move out and vaccinate the persons in it. “If not, the van will be stationed in the housing society premises and locals would be given the shot. As the van will have both Covishield and Covaxin, people can choose any,” said Patel. Similar is the case with the BMC’s G-North (Dadar) Ward, which is also working on converting an existing ambulance into a vaccine van. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of the ward, said stickers will be pasted to indicate it’s a vaccination van. “We plan to cover areas like the Dadar markets which see many shoppers, corporate office localities and housing societies in the ward. The van will stop and vaccinate those who are eligible and then move to the next location. There will be a few chairs in it so that a beneficiary can sit for 30 minutes after being administered the vaccine. This way we will be able to cover a large section of the ward,” he said. The G-North Ward has decided to shut some centres where many have already been vaccinated and start a vaccine van to cover those still left.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-rolls-out-vaccine-on-wheels-drive-for-hsg-socs-public-spaces/articleshow/87071918.cms||Richa Pinto

Work on a new building for Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli will also begin in November. A hostel for Sion Hospital with almost 500 medical students and resident doctors will be constructed too. “We hope to perform the ground-breaking ceremony for a 500-bedded hospital in Bhandup next month,” he said. A 50-bedded facility will also come up in Chandivli and the BMC is likely to float a tender for the work soon. “The idea of setting up hospitals or increasing beds in our suburban hospitals is to ensure that people don’t have to travel to our superspecialty hospitals (KEM, Sion and Nair) every time they fall ill. We want to take healthcare closer to them,” added Kakani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-civic-body-to-bolster-health-infra-throw-open-new-hosp-bldgs-in-nov/articleshow/87072012.cms||---

It should make public the progress in the probe into her death case,” said Goa Pradesh Youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar. Members of the party’s youth wing visited the teen’s family on Saturday and assured that they would support them in their fight for justice. While her family later claimed that the girl was murdered, the police are yet to reveal how she met her end. Goa Congress media cell in-charge Amarnath Panjikar said that if the chief minister is really concerned about the safety of women, he should see to it that the investigation in the case is taken to the logical conclusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-seeks-status-of-teens-death-probe/articleshow/87073870.cms||---
---||Madurai||Students add to big crowd in Kodaikanal||Madurai: It looks like life is picking up back to pre-covid days in Kodaikanal as the inflow of tourists to the hill station has jumped manifold in the last few days owing to the long weekend. With restrictions on travel being lifted and schools also expected to reopen fully from November 1, over a lakh tourists are expected to visit.The normally three hour journey to Kodaikanal from Madurai took nearly five hours as there was heavy traffic to the hill station. As it was a long weekend people started visiting the hill station from Thursday. Hotel rooms were almost booked and smaller establishments hiked prices as the demand jumped. As in other places, complying with covid norms including masking was partial in the hill destination.“As schools are opening, it is like a two year extended holiday coming to an end. We wanted to make a quick tour to the nearest destination and Kodai it was,” said T Shanmugam, who had come with his family and friends.Kodaikanal assistant tourism officer M Ananthan said that the tourist inflow has been high over the last two days due to the long weekend. “Around 15,000 to 20,000 tourists visited the hill station per day and all the accommodations were fully booked over the weekend. The boat houses were also doing good business.”Traffic on the ghat roads was high because many tourists also made one-day trips . Thousands of vehicles on the roads of Kodaikanal also led to traffic congestion. The tourism officer said that this was expected to ease in the next three to four months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/students-add-to-big-crowd-in-kodaikanal/articleshow/87071929.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Pujas clock revenue rise in Kolkata, local economy gets a boost||KOLKATA: Durga Puja committees in the city claimed to have made up for a large portion of the loses they incurred last year owing to the pandemic and the consequent economic slowdown. After the sweeping second wave, as Covid cases gradually came down, business started picking up, albeit slowly, and for the Puja, more jobs were created than that last time, providing a shot in the local economy arm, prominent Puja committees said. Organizers generate revenue from multiple streams, including corporate sponsorships, advertisements on gates, banners, hoardings, advertisement in souvenirs, selling space for food stalls and melas and local subscriptions. For the past few years, the state government has also been distributing Rs 50,000 to each committee. Though the Puja, one of the biggest street festivals in the world, is held in September-October, the preparations begin at least six months earlier. From designers to decorators, from idol makers to priests, a mid-sized Puja generates employment for 100-150 people. The muted celebration last year had hit all revenue streams. But vaccination of a substantial part of the population in the city and suburbs and drop in Covid cases gave the committees the courage to celebrate the festival, and that, in turn, improved the economic situation.  “The situation was much better this year for all Puja organisers,” said Saswata Basu, general secretary of Forum For Durgotsab, a body of Puja organisers. “If last year the revenue from sponsorships, ads and subscription fell to 30% of the usual figure, it went up to 75%-80% this year. Several factors, like largescale vaccination, help from the government, lower number of Covid cases and improving economic situation helped,” said Basu, also the convenor of Hatibagan Sarbojanin. In 2019, a research commissioned by the British Council, on behalf of the state tourism department, revealed the economics surrounding Puja was about Rs 32,377 crore, 2.6% of Bengal’s GDP in 2019-20. “Last year, there was hardly any corporate sponsorship and individuals paid only half the subscription amounts. But this year, sponsorship increased by 50%.  We received many ads for our souvenirs and the number of banners also increased,” said Subhankar Roychowdhury, general secretary of Bhawanipore Durgotsab Samiti. The revenue finds its way to rural economy, too. “Artists, idol-makers, dhakis and labourers arrive in the city months ahead of the Puja. They are engaged by committees and the remuneration goes to their villages and towns,” said Swapan Mahapatra of Ekdalia Evergreen Club.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pujas-clock-revenue-rise-local-economy-gets-a-boost/articleshow/87071942.cms||Zeeshan Javed

On Saturday, 58,000 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the district. It would be scaled up to 70,000-80,000 daily in the next two weeks, said Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, the assistant health officer of the Pune circle. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said barring Ambegaon, Khed and Mulshi talukas in the district, the rest — Haveli, Daund, Bhor, Indapur and Baramati — had only 60-70% coverage. He directed officials to ensure house-to-house and near-home vaccinations, besides special drives on the two weekends in these talukas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stress-on-near-home-vaccination/articleshow/87071920.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The progressive caseload in PMR increased above 11.46 lakh and its total recoveries 11.22 lakh, the daily report issued by the district health office showed. Six people succumbed in the region on Saturday, including two each from the Pune and PCMC limits, and the rural pockets. This took PMR’s death toll to 19,031. As many as 14,752 samples were tested in PMR on Saturday, with day’s positivity at 2.16%.

---||Madurai||Chaos reigns at this Madurai rly crossing||Madurai: As the state continues to ease the lockdown with the fall in Covid-19 cases, not everybody has reasons to celebrate, like those living on the other side of Alagappan Nagar railway crossing in Madurai city. For them, the increasing traffic means a gruelling day ahead.Over a hundred vehicles, including two-wheelers, autos, cars and school vans are seen stranded at this spot during peak hours, leading to long queues on both sides blocking traffic on the NH also. The Alagappan Nagar railway crossing is about 100 metres away from National Highway 44 with over 5,000 houses in areas across the gate. Apart from Alagappan Nagar, the houses are spread over Avaniapuram, Jahindpuram, Muthupatti and Muthupatti extension. Vehicles going towards Aruppukottai road and airport on the other side of the city also use the crossing.Ten years ago, about 20 to 30 vehicles crossed at a time, mostly two-wheelers, but now, chaos reigns, say residents. Ambulances also get caught in this traffic, says N Shanmugam, who works in a hospital. He says his work place is just four kilometres away from his house and usually takes ten minutes to cover, but now it takes 30 minutes.Though there are two railway gates on the stretch, the other at Palanganatham three kilometres away with an underpass for vehicle movement, it gets flooded during rain. “When it rains, all traffic comes here from TVS Nagar and Palanganatham also, and vehicles get damaged trying to pass before the other,’’ said P Rajavel of Pandian Nagar.What adds to the problem is that the NH is badly damaged at the entrance to Alagappan Nagar and a big textile showroom has appeared across the road, and there is the bus stop next to it. There is a traffic policeman stationed thanks to VVIPs moving on TPK road, but one person can hardly make difference.Over 128 trains including goods trains pass through the stretch on normal days, according to Shanmugam. “Now, with all train services resuming, nobody is going to be able to cross the gate without spending a good one hour near it,’’ he said. Alagappan Nagar road is narrow and an ROB is ruled out. But residents say another bridge somewhere along the stretch would make a difference. “We have made representations to MLAs, district collectors, corporation commissioners and councillors, but to no avail. Taking the bridge at Palanganatham is the only option, but this adds two kilometres to their daily travel, and if they have to travel towards Thiruparankundram, it becomes a detour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/chaos-reigns-at-this-madurai-rly-crossing/articleshow/87071943.cms||---
---||India||MVA govt most corrupt in Maharashtra history: Fadnavis||MUMBAI: Calling the Uddhav Thackeray government the most corrupt in the history of Maharashtra, leader of the opposition in the assembly Devendra Fadnavis accused it of large-scale extortion on Saturday. A day after Uddhav’s claim that the Centre was misusing central agencies in the state, Fadnavis said the ED and CBI were here because courts had ordered investigations. “Uddhav must decide whether he is with those supplying and consuming drugs or with the agencies,” he said in Nagpur. Fadnavis said the I-T department had revealed that Thackeray’s was a government where dalals (brokers) held sway. He said the personal ambition of Thackeray was the reason why experienced politicians in Shiv Sena had not been made CM. He said years ago too it was Uddhav’s desire to rise over everyone else that had driven Narayan Rane and Raj Thackeray out of the party. He was referring to the CM’s comment on Friday that he had never wanted to be the head of government in the state. “For how long will Uddhav keep saying he didn’t want to be CM,” he said. He said people had voted for BJP-Sena alliance and not Congress and NCP, parties with which Uddhav tied up later. “You (Uddhav) have formed government by deceit,” Fadnavis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mva-govt-most-corrupt-in-maharashtra-history-fadnavis/articleshow/87075337.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Caution while hiring can help rule out impersonators||PUNE: The absence of an effective mechanism to regulate the services of domestic help and agencies which provide support staff, besides the tendency to hire without seeking their police verification, is a major hurdle in checking crimes some of them commit. “In a city like Pune where, apart from the local job seekers, a large number of migrants from within and outside Maharashtra arrive every day in search of livelihood, it is difficult to know if a person approaching us for a domestic worker’s job is from a sound background,” a Karvenagar society resident said. Some regulatory mechanism like registration and verification with the police and employers asking for verification certificate can help in resolving this issue to a great extent, he added. As of today, neither Pune nor Pimpri Chinchwad police have such enrolment and verification system. So much so, there is no information on the number of agencies involved in providing maids/domestic help to households employ them. "We are working on an action plan to monitor the activities of agencies providing domestic help,” said Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said. The issue is crucial from a safety point of view, especially senior citizens who stay alone, he added. Gupta said, “We will soon make the plan functional at police station level once we get all the inputs and feedback from our officers.” A service provider said maids or domestic help arrested in crimes at their employer’s place are not connected in any way with any agency. “Such independent people prefer working either on hourly basis or for limited periods. Initially, they work properly and then strike. People also hire in a hurry and this could prove costly as one does not know whom he/she has hired. Giving complete strangers access to your house is avoidable,” he added. Vijay Gunjal, owner of Vaishnavi services in Chinchwad, said, “The government must frame some rules and regulations whereby all such activities are controlled. Often, it has been seen that maids misbehave with clients or get involved in petty crimes or stop going to their workplace without any notice to their employers.” Another owner of an agency pointed out that quite often people are solely interested in knowing how much they would charge for monthly remuneration and don’t even ask for any verification. “If they get a maid at a lesser charge, they would hire. Such an approach needs to change as people can’t ignore their own safety considering that the servants get complete access to their homes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/caution-while-hiring-can-help-rule-out-impersonators/articleshow/87071988.cms||Sandip Dighe

The condition of the roads had worsened during the monsoon. Further, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation will also lay 150 roads. This project is estimated to cost Rs 18 crore, officials said. KMC chief city engineer Netradip Sarnobat recently held a meeting with road contractors and directed them to initiate repair work. "Now that the rains have stopped, road repairs will be carried out from October 20. The contractors responsible for 44 damaged roads have been told to repair them in two-three days. Moreover, around 150 new roads will be constructed in the city areas at a cost of Rs18 crore. Contractors have been asked to start work from Wednesday,” Sarnobat said. Sarnobat said the contractors have been told to submit their work schedule in two days and warned against delaying the roadwork.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/road-repair-works-in-city-to-start-from-wednesday/articleshow/87069858.cms||---

Though the gazette notification on both KRMB and GRMB came into existence from October 14, the state government has constituted a committee to study the protocols and measures before handing them over to the boards. With the delay in taking over projects, both KRMB and GRMB chairpersons are likely to send reports to the Centre explaining the situation on Monday, official sources said. Officials in CMO said there is no hurry for the government to issue GOs or immediately giving projects to the boards as the transition period for handing over projects is three months, which is recorded in the KRMB meeting. However, officials said as per the assurances, the government would hand over projects by taking some time. “A committee has already been constituted headed by the irrigation engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar to look into the issues and suggest to the government on how to go about it. The government wants to hand over six outlets, including Srisailam, Kalwakurthy, SLBC and Nagarjuna Sagar dam to the KRMB,” a senior official of CMO told TOI. However, the government made it clear that it did not agree to hand over the power houses on Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar to the Board. Irrigation department officials said that the KRMB cannot take over the projects unless the state government gives them officially. “The word ‘taking over’ of projects was not there in the gazette notification, it was ‘handing over’. Hence the Telangana government has to hand over them to the KRMB,” special chief secretary Rajat Kumar told TOI. Officials also point out that even during the hand over, the state government has been asked to depute irrigation officials to maintain and operate projects. “Whether the officials would be deputed on temporary basis or permanent transfer to the Centre, who will pay the salaries of these deputed engineers? Some projects were taken up by floating corporations and taking huge loans, who will repay these loans? All these issues need clarity,” a senior official of the irrigation department said. CM K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to hold a meeting with officials on the issue on Monday to take stock of the situation especially after the KRMB meeting and its implications on the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-to-take-time-to-hand-over-projects/articleshow/87068251.cms||Koride Mahesh

Anxious parents are hoping for special schools to be reopened in November as children have been out of school for more than one-and-a-half years.“There are no circulars issued or specific instructions of any sort for reopening special schools from the Tamil Nadu Commissionerate for the Welfare of Differently-Abled so far. However, since schools for all other classes are allowed to reopen, the same is being expected for special schools. We are also ready to reopen. Special schools also operate on very low strength of students compared to regular schools, so crowding will not be an issue,” said Vetrivel Murugan, secretary and founder, Neyam Special School.  “These children need the school environment to feel safe and also get the chance to socialize. Parents like us are also struggling and relying on special educators to help take care of them and keep them in a relaxed state,” said Thirumaran P, parent of a special child.Special educators said that students with special needs who are above 18 years and their parents are being encouraged to get vaccinated for Covid-19. “We are looking forward to it and will be happy to have the children back if the state government allows us,” said J Shamila Doris, general secretary, YMCA, Madurai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/spl-schools-keen-to-reopen-in-nov-await-govt-directive/articleshow/87071969.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Equipment worth Rs 123 crore is also being readied by the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation Limited. With 23 operation theatres and a specialized cardiac department to be functional at the complex, we discussed on how we will be bringing in the necessary manpower, including nurses, doctors and surgeons,” said Radhakrishnan. He also said that space for a parking area is also being ensured. “There will be a multi-level parking area. There is space behind the complex that could provide parking space for 400 cars. Layout planning will be done and any space will be used judiciously. We have also asked for old buildings at GRH main campus to be identified for decongesting,” he said. Developmental works are also being undertaken at the Madurai Medical College for Rs 112 crore to establish a new academic block, library and hostel buildings, which are likely to be completed by this year end.Radhakrishnan also inspected the AIIMS, Madurai site at Thoppur. “No one wants AIIMS to be just on paper.

---||Mumbai||Post Diwali, safe Aarogya status & 1 dose may open doors: Maharashtra health minister||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said a “safe” status on the Aarogya Setu app might be considered a permit for individuals who have taken a single dose of the Covid vaccine to participate in all activities in the opened-up sectors after Diwali, primarily due to the long gap between two Covishield shots. “We will examine the possibility of using the status on the Aarogya Setu app in case a person has taken a single dose of Covishield, as the current gap between its two doses is 84 days. If cases continue to remain low post Diwali, we will discuss it with the state task force members and experts,” he told TOI. Tope said he had approached the Centre regarding reducing the gap between the two doses of Covishield, but the central government authorities ruled it out. Besides Maharashtra, some other states had also approached the Centre to reduce the gap. A senior official of the Union health ministry on Saturday said as of now there is no plan to change the gap between the two doses of Covishield because scientific studies showed its higher efficacy with a longer interval. Another official said any changes would be made based on scientific evidence only and not on random demands. Recently, the state government in its guidelines for reopening cinemas, theatres and auditoriums from October 22 with 50% seating capacity gave the options of “safe status” on the Aarogya Setu app or Covid vaccination certificates as a permit to enter the facilities. “The alternative to show the health status on the Aarogya Setu app was allowed because many cannot complete the Covishield vaccination despite its availability because of the almost three-month gap between its two doses,” said a state health official. The state was allocated 1.8 crore Covishield doses for October against 39.74 lakh Covaxin doses. Nearly 57 lakh beneficiaries would be due for the second dose of Covishield in the coming month while 14 lakh would be due for the second Covaxin shot, said a state public health official. Till October 15, the state had administered 9.07 crore doses. Of these, a total of 6.29 crore (70%) were given to first dose beneficiaries. As many as 2.78 crore (30%) people have been completely vaccinated in Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-post-diwali-safe-aarogya-status-1-dose-may-open-doors-says-tope/articleshow/87072052.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Multiple police teams have now been deployed to recover the articles used in the crime. The confession was made during sustained questioning carried out at Shinde’s bungalow. According to senior police officers, the suspect has confessed in the presence of other family members and senior police officers. Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta indicated that the case is likely to get solved in another 24 to 48 hours. The 51-year-old English subject professor was found brutally murdered on Monday morning with his throat, wrists and an ear slit. His forehead and head had injuries from some blunt and sharp-edged objects. The body was found in the hall of his bungalow in the upscale locality of Sant Tukoba Nagar, N2 Cidco of New Aurangabad. In all, six people were present in the house at the time of the murder. The SIT, led by inspector Avinash Aghav and his subordinate teams, concentrated on the remaining five family members — especially the professor’s 43-year-old wife, 20-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son. Citing the preliminary probe, a senior police officer told TOI: “One of the five people in the immediate family of the professor has confessed to the crime. The suspect claims to have prepared to eliminate the professor for quite some time, making it a well-planned murder.” As soon as the two articles — a blunt metal object and one sharp-edged weapon — that were used in committing the crime are recovered, the accused will be taken on record,” said the officer while giving credit to a young police sub-inspector for playing a crucial role in the detection. The murder suspect has claimed of dumping the two objects in an unused well full of silt and garbage. Multiple fire brigade teams have been deployed to vacate the well. Earlier attempts of putting in a heavy magnet to remove the two articles from the well proved futile. Corroborating the forensic expert’s opinion that there were no signs of resistance, the murder suspect has claimed that the professor was attacked while he was fast asleep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/prof-shinde-murder-case-close-relative-confesses-sit-collecting-evidence/articleshow/87069892.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The DPCA receives complaints against police personnel from general citizens, police personnel and other departments. The complaints can be registered with the DCPA against policemen from the ranks of constable to senior police inspector. Shamrao Dighavkar (IPS), retired DIG, who was recently appointed member of the DPCA, said there is a steady flow of complaints against policemen from various departments. This year, from January to September, the DCPA had received 55 complaints. “The number of complaints this year dropped due to Covid-19 infection. Last year, i.e in 2020, the office had received 69 complaints, in 2019 there were 99 complaints and in 2018 there were 74 complaints from across Nashik division — comprising Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar and Nandurbar districts,” Dighavkar said. “As many as 89 cases have been disposed, while 201 are still pending with the DCPA. As of now the posts of investigating officers, who probe the complaints registered, are vacant. The investigating officers are retired DySPs. They can serve for a tenure of three years or till they attain the age of 65. The process of recruiting new investigating officers is underway,” he added. Once a complaint is lodged it is investigated by the officers concerned and heard in a court of appointed members of the DPCA. The judgment is sent to the state home department following which the convicted police personnel could face action from his department or a departmental enquiry can also be set up or an offence can be registered in a police station against him/her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/process-on-to-recruit-5-ios-for-police-complaint-body/articleshow/87058175.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Though he did not indicate with whom he said it, it could be surmised that he said it with either Mohan Babu or Vishnu. Srinivas Yadav assured the film industry that a meeting with chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao with representatives of the film industry would be facilitated to resolve the pending issues pertaining to the industry. “The CM is favourably disposed to the film industry and it is his interest to make Hyderabad a big destination for film production,” he said at a function at the Filmnagar Cultural Centre. Eleven members of Prakash Raj panel, who got elected, however, stayed away from the function as they had announced their resignations. Polls to the 900-member MAA were held on October 10. As could be made out from his speech, Srinivas Yadav put actor Mohan Babu in a senior league to that of Chiranjeevi. Mohan Babu, in his typical style, cautioned anyone from the film industry from vitiating the atmosphere and not allowing the elected body to go about its work. “Enough of all that has happened of everyone going on television and criticising one another,” he said. Vishnu said the MAA body would hold a meeting with the cinematography minister and the CM soon. He also proposed to meet the cinematography minister and CM of Andhra Pradesh. He said though AP cinematography minister Perni Nani had also been invited, he could not make it. Mohan Babu said Rajnikant sent in his wishes to Vishnu as he was also not able to make it to the function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/knew-vishnu-would-win-maa-chief-post/articleshow/87068313.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Pune||Post-Diwali, status on Aarogya Setu app may be considered as permit for single dose beneficiaries: Rajesh Tope||PUNE: The state health minister, Rajesh Tope, on Saturday said the “safe status” on the Aarogya Setu app might be considered as the permit for the individuals with single dose of Covid vaccine to participate in all activities in the opened-up sectors post-Diwali, primarily because of the long gap between two shots of Covishield. “We shall examine the possibility of using the status on the Aarogya Setu app in case a person has taken a single dose of Covishield, as the current gap between its two doses is 84 days. If cases continue to remain low post-Diwali, we shall discuss it with state task force members and the experts,” he told TOI. Tope said he had approached the Centre regarding reducing the gap between the two doses of Covishield, but the central government authorities ruled it out. Besides Maharashtra, some other states had also approached the Centre to reduce the gap. A senior official of the Union health ministry on Saturday said as of now, there was no plan to change the gap between the two doses of Covishield because scientific studies showed its higher efficacy with a longer interval. Another official said any changes would be made based on scientific evidence only and not on random demands. Recently, the state government in its guidelines for reopening cinemas, theatres and auditoriums from October 22 with 50% seating capacity gave the options of “safe status” on the Aarogya Setu app or Covid vaccination certificates as the permit to enter the facilities. “The alternative to show the health status on the Aarogya Setu app was allowed because many cannot complete the Covishield vaccination despite its availability because of the almost three-month gap between its two doses,” said a health official of Maharashtra. The state was allocated 1.8 crore Covishield doses for October as against 39.74 lakh Covaxin doses. Nearly 57 lakh beneficiaries would be due for the second dose of Covishield in the coming month, while 14 lakh would be due for the second Covaxin shot, said a state public health official. Till October 15, the state administered 9.07 crore Covid vaccine doses. Of them, a total of 6.29 crore (70%) were given to first dose beneficiaries. As many as 2.78 crore (30%) people have been completely vaccinated in Maharashtra. The state has set a target of conducting 9-10 lakh vaccinations daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/post-diwali-status-on-aarogya-setu-app-may-be-considered-as-permit-for-single-dose-beneficiaries-tope/articleshow/87072079.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Dr Bharat Patel, a resident of Ashwavila Bungalows on Sindhu Bhawan Road, in his FIR with Vastrapur police said that the incident took place on Friday evening, after the car of one of his relatives hit the car of Jitubha Vaghela and his son Pushpraj Vaghela. “When a relative, Jeel Mimansu Patel, was bringing my granddaughter Miska, 8, home from her tuition class, his car hit Vaghela’s car near our society, and the sound of the collision was heard at my house as well. I then rushed to the accident site,” Patel, who runs Samved Hospital in Navrangpura, said. As Bharat got there Jitubha and his son Pushpraj, who were armed with sticks, slapped him without any reason. After slapping him, Jitubbha hit Patel with a stick on his forehead and above the left eye, causing him to faint. Patel’s wife Darshana then took him to the side of the road. After the assault, Patel is only left with just 30% vision in the left eye. When Patel’s son, Dhyan, rushed to his rescue, the accused father and son along with three others hit him with sticks, tore his clothes and broke his spectacles. Another relative, Mimansu Patel, tried to rescue Dhyan but they also assaulted him as well, says the FIR. Patel later approached Vastrapur police and filed a complaint for causing hurt, use abusive words and abetment against Jitubbha Vaghela, Pushpraj Vaghela and three unknown persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/neighbours-beat-up-doctor-after-accident/articleshow/87069926.cms||---
---||Goa||18 new species of ants found in Goa||Old Goa: Scientists from Indian Institute of Science have found 18 new species of ants in Goa, and with this, the state is now home to 83 ant species, including seven endemic to the country. The research was conducted by scientists Pronoy Baidya and Sumanta Bagchi from Bengaluru’s Centre for Ecological Sciences. It was funded by the ministry of environment forest and climate change and the department of biotechnology. The research also indicates that lateritic plateaus in Goa, locally called sada, support high levels of ant diversity. The tiny creatures play several important ecological functions such as seed dispersion, pest management, and nutrient cycling, making it crucial to preserve lateritic plateaus for the well-being of humankind, states the research paper published in the Royal Entomological Society’s Insect Conservation and Diversity journal. “Lateritic plateaus are biodiversity refugia hidden within Goa and through ants, we have realised their ecological importance. Sadly, the majority of development occurs on such plateaus, as they are regarded as wastelands. This attitude must change, and future development activities must also take biodiversity management into account,” Baidya, the lead author of this study, told TOI. Additionally, the conversion of natural habitats to human uses will disrupt biodiversity and distribution of ants, and can also harm ecosystem functions like nutrient cycling, decomposition, pest control, and seed dispersal, thereby affecting human well-being, the paper said. Baidya said, “We have recorded five invasive species across the state. Our study has shown that currently these species are inching towards decimating local ant populations and are affecting several critical ecosystem functions like decomposition and seed dispersal by killing the native ants.” “One of the most important of these five species is the yellow crazy ant, which has already been able to wreak havoc in several island nations, like the famous Christmas Island,” Baidya said, adding, “Managing the yellow crazy ant will become an important challenge not only for Goa, but for India as well, because this species has encroached almost everywhere.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/18-new-species-of-ants-found-in-goa/articleshow/87072130.cms||---

Now, work on package-2 to connect Varanasi-Ghazipur (NH-29) with NH-2 in Chandauli is left and is expected to be completed by December 2022. The National Highway Authority of India’s project director Varanasi RS Yadav informed TOI on Saturday, “The ring road phase-2 package-I, which has been built with a total project cost Rs1011.29 crores including land acquisition and civil works, is almost finish for commuting. But, it will be opened for commuting immediately after its inauguration by the PM on October 25 after completing the minor works at few points.” The ring road phase-2 projects package-1 is of 17 km to connect NH-56 at Harahua with NH-2 at Mohansarai, said Yadav adding, with it almost two third works of the Varanasi ring-road project will be finished as the ring-road phase-1 works in 16.55 km area between Harahua on NH-56 and NH-29 had already been completed and was inaugurated by PM in November 2018. Since then the ring-road phase-1 is in use for commuting. Yadav said that works in package-2 of the ring-road phase-2 of the project in which NH-29 has to be connected with NH-2 in Chandauli district is 40% complete so far. A major bridge on river Ganga is being built and following clearing all hurdles in land acquisition, which hurdled the project, civil works in entire stretch of the package is in progress with an investment of Rs 1,300-crores. It will be completed by December 2022, he added. The ring-road project was announced in 2000 by then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. However, the project saw light of the day after the BJP-led NDA government returned to power at the Centre in 2014. The NHAI took up the project on a priority and launched its first phase in 2015. Foundation of this project was laid by President Ram Nath Kovind in March 2018, but works lingered due to protest of land owners, which delayed in completing the process of land acquisition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ring-road-phase-2-to-open-for-commuting-after-inauguration-by-pm/articleshow/87069948.cms||---

Shinde, a professor of English at Maualana Azad College, was brutally murdered in the wee hours of Monday and since then the SIT headed by crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav, assisted by almost a dozen officers and police constables, have been struggling to crack the case. “After failing to get desired cooperation from family members of the deceased, commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta has asked to rope in psychologists as well as psychiatrists,” a senior officer privy to the probe said. These psychiatrists will examine the behavior of the deceased’s family and will also interact with them to unwrap them on emotional and psychological front, so that they are more forthcoming with information about the incident. Sources in the SIT maintained despite discrepancies in the version of deceased’s wife, daughter and minor son, they are said to have continued to stick to their respective versions. Moreover, SIT’s struggle to find any outsider’s involvement in the murder has forced them to concentrate only on the family of the deceased, to get answers to the unanswered questions. Different police teams under the SIT have started looking for the sharp-edged weapon used in committing the crime that left Shinde with deep slits on his throat, wrists, an ear and vertical cuts on the head. A dedicated police team is also probing into what made deceased’s wife reach Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University’s vice chancellor’s bungalow on Tuesday morning seeking transfer to university’s sub-center at Osmanabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/prof-murder-case-unable-to-get-cooperation-from-family-police-to-rope-in-psychiatrists/articleshow/87058189.cms||---
---||Kochi||Torrential rain, landslides kill five in Kerala's Kottayam||KOTTAYAM/IDUKKI: Five people, including three of a family, were killed and nearly 20 went missing in rain related accidents in Kottayam and Idukki districts on Saturday. In Plappally in Kottayam’s Koottickal panchayat, a landslide struck two hilly areas, washing away three houses and one shop around 12 noon. According to local residents, there were more than 10 people in the locality when the incident occurred which isolated the region from the outside world making rescue and search operations extremely difficult. As per the request from the state government to assist the civil administration in disaster management, Army has sent a team to Koottickal. The team, which reached Kanjirappally by evening, will be holding search operations in the locality. Incessant rains have made search operations difficult during the night. Power supply to the region has been snapped after the landslide. Since the weather is bad, a plan to deploy Airforce was put on hold. Revenue minister K Rajan is camping in the district to coordinate the rescue operations in the district. The bodies of two persons were recovered from a car that was washed away in floodwaters in Thodupuzha. As many as eight persons have reportedly gone missing after landslides struck Kokkayar near Kottayam border---four houses were washed away in Pullana River following the landslide. Five children, two men and a women were among those who went missing after the incident. While local residents rescued two persons, the search for the remaining people were still on, said officials. Several villages along the high ranges have been isolated after road access into these areas were cut off after a bridge was washed away at Yendayar. As the roads were blocked, local people were conducting the rescue works. Fire force personnel and an NDF team have been sent to the area, said officials. According to minister of cooperation V N Vasavan, three bodies retrieved from the landslide site at Koottickal have been identified. The deceased are: Claramma Joseph (65), Sini (35) and Sona (10), all belonging to one family. Since the region has been cut off from the rest of the region following the landslide, the search operations were conducted by local residents. Heavy losses were reported in the hilly regions in Kottayam. Traffic was disrupted as the roads got inundated in Koottickal, Mundakkayam, Erumely, Kanjirappally, Erattupetta and Pala following the flooding of the tributaries of Manimala and Meenachil rivers. Kanjirappally town was flooded for the first time in years, said its residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/torrential-rain-landslides-kill-five/articleshow/87072223.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After hand transplant, man’s kin may have to sell farm to meet post-op cost||MUMBAI: Rajasthan youngster, Jagdev Singh (22), is stable after undergoing hand transplant — the third in the city — that lasted 12 hours as against the usual 16-18 hours. The operation began around 8pm at Global Hospital, Parel, on Friday after the hands, which belonged to a 50-year-old man, were transferred from Ahmedabad Civil Hospital within two hours. While his father and brother-in-law were happy to hear about blood flowing through his newly transplanted arms, they were tied up with making arrangements to stay in the city for a year for the much-needed rehabilitation. “We may need to sell our farm if we are not able to raise adequate funds,” said Nirmal Dhillon, who is married to Jagdev’s sister. Hand transplants cost between Rs 22 lakh and Rs 26 lakh. However, the hospital has started a donation drive to help Jagdev’s family with finances. In January 2020, Jagdev was trying to fix the borewell in the family’s farm in Hanumangarh, close to the Pakistan border, when he came in contact with a high-tension wire. He was in a hospital in Rajasthan for a month before his arms and legs had to be amputated. “He was in second-year BA, but had to stop,” said Dhillon, adding that the youngster was a kabaddi champion.  “His only aim after the accident was to see his own pair of hands. It has thankfully come true,” said Dhillon. Jagdev read about Global Hospital’s hand transplant programme on the internet and came down to Mumbai for the first time in August and registered for the transplant. The family got a call late on Thursday about the potential donor in Ahmedabad and rushed to Mumbai immediately. According to Dr Nilesh Satbhai, the plastic surgeon who carried about the transplant, Jagdev’s procedure was not only shorter than usual, but he needed six units of blood as against 20 needed during the city’s first hand transplant carried out in August 2020. “The surgery was challenging as both the limbs had different levels of amputation and we couldn’t do mirror activity on them,” he said. While his right arm was amputated below the elbow, the left is above the elbow. It will take another four to five days before the doctor can breathe easy. “We have to wait that long to check the survival of the transplanted organ,” said Dr Satbhai. Jagdev will stay in hospital for a month. Dhillon said that the whole family had kept the youngster motivated with words. “He has family support and believes in solving problems rather than dwell on them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-hand-transplant-mans-kin-may-have-to-sell-farm-to-meet-post-op-cost/articleshow/87072117.cms||---

The Bharat Milap, an enactment of the 'Ramcharitmanas’ episode of the reunion of Lord Rama with his brothers after an exile of 14 years, is held annually on the next day of Vijaya Dashami at the historic ground of Nati Imli in presence of the royalties of Kashi. The Nati Imli Bharat Milap is a part of the famous Ramlila of Ramnagar, the capital town of the King of Kashi. While the month-long Ramnagar Ramlila could not be organised on the second consecutive year due to Covid-19 scare, the Bharat Milap was held with religious fervour. Scores of people assembled at Nati Imli to watch the heartening moments of the reunion. Legend says that a disciple of the great poet Tulsidas who composed Ramcharitmanas, Megha Bhagat, started the enactment of Ramlila after being told in dream to dramatise the Bharat Milap. He staged the scene at Nati Imli, and at the moment of dramatic climax, the legend says, he collapsed and died. It also became a tradition that the Maharaja of Banaras on this day attends the Nati Imli performance with all royal paraphernalia. Traditionally, the children playing the roles of divine characters are brought to the ground of Nati Imli for public viewing of their reunion. For locals, the Bharat Milap or Ramlila is an embodiment of the religious text. A huge crowd of people keeps waiting for hours at Nati Imli ground to watch this happening of a few minutes. The Bharat Milap is a part of Ramlila organised at different places by different organisations during the Shardiya Navratri festival. But, the Ramlila of Ramnagar has its own uniqueness. It is enacted in its pristine form without any modern aide like light and sound system. People from different places, including foreigners come to Ramnagar to watch the enactment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ram-bharat-reunite-after-a-year-at-nati-imli/articleshow/87069961.cms||---

---||Goa||Biodiversity board begins drive to document wild mushrooms||Panaji: The Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB) has initiated a statewide drive through its biodiversity management committees to identify and document hitherto unreported mushroom species of Goa. These include varieties known as khut or khutyaliolami, toshaliolami, sonyaliolami and chonchyaliolami, among others. “If traditional knowledge is not documented and people are not reminded of it, there is a fear of losing it,” GSBB member secretary Pradip Sarmokadam, said. The mushroom species are often harvested by people in the hinterlands. While the GSBB has roped in experts to report these species, the team will also document the knowledge of forest and tribal communities. “When tribals in Cotigao, Canacona, extract mushrooms from a certain ant-mound, they hoist the twig of a particular plant to indicate that the mound has been visited. They also leave some quantity of mushrooms on the mound so that new mushrooms can be harvested the following year. This sustainable practice already exists in their culture,” Sarmokadam said. The GSBB is closely working with the forest department and microbiologist and expert on roinn olmi (wild) variant of mushrooms, Nandkumar Kamat, for the documentation. Kamat stressed on the need to conserve these species because the loss of local diversity means a loss to the Western Ghats. “Goa has the world’s richest gene pool of genus Termitomyces with 35 recorded species so far, but it’s impossible to see 15 of these species in the wild. Taders don’t care about distinction between species, but will plunder, collect and market whatever they can. The first impact of the species’ indifferent and indiscriminate marketing is the erosion of the 130-million-year-old gene pool,” he said. The GSBB had earlier appealed to consumers to discourage the exploitation of such wild mushrooms by not purchasing them and had appealed to all those involved in plucking, sorting, packing, and sale to “leave behind at least 50% mushrooms in young stages on the termite mounds for conservation”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/biodiversity-board-begins-drive-to-document-wild-mushrooms/articleshow/87073925.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad city police opt for digital dry panchanama||Aurangabad: The city police have become the first unit in the eight districts of the Marathwada region to start opting for dry digital panchanama, which refers to recreation of the crime scene without any alteration and based on the evidence available with investigating authorities, to take cases to logical end. The dry digital panchanama caught attention of police authorities in the state after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in April this year recreated a crime scene with now dismissed Mumbai police inspector Sachin Vaze in the Antilia Bomb Scare case. Vaze was made to wear a PPE kit during recreation of the crime scene and the entire event was video-recorded before sending it, along with the CCTV footages, for forensic analysis. In Aurangabad city, two dry digital panchanamas, including one in on Friday evening, were carried out in the Osmanabad area, following commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta’s directives. In the latest dry digital panchamana, robbers in a chain snatching case were made to recreate the crime scene. Gupta said the dry digital panchanama was a “scientifically proven way of overcoming the limitations of getting eye witnesses and carrying out identification in cases such as chain snatchings, house break-ins, thefts, robberies and even body offences committed by criminals while hiding their faces with face masks or helmets. He said even a single CCTV footage of the suspect caught either during night or day, whether masked or not, was sufficient for carrying out a dry digital panchanama and sending it for analysis to forensic experts. “The experts scientifically analyse such a panchanama and confirm if the suspect caught on the CCTV and the one who was part of the dry digital panchanama is same or not.” he said. Inspector Geeta Bagwade of the Osmanpura police said, “We utilize boots, clothes, handkerchiefs, masks, helmet as well as vehicle used by the criminals for recreating a crime scene. The entire recreation is video-graphed from different angles and sent for forensic analysis.” A former cyber police station chief, Bagwade said the method “helps in proving the identity and involvement of the suspect in a crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-city-police-opt-for-digital-dry-panchanama/articleshow/87058222.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘40% of adults with Covid-19 in intensive care had obesity’||MUMBAI: Four out of 10 adults with Covid in the intensive care unit had obesity, according to a new European study, underlining how body mass index plays a role in causing severe Covid. “There is a higher risks of prolonged hospitalization and death in ICUs for patients with obesity,’’ concluded the study by University of Gothenburg, that has been published in the latest edition of medical journal ‘PLoS One’. In Mumbai, doctors said the proportion of obese patients in ICUs was around 30%. “It was one of the common factors among those admitted to my ICU,’’ said Dr Rahul Pandit, who heads the ICU in Fortis Hospital, Mulund, and is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid. He said obesity and diabetes were equally found in ICU patients of Covid. Dr Shashank Joshi, also a member of the task force, said, “In India, the most common risk factor among those with severe Covid and deaths was hypertension, followed by diabetes.’’ But, as obesity is common to both these conditions, it is certainly a risk factor. “Obesity was an underlying condition in many cases. During the first wave, one of our patients, a 35-year-old man who was obese but had no other comorbidity succumbed to Covid,’’ added Dr Joshi. Dr Avinash Supe, who was a part of the death committee that analysed Covid deaths during the two waves, said that hypertension was found in 44% of the deaths and diabetes among 42%. “Overall 60-65% had comorbidity including ischemic disease, lung disease and cancer (some had double or triple disease). Obesity as comorbidity was in 10-15% and predominantly in young patients who died,’’ said Dr Supe. A previous study published in ‘Immunity & Ageing’ journal listed reasons an obese person is more vulnerable to Covid-19: Most obese people have diseases such as renal insufficiency, diabetes and heart problems, that make them doubly vulnerable. Secondly, immunity at the cellular level is impaired in obese individuals .The author of the new PLoS study from Sweden, Lovisa Sjögren, said obesity increased the risk of death, and even among those who survive, it increased the risk of 14-day stay in ICU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-40-of-adults-with-covid-19-in-intensive-care-had-obesity/articleshow/87072231.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Wife files complaint alleging sodomy||AHMEDABAD: A 45-year-old woman who works for a private company on Friday filed a complaint alleging domestic violence and unnatural sex against her husband of 18 years. The accused runs a large IT company, officers of Navrangpura police said. The woman, a resident of Navrangpura, in her complaint said that her husband, 48, hit her over petty issues soon after their wedding and kept demanding unnatural sex, a police officer said. He said she was abandoned by her husband four months ago and has been living with her parents ever since. In her FIR, the complainant said that her husband would demand unnatural sex, against her wishes, and when she resisted, he would beat her up. “The man, under the influence of porn films, used to force his wife to have unnatural sex. She had told the cops that he used to beat her over petty issues and even abandoned her every now and then,” said a police officer. The officer said that she was forced to reach compromises every time they split due to pressure from her family and peers, but as he did not change his behaviour, she finally decided to approach the police. The woman said she kept quiet for a long time as her husband runs a large company and could use his money to influence the police as well. Inspector R J Chudasama of Navrangpura police said a complaint under the Domestic Violence Act and IPC Section 377 (unnatural sex) has been registered against the man and an investigation is underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wife-files-complaint-alleging-sodomy/articleshow/87070042.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s ASI office loses key science branch to Mumbai||HYDERABAD: The all-important science branch of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in the city has been shifted to Mumbai. This leaves Telangana and Andhra Pradesh without a science section in the ASI circle offices to carry out the research part of conservation of monuments. It was the common science branch of ASI for Hyderabad and Amaravati circles that together have 139 monuments of unparalleled historical and heritage value. Ironically, the shifting of the science branch comes at a time when the 800-year-old Ramappa temple got the Unesco world heritage site tag. The branch was set up in Hyderabad in 1953 and it was instrumental in securing the Unesco recognition for Ramappa as it was the first research body to scientifically prove that “floating” bricks were used in the construction of the Kakatiya period stone monument. Moreover, union minister G Kishen Reddy, who also looks after the archaeology portfolio, hails from Hyderabad. The ASI in its office order (no 247/2021-admn.I) issued on October 13 refers to the shifting of the science branches in New Delhi and Hyderabad to Sarnath in Uttar Pradesh and Mumbai respectively, without assigning any reasons. On one hand the ASI order talks of the revival of 41 posts and creation of 758 new posts across different cadres for strengthening the premier archaeological body, but on the other, it closes down the Hyderabad branch by shifting it to Mumbai. INTACH Hyderabad convener P Anuradha Reddy told STOI that the decision to shift the office was unfortunate as it will impact the scientific conservation of Ramappa and several monuments in the tentative or proposed lists for the Unesco tag. ASI has three main branches – conservation, science and horticulture. The science branch is important as it does research on the material used in the monument and protection from the vagaries of nature and pollution from vehicles and industries, she added. With the shifting of the science office to Mumbai, it will be a difficult task for the ASI to keep scientific work going in Andhra Pradesh, which has 131 protected monuments and Telangana, which has 30 archaeological sites and structures. Maharashtra already has two science branches and the Mumbai one will be the third. Uttar Pradesh too has two science branches. Kerala, which has less than 30 protected monuments, has its own science branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-asi-office-loses-key-science-branch-to-mum/articleshow/87070071.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Row over bike parking leads to murder of businessman in Dabri||NEW DELHI: Following a dispute over parking of a motorcycle, two men allegedly shot dead a 27-year-old businessman in Dabri area on Friday. The man who died has been identified as Afroz Alam, a resident of Dabri. The incident took place around 10.30 pm when Alam, whose father runs a garment factory, was present at the factory in Mahavir Enclave part two. According to the witnesses, Alam had got some material delivered to the factory and had come down to receive the same when he saw two men on a motorcycle sitting in front of the entrance of the factory. "When Alam asked them to move aside, the two men, who were reportedly inebriated, refused to obey. This led to an argument, which soon turned into a fist fight. During the fight, one of the two men took out a pistol and shot Alam in his head. As Alam collapsed, the two men sped away," said a senior police officer. Locals and factory workers, including Alam's elder brother, took him to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital where the doctors declared him dead. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Shankar Choudhary said that a case of murder had been registered based on the statement of Alam's brother. "Multiple teams have been formed and raids are underway to arrest the two suspects who are absconding. Initial inquiry has revealed that the reason behind the murder was parking of motorcycle in front of the gate of a factory run by the deceased man’s father. Further investigation is under progress,” the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/row-over-bike-parking-leads-to-murder-of-businessman/articleshow/87074217.cms||---

The incident occurred on October 14. The arrested include criminal on police record Sunny Mhetre (32) from Bhavani Peth and his accomplice Sagar Baggan (33) from Lohegaon. A first information report (FIR) relating to extortion was registered by lawyer Seemin Shaikh (35) from Bhagyodayanagar in Kondhwa. Seemin told TOI, “Four men blocked the access roads leading to two housing societies passing via the defence land and converted them into pay-n-park scheme by installing barricades.” “On October 14, I removed my bike parked in the parking lot of one of the societies where I run a shop. The suspects blocked my way by putting a barricade in front of my vehicle and demanded parking fees,” she said. “I refused to pay the parking fee because I did not park my bike in the pay-n-park scheme, but the suspects threatened me with dire consequences. They also threatened to vandalise my vehicle and snatched Rs200 from my hand and then only allowed me to go. I registered an FIR relating to extortion, wrongful restraint among other charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code because the suspects are in the habit of harassing and extorting money from residents of housing societies and others,” she added. Sub-inspector Sanjay Gaikwad from crime branch (unit I) said, “We have arrested Mhetre and Baggan following a tip-off and transferred their custody to the Cantonment police station for further action.” Senior inspector Ashok Kadam from Cantonment police said on Saturday, “A preliminary inquiry conducted before registering the FIR revealed that the PCB contractor’s employees were blocking access roads leading to the housing societies and were forcing residents to pay parking fee, which is wrong in the eyes of law. Two suspects on the run will be arrested at the earliest.” The Pune Cantonment Board’s chief executive officer Amit Kumar told TOI, “The land belonging to the defence estate office, Pune circle, was handed over to the Pune Cantonment Board for running a pay-n-park scheme. I will collect details about the incident and take a call on taking action against our contractor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pay-and-park-staffers-held-in-extortion-case/articleshow/87070080.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Mumbai||Long weekend: At 1,553, lowest Covid cases in Maharashtra in 17 months||MUMBAI: Blame it on the long weekend, but lower testing rates led to a sharp drop in daily cases in both the state as well as the city on Saturday. The state tally of 1,553 is the lowest in 17 months, and the last time the toll was lower than this was on May 13 (1,495). Only 1,00,944 tests were done across the city as against 1.5 lakh on an average; 33,002 of these tests were done in Mumbai. In Mumbai, which registered 500-plus cases on five days this month so far, the caseload dropped by 35% from 480 on Friday to 333 on Saturday. Daily deaths too dropped to 26 and three in the state and city, respectively. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the sharp drop in cases registered on Saturday is most likely the result of fewer tests conducted due to the Dussehra holiday. Fewer people turned up for both testing and vaccination during the last few days of Navratri. “But we must note that in May 2020, when we last had such a low caseload, the daily tests performed were lesser than 70,000 on an average. So the daily test positivity rate is much lower now than during the first or the second waves,” he said. In Mumbai, doctors said that despite the rise in cases as compared to August (when the lowest daily tally was 196), hospitalisation rates hadn’t correspondingly increased. Dr Kedar Toraskar, a member of the state task force on Covid and head of the ICU in Wockhardt Hospital in Agripada, said vaccination has made a difference in the city. “Most of those needing hospitalization are unvaccinated while a few are vaccinated. Those with complications are definitely unvaccinated,’’ said Dr Toraskar. The number of ICU admissions hasn’t gone up significantly even though cases in the city have doubled since restrictions were eased almost two months back. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare told TOI the health department is focusing on five wards, including D (Malabar Hill), E (Byculla) and T (Mulund), where there has been a noticeable increase in daily tally. While cases in Akola and Nagpur regions were in single digits, Latur and Amravati divisions registered double-digit tally on Saturday. Mumbai region with 582 cases was ahead of Pune (402), Nashik (385) and Kolhapur (119) divisons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/long-weekend-at-1553-lowest-cases-in-state-in-17-mths/articleshow/87072300.cms||---

Chairing a meeting to review the functioning of the health department, Nitish asked the officials concerned to maintain special vigil on the people arriving from other states at all the railway stations, bus stands and interstate border check posts and also make necessary arrangements for Covid-19 test at all these places. “If the people reaching Bihar are not found vaccinated, they should be inoculated,” Nitish told the officials. “The natives of Bihar residing in other states should be informed through different mediums to carry their vaccination certificates and RT-PCR test reports during travel,” he added. The CM also asked the officials to ensure early vaccination of remaining people in the state. “Vaccinate all those people who could not get jabs due to non-availability of Aadhaar card by using any other document for the purpose of identification,” Nitish said. He also stressed on the need to increase number of Covid-19 tests in the state. Additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit made a detailed presentation before the CM on works being done to check different diseases, including Covid-19. Amrit told the CM that Covid vaccination drive would be intensified before Chhath. He said the health department would organise a door-to-door campaign on October 18, 19 and 20 to motivate people to take their second vaccine doses. He said the WHO recently conducted a survey in East Champaran district and found 96% people vaccinated there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-cov-test-must-for-those-coming-to-bihar/articleshow/87070072.cms||Madan Kumar

He said most of the protestors are from Punjab and that the nation cannot afford to upset farmers of Punjab. “In the past, the country paid the price for upsetting Punjab,” Pawar said, apparently referring to the assassination of former prime minister Indira Gandhi. Pawar, who has handled defence and agriculture portfolios at the Centre, said he visited the protest sites two or three times and said the Union government’s stand on the farmers’ demands “does not seem rational”. Pawar said, “I advise the Union government to not upset the farmers of Punjab, which is a border state. If we upset farmers and people from border regions, there will be consequences.” Pawar said people living in border areas face several security-related issues which residents of states such as Maharashtra do not experience and so, when the farmers sit in protest for this long, paying attention to them was of “national importance”, Pawar said. The farmers are demanding the Centre repeal laws passed in September that they say will ruin their livelihoods. The government insists the new policy will benefit the growers and refuses to withdraw the legislation. After months of protests, more than 10 rounds of talks and a Supreme Court order to temporarily suspend the laws, the government says it would consider some amendments and could delay implementation by as much as 18 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/handle-farmers-stir-with-sensitivity-ncp-chief-to-centre/articleshow/87070103.cms||---

Based on the complaint lodged by a 22-year old woman, the suspect has been booked on charges of sexual harassment and stalking. In addition to this, sections of the Information and Technology Act, 2000 and section of Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986, have also been slapped on the accused. Sambhaji Pawar, police inspector said, “The woman works at a mall and recently found that an unidentified person had created her fake profiles on Instagram and uploaded her morphed pictures, eventually defaming her amongst family and friends.” The woman lodged a police complaint two weeks back. With the help of cyber police, we found the IP address from which these accounts were made. “We have not only deactivated fake profiles but also identified the suspect, who is complainant’s former college mate,” said Pawar. The officers probing the case said the victim and the suspect knew each other since college. After she turned down his proposal, he allegedly started bothering her. The suspect might have sourced the victim’s pictures from her original social media accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-booked-for-posting-womans-morphed-pics/articleshow/87058244.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Diesel in Nagpur crosses Rs 100 a litre, truckers for higher freight||NAGPUR: Diesel rates in the city have crossed the Rs100-mark. On Thursday, fuel outlets opened with petrol costing Rs111.15 a litre while diesel was Rs 100.34. Diesel has already crossed the Rs102-mark in some pockets of the region or it is close to that level. In Amravati, it is already at Rs103.69, making it the costliest in the region. A quick check at the rate list of one of the PSU oil marketing companies showed that in far-off places, the fuel was over Rs102 or close to it. For example in Sironcha, it is Rs102.53 a litre while in Yavatmal, it was Rs101.88. Diesel rates are being blamed to have already impacted the costing in an entire gamut of items. A further rise can be expected as truckers are pressing for higher freights. A number of transporters have stopped taking orders as they find the current rates not feasible. Nandkishore Gaur, who heads the vegetable brokers’ association at Kalamana Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), says in over a month, rates of all the vegetables have almost doubled. The average cost is not below Rs30 a kg in bulk markets. The rates of some vegetable are in the range of Rs180 per kg, he said. The rates of construction material like cement and steel have gone up during the last two months which has left the industries and realty sector complaining. “Steel rates have gone up by 20% in around two months touching Rs60,000 a tonne. Even copper, which was in the range of Rs80 a kg, is now Rs100. A number of products have become costlier,” said Dipen Agrawal, a steel trader and president of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT). A similar impact has been seen in cement rates too. “Over a couple of months ago, it was in the range of Rs250-Rs300 a bag. It’s Rs 380 to 400 now. There are other factors apart from fuel rates too,” said Anil Nair, a builder. “The demand for diesel vehicles in family car segments has taken a hit. Diesel version is not being preferred for cars up to Rs6 lakh. However, the demand is steady for costlier vehicles,” said Anuj Pande, president of Vidarbha Automobile Dealers Association. Kukku Marwah, president of Nagpur Truckers Unity an association of transporters, said a meeting was held with industries representatives recently. The transporters have been pitching for higher rates. The current rate from Nagpur are around Rs3,500 a tonne for Kolkata, Rs2,700 for Chennai, Rs2,800 for Delhi, and Rs2,200 for Mumbai. “These are just not enough to break even. The rates should be easily more than Rs4,000/tonne. A number of truckers have stopped plying because of low rates,” he said. Viren Thakkar of Logistics Parks (India) Private Limited said companies across a number sectors are not considering a hike demanded by the transporters to cover diesel costs. This has also led to a stalemate-like situation. The transporters are not accepting the rates offered by the companies leading to trucks standing idle. There is a shortfall of at least 22% in the current freight as compared to diesel rates. Farmers are a feeling the pinch in the form of increase input cost. “It’s harvesting time. If a harvester’s machine is to be engaged, the rates are up to Rs3,000 an acre which is double than last year. Farm hands have also doubled the rates,” said Vijay Jawandhia, a farm activist from Wardha. Manoj Jawanjal, director of Mahaorange, the state’s orange marketing company, said rates of tractor on rent is costing Rs850 an hour as against Rs600-Rs700. The rent for rotavators used for levelling fields is Rs700 an hour from Rs500 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/diesel-crosses-rs100-a-litre-transporters-fight-for-higher-freight/articleshow/87070107.cms||Shishir Arya

With extremely heavy rainfall lashing the district, landslides and flash floods were reported from many parts of Idukki. The car was washed away around 2pm at Moonnunkavayal Bridge. The bodies of Koothattukulam residents Nikhil Unnikrishnan (29), and Nima K Vijayan (31) were recovered within a couple of hours of the incident. Police said they had come from Vagamon and that the mishap occurred while they were on their way to Moonunkavayal. Local residents said they warned them not to cross the bridge but they drove ahead and the car got stuck. Before they could escape a flash flood washed them away. While Nima’s body was recovered around 500 meters from the accident spot, the body of Nikhil was retrieved from the stream after a search by fire and rescue force personal and local residents. The bodies were shifted to a private hospital for post-mortem. A major landslide was reported at Pullupara near Kuttikkanam on Kollam-Theni national highway on Saturday morning. Boulders and mud crashed down on to the highway and traffic along the route was blocked. Landslides were also reported in Thumpachi, Manappadi, Elappally, Eadad, Poochapra, Valaketti, Koovappally and Kumbalanganam areas. The district administration has banned tourism related activities. The traffic on the Gap Road stretch of Koch-Dhanushkodi national highway has also been stopped. Due to landslides and flash floods traffic was disrupted along Kollam-Theni National Highway, and Kuttikkanam -Kattappana and Thodupuzha- Puliyanmala routes.  The water-level in Idukki reservoir rose over 2.25ft in a single day from 2391.02ft to 2,393.54ft, which is 88.72% of the storage level, officials said on Saturday. The full reserve level here is 2,403.50ft. The water level had crossed the blue alert level and touched 2390.86ft on Friday. KSEB chief engineer (dam safety and DRIP) Supriya S said KSEB is closely monitoring the situation in all hydel dams, including, the Idukki Dam. "On Saturday, the catchment area of Idukki reservoir received extremely heavy rainfall and it resulted in the sudden rise in water level. KSEB is monitoring the water level every hour. A high level meeting was called to review the situation," the official said. "The central water commission has allowed to follow “dynamic flood cushion" in Idukki. But the unexpected rainfall has resulted in an increase in the water level. KSEB is also considering to open the reservoir if the water level reaches 2,396.86ft red alert will be sounded. At present it is at over 4ft below that level," said the official. Earlier the Central Water Commission has given the permission to maintain the water level till the full reservoir level (FRL) in flood seasons. The FRL of the dam is 2403ft. As per dynamic flood cushion the increasing water level should decrease within ten days after the flood days. The shutters of the Kallarkutty, Malankara and Lower Periyar dams were opened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/car-swept-away-bodies-of-two-occupants-recovered/articleshow/87072417.cms||---

Nansekar approached the agriculture technology management agency (ATMA) office in North Goa and sought assistance for the initiative, which at the time was a pilot project. He was provided technical support by ATMA block technology manager, Poonam Mahale, to grow tomato seedlings in bags with soil compost media. He planted 75 tomato seedlings across 20sqm. The space was covered with a shading net and stalk support was given to the seedlings. His venture invited the curiosity of his neighbours as they witnessed the growth of the juicy reds and eventually became his first customers for the harvested crop. With such an encouraging response to his pilot project, Nansekar has now decided to replant more seedlings in the same grow bags. “He learned the nitty-gritty and skill set to grow tomatoes through various sources and implemented them. His passion for farming has borne him the fruit of his hard work,” agriculture officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bicholim-man-reaps-40kg-tomatoes-via-terrace-farming/articleshow/87073943.cms||---
---||Goa||Young Indian players are improving, they need more games: Owen Coyle||Panaji: Owen Coyle has seen it all in world football. The Scottish manager led Burnley into the Premier League via the Championship playoffs back in 2009, defeated Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United – as defending champions – in the Premier League season opener and then saw some of his own teams struggle. When he landed in India at Chennaiyin FC midway through the 2019-20 season, there wasn’t much hope for the club. But Coyle worked his magic and dragged the team from the bottom to the final, which they lost against ATK. Last season at Jamshedpur FC, Coyle didn’t taste success. But his stay here is not just about taking the team to the Indian Super League (ISL) playoffs and winning trophies. “For me, the development of young Indian players is very important,” Coyle told TOI. “Being football lovers, we want to help in the development. We want the national team to be doing well. In the next four or five years, if India takes up the challenge, they can move to the next level. “The young players are improving. What they need is more games and better infrastructure. I am happy that there are investments in football. The potential is massive, with the young players I see. They deserve an opportunity to grow and develop.” The Scottish-born, former Republic of Ireland international striker has walked the talk. During his time at Chennaiyin, Coyle had a chance to put across his views to organisers of the ISL and he did not miss that. “We had a meeting of the coaches (with ISL). I advocated for more games and reduction of foreign players. Foreigners are good players and they bring a lot to the league, but equally, reduction is an opportunity for another young Indian player to step up,” said Coyle. While the number of games in the country’s top-tier league will remain unchanged at 20 for this season, there is a change in ISL’s foreign policy which started with six in 2014 and has now reduced to four. Last season clubs could use five foreigners. “This is a chance for us to help in the development of Indian players. Of course, there will be challenges with the reduction in foreign players. Last year, we saw most teams use two centre-backs, striker, number 10. Now, you’ll have to take a call depending on your opponents,” said Coyle, who has managed Burnley, Bolton Wanderers, Wigan, Houston Dynamo, Blackburn and Ross County in the past. This season at Jamshedpur, Coyle has signed a mix of youth and experience. Among the youngsters, there is Boris Singh, Komal Thatal and Ishan Pandita, while at the other end, new signings like Pronay Halder and Anas Edathodika are in the twilight of their careers. “When you sign players, it’s always a gamble. The entire environment has to be proper. But in Pronay, Ishan, Boris, Komal and Farukh coming back, we have young, hungry players. They want to do well. They have fire in the belly,” said Coyle. Coyle has managed some of the oldest clubs in the world, Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers, for example, and also has had stints at some of the youngest: Houston Dynamo (MLS) and Jamshedpur (ISL). At 54, there’s still work to do. For now, it’s taking Jamshedpur to the playoffs for the first time. “What we showed on an individual basis last year is that we can beat the top teams like Mumbai City and ATK Mohun Bagan. But we have to do that on a consistent basis. If we do that, we will win trophies,” said Coyle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/young-indian-players-are-improving-they-need-more-games-owen-coyle/articleshow/87093195.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Delhi||Singhu border murder case: No Sikh last rites allowed at cremation of lynching victim||CHEEMA KALAN: After the lynching of the Tarn Taran farm labourer near Singhu border for alleged desecration of the Sikh holy book, religious bodies opposed his cremation as per the Sikh rehat maryada (Sikh code of religious living). Lakhbir Singh, also known as Titu, was cremated at his native village Cheema Kalan in police presence late on Saturday evening, without any “ardas” in the absence of the panchayat by his family members. In absence of lighting at the cremation ground, a few local youths came forward and arranged a light while a few others switched on torches of their mobile phones for the cremation. Lakhbir’s widow Jaspreet Kaur attempted to see his face several times but no one dared to remove the plastic covering the body. Earlier, Tarlochan Singh, president of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee, Kasel, Taran Taran district had made it clear that they would not allow the murder victim’s cremation as per religious rites. “We will not allow the family of Titu to cremate him as per the Sikh rehat maryada. His cremation will take place in the village, but his last rites will not be allowed to be performed in the Sikh tradition,” he said and added the decision was taken following a ‘gurmata’ passed by the committee after holding a meeting in the village. Echoing this view, village sarpanch Manish Kumar said, “We totally agree with the decision taken by the Satkar committee and denounce the alleged desecration by Titu.” He said they would do everything to maintain communal harmony. Justifying the decision of Tarlochan Singh, president of Amritsar-based Sri Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee Balbir Singh Muchhal said, “There’s no way we can allow ardas, path or akhand path for a person allegedly responsible for sacrilege of our living guru.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-sikh-last-rites-allowed-at-cremation-of-lynching-victim/articleshow/87072412.cms||Yudhvir Rana

A team of engineers from the PCB inspected the bus stops in the last two weeks. “The majority of these stands are in bad shape. We found the roofs, iron bars, and benches broken during the survey. Commuters. are now forced to stand in open areas. It is unsafe for them. As a result, carrying out the repair work is the need of the hour,” said Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, PCB. The survey was conducted following the collapse of a bus shelter on Moledina Road, opposite the SGS Mall, on August 13, resulting in injuries to two commuters. The bus stop is still lying on the road, causing inconvenience to commuters. “We have informed the PMPML authorities to lift the stand since it is their property. We cannot scrap it or dispose it off unless we receive official permission from the transport body. The PMPML has not responded to our communication yet,” said Kumar. Commuters expressed concern over the lackadaisical attitude of the authorities. “How can the collapsed bus shelter be allowed to remain on the road for the last two months? It shows the poor coordination between the two authorities. Instead of making bus stops safe, the authorities are passing the buck,” Ashok Shinde, a regular commuter, said. Another passenger, Rupali Kale, pointed out the poor condition of the existing bus stand on Moledina Road. “Not even five passengers can sit at the bus stop now. The condition of the roof has deteriorated over the years. Thus, many passengers like me stand in open areas. The PMPML and PCB should take appropriate steps in this regard,” Kale added. "The grass in and around some of the bus stops has increased in the last few months. The authorities concerned need to clean it to ensure the safety of the commuters. Neither the PMPML nor cantonment is paying heed to this aspect," said Sandesh Shirke, a cantonment resident. Another resident, Samir Male, said, "Many bus stands are in poor condition. One can't even sit at the stop. People have to stand in open areas for a long time in all weather conditions." Duttatray Zende, general manager, traffic, PMPML, did not reply to phone calls or text messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-cantt-board-tells-pmpml-to-repair-10-bus-stands-in-poor-shape/articleshow/87070140.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Delhi||Soon, swipe bank card, scan QR codes to pay Metro fare in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro commuters will soon have a range of options for paying their travel fare. Other than a travel smart card, commuters will be able to use debit and credit cards, near field communication (NFC), QR code-based ticketing through mobile phones and paper QR tickets as payment options. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has started installing Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) system at 44 stations during the Phase-IV. While the new system will use the latest technology, the AFC at existing stations will also be upgraded. The system will need to be upgraded on all corridors as anyone entering the DMRC network from a Phase IV station will need the same system to exit from stations with AFC systems from Phase I, II and III. This is the reason why the standalone Airport Express Line got the system first, as its AFC system is not connected with the main network. A DMRC official said that the new system will see enhancement of the AFC system of the entire network, with the primary objective of promoting more digitisation of the services, apart from cashless and human error-free transactions. The Metro corporation is also upgrading the AFC firmware, which will allow passengers to use their credit or debit card as a smart card. At present, some Metros like Kochi and Nagpur have the facility, but only for debit/credit cards of particular banks. DMRC’s system will be able to accept transactions from all banks through the Rupay portal. The new system would also help create more ‘fare zones’ in the Metro network, which helps in determining the fare to be deducted from the smart card based on distance travelled and in the case of token users, if they have travelled a longer distance than they have paid for. “Presently the system has 32 fare zones. Due to the increase in the Metro network, it is necessary to upgrade the number of fare zones from 32 to 64 and upgrade the number of maximum stations in the system to 512,” a DMRC spokesperson said. Under the new system, penalty deductions will also be possible through smart cards. “Currently, a commuter needs to pay an increased value while exiting, which could be for the price paid for the longest travel, a stay too long or no ticket. In this case, the commuter has to go to customer care and pay the supplement amount by cash, even if they have enough balance on their card,” the spokesperson said. “The aim of this function is to make passengers able to use the card to pay the adjustment,” he said. DMRC will also integrate the point of sale (POS) terminal with ticketing machines at customer care of the older Phase-I and II stations. “It is required to facilitate payment via credit and debit cards. Smart cards can also be recharged POS,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/soon-swipe-bank-card-scan-qr-codes-to-pay-metro-fare/articleshow/87074224.cms||Sidharatha Roy

So far, 95 people with viral fever and dengue-like symptoms have succumbed in the district. Of these, 80 were children. Two police constables also died during treatment. Besides, 350 confirmed cases of dengue have been reported, health department officials said. More than 4,000 people in rural areas are bedridden, especially due to lack of necessary arrangements at government centres. Most of them are dependent on quacks for treatment. Patients admitted at local private hospitals suffered from platelet counts. SN Medical College – the largest government centre in Agra region - reportedly ran short of the platelet kits on Saturday. With patients' caretakers coming from other districts, the 21 blood banks in Agra district had upto 48 hours of waiting for platelets, officials said. In-charge of the SNMC blood bank, Dr Neetu Chauhan, said, “Since the dengue outbreak, demand for jumbo packs of blood and platelets have increased several times in two weeks. Platelet kits have run out of stock. We have placed orders for the supply of kits to a private agency." Balveer Singh, a farmer and father of 10-year-old Kuldeep, said, “My son had been suffering from fever for the past four days. We got him medicines from a private clinic as no doctor was available at the government centre. On Friday, his condition deteriorated. He died on the way to SN Medical College.” So far, 23 cops have been found to be affected with dengue. Aligarh resident, constable Sonu Kumar (28) posted at Nunhai police outpost died under treatment on Thursday. Resident of Mathura, constable Premlata (41) posted in Bulandshahr passed away at a private hospital in Agra on Friday. On Saturday, Agra SSP Muniraj G said, “Twenty-five cops are down with fever. Out of them, 23 have been tested with dengue infection. All of them have been granted leave. We are ensuring they get the required treatment. Arrangements have been made for cleanliness and anti-larvae spraying around the police stations, outposts and residential quarters.” Mahesh Badhoriya, a resident of Utsana village under Pihanat block, claimed, “Most of the patients with high fever are dependent on local quacks. Over 300 of them are bedridden at home.” Chief medical officer of Agra district, Arun Kumar Srivastava, said, “Health department teams are conducting door-to-door surveys in rural areas to identify patients suffering fever and help them in getting the required treatment." At least three more children have succumbed to viral fever in 24 hours in Firozabad district. Four died in Etah, three in Kasganj and one in Mainpuri. According to health officials, so far, over 6,000 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Agra division.

The trial for Covovax vaccine, which started last week at the BMC-run Nair Hospital has so far seen only six children. “The trial needs another 914 children,” said a doctor from the hospital. The trial will cover children in the 2-17 age group in three groups – the first group will look at children between 2-7 years, the next in the 8-11 age bracket, and the third at those aged 12-17. A clinical trial held earlier for Zydus Cadila’s DNA-based, needle-free Covid vaccine in the same hospital also found very few takers. “We needed 25 children for that trial, but only 12 signed up,” said Nair Hospital dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal. Covovax, which will also be manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India, has shown the vaccine has 90% efficacy in other trials. Each child enrolled in the trial will be given two shots, 21 days apart. “Their antibody levels will be studied multiple times, beginning with the first day of vaccination, then on days 22, 36 and 180,” said Dr Bharmal. The reason for the poor turnout, he said, is high exposure levels among children to SARS-CoV-2 virus in the city.

Exel Composites will hold a majority shareholding in the new venture, Kineco Exel Composites India, through which it aims to grab a share in India’s growing wind power, transportation and telecommunications market. As part of the business agreement, Kineco Group will sell its existing pultrusion business to Kineco Exel Composites India, in which Exel Composites will own a 55% stock. The two firms have not disclosed the monetary value of investment in the joint venture. Pultrusion is a manufacturing process for converting reinforced fibers and liquid resin into a fiber-reinforced plastic, also known as fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP). “Kineco is happy to be the partner of choice for a leading global company such as Exel, who has decided to invest in India,” said Shekhar Sardessai, founder and managing director of Kineco Group and managing director of Kineco Exel Composites India. Sardessai said that Exel’s technological expertise and composites know-how will help enhance Kineco’s more recent pultrusion business to the next level. Exel develops composite components in the global market for wind farms, rail and urban transportation, telecom radomes and industrial buildings. In India, Kineco has been manufacturing glass fibre radomes for mobile towers. “This strategic investment provides Exel with direct presence in the fast-growing Indian composites market. The investment fits Exel’s strategy and growth initiatives well, and clearly strengthens our competitive position towards current and new customers,” said Riku Kytömäki, president and chief executive officer of Exel Composites. Kineco Limited had also partnered with the US-based Kaman Aerospace Group to form a similar joint venture, Kineco Kaman Composites India (KKCI) to tap the growing needs of global aerospace and defence companies. The company used to manufacture advanced composite structural parts and assemblies for aircraft, helicopters, UAV’s and spacecraft using carbon and glass fiber materials. “Our previous strategic long-term partnerships with international partners have been extremely successful and we look forward to extending this success story to Exel joint venture,” Sardessai said. The joint venture will continue to operate from the existing manufacturing facility located at Pilerne, Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kineco-group-forms-joint-venture-with-finland-firm/articleshow/87072459.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A complaint was filed by a local BJP member in Kaant area as the event was organized without any prior permission from the police and district administration. Since section 144 is still in place in the district, permission is required for such events, police said. Rajendra Bahadur, SHO of Kaant police station, said, "We received a complaint that few people are camping in the area and had made arrangements to conduct a mass prayer for Asaram. When we rushed to the spot, we saw a large tent had been erected and Asaram’s disciples had made all the preparations for the prayers.” Their leader was identified as Suneel Sahu, a resident of Raisen in Madhya Pradesh, while four locals were assisting him. “They didn't have any permission so we booked them under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant).

The deceased has been identified as Zaker Ahmed Deshmukh, a resident of Abdul Rahim Nagar. The man was reportedly murdered during the early hours on Friday. By the time police reached the spot, most of the body had been charred. An autopsy was performed before handing over the body to the family members. Based on the deceased man’s brother’s complaint, a case of murder has been registered against unidentified person(s) at the Kotwali police station. Additional superintendent of police Mummaka Sudarshan said: “Deshmukh family owns two houses, and the incident took place in one of their houses. The deceased had visited this house, located in a less populated area on Thursday and never returned.” The officer said that the act appears to be the handiwork of more than one person, as the man was not only murdered but a pyre was also set up and lit. Since the room where the man was set on fire did not have windows, no one was aware of the incident till Friday evening. A probe has revealed that the deceased’s wife is a teacher and due to ongoing differences between the couple, they had been living separately for the past few months. An officer privy to the investigation said the police have certain clues about the case and teams have been dispatched to round up the suspects who were the victim’s acquaintances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/parbhani-charred-remains-of-man-found-inside-house/articleshow/87068568.cms||Mohammed Akhef

If the plan takes shape, ABAP president and general secretary will be guarded by commandos, sources said. Recently, IB officials had met ABAP general secretary Hari Giri to discuss security-related issues, the sources added. The president and general secretary of the body have been accorded Y-plus category security cover by the state government, which is reportedly being considered inadequate, the sources further said. Hari Giri meanwhile told TOI he had never sought extra security cover."Bhairav ji (the deity of Juna akhara) is our protector. So, we do not need any other security," he added.

He had also said, "Taliban was fighting for the freedom of Afghan people", and was later slapped with sedition charges. Speaking at a Ramlila event on the occasion of Vijay Dashmi in Sambhal, Singhal said that “we are also in favour of Hindu-Muslim unity, but it cannot be one-sided.” “Both the communities should contribute equally and make efforts on maintaining unity. It shouldn’t and can’t be one-sided. The initiatives must be from both sides,” he added. Singhal's remarks on Barq has now gone viral and purported video clips of the speech are being widely circulated on social networking sites. Barq was earlier booked by Sambhal police under IPC section 124-A (sedition) and 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race), among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/bjp-functionary-slams-sp-mp-barq-for-taliban-remark/articleshow/87068564.cms||Maria Khan
---||Delhi||‘Contradictory? Gandhi actually utterly and frightfully consistent’||There have been countless books on the Mahatma but the facet that most fascinated Jyotirmaya Sharma, the author of Elusive Nonviolence: The Making and Unmaking of Gandhi’s Religion of Ahimsa, was Gandhi the thinker. He feels many don’t take Gandhi as a serious philosopher. “But the Mahatma was constantly evolving, even with his ideas. There are inconsistencies and contradictions because one wants to see those. And it is fashionable these days to see many contexts, but are there many Gandhis? I believe that Gandhi is utterly and frightfully consistent and what one sees as contradictions were manoeuvres of reaching his goal. And in that sense, there is an invisible thread of consistency,” Sharma tells Akshaya Mukul at a session of the Times Litfest. He goes on to add that Gandhi was one among the many reformers of Hinduism. “He thought that the only way to reform Hinduism was to introduce non-violence and truth. With the various things such as inter-dining, temple entry that he started, he was just fabricating a Hinduism for himself. He is also often defensive, and he didn’t belong to an era where people scream and abuse. It is amazing how very civilised were the most tension-ridden conversations that he had with his detractors,” Sharma points out. He adds that non-violence is the greatest concept that Gandhi conceptualised, and nobody did it as effectively as him. “His personality, his aura also added to it. But the problem that arises with it is that it is almost entirely situated within religion and his understanding of religion. Even his contemporaries didn’t agree with him because they found his radical non-violence very difficult to digest and follow,” he adds. When asked what Gandhi would make of the political face of Hinduism that we are seeing now, he says that there is a tendency to often frame all debates in the context of the colonial and the post-colonial. “I think as a society if we support a lot of things that are happening then we have become pre-colonial. Most satires follow the same trajectory - There is the golden age, the fall from the golden age, and then comes the messiah, a guru or an avatar who re-establishes the normative. And in today’s world, we are still looking for a deliverer. We need to look at ideas that will make us more tolerant, democratic and civilised. That is the challenge,” the author says, adding that Gandhi was an idealist and it is important that he remains a symbol and a point of reference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/contradictory-gandhi-actually-utterly-and-frightfully-consistent/articleshow/87074246.cms||---

There were scuffles between farmers and UP Police in some places. In Muzaffarnagar, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) workers and local farmers reportedly jostled with cops as the latter tried to take away the burning effigies.

One of its senior members can be heard saying in a purported video clip that "it was a call from SKM to burn effigies to show our concern against the three farm laws". Farmers are on 'dharna' for 10 months, but the government refuses to listen, he added.

Further directions have also been sought to take strict action against those responsible for such boycott and imposition of collective fine under Section 16 of the SC & ST Act, 1989. The matter has reached before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by Gurmeet and other residents of the village. According to the petitioner, “As a result of the ongoing boycott, the life, livelihood and education of about 200 families of the SC community of Chattar village is in imminent danger. The members of the SC community cannot enter the areas where the dominant communities reside and cannot enter the fields of the dominant communities. Moreover, all the ration shops and dairies have refused to provide goods to the members of the community. Rations have to be obtained from the city, which is 40km away,” the petition has claimed. Gurmeet had said in his petition that on August 1, around 24 persons entered the Dalit Basti in inebriated condition and started making obscene gestures in public. When the petitioner and another person belonging to the SC community, Sachin requested them to cease such acts, they started hurling casteist slurs at them On August 2, the victim Sachin filed a complaint in relation to the above-mentioned incident and an FIR was registered under sections 3(1)(r), 3(1)(s), 3(2)(va) of the SC/ST Act at police station Uchana against them. According to the petitioners, as a counter-blast to the above FIR, an FIR dated August 2 was registered against the complainant Sachin and other members of the SC community by members of the dominant community. Thereafter, the petitioner Gurmeet and the complainant Sachin were called upon by the village Panchayat, dominated by the Jat community, to settle the matter. On September 26, another Panchayat was convened at 4pm where pressure was again sought to be exerted on the SC community to compromise. On their refusal to do so, one Balwan announced on behalf of the dominant community that there would be a social and economic boycott of all the members of the SC community. It was also announced that if any resident of the village disobeys this boycott, such person would be liable to pay a fine of Rs. 11,000 to the Panchayat. The petition is expected to come up for hearing before the HC next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/petition-filed-in-hc-over-social-boycott-of-sc-community-in-jind-village/articleshow/87072565.cms||---

Suddenly, the king collapsed on the stage, drawing a huge applause from the audience who thought he was quite convincing in his portrayal of a father pining for his son. Little did anybody realise that the actor playing the part -- former village pradhan Rajender Kashyap (62) of Hasanpur village in Bijnor’s Rehad region -- was actually dead. Sanjay Singh Gandhi, president of the Ramlila committee, said, “It was very tragic. No body realised what had actually happened. Everyone kept applauding, considering it to be a piece of great acting although he had suffered a massive cardiac arrest.” By the time other cast members rushed to Kashyap’s aid, it was too late. Unable to revive him, they rushed him to a medical facility but he was declared dead by doctors. A wave of sorrow swept across his village, whose residents had seen him enacting various Ramlila characters year after year for the past two decades. Kashyap is survived by his wife, three sons and two daughters. He was cremated on Friday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ramlila-dashrath-collapses-on-stage-during-scene-in-bijnor-dies/articleshow/87068583.cms||Harveer Dabas

It was just a lucky sighting of this trapped scaly anteater by a Salcete woman near her home that saved its precious life. In south Goa’s coastal taluka, Gracy da Costa chanced upon an Indian pangolin (Maniscrassicaudata) struggling for its life in a net. “I saw through my window the net moving but couldn’t make out what had got entangled in it till I went close,” da Costa said. At first, she wanted to set it free herself, but realising the scaly animal’s complicated entanglement, she and her kin tipped off the forest department at Margao. Animal rescuers, Benhail Antao and local rescuer, Julio Quadros immediately rushed to the spot. “We don’t know for how long it had suffered while trying to free itself from the net,” Antao said. Within a few minutes, the rescuers under range forest officer, Prakash Naik’s guidance, prised out the traumatized animal, all rolled up into a ball, from the mesh. Its extremely hard scales serve to protect it even from the big cats. Once it curls up, its scaly armour covers up its soft belly – its vulnerable part. Shy and only moving at night, their population in the state is said to be decreasing due to threats to their habitat and illegal wildlife trade. The animal – an adult weighs about 13 kg - digs into ant and termite burrows for its food. “The pangolin is absolutely harmless and we need to let it co-exist, lest it survives only digitally or in pictures,” Antao tried to sensitize curious locals, who had gathered to catch a glimpse of it. After being put under running water and cleaned up of all mud, the curled-up ball of meat and scales was placed on the ground. Freed from its fetters, the animal uncurled itself to its full stature. Sensing the lack of hostility among the spectators, it walked away slowly in the fading light to its home in the nearby bushes. “We owe it to the planet to protect these endangered species,” Vishal Surve, assistant conservator of forest said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/trapped-indian-pangolin-survives-net-horror/articleshow/87072804.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Mumbai||Shiv Sena seniors not CM because of Uddhav Thackeray’s ambition: Devendra Fadnavis||MUMBAI: Leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis said on Saturday that experienced politicians like Diwakar Raote and Subhash Desai could not become chief minister because of Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray’s personal ambition. Fadnavis was referring to the chief minister’s comment at the Shiv Sena Dussehra rally on Friday that he had never wanted to be the head of government in the state. “This government has completed two years. For how long will Thackeray keep saying he did not want to be chief minister? If he wanted a Shiv Sainik to be chief minister, he could have easily made Diwakar Raote, Eknath Shinde or Subhash Desai the chief minister. If that was the case [Thackeray not wanting to be CM], then neither Rane nor Raj Thackeray would have quit the party,” he said. He said the people had voted for the BJP-Sena alliance and not the Congress and NCP. He said the BJP was the number one party in the state, having secured the highest number of seats.“You [Thackeray] have formed this government by deceit,” he said. Criticising Thackeray for stating that he wanted the state to be like West Bengal in fighting against the Centre and BJP, he said the BJP would not allow the violence seen in Mamata Banerjee’s state. On Thackeray's challenge to the BJP to bring down his government, Fadnavis said if the BJP wanted to topple the government the CM would not even know about it when it happened. “We would rather you show that you can run the government,” he said. He said Thackeray’s Dussehra rally speech had no ideas and only showed his frustration. “This is what happens when one aligns with those who are ideologically at variance with you,” he said. Fadnavis said that raids by the income tax department had revealed rampant corruption. He said ED and CBI were here because Thackeray’s men had indulged in corruption and looted the people. “The dalali (middlemanship) has reached such a level that some ministers have even got extortion softwares created to know how much money is to be extorted from whom. If such things are going on, then it is natural that ED and CBI will come to the state,” he said. He said neither the PM nor the Centre was misusing the agencies. “If agencies were being misused, then half your cabinet would have been in jail,” he said. Fadnavis accused Thackeray of wanting to change the Constitution framed by Babasaheb Ambedkar. He was referring to Thackeray’s demand for a discussion on the federal structure of the Constitution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fadnavis-sena-seniors-not-cm-because-of-uddhavs-ambition/articleshow/87072679.cms||---

Production of wet grinders came to a halt after the Madras high court banned quarrying in Uthukuli of Tirupur district in June. While the 64 stone quarries operating in Uthukuli provide the suitable stone for making wet grinders, mining is carried out also for blue metal and making M-sand. Hearing a case on the widespread violation in mining activities in Uthukuli, the HC banned mining activities, affecting supply of stones to about 100 big industries and 900 small units making wet grinders in Coimbatore. R Soundar Kumar, president of the Coimbatore Wetgrinder and Accessories Manufacturers Association (Cowma), said that the state government should allow mining activities in less than one-hectare area exclusively for extracting stone for wet grinder production. "As per the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959, quarry activities are allowed in a minimum one-hectare land or 2.47 acres. There are people who have less than one hectare but could not apply for quarry activities because of the rule," Kumar said. Cowma cluster head Sasta M Raja said that 2,800 to 3,000 density stone with silica-mica combination, which are ideal for making wet grinders, are available only in the Uthukuli area. "Stones for making blue metal and M-sand can be extracted from other parts of the state. By bringing in the amendment, the wet grinder industry can be saved," he said. The industry is employing over 30,000 people in Coimbatore. One can stumble upon grinder units at Papanaickenpalayam, Avarampalayam, Peelamedu, Kalapatti, Rathinapuri, Sanganoor, Nallampalayam, Ganapathy and Maniakaranpalayam, where the units are operating like cottage industries. The wet grinder industry is the first to be recognised by the state government under the cluster development programme, based on the recommendations of the United Nations Industrial Development Programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/amend-mineral-rule-to-save-wet-grinder-biz-say-manufacturers/articleshow/87072659.cms||Sampath Kumar

Haryana police have booked 23 upper caste persons on the complaint of Gurmeet Singh (22) on October 13 when a dispute erupted over watching a kabbadi match being held in Ghogadiya village adjoining to Chhatar on October 11 and thereafter for allegedly announcing social boycott over 150 SC families of mangu mohalla here in Chhatar village of Uchana Kalan town, represented by deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, of Jind district. When a team from TOI visited the Chhatar village on Friday, people from SC community said they might have to leave the village if all the accused are not arrested. Uchana Kalan police have booked 23 persons of village, including two shopkeepers and Ishwar, Karmpal, Sita, Subhash, Ram Singh, Kuldeep, Rajesh, Kala, Pardeep, Ram Mehar-ex sarpanch, Krishan, Raj Singh, Sahil, Sonu, Anil, Prem, Lilu, Balwan, Rakesh Bansal and other under Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (Amendment 2015) 3(1) (S), 3(2)(VA) SC ST (POA) Act. SC community people said they are facing difficulty, as ration, milk and even fodder for cattle are being denied for them, forcing them to sell cattle at very low price due to non availability of fodder. Shopkeepers, including Rakesh Bansal said they closed their shops located in SC mohalla for two days on September 26 and 27 on seeing the tension between two communities and opened again after police and higher officials reached the village. The goods from shops are being given consistently now to SC people. It was observed that essensitail items from shops were being given to SC people on Friday and shops were seen open. Gurmeet said the issue started on August 1, when some upper caste men who were drinking liquor at the chabutra of SC mohalla were stopped from doing so. “I and Sachin lodged a police complaint But villagers mounted pressure on Sachin and settled the issue. The accused, including Rajesh, have been harbouring enmity with me since the incident and used derogatory words and casteist remarks when I went to watch kabaddi match in nearby Ghogadiya village. Thereafter, I approached Uchana Kalan police, but upper caste people started mounting pressure to take the complaint back. The upper caste people again held a panchayat on September 26 in which a social boycott was announced saying that one will be fined with Rs 11,000 if found giving anything or speaking with SC people in the village,” he added. Thereafter, shopkeers stopped giving essential items to SC people and milk from upper caste people or milk diaries. SC people sought an arrest of all the accused, he maintained. Sushil Kumar, another victim from SC community, said “I have sent my children to my in-laws’ home and sold cattle due to lack of fodder. We would be forced to leave the village if tension escalates. Police should take concrete action in the matter by arresting all the accused promptly. We gave a call for protest at Jind district headquarter on October 16 seeking fair action in this incident,” he added. Several people including Karmpal Singh from upper caste and one of the accused said “SC people are also our brothers and efforts are being made to maintain peace and harmony in the village. We have not announced a social boycott of the SC community in the village,” he added. BDPO Surender Singh told TOI: “We have found some facts in the complaint lodged by SC community and will speak with both sides in the village. However, there is no law and order situation in the village and police teams have been deputed. Now, shops in the village are open where SC people are getting necessary items. Statements from different people are being recorded and a detailed report will be submitted to higher officials.” Meanwhile sources in Chhatar village said upper caste people held a panchayat in which they tendered apology to the SC community people for the incident, but matter could not be resolved and social boycott decision was taken later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-have-to-leave-village-if-accused-not-arrested-sc-community/articleshow/87072682.cms||Vijender Kumar

Bermo SDPO Satish Chandra Jha said the fake IED was found under the culvert close to the school while the real one, a 5kg bomb, was recovered from the second culvert located some 100 metres from the first one. The Gormera village, where the IEDs were found, is located close to the Giridih district. The two culverts are built over a road that connects Nawadih, Dumri and Vishnugarh. Police often use the route during their search operations against Maoists. This is probably the first time that the Maoists have planted a fake IED under one culvert along with the real one. The SDPO said the rebels were probably trying to trick the policemen but failed. The policemen defused the real IED on the spot, he said. Jha further said the real IED had wires attached, which showed that it was active. The fake one contains sand inside the tin and wires were tied around it to make it look real. “It will be known only after an investigation whether the planting of the IED is a conspiracy by Naxalites to harm the police or the work of mischievous elements,” he added. Reports said the Maoists, who were active in the Parasnath zone and Uparghat-Nawadih area, are losing ground for the past few years and to re-establish their presence, they were trying to target the security personnel by setting up landmines or IEDs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoists-lay-trap-with-ied-to-attack-police-foiled/articleshow/87070355.cms||Divy Khare

His wife, Chanchala Sharma (55), was also brutally attacked and brought to a local hospital in an unconscious condition. She was later referred to Rims in Ranchi. Sharma, who hailed from Central Saunda under Bhurkunda outpost police station, was a former general secretary of the Congress Ramgarh district unit. Reports said Sharma was hit on the head with an iron rod. SP Prabhat Kumar, who rushed to Sharma’s house, confirmed that it’s a case of murder and the motive of the crime could be ascertained only after the police investigation is over. Talking to media persons, he said, “Police are investigating the crime from all possible angles, including robbery and targetted killing.” SDPO (Patratu) Birendra Kumar Chaudhary, who also visited the spot, said the unidentified miscreants broke into Sharma’s house from a window and attacked the couple with an iron rod. Local Congress MLA Amba Prasad rushed to Sharma’s house on hearing the news. She condemned the brutal killing of the veteran party leader and said she would meet chief minister Hemant Soren to press for a CID probe into the crime. Meanwhile, state Congress working president and Ramgarh district resident, Shahjada Anwar, said the miscreants have put up a challenge before the police by killing a Congress leader at his home. “An SIT should be formed to probe the case and arrest those responsible for the brutal killing,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-leader-found-murdered-at-ramgarh-home-wife-critically-injured/articleshow/87070180.cms||N K Agarwal

According to health department sources, review of several cells, including PCPNDT, NGO, NPPC Mental Health Viral and Hepatitis diseases, were called off in the last five days because of the strike. “We were told through a WhatsApp message that the review meeting was called off by our administrative officer. Majority of the work is handled by contractual employees and senior officials cannot get the meetings done without their help so it was called off,” a contractual employee at the state NHM headquarters said. MD NHM Bhuvnesh Pratap Singh said, “We have postponed the meeting as our staff members wanted a holiday in view of Durga Puja. No new schedule has been finalised yet.” The strike has extended to the districts now as contractual employees from several districts have come to Ranchi to attend a meeting. Over 180 contractual employees are protesting the abrupt termination of services of a senior colleague and alleged harassment by senior officials. The protestors have demanded the implementation of HR policy with immediate effect. In addition to this, they have demanded for the resumption of their off days on Sundays which was cancelled nearly a year ago owing to Covid-19. The contractual staff have also demanded the EPF contribution to be allocated from the state budget and remuneration for extra work done on Saturdays and Sundays during the peak of Covid-19. Following their strike, a meeting was convened with health department officials on Monday. The delegation of contractual employees said the talks failed as the department did not promise to fulfil their demands in writing. When asked, Singh said, “We have accepted all their demands. However, we will not cancel the termination of services of the said employee who was removed from his post.” The protesters have said that they will continue wih their strike until all their demands are met.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/nhm-work-suffers-as-contract-staff-sit-on-indefinite-strike/articleshow/87070393.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Phytohunt (phyto-plant, hunt-to search) is a plant-centric treasure hunt game where players have to solve the clue for a plant given in the riddle. The first version of phytohunt was completely outdoor and conducted annually for four years in the Botanyfest at Waghai botanical garden. “Version 3.0 is based on the plants present at the botanical gardens,” said Krishna Singh Rajput, director of BotanyFest Foundation, the first startup of MSU’s Faculty of Science started by alumni of botany department. “During the pandemic, to get rid of regular studies and boredom, we had started an online phytohunt on Instagram. After success in Gujarat, we organized it for Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu,” Rajput said, adding that the game was based on historical, mythological, medicinal and biogeographical significance of plants in that state. In phytohunt 3.0, players have to find the plants in the garden on basis of smell, taste and appearance given in the form of a riddle on the website. After finding the plant in the garden, they have to confirm the plant with the help of the website to get the next clue or riddle. First player to solve the clues and find the treasure in the garden becomes the winner. “The game is structured to create interest for plants among students in schools and colleges and to develop logical thinking and reasoning, problem-solving and communication skills in them,” he said. “We will implement the same game for Kamatibaug garden and slowly cover all parks and gardens of Vadodara before replicating it for parks and gardens across the state,” Rajput added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-social-start-up-launches-plant-centric-semi-digital-game/articleshow/87070216.cms||---

Joshi, however, did not meet chief minister Hemant Soren as widely reported earlier. Soon after reaching Ranchi, Joshi chaired a meeting at the CCL headquarters here with officials of Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL), Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI). Additional secretary in the ministry of coal, V K Tiwary and chairman of the Coal India Limited (CIL), Pramod Agarwal, also attended the meeting. During the meeting, the minister gave directions to ensure sustained coal production and dispatch to the power plants to ensure that there is no shortage. “The festive season has started and it is our duty to provide an uninterrupted supply of coal to the power plants,” he said, stressing that the coal companies should take necessary steps to clear the bottlenecks in coal production and transport. He also instructed the officials to motivate the employees to make all-out efforts to scale up production and dispatch. Later, Joshi visited several mines of the CCL in Tandwa and took feedback about their problems in increasing production besides giving several instructions in this regard. He said the situation related to the coal crisis is now improving. “The reason behind this crisis is the closure of a few mines and inundation of some due to recent heavy rainfall,” he said, stressing that restricted import is also one of the reasons. Joshi assured the power plants that they will continue to get their requisite supply. After visiting the mines, he tweeted: “Visited Ashok Opencast Coal Mine of Central Coalfields Limited located in Chatra district of Jharkhand. This mine with an annual peak-rated capacity of 20 MT is one of the biggest coal projects of CCL. Interacted with on-ground team and motivated them to increase coal production and offtake from the mine.” Official sources said Joshi’s visit was aimed at increasing coal production in CCL mines and inspected railway sidings to take stock of the issues related to transportation problems. While the minister stressed the transportation of proper quality and quantity of coal, officials intimated to him about the problems they face in land acquisition in expanding their coal projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/min-asks-coal-psus-in-state-to-hike-production/articleshow/87070337.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Ranchi||Vax rate dips during Navratri by 4 times as people avoid taking jabs||Ranchi: The Covid-19 vaccination drive in the state has dipped by four times than normal during the Navratri celebrations as beneficiaries avoided inoculation during the festivities. Meanwhile, the state BJP unit has announced to felicitate all healthcare workers once the national vaccination mark crosses the 100-crore mark. According to the state health department records, a total of 1,43,61,542 people have been administered their first dose while 46,87, 523 have been inoculated with both doses. When TOI compared the vaccination data issued by the department between October 7 to 9 and October 13 to 15, it was found that the vaccination rate in the state has fallen to over 9,000 doses per day from a whopping over 87,000 daily shots. According to the vaccination data, a total of 2,36,658 beneficiaries were inoculated between October 7 and 9 while a mere 28,213 turned up for vaccination during October 13 and 15. Among the 2,63,658 beneficiaries who were vaccinated between the first three days of Navratri, 1,48,821 received their first jab while 1,14,837 received their second dose. Meanwhile, among the 28,213 people who were inoculated during the last three days of Navratri, 13,484 received their first shot while 14,729 received the second dose. On being asked about the reasons behind the low turnout, public health expert and professor of community medicine at Rims, Dr Dewesh Kumar, said, “Every vaccination drive sees such a dip whenever there are festivals or other national holidays. The beneficiaries have given vaccination a miss as they didn’t want to miss the festivities. Another reason is that many also want to avoid it during the Navratri festivities. It will pick up pace within a few days as nobody wants to miss out on the vaccine.” Meanwhile, the state BJP has decided to celebrate 100 crore Covid vaccination shots in the country by felicitating doctors, nurses and hospital staff. Talking to TOI, state BJP president Deepak Prakash said, “It is a proud moment for us that under the able leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country is going to achieve the target of 100 crore vaccination shots. As of date, around 96 crore vaccine shots have been administered and once it crosses the 100-crore mark, the state BJP unit will felicitate our healthcare workers for their continued service.” Prakash further said this milestone has been achieved due to Modi's initiative and the valuable contribution of BJP workers who mobilized the people for the vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vax-rate-dips-during-navratri-by-4-times-as-people-avoid-taking-jabs/articleshow/87070272.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The government issued orders in accordance with the decision of the 15th special board meeting of the KRMB. The meeting was held in Hyderabad on July 15, following the central government issuing a gazette delegating all projects on the river to the KRMB. The decision was taken by the central government as both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states are fighting over sharing of the river water. The AP government has decided to hand over the Srisailam Right Bank power house and the Nagarjuna Sagar right canal power house to the KRMB. The two power houses, which were kept with Andhra Pradesh at the time of bifurcation in 2014, would now go to the KRMB, for operation. The power houses on the left bank at Srisailam and the left canal at Nagarjuna Sagar were given to the Telangana state. While directing the officials of the water resources department to delegate its power houses at Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar to the KRMB, the state government had asked them to officially hand over the projects along with those of Telangana state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-ready-to-hand-over-all-krishna-projects-to-krmb/articleshow/87068720.cms||Gopi Dara

The power deficit has come down to less than one million units a day as against a gap of 10 million units per day and the state government on Saturday announced that there will not be any power cuts. Moreover, the power purchase price in open market has dropped to Rs 6.11 per unit from Rs 20 earlier. NTTPS and Krishnapatnam power plants will soon begin production of 1600 MW. This will put the state in a comfortable position on the power front.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-power-cuts-as-crisis-eases-in-ap/articleshow/87068730.cms||---
---||India||Students headed home from West pay 3x pre-Covid fares||MUMBAI: Indian students studying abroad continue to bear the brunt of travel restrictions imposed by India on scheduled airline international flights. The latest comes in the form of high airfares for return to India during the winter holiday around year-end. With high demand and low supply, return air fare for travel to India from countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada are currently priced about three times the pre-Covid fares, say parents. The worst hit are students bound for India from the US west coast. “This year, with Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok shut to Indian flyers, students from the US west coast are left with no option but to transit via Europe and West Asia,” said a travel agent. On Saturday, the cheapest return fare for mid-December-early-January return travel on San Francisco-Delhi non-stop flight began at Rs 2.3 lakh, offered by Air India. A cheaper option was a transit via Dubai, priced at Rs 1.9 lakh, but entailed 25 hour travel each way. The cheapest fare on San Francisco-Mumbai return flights began at Rs 2.2 lakh, an Air India transit via Delhi. Other fares are expensive too. The cheapest available round fare on New York-Mumbai began at Rs 1.6 lakh and involved a Dubai transit and a 23-hour journey each way. The cheapest fares on non-stop return flights from New York to Delhi began at Rs 1.7 lakh. Similarly, for a Boston-Mumbai round trip fares began at Rs 1.7 lakh while Chicago-Mumbai via Dubai was the cheapest option with fares at Rs 1.94 lakh. The cheapest return on London-Mumbai non-stop began at Rs 1.4 lakh on Air India, the cheaper fare for Rs 1.1 lakh involved a Dubai transit. Delhi has better non-stop connectivity, with Toronto-Delhi non-stop return priced at Rs 2 lakh and Chicago-Delhi non-stop return at Rs 1.8 lakh. Navin Bhatia (name changed on request), a parent who divides his time between UK and India, said he has decided to meet his children — one studying in Canada and the other in the US — in Dubai this winter. “It’s a lot cheaper to fly to Dubai than to India from here in UK,” he said. “I’ll try to do a round trip to India from there if the fares are better. Currently, a Dubai-Mumbai return for last week of December is priced at Rs 65,700,” he said. Three weeks ago, he booked the tickets for mid-December travel and January return. A London-Dubai round trip in economy class cost Rs 80,000, while economy class fares on London- Mumbai began at Rs 2 lakh. India had suspended the scheduled international airline flight operations on March 23 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/students-headed-home-from-west-pay-3x-pre-covid-fares/articleshow/87075439.cms||Manju V
---||Nagpur||Nagpur Municipal Corporation generates 40% of target revenue in six months||NAGPUR: Restrictions on wasteful expenditure and focus on improving recovery from own revenue sources led the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to record a satisfactory income in the first half of the current financial year. Against a target of Rs2,796.07 crore set for the financial year by standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar, NMC has generated a revenue of Rs1,131.2 crore between April 1 and September 30. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had projected NMC’s budget of Rs2,607.6 crore for the current fiscal. The civic body’s half-year income stood at around 80.9% of the revenue target. NMC continues to depend on government grants for revenue as the civic body generates less than 37% of it through its own sources, while it receives almost 62% in the form of government grants, including GST. In the first six months of the current financial year, NMC received Rs826.17 crore as grant from the state government, including Rs701.87 crore as GST. NMC’s revenue from its own sources like water, property tax and town planning department is just Rs305.03 crore. Only the town planning department’s revenue has already surpassed the target. Against Rs86.19 crore annual target, the department mopped up Rs1,14.97 crore in the first six months. With six more months left in the current financial year, the department is likely to generate additional revenue of over Rs50 crore, said sources. Property tax department’s poor performance continued. To stay abreast with the target of Rs289.43 crore, NMC should have generated Rs144.71 crore, but created only Rs97.42 crore. The water works department’s poor show also continued. Against a revenue target of Rs201 crore, the department has contributed Rs82.81 crore in the first half of the current fiscal. There are other revenue sources which can contribute majorly in improving NMC’s own sources of income, including the market, estate and advertisement departments. These three departments have so far contributed a meagre Rs3.83 crore. The dip in revenue has driven the civic body to tighten its purse strings. Radhakrishnan had already curtailed civic works. Sources said the civic chief has taken several measures to limit NMC’s expenses. “Only works with higher priorities are being allowed to go ahead,” said sources from NMC’s public works department. Citing another example, sources said the civic administration has also not fully resumed the city bus operation due to cash crunch. As against 400-odd Aapli Buses, NMC is operating only 290 buses.

Elections for the post are slated to be held on Monday.  SP announcing its candidate for the post of deputy speaker has necessitated elections as till now only the ruling BJP has announced the name of Nitin Agarwal as its candidate. Agarwal happens to be an SP MLA who joined BJP in 2018. He continues to be an SP MLA as the party has not expelled him. “The party has decided to field Narendra Verma for the post of deputy speaker. He will file his nomination on Sunday,” party’s chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary told TOI on Saturday.  “Traditionally, the seat goes to the principal opposition party but the ruling BJP has thrown all traditions to the winds by fielding their candidate,” Chaudhary said. For the SP, Verma’s nomination is more of a strategic move. The party, which does not have the numbers in the state assembly to see Verma through on its own, sees the move as a win-win situation. With Narendra Verma, a Kurmi, the SP will be able to showcase the move as its attempt to reach out to the OBCs. On the other hand, in case any of the ruling party members vote in favour of Verma, it will send across a strong message that they are siding with the opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-samajwadi-party-fields-narendra-verma-for-the-post-of-deputy-speaker/articleshow/87075542.cms||Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui

The accident happened around 6pm near Sports City area of Greater Noida when Shubham, a resident of Delhi’s Bhajanpura, lost control of the Swift and crashed into the divider. Shubham and three of his friends had gone to Agra for a day’s trip and were returning home when the accident happened. Three of them were women. Arvind Pathak, the SHO of Dankaur police station, said the youths had borrowed the car — DL3CCQ-3726 — from another friend. Apart from Shubham, the three who were with him were Bhavya Jain (28) and Priyanshi Arora (23), both residents of Bhajanpura, and Maansi Nagar, who is from Ghaziabad. “The accident happened around 6pm when the driver lost control of the car and it rammed the divider. An emergency response vehicle took them to Kailash Hospital. The youth driving the car was declared dead on arrival and the three others are being treated for critical injuries,” Pathak said. In another accident, a 23-year-old man riding a bike died when a truck hit him from behind on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. Abdul Farukh was on the bike with a friend when they were hit by the truck near the Samsung factory in Sector 126. While Abdul died, his friend suffered critical injuries. They were on their way to Delhi. A resident of Okhla Vihar, Abdul was rushed to a hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. Police said the driver escaped, leaving the truck behind. The body has been sent for an autopsy. A third accident took place near Ghanghola area of Kasna, where a biker died and another riding pillion suffered injuries after the two-wheeler hit a divider on Friday. Police said the two — Awadhesh and Nitin Sahu — were not wearing helmets and were possibly drunk. Nitin was taken to a hospital, where he died. “Both were taken to a hospital, but Nitin died. Awadhesh was referred to Safdarjung hospital in Delhi. He is still critical,” said Sudhir Kumar, the SHO of Kasna police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/swift-hits-divider-on-yamuna-expressway-student-23-dies/articleshow/87072497.cms||Shikha Salaria

District magistrates have been asked to expand the scope of Bangla Sahayata Kendras (BSK) for Aadhaar enrolment. The move follows complaints about many people not having their Aadhaar cards during the recently concluded Duare Sarkar camps. “Two Aadhaar enrolment centres will be set up in each block and at least two per civic body. Moreover, there will be one centre each at the DM and SDO offices, municipalities and corporations,” the missive to district magistrates stated. The DMs have been told to select BSKs as soon as possible so that the Aadhaar enrolment centres can be made operational without delay.

---||Kolkata||Season of the Superstores||The gradual easing of Covid curbs and ramping up of vaccination drives have prompted supermarket and hypermarket chains in Kolkata and elsewhere to chase ‘an impressive growth’, especially amid the festivities when the average buyer is willing to splurge on non-essential commodities Kolkata: It is a no-brainer that festivals are good for business, pandemic or no pandemic. There are psychological drivers behind our urge to splurge when the autumn air smells of shiuli flowers and fairy lights embellish the mellow evenings. It is the time when even the most thrifty buyers are willing to loosen their purse strings. No wonder retail chains in Kolkata are going the extra mile to cash in on this spending fever. According to Kaushik Ganguly, business head (East) of Spencer’s Retail, the gradual easing of Covid curbs and ramping up of vaccination had translated into “an impressive growth” across their offline and out-of-store channels. “The festive season has pushed up consumption in such a way that the prospects of complete economic revival look brighter. With cases declining, a bullish sentiment is driving our sales. We are moving swiftly towards pre-pandemic figures,” he said. Kaushik Ganguly“After recording muted growth for several quarters, discretionary categories such as confectionery, packaged food and gourmet food are back on track,” Ganguly said and added that segments such as apparel, footwear, furnishing and home & kitchen products had witnessed the highest growth this festive season. Reliance Retail, which delivered a revenue of Rs 1,57,629 crore in FY 21 nearly on a par with the Rs 1,62,936 crore revenue reported in FY 20, couldn’t agree more. With over 12,800 stores across 7,000 cities, Reliance Retail is the largest fashion and lifestyle chain in India. In the fashion segment, some of its best-selling products include comfort wear, activewear, athleisure and kidswear. In work-from-home times, the demand is also high for personal electronics such as laptops, noise-free headsets, dishwashers and vacuum cleaners. “We have strengthened our capabilities in categories such as lingerie, home and pharma through acquisitions of Zivame, Urban Ladder and Netmeds,” said a spokesperson. The company has also launched a hyperlocal delivery platform called JioMart to enable home delivery of essentials across 200 cities. Reliance Retail is also expanding its digital presence to maintain continuity in business operations. “Omnichannel approach is the new normal. We have launched alternative means of servicing customers such as market on wheels and community pop-up stores. We have also expanded our design centres, developed a vendor ecosystem and fast-tracked supply chain infrastructure to future-proof business,” the spokesperson said. In addition to superstores, Reliance Retail operates a portfolio of over 45 international brands. It is the only Indian retailer to feature on the top 100 global retailers list published by Deloitte in 2021. S L PokharnaS L Pokharna, president (commercial) of Raymond Ltd, said the market was “cautiously positive” till August owing to a lurking threat of a third Covid wave. “We started getting positive signals from mid-July onwards and the consumer sentiment has improved with the festivities. As of now, we are witnessing over 20% growth in average bill value at our stores in Bengal,” he said and added: “Hopefully, this positive momentum will continue in Q3 and the sales will move swiftly above or close to pre-pandemic levels in most of the divisions.” In keeping with the lifestyle changes induced by the pandemic, there has been a fresh demand for casual/ready-to-wear apparel as compared to formal wear, Pokharna observed. “Trousers and T-shirts are the top selling categories at our store in South City Mall, witnessing an upward of 35% and 60% sales growth, respectively. Other product lines such as prints, especially floral motifs and micro-prints, continue to have high sales throughout in top wear. We are expecting improvements in suits and jackets and Indian ethnic wear category in the upcoming marriage season,” he said. Vedant Fashions Limited, which owns ‘Manyavar’, a leading ethnic and celebration wear brand, is also pinning its hopes on the festive season for positive growth. “On Mahalaya, we launched an influencer-led social media campaign called #AmarMaanAmarPujo. We are also planning to launch our Diwali campaign with Ranveer Singh,” said Vedant Modi, chief marketing officer of Vedant Fashions Limited. “Our aim is to make Indian wear a top choice for festivities among the consumers,” he added. Umashan NaidooFor Westside, run by Tata Group’s retail arm Trent Ltd, some of the highest selling categories include kaftaan, kurta, ethnic pants and dupatta, A-line kurta and palazzos, maxi dress and Anarkali kurta. Umashan Naidoo, head of customer services at Westside, said the pandemic had prompted businesses to constantly innovate and accommodate to changing customer behaviour. “Customers are always up-to-date with trends. Women have used social media to conquer their fears and are willing to experiment. This festive season, we are celebrating women, and our narrative examines those precious moments that light up festivities for them,” Naidoo said. Future Group’s hypermarket chain Big Bazaar has created mega shopping experiences such as Sabse Saste Din, Public Holiday Sale, Smart Search, Wednesday Bazaar and Great Indian Home Festival to help customers access the best deals. With stores in 150 cities across the country, Big Bazaar offers a massive price drop on over 1,500 everyday use items at all outlets. It also offers a host of value-added services such as home delivery, fast billing and grinding flour. Manish AgarwalFuture Group also operates Big Bazaar GenNxt, which integrates superior shopping experiences with innovations like interactive digital screens, sit-down checkouts and smart customer service. “We have rolled out a two-hour home delivery service that allows consumers to send orders to local store managers using WhatsApp or by logging in to our delivery app/website,” said Manish Agarwal, CEO (East Zone), Future Retail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/season-of-the-superstores/articleshow/87072540.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bengal likely to take up extended BSF powers with MHA||Kolkata: The West Bengal government, say sources, is planning to write to the Union home ministry against the Centre’s recent notification granting special powers to BSF to conduct search and seizure operations up to 50km inside the international border. Earlier, BSF could conduct raids within 15km from the zero line. On October 11, the Centre granted enhanced jurisdictional power to BSF for the states of Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat, West Bengal and Assam. The notification also allowed the central force to conduct raids in the entire state of Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya, and in the UTs of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. A Bengal home department official felt this was a direct interference in law and order, which is a state subject under the Constitution, and should be protested. He said there were already complaints of BSF harassing border villagers and its increased powers could result in more interference, causing major problems. Tweeting on the issue, Trinamool Congress spokesman Kunal Ghosh said: “The extension of BSF’s jurisdiction up to 50 kilometres is unacceptable. This is a direct interference in the jurisdiction of the state government. Trinamool Congress is considering the matter seriously.” Party MP Saugata Roy too criticised the move as an attempt to interfere in matters related to a state subject.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-likely-to-take-up-extended-bsf-powers-with-mha/articleshow/87072452.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Elephant electrocuted in Jalpaiguri, 14th death in over a year||JALPAIGURI: An adult female elephant was electrocuted at Bhandarpura village near Khuttimari forest in Jalpaiguri’s Banerhat block. The carcass was found in a paddy field along the forest tract on Saturday morning, making it the 14th such incident in the past year and a half. According to foresters, burn marks on the elephant’s trunk indicated death by electrocution. “Some pieces of equipment have been seized from the spot. These hint at deliberate electrocution. We have initiated a probe,” Jalpaiguri DFO Mridul Kumar said. In Bengal’s Dooars region, at least 34 elephants have died of electrocution in the past decade. Tapping power from high-tension lines to lay electric traps is an unauthorised and yet common practice in the area to stop herds from destroying paddy fields, especially during the harvest season. Environmentalists blame the deaths on indiscriminate growth of human habitat in and around forestland, which successive governments have failed to put a check on. “People encroaching upon forestland leads to man-animal conflicts. The behavioural change in elephants is the result of this continuous conflict,” said Animesh Basu, a member of the state wildlife advisory board. The forest department has held several meetings with power officials and environmental organisations in the past to thrash out a solution, but has achieved little. “The electricity department has resolved the issue of loose, hanging wires in the forests. But, we have not been able to convince people not to lay power traps. We have to work harder,” said Shyama Prasad Pandey, an environmentalist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/elephant-electrocuted-in-jalpaiguri-14th-death-in-over-a-year/articleshow/87073217.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||World||2 killed in fresh communal violence in Bangladesh||DHAKA: Two Hindu men have been killed in fresh communal violence in Bangladesh, police officials said on Saturday, taking the death toll to six from recent unrest in the country. Protests began on Wednesday after footage emerged on social media of a “blasphemous incident” during celebrations at a Durga Puja pavilion in Cumilla, bordering Chandpur and about 100 kms from Dhaka. Police said the latest violence occurred in the southern town of Begumganj of Noakhali district when hundreds of Muslims formed a street procession after Friday prayers on the final day of Durga Puja. More than 200 protesters attacked a temple where members of the Hindu community were preparing to perform the last rituals of the 10-day festival, local police station chief Shah Imran said. The attackers beat and stabbed to death an executive member of the temple committee, he said. On Saturday morning, another Hindu man’s body was found near a pond, district police chief Shahidul Islam said. “Two men have died since yesterday’s attack. We are working to find the culprits,” he added. Anti-Hindu violence spread to more than a dozen districts across Bangladesh this week after footage of the blasphemous incident emerged online. At least four people were killed on Wednesday when police opened fire on a crowd of around 500 people attacking a Hindu temple in Hajiganj, one of several towns hit by the disturbances. Extreme right-wing Islamic Shashontantra Andolon on Saturday took out a procession in downtown Dhaka area against the viral social media image from Cumilla, saying it was insulting to the country’s Muslim majority. Local authorities said they have deployed extra security to control any further unrest. The paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has expanded the vigil from 22 to 34 out of 64 administrative districts. The elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) said it expects to arrest some of the key perpetrators of the sporadic violence which took place in the past three days. “So far around 90 people have been arrested. We will also hunt down all the masterminds,” home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said. Voicing optimism over the probe, Kamal said “we expect developments of the investigations in the next one or two days”. At least 150 Hindus were injured across the country, community leader Gobinda Chandra Pramanik said, and at least 80 makeshift temples had been attacked. Authorities did not confirm the figures. On Friday, violence broke out in the capital Dhaka and Chittagong, prompting police to fire tear gas and rubber bullets at thousands of brick-throwing Muslim protesters. Highspeed mobile phone internet services were shut down in an apparent bid to prevent the violence from spreading. PM Sheikh Hasina met leaders of the Hindu community on Thursday and promised stern action. “The incidents in Cumilla are being thoroughly investigated. Nobody will be spared. It doesn’t matter which religion they belong to. They will be hunted down and punished,” she had said. The government and law enforcement agencies described the incidents as “planned” with the aim of destabilising the country. The Durga Puja celebrations, considered to be the biggest festival of the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh, concluded without the traditional Bijoya Dashami procession due to Covid and vandalism incidents. The minority Hindu community makes up about 10% of the 169 million population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/2-killed-in-fresh-communal-violence-in-bangladesh/articleshow/87075754.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Heavy rain alert for Kolkata, South Bengal pockets||KOLKATA: The weather office has issued heavy to very heavy rain warning for Kolkata and other parts of South Bengal between Sunday and Tuesday due to the low-pressure area over coastal Andhra Pradesh. Southwesterly winds from Bay of Bengal are likely to bring in a lot of moisture to trigger heavy showers. “The low-pressure area now lies over north coastal Andhra Pradesh and west central Bay of Bengal. Strong southeasterly winds from Bay of Bengal are likely to prevail over Gangetic Bengal during October 17 to 19,” said a special weather bulletin issued by the Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata, on Saturday. The low-pressure system was formed on Friday, as predicted earlier. The city and any many parts of south Bengal had witnessed sharp spells of thundershowers on Friday, too, when Puja committees were organising immersion. Now, with the system gaining strength, the Met office said the intensity and spread of rain will increase from Sunday. “Thunderstorm with lightning and widespread light to moderate rainfall is very likely over the districts of south Bengal during October 17 to 19 and over North Bengal during October 18 to 20,” the bulletin said. The Met office has issued a yellow warning for Kolkata on Sunday where heavy rainfall between 7cm to 11cm has been predicted along with Howrah, North 24 Parganas, Hooghly and West Mindapore. Rainfall activity is likely to intensify on Monday with an orange warning — heavy to very heavy rainfall between 7cm and 20cm — in Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, West and East Midnapore. According to the IMD prediction, heavy rain is expected over a few pockets of Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah and East Midnapore on Tuesday. Parts of North Bengal are likely to have rain from Monday to Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heavy-rain-alert-for-kolkata-south-bengal-pockets/articleshow/87075752.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Doctors sound case-spike alarm as revellers drop Covid guard||KOLKATA: Health experts on Saturday sounded a warning against an imminent spike in Covid cases over the next few weeks following nearly four months of relative calm when Covid cases in the state were under control. Hospitals are already witnessing a rise in number of Covid positive patients. The silver lining, however, is the vaccination coverage that many experts feel could act as a shield against a massive surge that had put the health system under severe strain during the second wave. “Because people had dropped all Covid responsible behaviour during this festivity, we should not be surprised to see a further spike in the number of cases in the next couple of days. But at the same time we are pinning hope on the vaccination coverage to prevent a sharp surge like the one during the second wave,” said IPGMER hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury, also mentor to Covid Care Network. The organisation had been asking people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour during the festival. Number of fresh positive cases in Kolkata touched the 200-mark for the first time in more than three months on October 13. Though the number fell to 100s from the next day, number of tests, too, has gone down drastically. Infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray said the next 15 to 20 days is extremely important to be vigilant about the trend. “If we do not see a massive rise either in number of infection or people requiring ICU admission it could mean a possible herd immunity being developed along with the effectiveness of vaccination coverage. That is why, to know the real trend we need to maximise testing,” he said. For more than a week, daily tests have been hovering around 25,000 a day. While test positivity rate had slipped below 2% since July beginning there is a steady rise in overall positivity which currently is above 2%. Some individual labs are getting a test positivity between 5% and 10%. “Even a week ago, we would see 20 to 22 patients admitted. But currently we have the number going up in 30s, a surge definitely but not a massive one so far. We hope the vaccination would make a difference in terms of severity of infection and subsequently in reducing hospital admission and mortality unless a new strain emerges,” said ID Hospital Beliaghata principal Anima Halder. Most hospitals had to open additional Covid wards last year after the festival to accommodate increasing number of patients. While the situation is not yet that alarming hospitals are keeping a close tab. “We had to open three wards after the festival last year to accommodate around 90 patients at a time. Right now, despite a slight rise in number we have around 30 patients. But the next one week to 10 days would be crucial to know the real impact of crowd gathering. We are keeping a watch in case we have to enhance our capacity,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-sound-case-spike-alarm-as-revellers-drop-covid-guard/articleshow/87070139.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Influx of cars for pandal visits hits Kolkata air quality||KOLKATA: The sharp rise in use of personal vehicles during this year’s pandal-hopping frenzy saw a spike in air pollution. Last year, when people were more restrained and there were fewer vehicles on the roads, the air quality was significantly better. This Ashtami and Navami (October 13 and 14), the PM2.5 concentration in the city’s ambient air (75.3μg/m3 and 76.7μg/m3 ) was more than six times higher compared to last Ashtami and Navami (October 23 and 24) with 12.5μg/m3 . PM2.5 is the tiniest and most dangerous of pollutants. Chemicals that ride piggyback on these particles play havoc with human lives. Particulate matter of size 2.5 or PM2.5 are ultrafine particles of diameter less than 2.5 micrometres, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair, and can travel straight into the bloodstream. “Finer particulate matter like PM2.5 comes from automobile exhaust, smoke from chullahs at road-side eateries and restaurants, road dust and aerosol. Since Puja involves activities generating all such pollutants, the spike is quite inevitable,” said a WBPCB scientist. “Unlike last year, revellers and pandal hoppers this year shed all pandemic inhibitions and moved from one pandal to another on two-wheelers and four-wheelers. Because of a sudden influx of a massive number of vehicles, there were snarls as well. Most of the motorists actually kept the car engine on even when it was static to keep the AC on. Thus, automobile fumes kept dirtying the ambient air,” said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an environmental activist. Even on October 7, the PM2.5 count was below 30μg/m3 . But from October 10, Panchami, Puja revellers hit the roads and the PM2.5 count suddenly rose to 55.8μg/m3 . From October 11, Shashthi, it rose further to 71.7μg/m3 . Since then, there has been no looking back. The smart shower on Dashami was a saving grace when the PM2.5 count marginally fell to 64.4μg/m3 . “What is worse is that this marks the beginning of the worst phase of the city’s winter pollution. During Diwali, it reaches another peak — the point of no return. The dispersal of pollutants gradually gets lower because of meteorological changes and the city gradually becomes a gas chamber with a sudden spurt in health issues,” said Deepanjan Majumdar, a scientist with National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/influx-of-cars-for-pandal-visits-hits-kolkata-air-quality/articleshow/87075742.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: North-south Metro rider count crosses 12 lakh mark from Sashthi to Dashami||KOLKATA: Metro registered eight to nine times Puja footfall compared to last year. On Sashthi, Metro crossed the 3.5lakh mark, clocking 3,77,761 passengers. The carrier ran 12 extra services from Saptami to Navami to meet the passenger rush and adhere to distancing norms. On Sashthi, with 256 trains running in both directions of the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar corridor, Metro breached the 3.5 lakh mark, 10 days after it crossed the 3 lakh mark on October 1. Pujas being holidays, less trains (204) were planned from Saptami to Dashami and services would start at 10am instead of 7.30am. But on Saptami (Tuesday), there were passengers 2,89,051 and Metro added 12 more services, running 216 trains along the north-south corridor. Last year, only 34,467 rode on Saptami. On Ashtami this year (Wednesday), Metro recorded 2,45,013 footfalls against last year’s 31,257. On Navami (Thursday), 2,39,480 passengers boarded the Metro against last year’s 27,003 on Navami. Officials said e-passes (boarding passes booked online in advance for a train ride) were issued in 2020 and stricter restrictions were in place, citing these as the main reasons for the low Puja commuter count in the first pandemic year. When the state government eased the 11pm-5am night curfew for the Pujas, Metro apprehended high footfall and decided to run as many as 204 services along the north-south corridor, the 32-km city lifeline. Evening operations were also extended by an hour; trains plied from 10am and 11pm. Last year, only 64 trains ran along the north-south corridor - from 10am till 9pm on the main Puja days. This year, East-West Metro, which operates 7 km from Sector V till Phoolbagan, also had 60 services instead of the usual 48 during the Puja days. Going by the 2,29,710 footfall on Panchami (Sunday), Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi asked officials to be ready to add trains during Pujas. The utility added 12 specials on Sunday, instead of running the usual 120. Metro has been running specials for essential workers on weekends; the state government has only allowed weekday operations, post the carrier’s resumption on July 16, after a 61-day hiatus for the second wave. Metro has been registering very high footfall since then. On October 1, it breached the 3lakh mark, which was a precursor to the high Puja footfall. Metro carried 12,68,583 passengers from Sashthi (Monday) to Dashami (Friday). Until 2019, Metro Railway ran services till 4am during the Durga Puja days. Just before Pujas last year, the high court had ordered not to allow crowds near the pandals and Metro Railway dropped the special services between Saptami and Dashami for pandal-hoppers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-records-9-times-higher-footfall/articleshow/87070743.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||World||PM Modi called on to raise matter with Hasina, seek strong action against guilty||Iskcon on Saturday wrote to PM Narendra Modi that attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh have become a “regular affair” and the community will live in fear unless the Sheikh Hasina government took strong action against the guilty. So far India has been guarded in its statements, saying that it has noted that the Bangladesh government has been prompt in acting against miscreants. But as some of the worst violence against Hindus broke out across Bangladesh this week, the Modi government is caught between a rock and a hard place — the attacks on Hindus calls for a tough stance, but on the other hand, Bangladesh is a close strategic partner. On Saturday, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) whose temples in Noakhali were “systematically” attacked with one devotee killed and two critically injured, wrote a letter to PM Modi calling for his intervention with Sheikh Hasina. Yudhistir Govinda Das of Iskcon wrote, “On Friday, a mob of over 200 people attacked the Iskcon temple and community in Noakhali... This is not the first attack on an Iskcon temple there. This has happened several times over the years. These attacks on Hindus have been a regular affair. Unless strong action is taken by the Bangladeshi government against the perpetrators of these heinous crimes, the Hindu community, which believes in peacefully coexisting with all other faiths, continues to live in fear and despair. The Bangladesh government should also provide roundthe-clock security to the Hindu temples to ensure their safety.” Hindus across Bangladesh took out protest marches in several towns on Saturday, even as Hasina promised exemplary punishment to the perpetrators. The violent attacks on Durga Puja pandals first started in Cumilla, then spread to a dozen of districts. According to sources in Bangladesh, police was called in, but there was a delayed response. The worst affected were temples and puja pandals in Chandpur and Noakhali. Officially, the violence has claimed about six lives, including many in police firing, and over 100 injured. Bangladesh government has blamed Islamic Shibir, a Jamaat-BNP outfit, for starting the violence by allegedly carrying out a blasphemous act perceived as insulting to the country’s Muslim majority at one of the Durga Puja pavilions in Cumilla. Joynal Abedin and four others belonging to Shibir were apparently arrested on Saturday. The Indian mission, said government sources, has been working with the committees of over 60 pujas across Bangladesh to calm the situation. Temple officials in Bangladesh said they think the attacks and violence were well planned. The attacks were almost simultaneous in several districts. “We called the police, but only got a response after we approached IG-level officers,” said a devotee, who preferred to remain unnamed. India’s MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said on Thursday, “We note that the government of Bangladesh has reacted promptly to ensure control of the situation including the deployment of law and law enforcement machinery. The Indian high commission in Dhaka, as well as our consulates in Bangladesh, are in very close contact with the authorities in Dhaka.” India has reacted very differently to reports of persecution of Hindus in Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/pm-modi-called-on-to-raise-matter-with-hasina-seek-strong-action-against-guilty/articleshow/87075830.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||Bengaluru||Diesel price breaches 3-digit mark in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: After petrol, for the first time diesel price has touched the three-digit mark in the city. Diesel is now costing a record Rs 100/ litre, going up from Rs 64.4/ litre in March 2020, an increase of Rs 35.6 in 19 months. Meanwhile, a litre of petrol cost Rs 109.1 here on Saturday. Bengaluru became the third metropolitan city after Mumbai and Hyderabad, where the price of diesel has breached the 100-rupee mark. On Saturday, a litre of diesel cost Rs 102.8 in Hyderabad, Rs 102.1 in Mumbai, Rs 98.6 in Chennai, Rs 97.3 in Kolkata and Rs 94.2 in New Delhi. In Karnataka, diesel is being sold at above Rs 101 per litre in districts like Bellari, Chitradurga, Davanagere, Kodagu, Koppal, Shivamogga and Yadgir. Oil marketing companies (OMCs) revise fuel prices daily based on the global refined products prices and dollar exchange rate. Fuel prices are also determined by freight and refining expenses, profit margins of oil marketing companies, dealers’ commission, central duties such as excise, and state duties such as VAT and other taxes. Truck drivers said soaring diesel prices will result in a spike in rates of essential and non-essential commodities. Many taxi and private bus drivers as well as State Transport Undertakings (STUs) too are facing a bleak future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/diesel-hits-100-across-ktaka/articleshow/87074535.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Schools in Karnataka asked to get ready for midday meals||BENGALURU: The government is all set to provide midday meals to students of government and aided schools from October 21 after a gap of one and a half years. The department of public instruction has sent a reminder to all schools asking teachers to make necessary preparations. With offline classes for grades 6 to 10 having already resumed and the department in the process of allowing them for students of classes 1-5 immediately after the Dasara holidays are over, the government has taken a decision to restart supply of midday meals. There was also a demand from a section of parents, especially from urban areas, to restart the scheme. Former primary and secondary education minister Suresh Kumar had raised the issue last week and had even met chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. Midday meals were stopped in all schools from March 15, 2020 owing to the pandemic. But after the intervention of the Supreme Court, the government started providing foodgrains to students. Teachers have been asked to get kitchens and foodgrain storage areas deep cleaned and keep gas stoves and other utensils ready. Steps have been taken to supply foodgrains to schools before October 21 and if any institution doesn’t receive them, they have been asked to procure them from the nearby fair price shop. Teachers have also been asked to ensure that only those cooks and assistants who have taken two doses of Covid vaccine are allowed to cook. More than 50 lakh students from classes 1 to 10 are beneficiaries of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/schools-in-karnataka-asked-to-get-ready-for-midday-meals/articleshow/87075866.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Daily jabs in October see 50% dip compared to September second half||BENGALURU: Notwithstanding the state target of administering at least 5 lakh doses a day, the government has managed to jab only around 2.7 lakh per day in the first 15 days of October, compared to 5.1 lakh between September 15 and 30. Between October 1 and 15, the state administered a total of over 41.1 lakh doses, which is only half of the over 81.9 lakh doses administered between September 15 and 30. Of those administered so far in October, more than 26.7 lakh were second doses, while over 14.3 lakh were first. Officials in the health and family welfare department, while reiterating that there is no problem on the supply side, pointed to the huge gap between doses of Covishield, the challenges of identifying those eligible for second dose, and hesitancy attributed to the festive season as reasons for the drop in daily vaccination. Since nearly nine of 10 vaccine doses administered in the state are Covishield, officials said reduction of gap between doses could expedite second dose coverage across districts. “Given that 80% of the eligible population has been covered with one dose, we’ve completed the easy part of the programme. The last leg of vaccination is more challenging, as we need to identify people, deal with hesitancy and other issues. We are adopting multiple approaches and are confident of being successful,” a senior department official said. MK Sudharshan, chairperson, state Covid-19 technical advisory committee (TAC), while pointing out that the panel has already recommended that the gap between doses be reduced, said: “That is something the Centre has to decide. From our side, we think that the gap was fine initially as we needed to cover as many people as possible with the first dose, but now that we’ve achieved that, the focus must shift to the second dose.” 90 lakh yet to get first doseAs of 4pm on Saturday (October 16), the government had administered more than 6 crore doses of vaccine — more than 5.3 crore (88%) were Covishield and over 70.7 lakh (11.6%) Covaxin. Around 50% of the said doses have been given to men, while more than 3 crore or 49.6% to women. Of the eligible population of more than 4.9 crore, the state has managed to administer at least one dose to more than 4.07 crore or 81.8%. Over 2 crore or 40.2% of the eligible population has been fully inoculated. This means that more than 90.2 lakh people among the eligible population are yet to get even the first dose, while over 2.07 crore people who’ve got the first dose still need to get the second jab, but not all of them qualify for it immediately given the gap. “As on date, around 30 lakh people are eligible for the second dose. However, we found that many of them have not turned up for vaccination, which could be because of the festive season. We are hopeful that daily vaccination improves in the second half of the month,” Dr Arundathi Chandrashekhar, MD, National Health Mission (Karnataka), told STOI. She added the state had already received around 50 lakh doses in October and it was slated to get a total of at least 1.3 crore for the whole month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-daily-jabs-in-october-see-50-dip-compared-to-september-second-half/articleshow/87075861.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||World||In US, cities and police unions clash as vaccine mandates take effect||WASHINGTON: Police departments around the US that are requiring officers to get vaccinated against Covid are running up against pockets of resistance that some fear could leave law enforcement shorthanded and undermine public safety. Police unions and officers are pushing back by filing lawsuits to block the mandates. In Chicago, the head of the police union called on members to defy the city’s Friday deadline for reporting their Covid vaccination status. Hundreds of officers in San Diego said they would consider quitting instead of complying with a vaccination mandate. The standoffs are playing out at a time when many police departments already are dealing with surging homicide rates and staff shortages unrelated to the vaccine. Cities and police leaders are now weighing the risk of losing more officers to resignations, firings or suspensions over their refusal to get vaccinated. Chicago’s mayor on Friday filed a complaint in court against the leader of the local Fraternal Order of Police, accusing him of “engaging work stoppage or strike” by saying the city’s 12,000 cops should ignore the order to report their vaccination status. On Thursday, mayor Lori Lightfoot said officers would be put on unpaid leave if they refused to provide the information. John Catanzara, president of the FOP in Chicago, called the mandate requiring inoculation “absolutely wrong”. No national statistics show the vaccination rate for America’s first responders, but individual police and fire departments across the country have reported figures far below the national rate of 77% for adults who have had at least one dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/in-us-cities-and-police-unions-clash-as-vaccine-mandates-take-effect/articleshow/87075877.cms||---
---||World||China’s latest craze: Scripted murders with real money||The murders are scripted. The money is real. In cities throughout China, young people are flocking to clubs to play a game that can be translated as “scripted homicide,” in which they become different characters and spend hours solving fake murders. This macabre entertainment is expected to generate more than $2 billion in revenue this year, by one count. The growing popularity has sparked some concerns from Chinese government officials about the sometimes gothic or gory content. It has also led to a proliferation of clubs. A “retail” script that can be sold to any number of clubs can cost about $80, said Wang Yihan, 28, who owns four script homicide clubs in Shanghai. A “city-limited script,” which can only be sold to just a few clubs in the same city, can sell for about $300, she said. An exclusive script, she said, for only one club, can cost about $900. Scripted homicides, known as jubensha in Chinese, require players to gather in a group to discuss a fake murder or other crime. Each player is assigned a character from a script, including one who plays the murderer. Then they engage in a role-playing game, asking questions until they determine which one of them did the deed. The games provide opportunities for young people to mingle, something that can be rare in China, according to Kecheng Fang, an assistant professor in the School of Journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. For Zhang, the player from Shanghai, scripted homicides have become one of her primary ways to meet people. “I met people who I now spend the entire weekend with,” she said. Jubensha has become so popular that authorities have become concerned about their subject matter. The state-run Xinhua news agency blamed such games for potentially distorting reality, labelling them as “confusing” to players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/chinas-latest-craze-scripted-murders-with-real-money/articleshow/87075902.cms||---

He was one of the convicts in the disproportionate assets case, in which he and his aunts V K Sasikala and J Ilavarasi served a four-year sentence. A special court in Bengaluru had deducted 89 days of imprisonment from his fouryear term in December last year, considering the days he spent in Tamil Nadu prison. The court ordered his release only after he paid a ₹10 crore fine. “He should have been released last year itself but the jail term was extended by a year for non-payment of fine. Sudhakaran’s wife paid another fine of ₹10,000 recently, the demand draft for which was submitted to the court for his release a month earlier. He was released at 11am on Saturday,” N Raja Senthoor Pandian, Sudhakaran’s counsel told TOI. The case against Jayalalithaa stood abated, while Sasikala, Ilavarasi and Sudhakaran went to prison on February 15, 2017. Sudhakaran is the younger brother of AMMK leader T T V Dhinakaran. In 1995, Jayalalithaa adopted him and conducted his grand wedding with actor Sivaji Ganesan’s granddaughter. The lavish wedding made headlines for all wrong reasons. The downfall of the AIADMK began and the party was routed by the DMK in the 1996 assembly election. Jayalalithaa disowned Sudhakaran in 1996.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sasikala-nephew-v-n-sudhakaran-walks-out-of-bengaluru-prison/articleshow/87075900.cms||---

This is part of the government’s ‘Jana Sevaka scheme’ which will be launched from January 26 with an aim to take the administration close to the public, he said. Under this scheme, wheat, flour, rice and sugar will be delivered at the people’s doorsteps. “The government should not be confined to Vidhana Soudha, but it should go closer to people. A government can become pro-people only if all the institutions working in rural areas function effectively, hence, we’re implementing this scheme,” Bommai said at the relaunch of ‘March Towards Villages’ programme at Surahonne in Nyamati taluk to address villagers’ woes and complaints. This doorstep ration delivery scheme was first initiated by the AAP government in Delhi and it had been temporarily stalled after the Centre raised objections before it gave its nod. Bommai said moves are afoot to introduce social security schemes. “All government services, certificates, documents pertaining to the public and also farmers will be made available in the gram panchayat-level itself and such facilities will be launched soon,” the chief minister said. He also said the people need not visit taluk offices to get issues sorted out. Grievances, even those regarding pensions, can be resolved at the GP-level, he said. The CM earlier handed over the government benefits like Sandhya Suraksha, old-age and widow pension, site allotment documents to many beneficiaries. Solid waste disposal vehicles and other facilities were also given away to Surahonne gram panchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bengalureans-to-get-ration-at-doorstep-from-november-1-says-karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai/articleshow/87075857.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai may get more rain over next two days: Weathermen||CHENNAI: Going by the weatherman’s forecast, the arrival of the Northeast monsoon may be more than a week away, but that may not stop the showers over the city as two weather systems on either side of the Indian peninsula may trigger favourable wind convergence and rain in the coming days. IMD forecast thunderstorms with rain in the city and suburbs for at least the next two days while parts of north and coastal Tamil Nadu may receive rain with varying intensity for at least four days next week. Private forecasters and bloggers said southwest monsoon may complete withdrawal around October 20, and the onset of northeast monsoon may be only by the end of the month. For the next 48 hours, IMD has forecast thunderstorms with light to moderate rain in some areas of the city and the suburbs with partly cloudy skies. Maximum and minimum temperature will be around 35° and 26°C. Parts of north, north interior and coastal Tamil Nadu may also get thunderstorms with rainfall varying from light to moderate between October 17 and 20. Meteorologists said the rain would be due to the influence of two low pressure areas each over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. “There’s also a trough at 500hpa (18,000ft altitude) near north Tamil Nadu. We can expect some rain on Sunday and it may reduce on Monday,” said N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD, Chennai. These disturbances may support convergence of winds leading to convective activity over the state. The late night and early morning spells in the city have left 149.2mm rain, which is 69% more than the normal 88.3mm so far this month. Neighbours too have recorded excess spells this month — Kanchipuram 143%, Tiruvallur 47% and Chengalpet 108%. While weather apps show arrival of northeasterly winds around October 25, meteorologists said the northeast monsoon may arrive only a few days later. Skymet weather, in an online post, said the withdrawal of southwest monsoon, which will pave the way for northeast monsoon arrival, may be complete around October 20. “But till the arrival of the northeast monsoon, we can expect one and off rain except between October 18 and 20 when there may not be much rain. Otherwise, there may be rainfall in the interior areas during the day and the convergence may shift to coastal areas in the evening or night bringing rain,” said blogger Pradeep John.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-may-get-more-rain-over-next-two-days-weathermen/articleshow/87075918.cms||---

A server failure delayed results and caused confusion at the counters run by Hindlabs at the airport. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is going to add more counters and have asked police to carry out crowd control. An AAI official said more than 160 tests are being done per hour for passengers who are headed to the UAE and other countries in the Middle East six hours before departure. However, there was a technical snag on Thursday. An AAI official said, “The labs faced an issue with the server from 2.30am to 3.15am and it was resolved soon. Since it was a peak load time, the reports were delayed but caught up to speed by 4.30am. Due to the delay eight passengers missed their flight and we have reimbursed the ticket cost and booked another ticket as per the passenger requirement.” A source added that they are looking at the cause of the snag and looking at ways to prevent it in the future. “We regret the inconveniences caused and shall be very cautious in future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/8-miss-flight-from-chennai-due-to-delay-in-rt-pcr-results/articleshow/87075946.cms||---

The cub is healthy now. S Ramasubramanian, ATR field director, told TOI over the phone that the tiger was injured in an encounter with a porcupine recently. “The cub tried to attack a porcupine whose quill pierced its right limb resulting in a deep wound. Due to this, it was unable to walk normally.” Soon after the rescue, a team of veterinarians checked the health condition of the cub. They said it struggled to defecate due to injuries. Its wounds were treated with medicines. The cub was first sighted on September 28 and it took three days to safely capture it. A net was used to capture the cub, which was then shifted to a centre in Rottikadai area. “This is where the treatment was provided to the cub. It took at least four days for the cub to become alright. After the treatment for a week, the cub became alright,” Ramasubramanian said. At present, the cub weighs 80 kg, which is a normal weight. “It has begun eating about 4 kg of meat and bones daily. There is an improvement in its overall health,” Ramasubramanian said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/seven-month-old-tiger-cub-rescued-at-tamil-nadus-valparai/articleshow/87075961.cms||P Oppili

Weather experts attributed the intense spell, which saw many places recording more than 5 cm of rainfall within a span of two hours, to a 'mini-cloud burst event'. Peermade recorded the highest rainfall in the state with 24 cm followed by Cheruthoni, Chalakudy and Poonjar at 14 cm. Six districts were put on red alert on Saturday. According to IMD's daily monsoon report, Kerala received 74% excess rainfall on Saturday. From Oct 7-13, the state has received 166% excess rainfall averaging about 19 cm rain. Several people were injured and displaced in rainrelated incidents. Dams in many districts are nearing their full capacity and small towns and villages in hilly areas are cut off from the outside world. Kottayam and Pathanamthitta are the most affected districts as of now. "The situation is serious,” chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said. Three members of a family were killed and nearly eight people were missing following a landslide in Plappally in Koottickal panchayath in Kottayam district. The landslide occurred at two hillside areas, destroying three houses and one shop around noon. Another landslide hit Kokkayar on the Kottayam-Idukki border and eight people are missing. According to primary reports, four houses were destroyed in the landslide. Local residents rescued two people, while the search for the missing persons was progressing, said officials. A car with two people was swept away by gushing waters near Kanjar in Thodupuhza in Idukki. Their bodies were recovered by locals and fire and rescue force personnel. Air Force and Army have deployed their assets in Kottayam, Idukki and Pathanamthitta. Army personnel from Pangode Military Station have been rushed to flood-affected areas. Mi-17 and Sarang helicopters are on standby to meet the requirements at Sulur air base. However, due to bad weather, they could not be operated till late evening. All bases under Southern Air Command have been put on high alert in view of the prevalent weather situation, said a defence spokesperson. A high-level meeting chaired by the chief minister resolved to ramp up rescue operations in places hit hard by heavy rain. The CM asked officials to keep a strict vigil on the water levels of dams and asked district collectors to ensure that people living on the banks of rivers are not asked to leave their homes on short notice. Meanwhile, the government has postponed the reopening of higher education institutions to October 20. Similarly, the Sabarimala pilgrimage would remain suspended till October 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/5-dead-20-missing-as-kerala-deluged-by-74-excess-rain/articleshow/87075984.cms||---
---||Chennai||When you say Om, Lakshmi goes moo||It’s been three years since he retired, but Chez still thinks he is on duty. So, every night, the former police horse patrols his one-acre paddock set amid the verdant greens of Uthukottai, a town in Tiruvallur district. The 19-year-old occasionally bumps into Goldy and Sara, both abandoned thoroughbreds who found their forever home along with Chez in this tree-lined community living centre for rescued domestic animals. More than 800 cows, horses, dogs, cats, goats, pigs, donkeys and ducks live in this 20-acre People For Animals (PFA) sanctuary, a two-hour drive from Chennai. Named Jinendra Jeevdaya Kendra, in January 2022, it’s going to open its doors to the public, to those who want a chance to connect with nature. The land has been given to PFA by Sugal Chand Jain in memory of his wife who died in 2016. “My wife loved animals, especially cows. That’s why I wanted to create the Chandrabai Singhvi Shelter for Animals to lead their lives in peace and harmony,” says the 77-year-old businessman and philanthropist, who heads the Singhvi Charitable Trust. He fondly watches Lakshmi and the rest of the herd of 150 cows, calves and buffaloes graze amidst the groves of mango, coconut, and gooseberry. “I visit as often as I can because I feel at peace here.” The sanctuary will house a meditation park and a humane education centre as well, explains Sugal Chand, also one of the founding members of PFA. Partially solarpowered, with a biogas unit in the pipeline for cooking, recharge ponds to maintain water supply to the sanctuary (doubling also as home to the ducks), and an organic vegetable garden, the idea, says Sugal Chand’s son Vinodh Kumar, is to be in commune with nature. Since its establishment in 1995, animals rescued by PFA were housed in a shelter in Red Hills, but as the number of rescues grew, the organization needed a larger space. “And it can’t be better than this for the animals. They have more than enough space here to roam free,” says former scientist Shiranee Pereira, founding member of PFA and chief functionary of the new sanctuary. The 400 dogs have charpoys to laze about in and spacious ‘villas’ for living, the cows reside in well-ventilated homes with cool mud floors, the goats have a one-andhalf-enclosure to call their own. “All the land is open to all the animals. It’s their home,” says Pereira, adding there is a central veterinary clinic to take care of all their medical needs and emergencies. As for you and me and the rest of humankind, we’re welcome to visit this cage-free, chainfree shelter, as long as we allow the animals to be. “We encourage people to feed the animals too, but only with the fodder we store here,” says Pereira. Vyas, the stately threelegged dog, nods in agreement before he runs off to police Lakshmi and the rest of her herd out to the meadows to graze. A couple of years ago, Vyas, was rescued, bleeding and maimed, from a pavement in Vyasarpadi. “Vyas is why we need spaces like this one,” says Pereira. “We want people to come here and build a fellowship with other living beings. We are hoping to build a community of people who truly are for animals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/when-you-say-om-lakshmi-goes-moo/articleshow/87076003.cms||Kamini Mathai

---||Chandigarh||Activists hold protests to push for Punjabi as medium of instruction in Pak schools||Bathinda: The Punjabi language aficionados in Pakistan are angry with the provincial government of Punjab for not implementing the court orders over Punjabi language. It is their long pending-demand to make Punjabi as medium of instruction in schools as well as compulsory subject from primary till graduation. Lahore high court in February 2019 had given directions asking the provincial government to place before the cabinet the draft bill of ‘Punjab Promotion of Mother Language as Compulsory Subject at Primary Act 2015’ for approval. The high court while disposing of petition of Punjabi Parchar society had given the directions. Earlier, the Supreme Court of Pakistan had issued directions to various provinces for taking concrete steps for promotion and use of provincial languages. The pro Punjabi activists assembled at Lahore Press Club on Saturday to hold a seminar, which was attended by law makers from ruling Tehreek-e-Insaf party, apart from Peoples Party of Pakistan and Muslim League (Nawaz). The activists also held a protest march in Lahore, Faislabad and at other places across Pakistan Punjab. Similar protests had been staged in the past on the International Mother Language Day on February 21, every year. “The court in 2019 had disposed the petition with the directions to take steps to place the Punjab promotion of mother language as compulsory subject at primary level act (a draft bill) before cabinet for approval soon. Nothing, however, has been done on the count even after more than two years,” Punjabi Parchar president Ahmed Raza told TOI over phone from Lahore. Noted Punjabi poets Baba Nazmi, Afzal Saahir, social activist Diep Saeeda, Tariq, Anjum Gill and Babar Jalandhari demanded at least the implementation of the directions of the court. The leaders of political parties, including advisor to Punjab chief minister, assured support to the cause, told Raza. Punjabi is not the medium of instruction in schools from primary to matriculation in Pakistan Punjab despite over 40% population speaking Punjabi. It is taught as elective subject in intermediate, graduation and post graduation level. Punjabi is written in Shahmukhi script (dialect) in Pakistan whereas in India it is written in Gurmukhi. Ahmad Raza said all the provinces of Pakistan, except Punjab, provide right of education in their respective mother languages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/activists-hold-protests-to-push-for-punjabi-as-medium-of-instruction-in-pak-schools/articleshow/87072797.cms||Neel Kamal

While addressing an election rally in favour of BJP candidate from Mandi Brigadier Khushal Thakur at Baira in Sarkaghat assembly constituency on Saturday, Jai Ram Thakur said people who once divided the state on the basis of cap colours, regionalism and dialects were today accusing him of favouritism. “But when I confront them with facts and figures they remains speechless,” he added. Lashing out at the Congress, the CM said, “I am not making any personal attack, but Pratibha Singh was a two-time MP from Mandi parliamentary seat and today people are talking about how many times she had reached among them as an MP. Yes, definitely she kept coming with Virbhadra Singh but only to seek votes.” He said the Congress had sent such a person to Himachal Pradesh as a star campaigner, who was accused of raising slogans like “Bharat Tere Tukde Honge”. He added that it was the same Kanhaiya Kumar who had said the Army personnel commit atrocities on women in Jammu and Kashmir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/people-of-mandi-will-not-tolerate-my-insult-hp-cm/articleshow/87072845.cms||---
---||Chennai||A doctor from Tamil Nadu who’s always on top of his game||Life’s a game, it’s said. And Hari Raman decided that he would play it his way even when he was dealt a bad hand. Born to agricultural workers in Purushanur, a hamlet in Tamil Nadu’s Villupuram district, he defied all odds to become a doctor, using his passion for gaming to pave the path to his dream profession. Today, the 25-year-old doctor and gaming enthusiast dishes out medical advice and pro tips for gamers with equal ease on his YouTube channel, which has 20.4 lakh subscribers. “I have always dreamed of becoming a doctor. But I come from a poor family, my parents S Lakshminarayanan and L Vijaya are farm hands,” he says, adding that his mother was always supportive of his dreams. “She wanted to send me to a private school but when she approached my uncle to get a loan, he refused, and asked her to put me in a government school and not waste money.” However, Vijaya didn’t give up, managed to get a loan and put Hari in AKT Academy Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Kallakurichi. “Since I had to travel three hours by bus, I had to stay in a hostel,” says Dr Hari, who scored 94% in class 12. “I worked hard for the MBBS entrance examination but couldn’t secure a seat so in 2015 I tried again and got a seat in GMERS Medical College in Gujarat.” Though his classmates and teachers were helpful, Hari still felt lonely and missed speaking Tamil. “Other students were able to go out and have fun but I couldn’t afford anything. I had to earn to support myself but it was difficult to do a part-time job while studying,” says Dr Hari, who then thought of starting a gaming channel on YouTube. So, in his second year, he started PVS Gaming. “It’s named after my village, my mom and grandfather S Selvaraj, who helped pay my fees. They are the ones who helped me grow,” says Hari, who began uploading one video every day. “Since I knew the game well, I told viewers how to play it, what not to do, etc in Tamil,” he says. His easy-going manner, simple language and ability to connect with viewers saw his subscriber base grow. “Six months after I started it, I earned ₹8,000,” says Dr Hari. But life was still tough. Hari was told he couldn’t appear for his final year exams as he hadn’t paid the fees. “They gave me one day to pay it and said I would have to write the exams six months later if I couldn’t do it. I cried as I wanted to complete my course on time,” he says. That’s when his friends came to his rescue, pooling in money to pay his fees. “In a couple of weeks, I was able to repay them but I will be forever grateful for their help,” he says. Dr Hari, who graduated this year, now works as a medical officer at the Villupuram government hospital. But even while pulling long hours at the hospital, he continues to run his channel. During the pandemic, he also used it to dispense information about Covid-19, safety protocols and, more recently, to combat vaccine hesitancy among people. “I do gaming videos but am responsible and tell my followers, many of whom are children and young adults, to restrict it to a couple of hours and focus on studies,” says Dr Hari. “When Covid-19 broke out, I made videos to help spread information and dispel myths. There is a lot of vaccine hesitancy among people, so I spoke about the importance of getting vaccinated.” He hopes to become a paediatrician. “I love children and want to help them, so I want to do my PG. And I also want to tell young people that they can achieve anything they want. Be dedicated, focus on what you want, always say ‘I can’, and stay positive,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/a-doctor-from-tamil-nadu-whos-always-on-top-of-his-game/articleshow/87076020.cms||Priya Menon

For instance, several KMC-run clinics in Jadavpur-Tollygunge belt on Saturday reopened after a four-day gap. Even as the allocation for each of 102 vaccination clinics was 250 doses several clinics in Bijoygarh, Baghajatin, Netajinagar, Jadavpur and Garia recorded not more than 75 recipients at the end of the day. Some clinics even recorded only 50 recipients. “We have recorded a lukewarm response from recipients so far as the vaccination at our clinics is concerned,” said a KMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-drive-picks-pace-after-slow-progress-in-puja/articleshow/87070194.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Gurugram’s air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 308 on the day, a sharp spike from 195 (moderate) the day before.  Track the pollution level in your city Low wind speed, a dip in temperature and bursting of firecrackers on the occasion of Dussehra has led to the deterioration in air quality, according to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). Officials said the air quality is expected to improve in the coming days, as it is likely to rain on Monday and Tuesday. At the city’s four air monitoring stations, the AQI hovered between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ levels on Saturday. While it stood at 298 at Teri Gram and 289 at Vikas Sadan — both ‘poor’ — the AQI was 342 at Sector 51 (very poor). The AQI was not monitored at Gwalpahari because of insufficient data. Late on Friday evening, effigies were burned and firecrackers were burst across Gurugram to celebrate Dussehra. The air was filled with smoke as a result, and residents woke up to a hazy morning. Though the AQI was in the ‘poor’ category during the morning hours, it later dipped to ‘very poor’ in the afternoon. According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines, people can suffer from respiratory illness on prolonged exposure to ‘very poor’ AQI. An official said pollutants aren’t being dispersed because of low wind speed. “The city is witnessing a drop in temperature and low wind speed of 5km/hr. As a result, pollutants aren’t being dispersed in the atmosphere and are adding to the pollution. The suspended particles are present very close to the atmosphere, which has deteriorated the quality of air,” said Kuldeep Singh, HSPCB regional officer (Gurugram). Asked how long the air will remain in the ‘very poor’ category, he said, “The region is expecting better wind speed and rain on Sunday and the pollutants are likely to get dispersed soon.” The graded response action plan (GRAP) is yet to be implemented in the region. Violation of dust pollution norms at several construction sites across the city is also adding to Gurugram's pollution. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality entered the ‘poor’ category on Saturday, with the AQI touching 284, the highest so far this winter season. The overall AQI of the capital was 198 on Friday. After the wind speed dropped to almost nil, a ‘haze’ also appeared over the city during the afternoon. However, 18 monitoring stations recorded ‘very poor’ air quality on Saturday evening. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the ministry of earth sciences, said fire counts were gradually increasing and the share of stubble burning to PM2.5 was 14%. CPCB’s central control room data showed that 24-hour average PM10 concentration for Delhi-NCR was 283.6 micrograms per cubic metre at 7 pm as against the standard 100 micrograms per cubic metre. The 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration was 143.2 micrograms per cubic metre at 7 pm. The standard for PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre. Experts said stubble burning and meteorological factors played a key role in deterioration of air quality. Despite the ban, firecrackers were burned in a few parts of the city on Friday on Dussehra. SAFAR said, “PM2.5 has returned as the lead pollutant in Delhi’s air. Favourable meteorological conditions led to intrusion of stubble burning-related air mass. With 1,572 effective fire counts as per SAFAR harmonised methodology, which includes data of two ISRO satellites, the stubble burning contribution in Delhi’s air has suddenly increased to 14%.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haze-envelops-gurgaon-air-turns-very-poor-for-the-first-time-this-season/articleshow/87072954.cms||Ipsita Pati

Chautala, who was in Gurugram to inaugurate a new office building of excise and taxation department in sector 32 in Gurugram, attributed the higher revenue collection to the implementation of the new excise policy and strict checking. Constructed at the cost of Rs 57 crore, officials said, the new office building will have space for 650 officials and employees of the department. Currently, the department has an office at Info City-1, which they share with MCG and HSVP. Meanwhile, the deputy CM said that total excise revenue for 2021-22 (until September) from four types of taxes -- VAT, CST, GST and excise -- was Rs 20,558 crore, while in the same period last year Rs 12,831 crore was received by the government. This, he added, indicated an increased economic activity and economic recovery after the pandemic. Even in 2020-21, amid the pandemic, the liquor contract of the excise department was auctioned for Rs 3,559 crore while the reserve price was Rs 3,128 crore. For 2021-22, those who already had licenses were given the option to take contracts with an increase of 10% and most of the contracts were renewed. In the current excise year (2021-22), revenue from liquor contracts of Rs 3,803 crore has been received in the form of fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/new-excise-policy-helped-increase-revenue-says-deputy-cm/articleshow/87072958.cms||---

Teacher associations said denying opportunities on the basis of religion is against the Constitution. The HR&CE department is starting four new colleges, including Kapaleeswarar college in Kolathur, from 2021-22. In an advertisement issued on October 13, the department said the walk-in interview for the post of assistant professors to teach BCom, BBA, BSc Computer Science, BCA, Tamil, English, mathematics courses and physical director and librarian posts is on October 18 at the college campus in Kolathur at 10am. It also announced walk-in interviews for 11 non-teaching staff posts including office assistant, junior assistant, watchman and sweeper in the afternoon. The advertisement said for both teaching and non-teaching posts only Hindus can apply. M Maharaja, former special government pleader, HR&CE, said the advertisement was wrong as section 10 of the HR&CE Act, which says all staff should be practising Hindus, applies only to appointment of temple staff. K Pandiyan, former president of Association of University Teachers, said though the HR&CE department runs 36 schools, five arts and science colleges and a polytechnic college, it is the first time applications have been sought only from Hindus. “A department run by the state government cannot discriminate on the grounds of religion and make candidates from other religions ineligible,” he said. He also cited the example of MSS Wakf Board College in Madurai which has several nonmuslim faculty members. T Veeramani, president of Tamil Nadu Government Collegiate Teachers Association, said the condition that only Hindus can apply was not acceptable. “The government can run the institution only according to the Constitution,” he said. Despite several attempts by TOI, HR&CE minister P K Sekar Babu, commissioner J Kumaragurubaran were not available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hrce-ad-for-only-hindu-college-staff-sparks-uproar/articleshow/87076043.cms||A Ragu Raman

There are 4,400 such students studying in around 134 special centres established in the city, officials said. Data from the education department shows that the centres have seen an increase of around 400 students in the past few weeks. An initial survey of dropout students carried out earlier this year had identified around 25,000 out-of-school children in the state, of which Gurgaon had the maximum count — 4,000. Asked about the increase in students at these centres to 4,400 when the survey identified 4,000 children, education department officials said the rise can be largely attributed to the recent reopening of schools for classes 1 to 12, and to the increasing number of migrant workers returning to the city as economic activities are picking up. Officials and schoolteachers are regularly conducting surveys in slums to identify out-of-school children, the department said. “Our special centres in Gurgaon are receiving an encouraging response and we are seeing an increased number of students coming to these centres. The number is likely to further go up,” a senior education department official told TOI. After the survey to identify out-of-school children was completed earlier this year, children below seven years of age were directly admitted to class 1 in their nearest primary schools. Those in the age group of 8 to 14 years have been admitted in special centres, where they are undergoing a six-month-long bridge course. They will be admitted to age-appropriate classes in the next academic session, which will start from March 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/spl-centres-for-dropouts-see-spike-in-students/articleshow/87073004.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
