A judgment declaring the obligation to ascertain the real value of the land taking market value into consideration was given by justice Devan Ramachandran after considering four petitions (WP-C No. 3267/2021 and others) filed through advocate PA Mohammed Shah. The petitioners were owners of land in Alappuzha that were notified for acquisition under National Highway Act (NH Act). While their lands were described in basic tax register (BTR) as wet lands, their lands are garden lands and are not included in the data bank prepared as per Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, the petitions said. They raised their apprehension that a lower compensation will be granted than their real present value by the Competent Authority for Land Acquisition (CALA) by merely relying on revenue records. In the judgment, the court noted that expansive powers equal to a civil court has been granted to CALA under NH Act to equip it to determine the real market value of the property. After referring to section 3I of NH Act that deals with powers of CALA, the court said in the judgment, “To paraphrase, the ‘CALA’ is statutorily obliged to make a comprehensive enquiry – adverting to the documents of title; the physical nature of the property; the purpose for which it had been put to use prior to acquisition; the nature of the locality; the infrastructural development of the area where is situated; the nature of the road which it abuts; the ease of access to it, etc – juxtaposed by the entries in the Revenue Records and the Fair Value notifications. The considerations above enumerated, of course, are not exhaustive.” The court held that the petitioners can approach the CALA with all documents, materials, and inputs to substantiate their claim for a higher value and the CALA can fix the rate after considering them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/acquisition-for-national-highway-market-value-of-land-should-be-ascertained-says-hc/articleshow/87144255.cms||Mahir Haneef

In a letter addressed to all the secretaries, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba has said Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized on several issues including the need to push capital expenditure while referring to the PM's last meeting with top bureaucrats. He has also directed all ministries and departments to identify the actionable points from PM’s Independence day speech and ensure time bound implementation. “In particular, a roadmap may be prepared for achieving 100% saturation under Central government schemes,” the letter said. Each ministry and department has been directed to report the progress of implementation regularly, Gauba has also said a single data source can be useful for multiple benefits and hence there is a need to embrace the concept of “data is wealth” and utilize the data available with the government departments. The cabinet secretary has also directed all ministries and departments to go for procurement of items and services using the GeM portal, the government’s e-marketplace. Gaura has also directed the ministries to bring all the pending references including from the VIPs such as MPs to “Nil” by this month end. The government will also prepare a report card and rank them on the parameters of disposing off the references.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/speed-up-capital-expenditure-cabinet-secy-to-ministries/articleshow/87144850.cms||Dipak K Dash

Pakistan army’s media wing, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), released a video clip and issued a statement on Tuesday claiming that the submarine was detected by a Pakistan navy patrol aircraft on October 16. The statement said that the submarine was “blocked from entering into Pakistani waters”. However, Indian Navy sources said the GPS coordinates in the video show the submarine’s location around 140-150 nautical miles from Karachi, which are international waters. “Territorial waters extend to just 12 nautical miles from the coast. It could be any country’s submarine in the video. There is a question mark on the authenticity of the video itself. Moreover, Pakistan has made such dubious claims in the past also,” said the source. In its statement, the ISPR claimed that Pakistan navy showed "unremitting vigilance and professional competence" in ascertaining and blocking the attempted entry of the Indian vessel. “During the prevailing security milieu, a strict monitoring watch has been kept by Pakistan navy to safeguard maritime frontiers of Pakistan,” the ISPR said. The Pakistan military claimed that this was the third incident of its kind during which an Indian naval submarine has been prematurely detected and tracked by the Pakistan navy's long range maritime patrol aircraft. An incident of this nature was last reported in March 2019 when the navy had detected and thwarted an attempted entry by an Indian submarine, the statement claimed. Another reported attempt by an Indian submarine was made in November 2016 which was tracked and pushed clear out of Pakistan’s waters, Pakistan’s military claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indian-navy-rubbishes-pakistan-claim-of-blocking-its-submarine/articleshow/87144760.cms||---

---||World||GE mandates Covid-19 vaccines for US workers||CHICAGO: General Electric Co (GE) has asked its United States-based workers to get the Covid-19 shots or seek a medical or religious accommodation by December 8 in order to comply with US President Joe Biden's executive order.  As part of efforts to control the pandemic, which has killed more than 700,000 Americans, Biden, a Democrat, last month signed the order requiring federal contractors to mandate the Covid-19 shots for employees and get them vaccinated by Dec. 8.  As a federal contractor, GE said it is complying with the executive order. The company updated its vaccine policy for more than 50,000 US workers last week.  The Boston-based conglomerate is the latest US employer to impose such a requirement, which has sparked a political fight.  While supporters of the vaccine mandates see them as necessary to pull the country out of the nearly two-year-old pandemic, critics are calling them unconstitutional and authoritarian.  The White House has said vaccine requirements have driven up the Covid-19 vaccination rates by 20 percentage points.  The measure has drawn a sharp reaction from some Republicans, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott last week barring Covid-19 vaccine mandates by any entity, including private employers.  Union Pacific Corp and its three unions have sued each other over the vaccine mandate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ge-mandates-covid-19-vaccines-for-us-workers/articleshow/87145103.cms||---
---||World||US workers face layoffs as Covid-19 vaccine mandates kick in||Thousands of unvaccinated workers across the United States are facing potential job losses as a growing number of states, cities and private companies start to enforce mandates for inoculation against the Covid-19.  In the latest high-profile example, Washington State University (WSU) fired its head football coach and four of his assistants on Monday for failing to comply with the state's vaccine requirement. The coach, Nick Rolovich, had applied for a religious exemption from the mandate earlier this month.  Thousands of police officers and firefighters in cities like Chicago and Baltimore are also at risk of losing their jobs in the coming days under mandates that require them to report their vaccination status or submit to regular coronavirus testing.  While controversial, the mandates have been effective at convincing many hesitant workers to get vaccinated against the virus, which has killed more than 700,000 people in the United States. Some 77 per cent of eligible Americans have received at least one shot of a vaccine, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters last week.  In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has been battling with the police union, which came out against the vaccine mandate for city workers. About a third of the city's 12,770 police employees missed a Friday deadline to report their vaccination status, and some officers have been put on no-pay status.  "Fundamentally, what this all is about is about saving lives. It's about maximising the opportunity to create a safe workplace," Lightfoot said on Monday, accusing the union of tying to "induce an insurrection" by opposing the mandate.  Chicago Fraternal Order of Police union president John Catanzara did not respond to a request for comment.  The White House, which announced sweeping vaccine requirements in a bid to reduce hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 in the wake of a surge driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, has been a major catalyst behind the inoculation push.  On Friday, some 200 Boeing Co employees and others staged a protest over the planemaker's requirement that 125,000 workers be vaccinated by Dec. 8, under an executive order issued by President Joe Biden for federal contractors.  The rules for another order applying to private businesses with 100 or more employees are expected to be finalized soon.  Along with the mandate for federal workers and contractors, Biden's vaccine requirements will cover roughly 100 million people, about two-thirds of the U.S. workforce.  The White House has been meeting with executives of several major companies to discuss Biden's private-sector vaccination plan.  A wave of layoffs has already swept through the healthcare industry, which moved more quickly than others to impose vaccine mandates given the heightened COVID-19 exposure risk for patients and staff.  Nurses and other healthcare workers who chose to leave their jobs rather than be immunized recently told Reuters they could not get past their concern over a lack of long-term data on the three vaccines available in the United States.  While the vaccines received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in less than a year, medical experts have widely vouched for their safety, citing years of research, large clinical trials and real world data after hundreds of millions have been vaccinated worldwide.  Like WSU's Rolovich, many unvaccinated workers seeking an exemption have done so on religious grounds. It was not clear how a university committee in charge of weighing such exemptions ruled in his case.  School leaders said the mandate was aimed at ensuring the safety of its faculty and staff.  "Experience is showing that vaccine mandates help motivate people to complete the vaccination process," Marty Dickinson, WSU Board of Regents Chair, said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-workers-face-layoffs-as-covid-19-vaccine-mandates-kick-in/articleshow/87145127.cms||---
---||World||Top US and Brazil diplomats discuss 'unprecedented' migration||RIO DE JANEIRO: United States secretary of state Antony Blinken spoke with his Brazilian counterpart Carlos Franca to discuss "unprecedented" regional migration and ways to collaborate to slow the number of migrants heading north, the State Department said on Tuesday.  The call between the senior diplomatic officials of the two largest economies in the Americas comes as a record number of Brazilians arrive at the southern US border, part of a wave of people from Latin America fleeing a region hit badly by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Southern border apprehensions have jumped to their highest levels in 20 years in recent months, causing political and logistical headaches for US President Joe Biden.  In the call, Blinken and Franca discussed "the unprecedented irregular migration movements throughout the hemisphere", and how the two nations could work together "to halt the growing uncontrolled flow of irregular migrants in the region", according to State Department spokesperson Ned Price.  Diplomatic efforts are under way to slow the arrival of Brazilians. Mexico is slated to impose visa requirements for Brazilian visitors, according to a document from Mexico's Interior Ministry. Mexico has not required visas for Brazilians since 2004, giving migrants an easier path to enter the country and proceed north.  Reuters reported last week that Washington has, since July, asked Mexico to impose visa requirements on Brazilians.  During the first 11 months of the 2021 fiscal year, 46,280 Brazilians were apprehended at the southern US border, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data show, compared with 17,893 for all of 2019.  Blinken also praised Brazil's "leadership in assisting vulnerable populations of migrants, including Haitians and Venezuelans".  Last month, Reuters reported that the International Organization for Migration had asked Brazil to receive some Haitian migrants camped along the US-Mexico border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/top-us-and-brazil-diplomats-discuss-unprecedented-migration/articleshow/87145328.cms||---

The CST-100 had been scheduled to fly to the International Space Station (ISS) from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on August 3 but the flight was aborted just hours before launch because of problems with propulsion system valves.  Boeing officials told reporters in a briefing on Tuesday that they were still conducting testing of the valves but they may have become stuck because of moisture or condensation.  "Normal environment humidity was likely the source of that moisture in the valves," Michelle Parker, Boeing Space and Launch chief engineer, said.  Boeing was forced to remove the spacecraft from the Atlas V rocket built by United Launch Alliance and transport it to a factory at Kennedy Space Center for troubleshooting of the valves.  John Vollmer, vice-president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, said the aerospace giant was now looking to conduct the unmanned CST-100 test flight in the "first half of 2022".  If that flight is successful, "we would look at CFT (crewed flight test) maybe by the end of the year," Vollmer said.  "We like to see six months in between flights," he said.  Boeing built the Starliner under contract with NASA to ferry astronauts to low Earth orbit following the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011.  NASA gave both Boeing and SpaceX multi-billion dollar contracts to provide its astronauts with taxi services to the space station and end US reliance on Russian rockets for the journey.  SpaceX's program has moved forward faster, having now undertaken four crewed missions.  Boeing's program is lagging behind and the aborted Starliner launch was a setback for the company. Boeing needs to complete a successful uncrewed mission before it can carry astronauts.  During an initial unmanned test flight in December 2019, the Starliner capsule experienced glitches with its thrusters. It did not have enough fuel to reach the ISS and had to return to Earth prematurely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/boeing-aims-for-unmanned-starliner-test-flight-in-first-half-of-2022/articleshow/87146378.cms||---

In the July-September quarter, money transfers with UPI and merchant payments crossed the Rs 200 crore transaction milestone clocking Rs 221 crore and Rs 231 crore transactions respectively, said Karthik Raghupathy, head of strategy and investor relations at PhonePe said. Nearly 4 out of 5 merchant payments are now offline payment transactions in this period of time, the digital payments & financial services platform said. “The rapid growth (QoQ) we are seeing is an indicator that digital payments are truly penetrating across all markets. It is going to be an exciting next quarter with the festivities and the holiday season. We are already looking forward to interesting insights and trends from Q4 2021,” Raghupathy said. Banking technology provider Sarvatra Technologies, which has partnered with over 50 urban co-operative banks live on its UPI platform, said it saw a significant shift in the confidence of store owners in accepting offline digital payments, compared to July-September quarter last year. Its MD, Mandar Agashe said the offline digital transactions allow the kirana shop owners to accept payments via QR code with the instant notification of payment completion. “Even the smallest size of payments are now accepted by these stores, since it allows them to service more customers, saving the time of payments,” he said. Another payment service enabler PayNearby’s MD & CEO Anand Kumar Bajaj which saw a significant increase in offline digital payment by 11.5% month-on-month in September, 2021 said they saw a stable growth in online payments as well. “Besides the increasing usage of the QR code and card swipes, we do see a higher traction towards the ‘Tap and Pay’ option, which is largely seen as an urban phenomenon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/offline-payment-volumes-overtake-online-in-july-sept/articleshow/87144901.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Out of 16 newly-built retiring rooms located at the Karbighaiya end of Patna Junction, four of them have been made functional now. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, “Railways has fixed the tariff for a single super deluxe retiring room at Rs 1600 for 24 hours, while it is Rs 1,120 for each single AC retiring room for 24 hours. Apart from this, 18% GST will be also charged.” The retiring rooms are being booked from a separate counter at Patna Junction, while efforts are being made to provide online booking facility for the convenience of passengers. Retiring rooms are being made functional after a gap of almost two years, the CPRO said adding passengers, however, will have to follow strict Covid protocol during their stay in the rooms. According to sources, the railways has retiring room facility at Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal and Danapur station falling under the jurisdiction of Danapur division of ECR. The retiring rooms loacted near the Mahavir temple side will also be made functional in a day or two after renovation, sources said. Meanwhile , railways has reduced the price of platform ticket from Rs 50 to Rs 10 following strong protest from passengers across the country. The Railway Board has taken this decision to restore platform ticket price to pre- pandemic days at all major stations. Railways has also ensured that platform tickets can be obtained from all UTS (unserved ticketing system) counters. It may be recalled that railways had increased platform ticket price from Rs 10 to Rs 50 per person at 50 stations in the ECR to check unnecessary gathering of people on railway platforms due to Covid-19 pandemic during the first wave last year .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rlys-makes-retiring-rooms-functional-at-patna-jn/articleshow/87143141.cms||Kumod Verma

Total expenses were up nearly 12% at Rs 9,883 crore during the quarter that was marked by unprecedented inflation, which the company’s CMD Sanjiv Mehta described as something “not seen in many years”. A high inflationary environment has brought margins under pressure. While ebitda margin at 25% was stepped up sequentially as compared to the June quarter this year, the YoY margin was down by 40 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) as compared to the corresponding quarter last year. HUL said the growth in bottom line was aided by net revenue management and savings that enabled the firm to manage inflationary pressures with the objective of keeping consumers in its franchise. Nearly 70% of HUL’s growth comes from volumes, while the balance is from pricing actions taken by the FMCG major. Sequentially, HUL has raised prices by 2% even as the company remains cautiously optimistic about demand recovery. HUL said its performance was broad-based with all three divisions growing competitively — more than 75% of the business gained market share and penetration. Calibrated price increases were taken across fabric wash and household care portfolios to partly offset the high inflation in input costs. The same approach towards price increase has helped protect the beauty and personal care business model as vegetable oil prices remain at elevated levels. “September quarter witnessed a sequential improvement in trading conditions, albeit remained challenging with unprecedented levels of input cost inflation and subdued consumer sentiments. In this backdrop, we have delivered a strong performance growing top line in double digits and stepping up profitability sequentially,” said Mehta. He added, “Calibrated price increases and laser sharp focus on savings have helped us protect our business model while ensuring the right price-value equation for our consumers.” HUL CFO Ritesh Tiwari said the industry continues to witness unprecedented levels of inflation in some of our key input materials, palm oil, crude, packaging materials and freight rates. HUL, said Tiwari, will continue to dynamically manage all lines of its P&L, leverage a robust savings programme, and use net revenue management principles to take calibrated and judicious pricing actions. Volume growth is up by 4% on a year-on-year basis. However, when viewed sequentially, it is lower as compared to 9% volume growth in the June quarter because of a base effect of an unusual 2020. “Key laggards in volume growth in our view were hygiene products, sanitisers, foods, and tea (either due to high base or sharp price hikes),” said Abneesh Roy of Edelweiss Securities. Nielsen’s numbers reveal that the rural market growth for the FMCG industry has moderated, albeit from a higher base. Urban growths on the other hand have inched up with improved mobility after the second Covid wave (Google mobility index is at 87% in September 2021, as compared to 37% in May 2021). Overall consumer sentiment, however, remains subdued. The HUL board has declared an interim dividend of Rs 15 per share for the current fiscal year. Following the announcement of the results, the HUL stock dropped by about 4% to close at Rs 2,546 on the BSE on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/huls-q2-profit-rises-9-amid-high-inflation/articleshow/87144376.cms||---

According to a presentation by the Confederation of ATM Industry (CATMI), far-flung machines will have to be shut down as it is not possible to ensure cash availability around the clock. In a presentation that was shared with the media, CATMI said that the norms would mean that 70-80% of semi-urban & rural ATMs and 20-30% of urban ATMs would be liable for the Rs 10,000 penalty and the likely penalty on operators would be Rs 80-100 crore per month. The confederation has said that there are only two-three major cash-replenishment agencies in the country and they are unable to service small towns and villages with the desired frequency. Moreover, 8-10 hour power outages in many semi-urban and rural areas disrupt cash loading. Currently, around 42% of rural ATMs are loaded only once a week while 20% are loaded twice every week. The rest are loaded with cash on alternate days. “If implemented, the current scheme will force bans, white-label ATM operators (WLTAO), management service providers to shut down all far-flung ATMs which are difficult to operate. WLAOs, who are currently rolling out 600-700 ATMs per month in the interiors of the country, will be forced to stall/curtail or close operations,” the confederation said. CATMI added that closure of ATMs in areas that need them for the distribution of subsidies and benefits will mean serious inconvenience to the under-served segments of the society and will impact financial inclusion. It said that banks have already started introducing contractual penalty clauses with management service providers (or MSPs, the companies that manage ATM networks on behalf of banks for a fee). In a request for proposals, a large public sector bank has said that the MSP will face a cashout penalty of Rs 1,000 if there is no cash for 4-8 hours, Rs 2,000 (for up to 24 hours) and Rs 4,000 for more than 24-hour cashout situations. “For white-label ATM operators and MSPs with low transaction volumes at around 80-90 per day, this penalty is 25-30% of the revenue. With such huge penalties, both MSPs/WLAO model will become defunct. Cumulatively, all WLAOs earn around Rs 90 crore per month and this levy will be Rs 25-30 crore per month,” the confederation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/stiff-cashout-penalties-may-lead-to-shutdowns-atm-cos-tell-rbi/articleshow/87144330.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar students find CBSE new plan disadvantageous||PATNA: The students of classes X and XII welcomed the CBSE decision that they would write their Term I examinations in their own school. Many students, however, feared that the syllabus for Term II exams will not be completed on time as they may get less than two months for the annual exams. The CBSE released the Term I date-sheet on Monday. The examination for major subjects for classes X and XII will begin from November 30 and December 1, respectively. The Term II exams will be held in February and March 2022. The syllabus for the both the exams will be different. The final results will be declared after both the examinations. Ashi Sinha, a class XII student of Notre Dame Academy, said, “It will be a disadvantage for us as we have only completed the syllabus for Term I and did not focus on Term II. For Term I, we have to deeply study every topic for objective-type questions while the Term II syllabus will be subjective and vast. The new pattern is different and we do no know how much time we may get for the Term II exams.” Urvashi Sinha, who studies at St Michael’s High School, had similar worries. “We are to get very little time for syllabus completion and revision for Term II. I don’t know how the teachers are going to complete the syllabus. Usually, we get one month time after pre-board for thorough revision. It is a drawback for us,” she said. Sinha added: “Teachers are saying there will either be no winter vacation or a short one. Besides, they have to go little fast to complete the syllabus. Still, it’s the problem for us to cover the syllabus.” Pratik Sharma, a Class X student of Loyola High School, said had the board planned the exam in October-end or November first week, they might have got some time to complete the Term II syllabus. “Only completion of syllabus will not be enough. We have to revise it thoroughly for the subjective exam. We are at disadvantage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pupils-find-cbse-new-plan-disadvantageous/articleshow/87143418.cms||Faryal Rumi

The PM will dedicate the airport to ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshta Bharat’, reaffirming India’s diplomatic peace initiative to further buttress ties with Sri Lanka and a host of Buddhist countries. Rajapakshe’s delegation, including 12 members of the Holy Relic Entourage, over 100 monks and four other ministers shall be presenting, among other relics, two photographs of murals commemorating the Mauryan royal off-springs’ epochal mission to Sri Lanka. Delegates and Buddhist clergy from several other nations shall also be joining the PM at the airport inaugural and the ceremony marking Abhidhamma Day at Mahaparinirvan temple where Lord Buddha attained salvation. “The Kushinagar airport will provide a fillip to tourism both in eastern UP and northwest Bihar,” Union tourism secretary Arvind Singh told this newspaper. “Pilgrim-tourists from countries, including Japan, China, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Sri Lanka shall now have the satisfaction of a more holistic Buddhist trail experience with the commissioning of the international airport at Kushinagar that shall easily encompass the sites along Buddha’s ‘Last Walk’ trail from Vaishali, cutting through Kesaria and Lauriya-Nandangarh in Bihar,” Singh said, adding that the Gandhi Circuit in Champaran would be another attraction. “Earlier, international charter flights would land at Bodh Gaya and return via Varanasi. Kushinagar shall now provide the Buddhist tourists a wider arc,” he further said, adding, “Kushinagar promises to widen the tourist horizon.” Meanwhile, in neighbouring Nepal, it’s much delayed Gautam Buddha International Airport project at Bhairawa, abutting Buddha’s birth place Lumbini is also expected to be inaugurated in early 2022. That will provide international tourists an opportunity of a composite India-Nepal Buddhist pilgrimage. Kushinagar airport director A K Dwivedi said, “Commercial traffic from this airport is expected to commence from November 26.” DGCA chief Arun Kumar said: “Kushinagar International Airport has been certified. Both national and international carriers can now apply to operate in this sector.” But, road travellers on the East-West Corridor cutting through Kushinagar and also the Buddhist Circuit routes in Bihar have often rued lack of decent eateries and even toilets along the way. “This is a challenge that provides a large window of opportunity to provide jobs with the opening of cafes/food courts with hygienic washrooms. Local entrepreneurs should be cashing in to cater to the tourists whose footfalls are bound to soar,” Singh said. The UP tourism department estimates a 20% jump in tourist arrivals soon. Car rentals and taxi services promise to be another employment generation opportunity, he added. Moreover, for the diaspora from more than half a dozen districts in east UP along with four districts in northwest Bihar (East and West Champaran, Siwan and Gopalganj) in the middle east, Kushinagar shall now offer a direct flight home. “About 8.5 to 9 million Indians are in the Gulf countries. A sizeable number of them are from UP and Bihar,” Sanjay Bhattacharya, Secretary-MEA (counsel of passports-visa & overseas Indian affairs), said. “In fact, we have just signed an MoU with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai to undertake a study of migrations from Bihar,” he told this newspaper. The tourism secretary, under whose earlier watch as the chairman of AAI the airport at Darbhanga was commissioned and the Kushinagar airport neared completion, said: “Look how successful Darbhanga airport has been. This has been largely due to the traffic from the region’s diaspora spread across India. Kushinagar too provides a similar option to people from the Poorvanchal region, including north Bihar, who live and work in cities across the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kushinagar-airport-to-boost-tourism-in-up-bihar-secy/articleshow/87143266.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

After the out-of-the-box solution to raging liquor menace met with success in Motipura village some 7 km away from motown Sanand, the experiment has been adopted by 23 more villages across Ahmedabad, Surendranagar, Amreli and Kutch districts. Only the fine has been raised to Rs 2,500 which is used to fund local socio-religious events. Babu Nayak, sarpanch of Motipura village which implemented the anti-liquor addiction pilot in Motipura and leader of Nat Samaj or nomad community in Gujarat, says currently 24 villages follow the experiment after it proved a major deterrent in the village. Most of the villages report high liquor menace and have an average 100-150 liquor widows, women who lost their husbands to alcoholism. Interestingly, women are roped in as informants who give tip-off about drunk men in the village. Their names are never revealed but are given Rs 501 or Rs 1,100 from the fine collected as incentive for a social cause. “The menace of drunk husbands creating ruckus and indulging in domestic violence has cut down by 90%. Spending a night in a village cage and community leader warning of social boycott proved a major preventive,” says Nayak. “Police take action as per law whenever anyone is caught drunk. We do not hand over drunks to cops. Ours is more of a social and community intervention to avoid villagers consuming liquor and falling in debt trap and legal troubles," says Nayak. The Nat Samaj spread the word and more villages joined in the `social experiment'. Rajan Nat of Gadhsisa village in Mandvi taluka of Kutch says the cage experiment was implemented in April 2021. "So far, we've got half a dozen cases but the impact has been visible. Men avoid getting drunk in public. Cases of domestic discord due to drinking has also gone down," says Nat. Squads of elders carry out surprise checks following tip-offs by village women and if a person is caught drunk on `sniff test', he is made to spend the night in the makeshift cage. A bottle of water and another bottle to relieve oneself is provided. Jigar Nayak of Mota village in Viramgam in Ahmedad says the embarrassment has proved a bigger deterrant. "If police case happens, families lose livelihood and money on legal expense. This is a cheaper way to make locals give up the addiction using some social pressure," says Nayak.

The Centre’s recent allotment of four blocks for mining in the state has paved the way for exploitation of many more economic minerals in the coming years. State mines and geology minister Janak Ram said the state has already been allotted four blocks, including one each in Aurangabad and Gaya districts (for mining of potash) and two in Rohtas district (for mining of chromium and nickel). The process of auctioning these blocks is likely to be completed shortly, he added. The minister added mining of potash would boost the fertilizer industries of Bihar, while chromium and nickel can be used in the manufacture of several consumer items, including mobile and aviation-related products. “All this will certainly help the state government in generating new employment opportunities for the youths of the state and improving the state’s economy,” he said. Ram said detailed investigations for other economic minerals were being carried out by different teams of the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and the investigations have already indicated rich reserves of various minerals. “Work for estimating reserves of coal and fire clay in Bhagalpur district and mica in Nawada district is also in considerable progress,” the minister added. Giving details of the availability of economic minerals in the state, GSI director Bishwapriya said a number of minerals, including alkaline earth (locally known as ‘Reh’), copper, graphite, gold, iron ores, kyanite, limestone, pyrite, silica sand, tin uranium and barium are found in varying proportions in different parts of the state. The state is the principal holder of country’s pyrite resources, possessing 95% of the total. Other important mineral resources include limestone in Kaimur (Bhabhua), Munger and Rohtas districts, mica in Nawada district, silica sand in Bhagalpur, Jamui, Munger and Nalanda districts, quartzite in Lakhisarai, Munger and Nalanda districts, and talc (or soapstone) in Munger district. Bishwapriya added occurrences of gold in Jamui district, feldspar in Gaya, Jamui and Munger districts, iron ores in Bhagalpur, Gaya and Jamui districts, lead-zinc in Banka and Rohtas districts and granite in Bhagalpur, Gaya, Jahanabad and Jamui districts have also been reported and some of them are being worked out. “If mining is carried out in a proper way in all these districts, the state will receive enough revenue to boost its economy,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/min-mineral-exploration-to-boost-states-economy/articleshow/87143212.cms||B K Mishra

Police claimed they will be able to recover the video footage from it which will help find out exactly how the fire started. The cameras have been installed at multiple locations in the building. The unit is a six-storey building which has two levels of basement. Cops were surprised when told by the factory inspector that the unit was not registered as an industrial unit but a residential building. The revelation has raised various questions as to how the building got the electricity connection required for industrial use. “The type of electricity connection the unit was using is yet not clear. Our officers are inquiring into this aspect,” said an official from the Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (DGVCL). Police will ask for an investigation report of the electrical inspector based on which further action will be taken. Meanwhile, a team of forensic science laboratory (FSL) carried out an inspection of the building to find out the exact cause of the fire. “It is not yet clear how the fire started,” said an official. FSL team collected samples and inspected the building which was used for production of packaging material and bags, as a warehouse as well as residence of workers. Abdul Kadir Abdul Samad Bharvaliya (23) of Uttar Pradesh and Mohan Kripakant Ameri Jha (38) of Bihar died in the incident. Bharvaliya tried to get down from the building by hanging a long piece of cloth from outside as many workers were trying to escape. Jha got trapped in the basement and suffered severe burn injuries.  The fire started from the lower floor and spread to the upper areas. A huge quantity of goods stored on the staircase also caught fire making it impossible for the workers living on the top two floors to get down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/police-recover-dvr-from-vareli-packaging-unit/articleshow/87143847.cms||---

However, this rise of 50-150 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) would be still lower than the peak of 11.2% in March 2018 and 9.1% in March 2019 as the corporate sector continues to be resilient. According to a report by Crisil, Covid relief measures like the restructuring dispensation and the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) will help limit the rise. With around 2% of bank credit expected under restructuring by the end of this fiscal, stressed assets — comprising gross NPAs and loan book under restructuring — should touch 10-11%. “The retail and MSME segments, which together form about 40% of bank credit, are expected to see higher accretion of NPAs and stressed assets this time around. Stressed assets in these segments are seen rising to 4-5% from 3% last fiscal and 17-18% from around 14%, respectively, by this fiscal end. The numbers would have trended even higher but for write-offs, primarily in the unsecured segment,” said Crisil Ratings senior director Krishnan Sitharaman. According to Crisil, the retail segment, which had a relatively stable run over the past decade, has been singed by the pandemic with salaried and self-employed borrowers alike facing significant income challenges and higher medical expenses, especially in the second wave. Despite the measures, Crisil Ratings believes stressed assets in the retail segment will rise. While home loans, the largest segment, will be the least impacted, unsecured loans are expected to bear the brunt of the pandemic. The MSME segment is likely to see asset quality deteriorate and will require restructuring to manage cash-flow challenges. Crisil expects 4-5% of the MSME loan book to be restructured, leading to a jump in stressed assets to 17-18% by this fiscal end. As against this, only 1% of the corporate loan book is expected to undergo restructuring. The rural segment, which was hit harder during the second wave of the pandemic, has also seen a strong recovery. Therefore, stressed assets in the agriculture segment are expected to remain relatively stable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bad-loans-to-rise-up-to-150bps-in-fy22-study/articleshow/87144320.cms||---

But profit-taking by a large number of investors on the back of the recent surge in share prices led to a strong sell-off in stocks outside of the leading indices. As a result, after hitting a life high at 62,245 points in mid-session, the market witnessed strong selling in late trades and closed at 61,716 — down 50 points on the day. The sensex took just two days to go past the 62k mark from 61k, one of the fastest ever for covering a 1,000-point gap. It also took nine months to rally from the historic 50k mark on January 21 this year to 62k on Tuesday. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, the domestic market opened above 62k and continued its positive rally backed by its global peers, but witnessed huge volatility to finally close the session in the red. “The festive mood along with further relaxation (from Covid-related restrictions) in Maharashtra continues to cheer investors and is thus driving the positive momentum. Accelerated demand and good quarterly corporate results have kept investors’ interest sanguine,” Khemka wrote in a post-market note. “However, rising global commodity and energy prices continue to be a cause of worry. With lot of heavyweights reporting their numbers this week, it would keep the markets volatile.” The day’s slide outside of the sensex was apparent from the sell-off in several sectors that had outperformed the index. By the end of the session, BSE’s realty index closed 4.6% lower while FMCG lost 3.1% and the consumer durables index 2.9%. Among the handful of sectoral gainers were IT (up 1.3%) and capital goods (gained 0.6%). The day’s sell-off also left investors poorer by Rs 3.3 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 274 lakh crore. Data at the end of the day on the BSE also showed that both foreign and domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 506 crore and Rs 2,578 crore, respectively. Of late, foreign fund managers have been taking money off Indian stock markets with October’s net inflow figure now at about Rs 1,200 crore, compared to a net inflow of Rs 13,154 crore in September. Among the 30 sensex stocks, 16 closed in the red, while 14 closed higher. However, in the broader market, the advance-decline ratio was highly skewed in favour of declines at 935-to-2,427, BSE data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-scales-62k-on-volatile-day-gains-12k-pts-in-9-months/articleshow/87144338.cms||---

If I have to simplify, it is just to be humane and responsive to every employee who needs help. Although it may look simple, the most difficult things in life are the day-to-day ones — which we fail to do consistently every day. Someone once asked me: What it means to be a professional? I had replied: Responding always, keep your time & commitment, dressing for the occasion and being empathetic always. Today, I would think it’s simpler. Just be humane, grounded, accessible and respond to the stated and unstated needs of every employee. During this pandemic, quite a few young employees reached out to me and expressed their concerns. I will share two case studies to show their anguish… The first was a young employee working in a multinational. She reached out knowing that I had retired more than two years ago from an active corporate role. When I asked why she reached out to me, she said that I was always accessible and she was sure I will respond to her. She sent me a message on social media, and I did respond. We then had a call and followed up with several more. Her concern was that ‘work from home’ has ruined both her work life as well as personal life. She said she had to respond to international calls even at 11pm and her spouse was not amused nor were her kids. She said she was more stressed than ever. The second case was a mid-level manager from an Indian corporation. His query: Why is it that everyone is under stress nowadays? Can stressed employees deliver their best? He went on to state that this sort of stress neither is good for the employees nor the organisation. Again, when I asked why he contacted me as I have not even met him, he said that some of his friends told him that I would respond positively. The two cases are symptomatic of what is happening in organisations today. Employees, managers and leaders are all under stress. They are finding it difficult to balance work and life and the pandemic has made it more complicated for them as the line between office and home has blurred. What can HR do to help employees? I would say: Let’s keep it simple. HR needs to be humane and responsive. They need to be accessible to the employee all the time. They need to be empathetic listeners and employee champions. They need to respond to every employee irrespective of them being an introvert or an extrovert, a junior or senior employee in the hierarchy. I would rather say, HR needs to reach out to the quiet employees much more and respond to their needs. Some may ask: What it means to be humane? Being empathetic and responding to every employee by putting yourself in their shoes will make you respond in a humane way. If we respond the way we expect others to respond when we are in a crisis, it is the humane way. It is like the murmuring of birds in the sky. Nobody knows who the leader is or who HR is. They sway together and support each other always when attacked by a predatory bird. HR needs to be like the invisible saviour of the birds in the sky within organisations. If we are humane, grounded, accessible and responsive, HR will be the function which employees will hail as their messiah in distress. Otherwise, they may wonder as to why HR exists in organisations. It is time for HR to be humane and responsive, always.

The state government is unable to take the work on R&R colonies forward as it involves a huge cost. According to latest reports, the state government could complete just around 7,000 housing units of the total 1.2 lakh units proposed for the oustees. Even though the government had aimed to complete around 10,000 housing units in the R&R colonies by August itself, progress was hit due to the paucity of funds. The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (STs) that inspected the R&R colonies recently expressed serious displeasure over the progress and quality of work. The commission directed the state government to not relocate the tribal people from their existing villages to the proposed colonies without completing basic infrastructure first. The commission asked how officials could propose to shift the people to the R&R colonies when infrastructure such as roads, drinking water and power supply had not been created. The Union jal shakti ministry and finance ministry are yet to respond to the appeals of the state government and the Polavaram Project Authority (PPA). The PPA, the nodal agency appointed by the jal shakti ministry to oversee progress of the project, has reportedly urged the ministry to clear the revised cost estimations to complete the project as per the schedule, by June 2022. Finance minister Buggana Rajendranath met Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman several times in the last few months in a bid to get the project cost cleared. However, the Centre looks unmoved by the state’s representations as it has decided to stick to the old cost of Rs 22,000 crore. In fact, the Central Water Commission (CWC) had recommended payment of Rs 55,656 crore towards the project cost, including Rs 33,168 crore for the R&R package. The Centre has so far reimbursed Rs 11,492 crore of the total project cost besides keeping the revised estimations on hold. Sources said the state government would require at least Rs 15,000 crore to complete the first phase of R&R package works and release of compensation to the oustees before water is stored in the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/delay-in-clearing-polavaram-project-cost-hits-rr-works/articleshow/87143862.cms||Samdani MN

Babu alias Raman Patel, who works in Patel Somabhai Ramdas firm, chased the two robbers and clung onto the car duo used to get away, but his valiant attempts did not bring any results. Earlier, Patel had boarded a bus for Bhavnagar carrying valuables worth Rs 60.8 lakh in a bag at Una bus stand at around 5.45am. Before the bus started, two men with their faces covered with masks, entered the bus and snatched the bag from Patel — all within a matter of few seconds. Even though the employee gave a chase, the duo, however, escaped in the car waiting outside the bus stand. Police said that two accomplices were already seating in the car and when they saw Patel chasing the duo, they opened the doors of the car in advance and sped off while the two robbers got inside. Patel clung to the car driver’s door and was dragged for a few metres, before being thrown off. Later in the day, the car without registration plates was found abandoned at a deserted place on Bhavnagar road. Police said that they are trying to find out the owner on basis of the engine and chassis numbers. “Different teams of LCB and SOG have been pressed into investigation. We are going through the CCTV camera footage of Una as well as Bhavnagar road and are also trying to track them on the basis of mobile phone network,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/dramatic-loot-of-rs-61l-from-angadiya-man-in-una/articleshow/87144077.cms||---

Raja of Dahtola under Bounsi panchayat and Yogendra from Khairuganj were gunned down by militants in Kulgam district of Kashmir on October 17. A host of leaders, including deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, labour resources department minister Jibesh Kumar and BJP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi paid floral tributes to the departed souls at the airport. Later, the relatives of the deceased left with the bodies for Araria in an ambulance. A team of Araria district officials accompanied them. The body of Muzahid, a mason by profession, had reached his native village on Sunday night. His wife Dilkho Bano cursed her fate as her husband had gone to Kashmir about six months ago to earn livelihood. Dilkho is more worried about the survival of the family. “He was the only breadwinner in the family. I have to look after four minor children, including two daughters. It is an uphill task for a poor woman like me,” she said in a choked voice. Muzahid’s younger brother, Md Dilwar, said an Army official posted at Kargil Army checkpoint informed the family on Wednesday night that terrorists attacked him when he along with two others had gone to purchase vegetables from a nearby market. The Army personnel rushed him to the hospital where the doctor declared him dead. Over 300 people hailing from villages like Bisrupa, Bhakhri, Amna, Bagulabari, Bahadur, Adhkaili and Amnakismat under Dagarua block are serving as labourers in different parts of J&K. “Majority of them are still stuck in the Valley. The family members are worried about their safety,” Dilwar said. Meanwhile, Yogendra’s mother Barni Devi told this newspaper over phone that he had gone to J&K on persuasion of a contractor, Brahma Rishidev, stated to be a resident of Mirzapur in Araria district. Arvind Rishidev of Raniganj block in Araria said he left the Valley two weeks ago, apprehending attack from militants. He had gone to the Valley about six months ago. “I left Kashmir for home after the situation deteriorated and attacks on non-local residents increased,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bodies-of-2-araria-natives-killed-in-jk-reach-home/articleshow/87143461.cms||Ramashankar

The government needs to get Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and environmental clearances to keep the ship at shore, a task that has raised challenges. The 80-meter-long ship drifted from its anchorage point at Visakhapatnam Port Trust and ran aground at Tenneti Park near Jodugullapalem and Kailasagiri hill on Beach Road in October 2020. Days after the incident, the tourism department planned to purchase the ship and convert it into a tourist attraction. The Port City is known for its TU-142 Aircraft Museum and INS Kursura Museum that draw large numbers of domestic and international tourists. But no detailed project report (DPR) has been prepared yet to convert the ship into a floating tourist destination. The 3,000-tonne cargo vessel will attract tourists if it is converted into a floating restaurant or any other attraction, state tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao told TOI. “Efforts are on for the proposal. Officers concerned in the department are trying to get the permissions. We hope all hurdles will be cleared soon,” the minister said. Sources in the tourism department said the ship is located in a CRZ-IV category and needs clearances before tourism activity can commence. The aquatic area from the low tide line up to territorial limits is classified as CRZ-IV, including the area of the tidal influenced water body. While there are no restrictions on traditional fishing undertaken by local communities, no untreated sewage or solid waste shall be let off or dumped in these areas. The issue has now come down to whether the government’s proposal to convert the ship into a hotel or another proposal will get permission. Sources said the government is still studying technical aspects. Executive director of the tourism department A L Malreddy told TOI this would be a new kind of project and one that has not been attempted before. “We need to get permissions such as CRZ and environmental clearance from the Centre. We are discussing the maintenance, future maintenance, stability of the ship and permissions to convert the ship into a tourist attraction. Once we get the permissions, it will be ready within 12 months,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/plans-to-refurbish-abandoned-ship-on-hold/articleshow/87143793.cms||Siva G
---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra: Man held on charge of setting 10 houses on fire||KOLHAPUR: A man was arrested by the Satara police on Monday for allegedly burning down 10 houses under the influence of alcohol at the Majgaon village in the Patan taluka. According to the police, the accused — Sanjay Ramchandra Patil — suspected his wife of having an extramarital affair and frequently fought with her. On Monday evening, Patil lit a fire in his own house that is a part of large congregation of old houses. The fire led to a cylinder blast that later engulfed the other houses. The fire forced the residents to rush out without taking their belongings and according to a primary estimate, the damages have been pegged at Rs 50 lakh. The locals thrashed Patil before handing him over to police. “We have arrested the accused and doused the fire. However, the residents of these houses have nothing left expect the clothes they were wearing before leaving the house,” Uttam Bhapkar, the assistant police inspector from Malharpeth police station, said. Residents claimed that Patil tried to kill his wife by burning his house down. However, nobody got hurt in the incident. Before the arrival of firefighters, the villagers tried to douse the fire with the help of public water supply system. Two firefighters reached the spot and the flames were doused in 20 minutes. Police said several gas cylinders from the houses exploded that helped spread the fire rapidly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/patan-man-held-on-charge-of-setting-10-houses-on-fire/articleshow/87143086.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Dry spell poses threat to crop yield in kharif||VIJAYAWADA: The prevailing dry spell across the state is likely to pose a threat to expected crop yields this kharif season. According to information available with the state agriculture department, 325 out of 670 mandals have experienced three dry spells this season. The dry spell is calculated if there is no rain for three continuous weeks after the monsoon enters for the season. This year, though there was 5.8% of excess rainfall in the state, comparatively, the north coastal districts and Rayalaseema districts have experienced a greater dry spell. The state had received 513.2 mm rainfall against the average rainfall of 484.9 mm from June to the first week of October this year. While Nellore district had received the lowest rainfall, Chittoor and Kadapa districts received the highest, leaving normal rainfall in the remaining 10 districts. In Srikakulam district, out of 38 mandals, 13 experienced a single dry spell, while 20 mandals recorded two dry spells and 33 mandals experienced three dry spells between June and October. However, Krishna district had seen just two mandals with single dry spell and two more with three dry spells. These four mandals are from the western parts of the district, where agriculture is cultivated under borewells, besides rain-fed crops. Similarly, West Godavari district has witnessed eight mandals with a single dry spell and eight mandals with three dry spells. As many as 50% of these mandals have had the experience of the longest dry spells this season, where mostly paddy is cultivated. This year, Chittoor is comparatively in a better place with only eight out of 66 mandals experiencing a single dry spell. Dry spell is one of the conditions to declare drought in the state. Besides rainfall, availability of drinking water and fodder and the crop situation are also considered before the Centre declares an area as drought-hit. While there is no severe drought, the long gap between spells of rain can cause adverse changes in the moisture levels and affect crops and yield for the season. However, all these would be known once the officials start evaluation in December, by which time, the paddy harvesting will have been completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/dry-spell-poses-threat-to-crop-yield-in-kharif/articleshow/87143812.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Vadodara||Salahuddin Sheikh was influenced by Zakir Naik: Police||Vadodara: Hawala and religious conversion racket accused Salahuddin Sheikh was influenced by the speeches of preacher Zakir Naik who fled India in 2016. During his interrogation, Sheikh told the special investigations team (SIT) on Tuesday that he had attended a peace conference addressed by Naik in 2007 in Mumbai. “Sheikh said that he was influenced by Naik’s speeches. We asked him if he had met Naik but he refused. We are trying to ascertain if he was in contact with Naik,” said a SIT member. Naik was booked for money laundering and hate speeches in India following which he fled the country. The Indian authorities are trying to extradite him from Malaysia where he is currently staying. Both Umar Gautam and Sheikh have told the SIT that they also sent about Rs 5 lakh to a man identified as Shabbir in Jammu and Kashmir. “They said that the money was sent to help the poor people but we are verifying if they did some terror funding. The hawala money was also sent to West Bengal and Assam for helping the Rohingya Muslims,” the police said. The duo told the investigators that the crores of rupees which they received through hawala funds were sent to Malegaon, Malda, Nepal, Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Kerala in the last five years. Sheikh received over Rs 60 crore through hawala and another Rs 19 crore from a UK resident Abullah Fefdawala who too has been sent summons by the cops. “Umar said that he had converted around 10 persons including three women in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi,” revealed the investigators who are questioning the duo after they were brought to the city three days ago. Both are accused of running religious conversion racket and was nabbed by the Uttar Pradesh police a few months ago. Sheikh runs Afmi Trust in the city and the police said that he used the trust as a front to launder money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/salahuddin-sheikh-was-influenced-by-zakir-naik-police/articleshow/87143648.cms||---

The assembly Speaker and chief secretary held several rounds of meetings to review the arrangements, including of security to the President, during his stay in the city. IG (central range) Sanjay Singh said advance security liaison (ASL) meeting has already been held with the SPG personnel for the President’s visit. “On Tuesday, we successfully completed real-time dry run of the President’s convoy movement from the airport to Raj Bhavan and later to the assembly premises, Khadi Mall and Takht Sri Harmandir Ji Patna Sahib gurdwara as well as to the Mahavir Mandir near Patna Junction,” he said. Singh said at least 1500-1600 constables and more than 300 to 400 officers and magistrates would remain deployed for the security of President during his Patna visit. The IG said the state police headquarters has allotted 1000 personnel to Patna police. SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams of anti-terrorism squad (ATS) and Quick Reaction Teams (QRT) of Special Task Force (STF) would also remain deployed at vantage points and in standby mode for immediate reaction. A senior IPS officer, preferring anonymity, said the ATS’s SWAT deployment for VVIP movements in existing global scenario is a mandatory practice. “SWAT teams would not be involved in direct security arrangements for the President. They would remain as standby for use as per the requirement,” he said. ADG (Operation) Sushil Mansingh Khopde said Patna police had asked for STF QRTs, which have been provided for use as per the requirement. “The QRTs would be at the disposal of authorities managing the overall security,” he said. ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar said all due security arrangements at every programme venues and routes for the President have been made as per the blue-book rules. “All necessary security-related equipment, including vehicles, have been provided as per necessity. Additional forces and senior police officers have been provided too,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2k-cops-deployed-in-state-capital-for-presidents-visit/articleshow/87143396.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Rohit Choudhary was welcomed in the JD(U) by party national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh by offering him the membership receipt of the party. Soon after formally joining the JD(U), Rohit with Lalan and other senior party leaders called on Bihar CM Nitish Kumar. Rohit is also the younger brother of senior BJP leader and state’s panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary. Tarapur bypoll is scheduled to be held on October 30. Almost all speakers at the Milan Samaroh, including Lalan, Upendra Kushwaha and education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, highlighted the political significance of Shakuni Choudhary in Tarapur and stated that the bypoll result is bound to come in favour of the JD(U). Sources said, Rohit himself was a serious contender for either BJP or JD(U) ticket for Tarapur bypoll. But the JD(U) fielded Rajiv Kumar Singh, also a Kushwaha, as its candidate. The importance of Shakuni in Tarapur constituency can be gauged from the fact that Lalan, soon after filing of nomination papers by the JD(U) candidate, rushed to his house to take his blessings for the victory of his party. “When I went to meet Shakuni Ji, I asked him to hand over his younger son Rohit to me. Rohit’s mother happily agreed to my proposal,” Lalan said while addressing Milan Samaroh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/shakunis-younger-son-joins-jdu/articleshow/87143165.cms||Madan Kumar

Sharmila’s mother Y S Vijayamma and supporters also paid their respects at Dr YSR Ghat in Idupulapaya. After floating her own political outfit in the neighbouring state, Sharmila disclosed her plans to embark on a 400-day ‘praja prasthanam padayatra’, covering 90 assembly and 14 Parliamentary constituencies in Telangana. The YSRTP chief will first address a public meeting at Shakarpally crossroads in Rangareddy district. The padayatra will be flagged off by Y S Vijayamma from Chevella constituency. Sharmila is the third person from the former chief minister’s family to embark on a marathon padayatra. While Y S Rajasekhara Reddy was the first to go on a 1,475-km-long padayatra, which helped him dethrone TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu, and become chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh in 2004, his son and chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy completed a 3,648-km-long padayatra in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sharmila-pays-tribute-at-ysr-memorial/articleshow/87143840.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Mumbai||Must inoculate every child, insists senior doctor, but not all agree||MUMBAI: There is a need to vaccinate every child against Covid-19 otherwise children could emerge as a potential “reservoir” for the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s transmission and evolution into newer variants, said senior virologist and paediatrician Dr T Jacob John. “Vaccination is the birthright of every child. Covid vaccination is not charity, it is an instrument for a better, healthy tomorrow,” said John, adding that in today’s “one-child families, it would be wrong to not offer the protection of a vaccine to a child”. Quoting from a paper published in ‘The Journal of Infectious Diseases’ on October 14, John told the Indian Academy of Pediatrics that symptomatic and asymptomatic children carry high quantities of live, replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus. With the adult population vaccinated, the children could become the reservoir for the coronavirus to mutate and evolve. Although India has given permission for one vaccine candidate and another vaccine is likely to get the nod soon, there is widespread debate on the merit of vaccinating children below 12 as they don’t get severe disease. Dr Giridhar Babu of the Public Health Foundation of India said: “Science precedes everything else. At the moment, there is no evidence about vaccination being beneficial to children. There is nothing known about their immunogenicity and safety among children.” John, however, said as India had entered the endemic phase of Covid, “if we want to minimise virus transmission and the risk of emergence of new variants by mutations, vaccinating children becomes a public health imperative”. In future, Covid vaccination may become a part of the universal immunisation program for children, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-must-inoculate-every-child-insists-senior-doc-but-not-all-agree/articleshow/87145240.cms||---
---||Kochi||BJP opposes new limestone mine of MCL||Palakkad: The BJP district committee has opposed the move to open a new limestone mine in the Walayar forest for Malabar Cements Ltd (MCL). The new district president of the party, K M Haridas, party state treasurer E Krishnadas and general secretary P Venugopal told reporters that “the mining permission for MCL will end in 2023 in the present limestone mine. So, moves are made to open a new mine in the nearby Pandarathumala. The MCL has sought permission from the Union ministry of forest and environment to open the new mine in Walayar forest. But Pandarathumala is an ecologically sensitive area and no mining should be allowed and the MCL should find alternative methods to get the limestone.” “The CPM-ruled Pudussery grama panchayat had denied permission for starting a new limestone mine at Pandarathumala. But they are under pressure to allow opening of a new mine,” the BJP leaders alleged. The MCL was started in 1978 in Walayar due to the availability of good quality limestone required to manufacture cement. The non-availability of limestone threatens the very survival of this profit-making public sector cement company. It will also put more than 1,000 workers out of job, said the employees of MCL. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bjp-opposes-new-limestone-mine-of-mcl/articleshow/87144174.cms||---

The accused have been identified as Nirale (18) and Ajay (19), while two boys are 17 years old, police said. One of the accused juveniles and the victim, Imran, allegedly had an argument over a girl. The victim’s family claimed that the accused had made communal comments as they thrashed him. Police, however, said it was a fight over a personal issue among friends. Soon a CCTV footage went viral on social media, which shows that local residents and passersby stood there but did not try to save Imran. A police team took a profusely-bleeding Imran to AIIMS Trauma Centre, but he was declared dead. “Initial medical reports show that he had one stab wound that caused his death,” an officer said. Imran’s family members alleged that one of the accused first stabbed him and then kicked him twice on the chest. Imran worked as a salesman at a store in south Delhi. “As he returned from work, his friends asked him to come out. After some time, I received a call from a neighbour who said four-five boys are thrashing Imran and hurling slurs at him,” alleged his sister, Ayesha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-minors-among-4-held-for-stabbing-18-yr-old-to-death-in-sangam-vihar/articleshow/87145225.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttarakhand's catastrophe survivors from Prayagraj recount brush with death||LUCKNOW: Marooned in rain-battered Uttarakhand, Dinesh Kumar Sharma was witness to the unfolding catastrophe with flash floods and landslides wreaking havoc in the Garhwal hills. After surviving the deadly pandemic, Sharma thought he won’t be second-time lucky. But this 42-year-old businessman from Prayagraj, who went on the Char Dham yatra, was back from the jaws of death on Tuesday even as six other tourists were confirmed dead in the flood-ravaged Himalayan state. Sharma and his group of five, all residents of Prayagraj, told TOI that it was a surreal to be home. Recounting his brush with death, Sharma said, “We were thrilled when we left for Char Dham yatra in our car on October 14. Two days later, we reached Badrinath temple after a brief halt at Haridwar. Little did we know that a drizzle which painted a breathtaking view of the hills would suddenly turn into a nightmare.” Five others from Prayagraj who accompanied Sharma — Neeraj Shukla, Kanhaiya Gupta, Nagendra Pandey, Arun Dubey and Mahantmani Mishra — were in a daze. Talking about the ordeal, Sharma said, “As the day progressed, there were frenzied screams of ‘bhago bhago paani aa raha hai’ (run to a safer place to save yourself from rain), triggering a flashback of the 2013 Uttarakhand tragedy which I remember seeing on television.” “Faith became our anchor. Chanting ‘mahamrityunjay mantra’, we headed towards Kedarnath but were numb midway when we saw an SUV from Noida rolling down a gorge. Dumbstruck, we decided not to stop and took shelter in a hotel in Garhwal Mandal. We can’t believe we are still alive. We survived the pandemic, but thought we would be swallowed by nature’s fury this time.” Stuck in a hotel for 48 hours with little hope of survival, the group received frenzied calls from family as news channels flashed pictures of devastation. “The mobile network was feeble, but we managed to make a video call to assure families that we are still alive,” said Shukla. Not waiting for another disaster to happen, the group mustered courage to leave home after rains subsided a little the next morning. “It was raining heavily till Tehri and we could barely see through windowpanes. But the weather cleared, when we reached Rishikesh after a 14-hour treacherous journey of 300km,” said Pandey. On Tuesday evening, the group got a hero’s welcome when it reached home. A beaming Sharma said, “Locals, police and administration were a godsend during the catastrophe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/surreal-to-be-alive-survivors-recount-horror/articleshow/87146051.cms||Ankur Tewari

People greeted one another at the Badi Dargah and the traditional procession — Julus-e-Mohammadi — started from the Chowk Mandai in the old city area at 3 pm. Shahar-e-Khatib Hafiz Hisamuddin Ashrafi and chief maulanas participated in the procession. There were a total of five vehicles in the procession. The procession passed through parts of Bagwanpura, Bhoi Galli, Kathada, Shivaji Chowk, Naikwada Pura, Budhwar Peth, Adamshah Chowk, Kazipura, Pinzar Ghat, etc. The procession route was decorated with festoons and arches. Lazer lights illuminated the route in some stretches. Ahead of the festival, the Nashik city police had conducted a meeting with the leaders of the community and had informed them about the guidelines of the government. The police had appealed to the community to adhere to all guidelines. The textile city of Malegaon, which has a large Muslim population, also celebrated the festival with traditional fervour and gaiety. Heavy bandobast was maintained by the city police in the old city area along the procession route.

---||Aurangabad||South Central Railway’s Nanded division at bottom in terms of railway infrastructure||AURANGABAD: The Nanded division, which caters to several parts of Marathwada, has had only 35km of route electrification and barely 83km of track doubling, revealed the official data furnished by the South Central Railway (SCR). While Nanded division is at the bottom in terms of electrification among six divisions of the SCR, it is placed second from the bottom — just marginally ahead of the Hyderabad division — in doubling of tracks by the difference of only 0.4km. Moreover, the Nanded division is the only division in the zone that still has 130km track of meter-gauge, when most such colonial area routes have been almost phased out across the country. While Union Minister of State for Railways Raosaheb Danve has convened a special meeting of MPs at Aurangabad on Wednesday to address the railway-related issues, stakeholders have raked up the issue of step-motherly treatment towards the Nanded division. Hingoli MP Hemant Patil said official neglect of the Nanded division by the Indian Railways for years has resulted in the division figuring at the bottom in terms of infrastructural development. “While Marathwada has a huge developmental backlog, Indian Railways is to be blamed partially for such backwardness, as it has continued to give biased treatment to the Nanded division,” he said. Railway activist Gautam Nahata said removing the Nanded division from the jurisdiction of SCR could be a way out to end the “step-motherly” treatment. “The Indian Railways should either create a separate zone by merging Nanded and other nearby divisions or attach the Nanded division to the Central Railway at the earliest,” he said. When contacted, SCR authorities said route electrification works have been sanctioned for all the broad-gauge line sections, covering entire the Nanded division. “The works have commenced and are progressing at a fast pace. All the sections will be electrified by December 2023. Also, the section between Akola and Khandwa had a meter gauge. The whole section has been taken up under gauge conversion project and the section between Akola and Akot has been already converted to broad gauge,” Ch Rakesh, the chief public relations officer of SCR, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/scrs-nanded-division-at-bottom-in-terms-of-railway-infrastructure/articleshow/87143132.cms||Prasad Joshi

The woman said that when she went to her in-laws home soon after their wedding in May 2003, she saw her husband taking extra care of his niece, his sister’s daughter, who is now around 28. She said whenever they went out , her husband would take his niece along and bought her expensive gifts. For the past two or three years, whenever the complainant went to her parents’ place and returned, she would find the niece’s undergarments on her husband’s bed. She said that she even saw her changing her clothes in front of her husband during Navratri two years ago and when she asked her what she was doing, she told the complainant that she was showing her ghaghra-choli to her husband. The complainant said that her husband’s niece wore revealing clothes around her husband and made obscene gesture as well. She said that her husband even talked about his niece’s periods and whenever the complainant objected to their relationship, he used to beat her. In March 2020, her husband’s niece tried to sit in the lap of the complainant’s son. As the complainant’s son was uncomfortable with her, he left the room. When the complainant objected to such acts, her husband thrashed her and their son and drove them out of the house, the FIR states. She filed a complaint alleging domestic violence against her husband and five other members of his family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-in-relationship-with-niece-thrashes-wife/articleshow/87144191.cms||---

As per the new directives, if one teacher is absent, the rest in the team has to split the absentee’s workload too as the evaluations had to be completed as per the schedule. Teachers associations alleged that there is a high chance of making mistakes in the evaluation and tabulation works due to the workload of teachers. They also alleged that the answer keys of all subjects were drafted by junior teachers in such a way to liberalize the evaluation in favour of the students. “There are 80 centres for evaluation and there are 53 subjects in Plus One. The numbers of administrative officers, tabulation officers and clerks, who are essential for each camp, have been reduced in all centres in various proportions. Those who evaluate the papers will have to tabulate the marks, which needs high accuracy. Lack of enough staff and additional workload to officials might need lead to several mistakes and teachers will have to bear the blame in case of any complaints,” said Anil M George, state general secretary of departmental higher secondary school teachers’ association (HSSTA). S Manoj, state general secretary of aided higher secondary teachers association (AHSTA), said that the decision to start the evaluation before the completion of exams was wrong. Moreover, some centres were affected by floods and teachers might find it hard to reach there as heavy rains are forecast from Wednesday. “Teachers who are experts in respective subjects are not included in the scheme finalization teams of the Plus One exam. The answer keys were drafted by junior teachers selected by pro-government associations of teachers. The aim is to give marks liberally as directives are given to give full marks for certain questions even if the answers are incomplete. This will affect the quality of students,” Manoj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/teachers-worried-over-govts-decision-to-cut-staff/articleshow/87156130.cms||---

Now, Panchkula has 16 fogging machines. Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said the new machines were purchased in view of the rise in the number of dengue cases in the district and residents complaining of inadequate fogging in their areas. MC Commissioner Dharamvir Singh said that the thermal fogging machine could be easily carried by hand and was handy for fogging in colonies and inside houses in affected areas. “All machines can easily cover all the wards faster,” he said. Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal urged residents to make ensure there was no stagnant water near their homes to prevent mosquito breeding in their areas.

With this, Navi Mumbai has become the first city in MMR to have covered 100% of its eligible population with the first dose. Mumbai, which has a target of vaccinating 92.3 lakh beneficiaries, has covered 89.3 lakh beneficiaries with the first dose, which is 97% of the target, while it has fully vaccinated 56% of the eligible population. Over 52% of Navi Mumbai’s eligible population here have got the second dose as well. However, considering its floating population, the civic administration has still appealed to those who might have got left out to get themselves vaccinated at NMMC vaccination centres free of cost. The state has a target of vaccinating 9.14 crore and has completed 70% of the first dose coverage, while 31% eligible adults are fully vaccinated. With the ebbing of the second wave and the start of the festive season and the harvesting period in rural areas, the vaccination drive in the state is going on at a much slower pace than it normally does. “We plan to continue with Mission Kavach Kundal till Diwali and vaccinate as many beneficiaries as possible till then,” said health minister Rajesh Tope. “ The target was to vaccinate 11.07 lakh eligible population, and we have achieved it. We will now focus on giving the second dose. We appreciate the cooperation extended by people of this city due to which such a challenging task could be achieved,” said NMMC chief Abhijit Bangar. A total of 5.76 lakh have been given the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-nmmc-claims-100-covered-with-first-dose/articleshow/87145260.cms||---

Speaking to media persons after meeting the family members of Uthra of Veelasseril, Eram, Anchal, here at their house, he said the state government should honour Uhtra’s family’s opinion on the sentence. He pointed out that despite the Uthra case being one of the rarest of rare cases the court did not order capital punishment. Though the evidence gathering and conduct of the case by the prosecution were done in a flawless manner, the convict did not get the deserved punishment, he said. Sooraj, Uthra’s husband who used a snake to kill his wife, a differently-abled woman, received double life term in addition to 17 years of rigorous imprisonment in four cases charged against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-must-move-hc-for-capital-punishment-to-sooraj/articleshow/87144222.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Fatalities in the state that had stayed under 30 for the last few days, however, rose. In the city, the daily toll, which fell to zero on Sunday, was four for the second straight day. The state reported 1,638 cases, including 314 in the city, and 49 deaths on Tuesday, taking the total caseload to 65.9 lakh. The number of sealed buildings in the city dropped to 46 from 50-plus last week.

We have to keep a close watch on a weekly basis to see if the cases rise as socialisation increases,” said Kakani. Active cases in the state and city also reported a dip. There are 26,805 active cases in the state, of which 5,521 are in the city. Health minister Rajesh Tope said though there was a slight increase in cases reported from parts of Ahmednagar district, none of the samples showed any new variant of the coronavirus. “As long as there is no mutation reported from any part of the state, we are not worried about a slight increase in cases as the treatment protocol is set.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-daily-cases-stay-low-in-state-city-active-cases-too-drop/articleshow/87145273.cms||---

Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has received 1,485 building plan proposals so far since April this financial year, including 871 proposals in just the August-September period. The civic body’s town planning department has approved 784 building plans so far since April. Of them, 564 building plans were approved in the past two months. NMC has earned a revenue of Rs 116 crore through various town planning taxes during the first half of the current financial year (April-September). Of that, 50% of the revenue was generated in August and September, said the NMC officials. Earlier, the builders could not submit their building plans due to the pandemic, but they have now started submitting the plans,” said Umesh Wankhede, the chairperson of the real estate committee of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (Maccia). Wankhede, who is also a senior member of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai) in Nashik, further said that there has been a positive mood in the real estate sector after improvement in the Covid scenario and the festive season has only helped the cause. Builders have started planning new residential and commercial projects in the city. “No new projects were launched during the festive season last year due to the pandemic, but the scenario has changed this year. Around 50 small and large residential building projects have been launched during Navaratra,” said Wankhede. Jayesh Thakkar, a senior office-bearer of Naredco Nashik also reiterated the same. He said the market sentiments have become positive since the beginning of the festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/realty-biz-in-nashik-city-picks-up-567-building-plans-approved-in-aug-sept/articleshow/87143172.cms||Tushar Pawar

Eastern Railway installed a digital passenger reservation chart board at Howrah Station on Monday afternoon for passengers to get a clear view of their reservation status. A senior ER employee commissioned the e-chart board. The reservation chart board is a combination of eight 50-inch LED television sets. Passengers reservation status will be displayed on four of the television screens and advertisements on the other four. The entire display system will be maintained by an agency, which pays the railways for the advertisements displayed. “This will generate non-fare revenue of Rs 43.93 lakh per year as licence fee,” an ER spokesperson said. He said this digital system will be extended to other platforms gradually in phases. “Digital charting is an environment-friendly method to display passenger reservation chart as it will reduce consumption of paper and project the railways as an eco-friendly organization,” the spokesperson said. The railways has been consistently turning paperless over the years. “Now passengers can look up the digital reservation board instead of waiting for the manually prepared paper charts which are pasted on the trains just before the scheduled departure,” an ER official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-reservation-board-installed-at-howrah-stn/articleshow/87144213.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolhapur||Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader Raju Shetti seeks Rs 3,300/tonne of cane, MSP for sugar raised to Rs 37/kg||KOLHAPUR: Sugar cane farmers should get Rs 3,300 per tonne for the crushing season that started on October 15, said Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader Raju Shetti. Speaking at the annual congregation of sugar cane farmers at Jaysingpur in Kolhapur district, Shetti said the Centre should increase the minimum support price (MSP) for sugar to Rs 37 per kg and waive the goods and services tax on it for one year. “The sugar prices in international and domestic markets are soaring. We believe the sugar prices may touch Rs 39 per kg soon. Therefore, the farmers should be incentivized and they should get Rs 3,300 per tonne from the mills,” said Shetti. Most mills have started announcing the price they will pay to the farmers for the current season. However, the prices are in range of Rs 2,950 to Rs 3,100 per tonne. Shetti’s demand is more than the prices assured by the mills. “The farmers should get payments in two phases. They should first be paid the fair and remunerative price (FRP) fixed for the season, and the remaining amount should be paid by January 2022. If the mills fail to pay the remaining amount by January 2022, we will shut down operations of the mills in the midst of the crushing season,” warned Shetti. Shetti, who is also the president of the Swabhimani Paksha, which is part of MVA government, lashed out against it over “repeatedly failing the farmers”. He said the time has come to decide whether to continue the alliance with Congress and NCP, which are part of MVA government. “In 2019, the flood-affected farmers received Rs 950 per gunta as compensation. Now the MVA government has given Rs 150 per gunta. We held protest rallies. Some workers committed jal samadhi. I met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with swollen feet. Despite all our efforts, the CM did not respond to our demands. I was one of those who had backed Uddhav Thackeray as the CM. However, we have been let down and, therefore, the time has come to decide whether to continue or discontinue our alliance with the MVA,” said Shetti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shetti-seeks-rs-3300/tonne-of-cane-msp-for-sugar-raised-to-rs-37/kg/articleshow/87143179.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Shots given in October lowest since end of August in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The first two weeks of October recorded the lowest weekly vaccination count in Maharashtra since August-end despite better supply of vaccines and Mission Kavach Kundal launched to cover the maximum beneficiaries. CoWIN statistics show Maharashtra was administering over 50 lakh shots every week in September, peaking at 55 lakh between 18 and 24. It dropped to 36-43 lakh jabs each in the first two weeks of October. Health department officials believe two factors were at play: the festive season, including Navratri when many fast, and the long gap of 84 days between two Covishield doses. A senior official said Mission Kavach Kundal has been extended till November 2 and the citizens’ response to vaccination has increased after the festival. The health department plans to increase the pace of vaccination to an average 10-12 lakh jabs per day (meaning over 70 lakh shots a week) in the state till Diwali. “If at all a drop in vaccination turnout is witnessed during Diwali, which starts from November 4, these numbers will stand Maharashtra in good stead. We plan to conduct the maximum vaccinations before November 4 as the festival could coincide with many taking a break and heading out for small vacations,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-shots-given-in-oct-lowest-since-end-of-aug-in-state/articleshow/87145289.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Meeting today to resolve damaged sugar cane issue||KOLHAPUR: District collector Rahul Rekhawar has called a meeting on Thursday to resolve the issue of sugar cane crop damaged due to the floods in July this year. Crops worth crores of rupees, spread on more than 60,000 hectare, were damaged due to the floods. Sugar cane with damage of 33% or more is considered an affected crop. The sugar cane damaged due to floods is worth over Rs 1,000 crore. The recovery rate of sugar from such damaged crops is usually less and, therefore, the mills are reluctant to take them. Only a few mill owners in the district have assured that they will use the damaged sugar cane first to ensure that the flood-affected farmers get some money at the earliest. On Tuesday, several farmers, along with Hatkanangale MP Dhairyasheel Mane, met the Kolhapur district and raised the issue. Mane said, “The mills usually avoid such damaged crop since it affects their overall recovery performance. Also, the cutters demand a high amount from the farmers to cut and transport the crop to the mills. We have raised the issue with the collector and he has agreed to hold a meeting with the representatives of all stakeholders from mills, public representatives, and farmers’ outfits on Thursday.” The farmers have demanded that the mills should have a plan to cut the damaged sugar cane and provide it to the administration to ensure that the sugar cane is cut and crushed on time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/meeting-today-to-resolve-damaged-sugar-cane-issue/articleshow/87143193.cms||---
---||Nashik||NMC: 100m no-plastic radius around Godavari||Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), in order to reduce river pollution, has decided to declare the 100-metre radius from Godavari river as no plastic zone. It has also been decided to take action against those traders found involved in the sale-purchase of plastic bags below 150 microns.  In addition to this traders within 100 metre radius from the river Godavari will be fined if they are found selling plastic carry bags below 150 microns. The decision to this effect was taken during a meeting between civic officials and NGOs regarding river pollution. An NMC official said boards with message of ‘no plastic zone’ will be put up on the banks of Godavari river to make people aware of this rule. “A drive against single use plastic will be taken by the civic administration. The NMC has decided to form divisional-level squads at all six divisions of the civic body for the drive,” he said. “A fine of Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 each are to be imposed if traders are caught using banned plastic bags for the first and second time, respectively. However, a police case will be lodged if anyone is found involved using banned plastic for the third time,” he added. During the last six months (April-Sept) of the current financial year, the NMC administration has slapped fines worth Rs 2.55 lakh on 45 traders for violation of plastic ban norms. During the last financial year, the civic body had slapped fines worth Rs 9.50 lakh on 183 traders.Single use plastic has been banned by the state government since June 2018, but the plastic ban is not being implemented effectively. In December 2019, the NMC had conducted a drive for collection of single use plastic from households in the city and had collected around 900 quintal of banned plastic in one day. But no such drives were taken thereafter due to the outbreak of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-100m-no-plastic-radius-around-godavari/articleshow/87143221.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Delhi||Mind your speed on Delhi-Agra NH||NEW DELHI: Delhi-Agra stretch will be the first NH corridor in the country to have screens which will alert commuters, if they are driving beyond the permitted speed limit. The Vehicle Actuated Speed Display (VASD) will be installed at different locations that will capture and display the vehicle speed in real-time. This is part of the first major step by the National Highways Authority of India (NHA) to put in place the first Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) on any NH, which aims to make the corridor smooth and safe for traffic movement. The authority has floated a tender inviting the bids from potential players. The project stretch will be from the start point of 4.4 km long 6-lane Badarpur Elevated Highway to Agra. The ATMS software will also be capable of generating e-challan automatically and integrated with the Vahan database, NIC and FASTag for obtaining the vehicle registration and details required for e-challan and cross-verification of the vehicle class. According to the bid document, the stretch will get equipment and sensors that will collect information on road and traffic conditions, violations, incidents and weather conditions. The information fed in the system will get transferred to the traffic management centre for processing and action. The system primarily works with feed from CCTVs and will alert incidents to the police and emergency service providers for quick rescue at site. The 180 km stretch will get at least 285 cameras to enable seamless real-time monitoring of road, traffic and weather conditions and congestion. These will be used for monitoring accident prone areas, junctions, major median openings, structures, urban areas and major village junctions.. Officials in the NHAI said another component of the video incident detection system (VIDS) at 60 locations will automatically detect incidents, abnormal conditions, accidents, stopped vehicles, wrong direction driving, poor visibility and also vehicle details. These will be installed at black spots, accident-prone and other essential areas identified by the enforcement agencies. The information of incidents will be automatically fed into the system for quick action. Similarly, the vehicle speed detection system (VSDS) with automatic traffic counter and classifier and the travel time measurement system installed at two locations will detect the speeding vehicles and read their number plates automatically, and also to pass on the information of defaulters and errant drivers to the authorities concerned for enforcement and e-challan. Officials said this stretch has been selected for the first such project as it is one of the busiest NHs in the country and connects a major tourist destination. The stretch will also get at least 22 variable message sign display facilities to alert commuters about road and traffic conditions. In case of incidents such as congestion, the displayed information will help drivers in judging whether to take a detour or not, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mind-your-speed-on-delhi-agra-nh/articleshow/87145307.cms||Dipak K Dash

The campaign was held at over 400 sites and Prayagraj district recorded the highest turnout of recipients across the state. Prayagraj was followed by Lucknow, Sitapur, Gorakhpur and Shahjahanpur in terms of vaccines given to recipients on Monday, health department officials said. Out of 70,706 jabs, as many as 46,462 recipients of all age groups were administered the first dose while 24,244 recipients were given the second dose. With this, a total of 32,45,674 beneficiaries of all age groups including 25,24,268 of the first dose and 7,21,406 of the second dose were covered. Out of 32,45,674 recipients, 17,50,066 males, 14,94,127 females and 1,481 transgender people have been covered. Pointedly, the department had set a target to administer jabs to 1.62 lakh recipients of all age groups but has achieved 43% target only on Monday. Officials of the health department claimed that over 72% of target recipients in the district were given jabs so far as it has set a target to administer jabs to 45.16 lakh recipients in the Prayagraj district. District immunization officer and additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI that the department aimed to cover the maximum number of recipients in a single day mega-campaign and was successful in its endeavour. “All the health staff have been congratulated for their hard work and unrelenting spirit which helped the department to achieve the target. The department had set a target to administer 1.62 lakh jabs on Monday during the mega vaccination campaign and managed to cover 70,706 recipients,” he added. He, however, maintained that over 56% recipients were given at least a single dose till now, while 16% of the target recipients were fully vaccinated. Figures also indicated that as many as 5,05,78 jabs were given to eligible recipients, including 2,40, 161 males and 2,64,784 female recipients in the past 18 days of the October month alone. Right at the launch of the vaccination drive against Covid-19 in Prayagraj district, a total of 11,504 doses were given to frontline workers in January while the total number of doses given to recipients, including frontline workers was 51,575 in February month. In March, the number of jabs rose to1,17,625 and the figure went up to1,86,853 in April. The number of doses administered crossed the two lakh mark in May when a total of 2,21,808 doses were given to recipients of all age groups. The tally rose to 2,74,860 and then 3,52,925 in June and July, respectively. The pace of vaccination gained momentum in the second week of August, and a total of 5,84,496 jabs were given in August alone. However, September broke all previous records, and the 9,39,300 of vaccine shots given in September month equalled the total number of jabs given in July and August together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/sangam-city-witnesses-highest-single-day-vaccination-in-state/articleshow/87145323.cms||---

This is 25% short of pre-Covid time collective ridership of 80 lakh. Statistics released on Tuesday showed that CR ridership touched a new high of 32.5 lakh on Monday, which is 27% short of pre-Covid time (45 lakh). WR ridership was 27.6 lakh on Monday, which is 21% less than pre-Covid time (35 lakh). Commuters on suburban trains are likely to increase with colleges reopening and more offices telling employees to report for duty with staggered timings, sources said. Statistics showed that on CR, 15.4 lakh new monthly passes were issued to the general public since mid-August, when train services resumed for common passengers with double vaccination. On WR, 6.8 lakh new monthly passes were issued between mid-August and October 18, said chief spokesperson Sumit Thakur. He said the total AC passes sold in two months were 3,913, and this was a good sign of people wanting to travel in AC trains during Covid. Travelling by AC aggregator cabs like Ola and Uber costs Rs400-700 one way and a return journey would be more expensive than the price of an AC monthly pass, with which you can travel unlimited throughout the month. Over 2 lakh opted for first class passes, which showed that many prefer local trains to private cars and AC cabs. Most were those who travelled in second class, and this is likely to increase gradually as more offices reopen. The statistics showed that Borivli station on WR sold maximum monthly passes to the general public (75,000), includeing 992 passes for AC trains. Dombivli station on CR had issued over 50,000 passes, sources said. Subhash Gupta from Rail Yatri Parishad demanded that Railways sell single-day journey tickets to fully vaccinated passengers, which will see a rise in ridership and increase in revenue collection. Sutar said they have been strictly following the Maharashtra government’s guidelines, which issued instructions to issue only monthly season tickets to fully vaccinated commuters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cr-wr-ridership-crosses-record-60l-25-short-of-pre-covid-times/articleshow/87145302.cms||Somit Sen

---||Mumbai||Mumbai colleges reopen today with small batches, Covid vigilance groups||MUMBAI: After a gap of 19 months, city colleges are prepping to reopen campuses on Wednesday. With many students still unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and semester-end exams underway for second- and third-year under-graduates, though, colleges expect to start classes with smaller batches of post-graduate students. Some colleges have even formed Covid vigilance committees to oversee compliance to pandemic protocols. Colleges said the abrupt decision to reopen days before the Diwali vacation may result in poor attendance. On the other hand, it would give them a headstart to prepare for post-festival increase in attendance. Outstation students are likely to join after Diwali, they say. Thadomal Shahani Engineering College plans to conduct viva and practical exams for third- and fourth-year students offline. “We are calling only our second-year students for hybrid classes from Wednesday. Many of our outstation candidates are likely to join after Diwali. In one of the courses, of the 60 students, 43 said they are fully vaccinated, so we are hoping for better attendance,” said principal G T Thampi. Classes will be initially for a shorter duration, he said. Ramnarain Ruia College has formed a Covid vigilance committee to keep a check on compliance. Principal Anushree Lokur said they will first call post-graduate students for practicals, as most UG students are in the midst of their online exams. “Once a proper timetable is scheduled for first-year UG students, we will call them for a few days next week.” Only about 16% of FYBSc students are fully vaccinated and have given their consent at D G Ruparel College, said Vidya Patil, a teacher, adding many of their students are not even in Mumbai. She said the majority of students are attending online and therefore their focus will be on e-classes. “We will continue to teach using our laptops, and the same will be displayed for students in the classroom using projectors,” said Patil. The college has come up with a practicals schedule. St Xavier’s College will conduct offline lectures and simultaneously broadcast those sessions from Wednesday. The ‘in-college’ lectures will continue to be made available in the recorded form, stated a circular issued by the college. It specified the arrangement would continue till the university makes attendance mandatory for all. Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, said they would call their SY and TY students for a few days after exams, to get them accustomed to the hybrid model. Permanent staff members though will be called to conduct lectures for 50% of the vaccinated FY students from Wednesday. Mithibai College will start with practicals for PG, said principal Krutika Desai. Rajesh Gehani, secretary of Vivekanand Education Society, said they would start hybrid classes. While the university has recommended having a medical practitioner on campus, most colleges say it is not feasible and they are tying up with clinics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-colleges-reopen-today-with-small-batches-covid-vigilance-groups/articleshow/87145325.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Kozhikode||Serious fire safety violations in SM Street: Probe report||Kozhikode: The police special branch has submitted a report to the district police chief pointing out multiple safety violations and unauthorized constructions at the city’s main commercial hub of SM Street, which if not addressed, could lead to major fire disasters. The special branch had conducted an inquiry following recurring fire incidents at SM Street, including the latest incident of a fire gutting a footwear godown at MP Road on September 10. Police have found that many shops are operating by blocking even corridors inside the buildings and large amount of waste materials, including inflammable materials, were being dumped in vacant places inside the buildings. Also, the report said that many shop owners have stocked materials four to five times more than the capacity in the shops. It was found during inspections that goods were even stored in racks above the electricity metres and switches. The report also pointed out that goods are stored even on top of the buildings under tarpaulin sheets. Also, it was found that many buildings had unauthorized constructions and have made deviations from approved plans. Another safety risk cited is that many are engaging in cooking even inside small rooms using gas cylinders. It has recommended that the food outlets functioning in the area should adopt the practice of shifting cooking of food elsewhere. The report prepared by special branch assistant commissioner A Umesh was handed over to district police chief A V George. It will be presented to district collector N Tej Lohit Reddy and Kozhikode corporation authorities soon. The fire safety audit conducted by the fire and rescue services department recently had found serious safety lapses which could exacerbate fire risk in the main commercial hub of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/serious-fire-safety-violations-in-sm-street-probe-report/articleshow/87144262.cms||---

The suspect was identified as Sandeep Lalewar (27) of Madhuban Colony, Makhmalabad. He approached an elderly woman at her residence in Rajpal Colony requesting her to give him a glass of water. Keeping the 77-year-old woman engaged in talks, the criminal snatched her gold chain of 25g and fled. The woman later registered a complaint with the Panchavati police. As the Crime Branch came to know about the incident, senior officials visited the spot to gather information. One person gave them a description of the chain snatcher. Based on a tip off, the police found out that a person with a similar description resides in Madhuban Colony under the Panchavati police station. The police then laid a trap in the Madhuban Colony and spotted the suspect there. The suspect tried escaping when he police personnel charge towards him, but was arrested. Upon questioning, he confessed to have committed the crime and handed over a broken gold chain of 19g worth Rs 68,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-nab-man-within-4-hours-of-chain-snatching/articleshow/87143258.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Away from the limelight, these cops have hands full ferrying undertrials||NEW DELHI: Constable Suresh of Delhi Police’s 3rd Battalion wakes up every day around 4.30am. Around 6am, the 31-year-old reports to the Vikaspuri police line and, after a briefing by a senior officer, leaves for his duty which is to ferry prisoners to courts or hospitals and, at times, to other states. It is not an easy assignment. When Covid-19 was at its peak, he had to wear protective suits to avoid infection. At all times, he and his colleagues are at risk of being attacked. What Suresh and others of the 3rd Battalion are up against was proved last month when jailed gangster Jitender Gogi, escorted to the Rohini district courts, was gunned down by two men in a courtroom. The personnel of the 3rd Battalion and Special Cells shot the assailants dead, but they had achieved their objective. According to data accessed by TOI, in 2021 up to September, Suresh and his fellow policemen escorted 41,652 under-trial prisoners to different courts, 5,475 criminals out of Delhi and 16,721 to city hospitals. In the last two and half years, Suresh has accompanied more than 300 such prisoners to various destinations and back. From 5am, Suresh usually works through the day before peeling off his uniform around 7pm. Before leaving the prison and returning to their cells, the inmates are frisked by the 3rd Battalion men. "We recover many prohibited items. Much of it is tobacco, but we have discovered blades and other dangerous objects,” an officer said. An outstation trip has its own dangers. “We mostly travel by train,” said Suresh. “Sometimes, the policemen aren’t allotted neighbouring seats. At such times, we request the ticket collector and the passengers to shift to allow all police personnel to sit together and thus reduce the risk of misadventure by the prisoner.” According to policemen, criminals badger and abuse them all the while during a trip, long or short. Constable Brijendra, a Rajasthan native, added that it sometimes takes over 48 hours to reach their destination. It is a tension-filled journey for them. “At night, we sleep in shifts. If there are six policemen, then two of them rest at one time,” he revealed. “When the criminal being escorted wants to go to the toilet, we accompany him to the latrine only when the train is moving.” The threat increases when it involves high-risk prisoners, particularly because the escorts often don’t have identikits of possible attackers. “The only thing we can do is to take extra precautions,” said an officer. Another officer added, “In the hospitals, we have to keep a continuous watch on the criminals and closely follow them whichever ward they go for treatment.” It also proved harrowing working at the peak of the pandemic last year, when 54,678 jail inmates had to be taken to courts, 19,835 to hospitals and 7,249 to courts outside Delhi. In two years, more than 300 policemen tested positive for the coronavirus. Hareesh HP, DCP, 3rd Battalion, said his men were sensitised to be swift and professional in responding to an attack on an escort party or a prisoner. A calibrated and well-coordinated response from his men prevents civilian lives from being lost in the skirmish, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/away-from-the-limelight-these-cops-have-hands-full-ferrying-undertrials/articleshow/87145358.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Kolhapur||Covid-19: 100 per cent 45+ residents of 67 villages in Kolhapur fully vaccinated||KOLHAPUR: As many as 67 villages from Kolhapur district have got 100% of their residents above the age of 45 are fully vaccinated. Also, 33 of these villages are from Chandgad taluka which is a hilly area and sparsely populated. Authorities claimed it as an achievement of the on-ground health staff as they were initially worried about the turnout of the people living in hamlets in far flung hilly areas. Followed by Chandgad taluka, Karveer, which is half urban and half rural, has 13 villages where 100% residents above 45 years have been fully vaccinated. Yogesh Sale, district health officer, said, “We have always remained among the few districts with highest turnout for Covid vaccination since the start. More number of vaccination centres in rural areas has helped in achieving the 100% vaccination among 45+ age category. We expect the number of villages with 100% vaccination of similar age group beneficiaries going to increase as we already have 60% of population from this age group getting both the doses.” Out of the 12 tehsils, five — Gadhinglaj, Kagal, Panhala, Shahuwadi and Shirol — do not have a single village where all beneficiaries belonging to the 45+ year age residents are fully vaccinated. In case of 18 to 44 years age group, no village from the entire district is fully vaccinated. “Vaccination for this age group started late and the number of people from this age group with their second dose due is much less than other age groups. As many as 58 villages from the district have 100% residents from this age group vaccinated for first dose. Among these as well, 32 villages are from Chandgad tehsil followed by Gaganbawda (13 villages),” Sale said. The district has a total of 34.77 lakh beneficiaries out of which 24.71 lakh have received the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/100-45-residents-of-67-villages-in-kolhapur-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/87143252.cms||---

Dismissing the plea filed by Bharanikumar of Thanjavur district seeking a government job under the ex-servicemen category, justice S S Sundar imposed a cost of Rs 1,000 on him payable to the district legal services committee.The petitioner who had studied up to Class IX, had registered his name in the employment office in 1990, under the ex-servicemen quota as his father was an ex-serviceman.Justice Sundar observed that the petitioner himself admitted that he had filed earlier petitions seeking for the same relief in 2009 and 2014. The petitioner’s first petition was disposed of based on a letter issued by the government in response to the representation submitted by the petitioner. His second petition for the same relief was dismissed by this court.The judge observed that since no suitable job was given to the petitioner under the ex-servicemen category, he had filed this present petition in 2021. Probably, the petitioner will not be satisfied, till he gets employment by getting orders one after another.“After the second petition was dismissed on merits, the petitioner is not supposed to file another writ petition for the same relief, as the principle of ‘res judicata’ is held applicable in writ proceedings. The petitioner appears to be a ‘court bird’ having a tendency to approach this court, whenever he feels like. The petitioner has been either misled or on his own approached this court with identical prayers to file three writ petitions successively,” observed the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-refers-to-man-as-court-bird-imposes-cost-for-repeated-pleas/articleshow/87144264.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Sawant wrote to the Congress high command, saying, under such circumstances, it will not be possible for him to work as the spokesperson. Sawant feels that he has been associated with the Congress for well over three decades and since 2010, he is working as the spokesperson and suddenly, now he has been superseded by a new entrant, Londhe. During the Devendra Fadnavis rule, Sawant was instrumental in exposing the BJP-led government on several occasions. Patole on Tuesday allocated work to newly appointed office bearers. While Londhe has been appointed as chief spokesperson, he will be assisted by Sawant and Zakir Ahmed. Amravati-based Sunil Deshmukh has been given the responsibility of frontal organizations. Prior to this, Londhe was in the NCP for a few years and joined the Congress in November 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-congress-gen-secy-quits-over-new-mpcc-appointment/articleshow/87146130.cms||---

This decision has shocked Chhagan Bhujbal who heads the Maharashtra civil supplies ministry. Bhujbal, who is in Vidarbha at present, told TOI that he will talk with the official in this matter and seek details. Akola RDC Sanjay Khadse said the directives were issued internally to the officials in order to increase vaccination in the district, which is presently in bottom five districts of Maharashtra. “We are not going to stop anyone’s ration but we want people to come forward and get vaccinated,” he said. According to officials, ration shops will monitor the festive rush after October 30 as Diwali festivities are round the corner. In Akola, less than 50% population has received at least a single dose of vaccination. The festive rush at fair price shops is likely to spread infection. As a result, the district administration has made the announcement about ‘no vaccine, no ration’ formula. “We have at least 11 days in hand. We have enough vaccines available. The only motive is to encourage more number of people to get jabbed. Hopefully, this order will inspire many people to get vaccinated,” said Khadse. However, as the news regarding this order spread across the region, it invited different types of reactions from the administration as well as from the political front. Bhujbal, who was in Chandrapur on Tuesday, expressed shock over the Akola collector’s decision. Bhujbal claimed that the government has openly helped deprived people through fair price shops during the pandemic. “It is wrong to stall supplies to the needy and pressurize them to take vaccine,” he said. According to Bhujbal, officials should take a focused approach and motivate people towards taking vaccine, but should not stop their ration ahead of festivities. “There could be other means to prompt people for vaccination,” he said. A senior official told TOI that initiatives like making vaccines must for all 18+ students before entering colleges and to all those who visit banks are also on cards in Akola. The purpose is to increase vaccination before October 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/akola-collector-for-no-vaccine-no-ration-bhujbal-expresses-shock/articleshow/87144297.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Allahabad||Juna Akhara to launch drive for conservation of Yamuna||Prayagraj: Although much is being done in the country to conserve the sacred river Ganga, the seers of Shri Panchdasnaam Juna Akhada, one of the 13 ancient recognised Hindu monastic orders of the country, have now decided to undertake efforts to conserve river Yamuna too. With this aim, support of seers of the Akhara in Prayagraj as well as other towns and villages of the state would be roped in. For this purpose, the monastic order has decided to organise ‘Kalindi Utsav’ under which wide-spread riverbank cleaning exercises and conservation awareness events would be launched between Karela Bagh and Bade Hanuman temple in Prayagraj on November 14. “The effort would be gradually scaled up to a state-level mission,” said Mahant Hari Giri, general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP) and chief patron of Juna Akhada. “Yamuna is also a sacred river in Hinduism. The river is worshipped as a Hindu goddess called Yamuna, also known as Yami in early texts, while in later religious literature she has been called Kalindi. In Hindu scriptures, she is daughter of Surya, the sun god and Sanjna, the cloud goddess,” the senior saint said. “Aimed at attracting the attention of the people as well as the governments towards the need of undertaking Yamuna-specific initiatives to conserve the river, demand of constructing public toilets on the river banks would also be raised,” said Mahant Hari Giri. “We want basic amenities to be developed first to conserve the Yamuna, followed by the people residing on its bank being sensitised about the need to conserve the river and its importance among millions of Hindus. The next step possibly could be strict measures by levying fines, etc., on people polluting the river and its banks by dumping waste, garbage and releasing untreated sewage into it,” he said. The Juna Akhada, the largest of all 13 monastic orders in terms of count of seers as well as maximum number of Naga ascetics, would also undertake massive tree plantation drives along the banks of the Yamuna as part of this mission. “We will involve locals residing on the riverbank as well as volunteers for looking after the planted trees. Our saints and seers across the state will use their sermons and discourses to spread the message,” he explained. Deepdaan events on the Yamuna banks during the sacred Kartik month as per the Hindu calendar, from October 21 to November 19, would also be organised during cleaning of the ghats and the banks as part of this mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/juna-akhara-to-launch-drive-for-conservation-of-yamuna/articleshow/87145354.cms||---

The court also said that since the punishment was set aside, the petitioner should be notionally reinstated and all his monetary benefits should be restored by the authorities.The court was hearing the petition filed by M Chelliah. The petitioner was working as a sub-registrar at Palayamkottai in Tirunelveli district. During a surprise inspection by the vigilance and anti-corruption department in 2005, the petitioner had unaccounted cash of Rs 83,000 in his bag. The second charge against the petitioner was that he was constructing a building without obtaining proper permission.A charge memo was issued to him in 2007 and disciplinary proceedings were initiated. Since the charges against him were proved after the inquiry, a punishment of removal from service was imposed. When the petitioner filed an appeal, the same was dismissed in 2010. Challenging the same, the petitioner filed the present petition before the HC Madurai bench in 2014.The petitioner’s counsel submitted that Chelliah and his wife were government servants. The petitioner came to the office with cash as he wanted to purchase jewellery for his wife. He further submitted that the petitioner had obtained prior permission for construction of the building.However, the government advocate submitted that a circular was issued in 2009, pertaining to cash handling, taking into account the inspection conducted at various sub-registrar offices.Justice S S Sundar observed that it is clear from the circular that people like the petitioner are not supposed to bring cash while coming to office. Even in extreme cases, where such employees have to bring money to the office, the money should be handed over to the concerned authority.The judge observed that no such circular was issued when the inspection was conducted in 2005. It is not known as to how the petitioner could be proceeded for alleged misconduct in the absence of any such circular. Hence, the judge disposed of the petition by setting aside the order of removal from service imposed on the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-relief-for-govt-employee-sets-aside-dismissal-order/articleshow/87144298.cms||---

Breadnut does not have any mention in the flora directory records of Maharashtra. The fruit from this tree is similar to jackfruit. The trees have been found in Powar Nagar, Morewadi and Laxmipuri areas of the city. “The seeds were planted in the city around seven years ago. Now, these trees have got fruits. People started complaining about the higher number of seeds and sharp spikes. We studied these fruits and after detailed research, we came to know they are breadnut trees that look like breadfruit tree (Neer Phanas in Marathi). The breadnut fruit has seeds inside, which is not the case with breadfruit. This tree grows six to eight metre in height and belongs to the Moraceae family which is scientifically known as Artocarpus camansi,” he said. This forest plant species is found in few countries in Africa and Asia, but there were no records of breadnut tree in India. “Anil Chougule from Nisarg Mitra NGO and Dr Mandar Aitawde helped us in finding this species for the first time in India and soon it will be scientifically recorded,” Bachulkar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/breadnut-tree-a-native-of-philippines-recorded-for-the-first-time-in-kolhapur/articleshow/87143280.cms||---

---||Thane||Thane: Flamingo park’s eco sensitive boundary shrinks to max 4km||MUMBAI: The eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS) has been formally reduced from the deemed 10km to 0km at some places to a maximum of 3.9km at others. The Centre recently issued a gazette defining the ESZ boundary as also the area around the sanctuary which will now be 48 square km. The ESZ will extend to the limit of mangroves on the western side of the sanctuary and the entire width of Thane Creek and adjoining Navi Mumbai mangrove area on the east. On the southern side, the boundary borders Sion-Panvel Highway and further south is the commercial part of Thane Creek “which does not add any value to the sanctuary,” states the gazette issued on October 14. On the northern side, the ESZ is limited to 2.2km and includes the northern part of the Thane Creek and mangrove patches on government land. Virendra Tiwari, chief conservator, Mangrove Conservation Cell, said the change in the ESZ boundary does not impact the bullet train project in any way as it does not require environmental clearance. The gazette mandates the state government prepare the zonal management plan within two years of the publication of the notification. The final notification now clears the way for not just the real estate industry but the clearing of the 11 holding ponds of Navi Mumbai that were created to prevent the city from flooding, say environmentalists. Neglect over the years, they allege, resulted in ingress of seawater, resulting in the ponds being choked with mangroves. There is now a petition pending before Bombay high court for clearing the ponds. Tiwari said the clearing, which is a regulated activity as per the gazette notification, can be done only with court approval. For the real estate industry, the notification would expedite obtaining development permissions in 15 civic wards from Chembur, Kurla, Bhandup, Mulund, Ghatkopar East to Kandivli, Borivli, Dahisar, Andheri East and Bandra East. Even areas in Dadar, Matunga and Parel which were impacted will be easier to construct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-flamingo-parks-eco-sensitive-boundary-shrinks-to-max-4km/articleshow/87145364.cms||Clara Lewis

The minister made a surprise visit to the archaeological site on Tuesday and climbed down into a 7ft deep quadrant to inspect the artefacts found in various levels of the soil structure. He was accompanied by commissioner for archaeology R Sivanantham. Excavation has been completed in seven phases in Keeladi and carried been out twice in the cluster villages of Konthagai, Manalur and Agaram. This is the first time that the Tamil Nadu State Archaeology Department has left the quadrants open without filling it with soil after the excavation ended as it plans to establish an open site museum here. The minister told reporters that the visitors would see the artefacts in their natural surroundings when the museum is established and that it would be a first-of-its-kind in Tamil Nadu. He said that the department would seek the help of IIT-Madras to protect and preserve the brick structures in the quadrants. Thennarsu added that the image of a fish imprinted on a ring well discovered in the seventh phase and engraved coins found here strengthened the theory that the people who lived here had commercial transactions with other parts of the country, namely north India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-decision-yet-on-eighth-phase-excavation-at-keeladi-says-min/articleshow/87144309.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Fake notes: Gujarat HC questions NIA’s witness surge||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has questioned the National Investigation Agency (NIA) why it intends to examine 41 more witnesses in a trial already underway in connection with the printing of fake currency after the 2016 demonetization. A couple of months ago, the HC had advised the NIA and the special court not to insist on examining unnecessary witnesses, to focus on quality evidence, and to try not to prolong the trial. The high court questioned the NIA after an accused person challenged a special court’s order of September 30 permitting the prosecuting agency to examine 41 witnesses. Accused Ketan Dave’s counsel Zubin Bharda submitted that the prosecution changed the list of its witnesses on five occasions. The lawyer questioned the trial court’s permission granted under the provisions of Section 311 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) to the NIA to examine 41 more witnesses. The first list contained 70 witnesses. Twenty-one of them have been examined. Later, the list went up to 147 witnesses, the lawyer submitted. After the preliminary hearing on Monday, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Niral Mehta made an observation. “It is by now a settled position of law that the power to summon any person as a witness…,” the bench said, “…or asking him to attend the court or recall or re-examine him under Section 311 of the CrPC must be exercised judiciously and with caution and valid reasons.” The court went on to question, “We would like to know from the prosecuting agency in what manner all the witnesses named in exhibit-152 [NIA’s application before the trial court] is essential to the just decision in this case.” The HC has sought an answer from the prosecuting agency by next week. Earlier, in response to a bail application filed by a co-accused in this case, Shaileshbhai Barvadiya, the HC had observed that the prosecution should insist on quality evidence and not on quantity. The court said the prosecution should refrain from unnecessarily examining a large number of witnesses, which causes a delay in trial and looks bad on part of the judiciary. That is against the interest of the accused and the victims too, the court said. The high court had also requested the chief justice to appoint two more special judges to look after seven NIA cases. At present, the principal sessions judge is a designated NIA judge and she is busy with other cases as well as with administrative responsibilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fake-notes-hc-questions-nias-witness-surge/articleshow/87144380.cms||---

Now, owners of unauthorized layouts and plots will have to shell out Rs168 per sq ft as against existing Rs56 per sq ft.The state’s urban development department issued the notification on Monday increasing the charges.Officials of Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) said development charges for regularization of unauthorized layouts and plots have been Rs56 per sq ft since August 2014.In the latest notification, the government said charges for regularization will be three times existing development charges. “No charges are required to be recovered from unauthorized plots in case charges have already been recovered during regularization of entire layout,” the government said.The government introduced the Gunthewari Act in 2001. Development charges were fixed at Rs16 per sq ft on May 18, 2001. The government appointed NIT as planning and execution authority under the Gunthewari Act for the city. NIT has been recovering charges and spending the fund on infrastructure development works in the regularized areas.In August 2013, the government hiked charges to Rs112 per sq ft on the demand of NIT. After uproar from people and public representatives, the government retracted the decision. In August 2014, the charges were increased to Rs56 per sq ft. Since then, the charges have remained unchanged.Earlier, NIT used to regularize unauthorized layouts and plots that had come up on or before January 1, 2001. On March 12, the government had also allowed regularization of unauthorized layouts and plots that came up on or before January 1. NIT is yet to start the process and likely to commence inviting applications from December.Guardian minister Nitin Raut could not be contacted for his statement.BJP MLA from East Nagpur Krishna Khopde condemned the decision and warned of an agitation. “It is nothing less than a black notification. If the Thackeray government has to fill its coffers, there are other ways. Government should hike charges for big industrialists. Gunthewari plots are of poor people. Therefore, we are not going to allow the government to implement this,” he said.The civic agency has regularized over 4,000 unauthorized layouts comprising of hundreds of plots till now. Over 2,000 applications are pending for last many years due to one or the other hurdle. Now, revised charges will also be applicable to pending cases.Activist Vijay Kumar Shinde said, “City areas, specially hose on outskirts, had almost turned into concrete jungle due to regularization of unauthorized layouts and plots under the Gunthewari Act. The Supreme Court had imposed ban on regularization of unauthorized structures. We are witnessing fire mishaps and collapse of buildings across the country due to violation of building by-laws. Therefore, regularization should not be done. It is very clear from the latest notification that the government is trying to earn by encouraging violations. Few people, developers and builders will continue to violate norms assuming the government will continue to extend Gunthewari Act. It will turn entire city into concrete jungle.”In the same notification, the government has fixed premium of 10% of ready reckoner (RR) value for regularization of structures above permissible floor space index (FSI). Earlier, regularization was allowed only up to permissible FSI.Also, government has fixed same charges for regularization of structures in marginal spaces, which was allowed earlier too.-------------------------------------------------IAN* State introduced Gunthewari Act to regularize unauthorized layouts and plots in 2001* Regularization charges were Rs16 per sq ft* Charges increased to Rs112 in 2003, but govt withdrew in face of strong opposition* Charges hiked to Rs56 per sq ft in 2004* Now government increased charges three times* Premium of 10% of RR for regularization of structures above permissible FSI* Premium of 10% of RR also fixed for regularization of structures in marginal spaces||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-hikes-gunthewari-charges-by-three-times-fixes-premium-for-excess-built-up/articleshow/87144303.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Mumbai||Gangster Suresh Pujari arrested in Philippines||MUMBAI: The lesser known fugitive gangster Suresh Pujari, who had created havoc in Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan, Ulhasnagar, Dombivli and Karnataka in the absence of major gangs till few years back with threat calls and extortion activities, was arrested in Philippines three days back. Several businessmen, hoteliers, wine shop-owners and cable operators heaved a sigh of relief. Pujari, a footsoldier of Ravi Pujari, who was deported two years ago from Senegal, was arrested on an Interpol notice by the Philippines fugitive cell on October 15. Sources said the Philippine authorities and Interpol alerted the ministry of external affairs (MEA) about his arrest. “There is no official communications from the Indian authorities, but sources from other channels confirmed his arrest,” they said. A senior Mumbai police official confirmed the arrest. Initially it was believed he was held up in Africa, Australia or Malaysia, but he came under Interpol’s radar after he spoke to aides in Mumbai a year back. Police said he initially fled to Dubai and then moved to Australia and Malaysia. There is no information on when and how he ended up in Philippines. The intelligence agency had shared information with Interpol through CBI. Thane and Mumbai police had issued a red corner notice against him in 2017 and 2018 respectively after there was a rise in extortion activities. Thane police are dusting out old files and compiling a fresh dossier to send to MEA. In 2015, his men shot dead cable operator Sachanand Karira in Ulhasnagar after he failed to pay up Rs 5 crore. A police official said Pujari hails from Malpe in Karnataka and had come to Mumbai when 15 or 16 to work in a hotel. There are no records where he worked in Mumbai, till he was arrested in a petty case and was jailed. He came in contact with members of Ravi Pujari there. After his release he started a gambling club in Ulhasnagar. “His name was first heard in 2002, when Ravi Pujari orchestrated an attack on advocate Majeed Memon. He was arrested and booked under the stringent MCOCA. He was a great fan of his mentor and wanted to follow his footsteps. In late 2000, when calls from the underworld would send shivers, he impersonated Ravi and threatened a businessman in Mangalore. Later, due to differences over extortion money, he formed his own gang,” said a source. He had once threatened NCP minister Jitendra Awhad and Omie Kalani, son of Ulhasnagar strongman Pappu Kalani. During a phone call, Omie had threatened and insulted him over a phone conversation that had gone viral on social media. Ashok Morale, additional commissioner of police, Thane crime branch, said, “Once Pujari is brought here, we will demand his custody to investigate his role in 21 cases.” (Inputs by Pradeep Gupta)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-gangster-suresh-pujari-arrested-in-philippines/articleshow/87145373.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Madurai||Madurai corporation to intensify tax collection||MADURAI: With more than Rs 300 crore pending in various taxes, the Madurai Corporation has decided to intensify tax collection in the coming days. Taxes collected by the corporations include property, SUC (for sewage maintenance), vacant land, water, professional etc. The annual income to the civic body through taxes is estimated to be about Rs 201 crore, of which property tax amounts to a large portion of about Rs 97 crore. But, now it is estimated that the pending dues in taxes to the civic body amounts to about Rs 379 crore from April 2020 till date in 2021. The pending dues are estimated to be Rs 22.49 crore this financial year alone. Hence, the corporation has decided to identify the evaders and make them pay their taxes on time. Special camps conducted for tax collection last year received a lukewarm response as the corporation was able to collect nearly 56% of its pending dues in taxes. Now, the assistant commissioners of the four zones of the civic body have been asked to intensify collection and the employees have been given training on the same. Sources said that this year too the civic body would conduct special camps to intensify the collections. But, the problem the civic body faces if from people and establishments whose dues are pending for many decades and who have never come forward to pay. Covid added to the woes with even regular tax payers not paying up in time. There are more than 3.26 lakh houses and commercial buildings in the corporation limits of which 1,427 government and 1,617 commercial building including educational institutions are in litigation. Vacant land tax could be a source of good income if identified and taxed properly, said a former employee of the corporation. Corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan said that they were training and using the existing staff to collect taxes. “The problems that the civic body is facing in terms of collecting taxes, was manifold. We are sorting them out one by one,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corporation-to-intensify-tax-collection/articleshow/87144305.cms||---

While mining areas witnessed increasing dust pollution due to transportation, rivers, lakes and beaches saw the presence of faecal coliform. The board said that pollution levels crossed the ‘red mark’ not only in the state’s mining belt, but also in the capital, Panaji, and rural areas in Kundaim. The GSPCB annual report for 2020-21 said that “PM10 (annual average) is within permissible limits at all locations except Panaji, Bicholim, Honda, Usgao, Codli, Tilamol, Cuncolim and Kundaim. PM2.5 is within permissible limits at all locations.” A senior official said that PM10 is attributed to dust pollution, including construction activities, while PM2.5 is attributed to vehicular pollution. The field observations around the monitoring sites indicate the prominence of anthropogenic activities like vehicular movement, construction activities and industrial emissions, the report said. The board also said that parameters like ozone, lead, and carbon monoxide have been monitored at 14 outsourced locations, and were found to be within prescribed limits The GSPCB monitors air and water quality under central pollution control board (CPCB)-sponsored projects such as the national air monitoring programme (NAMP) and national water monitoring programme (NWMP). NAMP project covers 18 ambient air quality monitoring locations while NWMP covers 63 locations in Goa. Besides the 18 NAMP locations, the board monitors an additional location, the fire station at MPT (discontinued as an NAMP station since September 2019). Of these 19 locations, 14 are outsourced to a laboratory recognised by the Union ministry for environment, forest and climate change, and five are operated by the board. “From the water quality data analysis, it is seen that in general and on an annual basis, all parameters at a majority of locations which are monitored on a monthly basis are within the prescribed limits, except microbial pollution...” Furthermore, low pH was observed at the Kundaim, Corlim, Verna, Bethora, and Madkai industrial estates’ borewell water samples, which are collected and analysed on a biannual basis, the board said. The board reported faecal coliform exceeding permissible limits at many locations including the Mandovi, Zuari, Tiracol, Sal, Mapusa, Chapora and Tiracol rivers. It said this may be attributed to the release of untreated or partially-treated effluents along the water course. It also said that the coastal waters off several popular tourist hotspots including the Calangute, Miramar, Vagator, Colva, Morjim, Baina and Tiracol beaches have total coliform that exceeds permissible limits. The GSPCB also said that some lakes like Saipem, Curtorim have dissolved oxygen below permissible limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parts-of-goa-grappling-with-pollution-gspcb/articleshow/87145376.cms||Murari Shetye

In a letter to Chahal, BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said that 30 trucks are already running in Byculla and are distributed by Shiv Sena corporators. “Thirty trucks are already distributed in Byculla and other areas by the local corporators. With the lack of a policy, these food trucks distributed by the BMC using taxpayers money are running illegally,” Mishra said in his letter. The letter also went to say that there is ambiguity on whether the policy is for food trucks or vegetable vans. “Unless an NOC is taken from the Mumbai police, traffic police and Maharashtra FDA, the distribution and running of these food trucks will be illegal,” wrote Mishra. While the Shiv Sena is miffed by the BMC’s circular to stop the distribution of food trucks as freebies by corporators ahead of next year’s BMC elections, Chahal has called for a meeting to discuss and formulate a food truck policy on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/seize-all-food-trucks-bjp-to-bmc-chief-in-mumbai/articleshow/87146133.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The officials of the city traffic branch attributed the increase in the number of accidents to the rush on the streets and rash driving. However, the maximum number of road accident victims were pedestrians. Out of the 18 killed, 10 were pedestrians, who were either crossing the roads or walking by the side. From August 15, Nashik city police commisioner Deepak Pandey had made the use of helmets compulsory for two-wheeler riders. To ensure strict implementation, the CP issued the ‘No Helmet, No Petrol’ order. A large number of bikers have now started using helmets. Senior officers of the traffic branch said, as wearing helmets was made mandatory only a month-and-a-half ago, the results would be evident only after the analysis of a 3-4 month period. Last year, by the end of September, 100 road accident fatalities had been reported. This year, during the same period, 131 people were killed. While 37 pedestrians were killed in road accidents this year, 20 pedestrians were killed last year. Due to the Covid restrictions too, the road mishaps were fewer last year. The officials said they would implement stricter traffic rules to reduce violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pedestrians-account-for-10-of-18-deaths-in-nashik-roads-in-sept/articleshow/87143320.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Ahmedabad||Millennia of Buddhist heritage in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: The excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) at Vadnagar, PM Narendra Modi’s hometown, since 2015 have unearthed the ancient town and, overall, the region’s Buddhist past. The finds include multiple votive stupas, relics, artifacts, and structures. Experts said that along with the nearby Taranga hills, the region gives a snapshot of about 1,400 years of Buddhism. The major finds from the excavations by the state archaeology department in the 2000’s and later excavations by the ASI at Vadnagar and Taranga are on display at the three-day international Buddhist symposium at Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh. The symposium will be inaugurated by PM Modi on Wednesday, Buddha Purnima. “The exhibition has a special section on Vadnagar and Taranga,” said an expert associated with the project. “The new finds give a sequence of events of Buddhism’s course in the region.” Experts said that the earliest finds in Vadnagar — built structures and artifacts — date back to about 1st century CE. The presence of Buddhist artifacts is found up to 7th century CE after which it thins out. “But we should see Taranga as a possible continuation of the Buddhist traditions,” said the expert. “Because at nearly the same period (7th century CE), the hills were made the abode of Buddhist monks, which continued up to the 14th century.” Apart from an idol of Bodhisattva and terracotta head of Lord Buddha, several artifacts including sealings connect the sites with other important Buddhism spots of India, experts said. For example, the elliptical structure near grains storage resonates with Rajgir and Shravasti structures. At Taranga, the ASI experts have found terraced system along with retaining wall to create religious structures. A stupa with circumambulatory path was found on Dhagolia hill. Also discovered was a rectangular structure, probably a prayer hall, with two stupas near Taran Dharan Mata temple. In all, about 40 votive stupas have been found from the hills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/millennia-of-buddhist-heritage-in-gujarat/articleshow/87144332.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC’s corpus in FDs hits Rs 82,000 crore||MUMBAI: Consolidating its status as the country’s richest civic body in the midst of a resource crunch, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has declared a fixed deposit (FD) asset base of over Rs 82,000 crore. More than 60% of this corpus is intended for funding large infrastructure projects in Mumbai in coming years.According to a statement tabled before the BMC’s Standing Committee, its finance department has revealed that it has a total of 343 FDs in various banks, most of them nationalised, which have earned an annual interest of over Rs 1,800 crore FDs worth Rs 5,664 crore matured this year and Rs 9,079 crore of revenue was ploughed back into new FDs. The consolidated amount in FDs now stands at just over Rs 82,410 crore, up from Rs 79,002 crore in August 2020, despite a dip in revenues. The BJP has, however, questioned the Shiv Sena-controlled civic body’s presentation of its finances. “Almost all the money is meant for pension of employees and their Provident Fund (PF) and BMC’s sinking fund. This is all part of statutory reserves and deposits of contractors. BMC is facing a financial crisis and has cut down on several projects like upgradation of schools and open spaces in the budget. The BMC must revisit FDs and the interest it is getting. Better financial management is required for bulk deposits,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. Internally too, the BMC administration is aware of the challenges. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal had announced a Rs 39,038 crore budget for the financial year 2021-22. Despite falling revenues amid the pandemic, the budget rose 16.7% over last year's outlay of Rs 33,441 crore. Chahal, however, admitted that capital expenditure had risen and was not sustainable unless revenue collection improved or new income streams were added. BMC has been taking internal loans against the FDs to fund long-term infrastructure projects like the Coastal Road. It has said the corpus includes Rs 26,283 crore in employees’ provident fund and pension accounts. After adding some additional liabilities, a balance of Rs 50,952 crore is seen to be available in the corpus for expenditure on key projects. This is the BMC’s avowed plan for the next few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmcs-corpus-in-fds-hits-rs-82000cr/articleshow/87145402.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Goa||Goa govt understated fiscal, revenue deficit, says CAG||PANAJI: Goa’s fiscal policies, although well within stipulated norms, still need a well thought-out “borrowing-repayment strategy” to prevent a debt trap, said the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) in its state finances audit report for 2019-20. While acknowledging the state government’s efforts to contain the fiscal deficit below the threshold of 3%, the CAG also gave the government a slap on the wrist for window-dressing the state’s fiscal profile through off-budget borrowings and delayed pension payments. The CAG audit confirms an open secret that the state government has been playing with numbers and fiscal parameters. “The state government short-transferred Rs 138.5 crore of employees and government contribution to NSDL under the defined contribution pension scheme during 2019-20, thus understating the revenue deficit and fiscal deficit to that extent,” the CAG said. The audit report, which was tabled in the state legislative assembly on the last day of the last session, also red-flagged the off-budget fiscal operations undertaken by the state. Rs 919 crore was borrowed in 2019-20 through off-budget loans, which allowed the government to understate its overall debt by 1.1% of the GSDP. “Further, taking into account the off-budget borrowings of the state, the total outstanding debt at the end of March 2020 worked out to Rs 23,473 crore as against Rs 22,554 crore shown in the finance accounts,” said the CAG report. The CAG said that the Pramod Sawant government has taken steps for “better fiscal management”, but at the same time, warned that the state government needs to improve its outstanding debt-GSDP (gross state domestic product) ratio, which stood at 28% in 2019-20 as against the cap of 25% prescribed in the Goa Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. In an analysis of Goa’s debt profile, the CAG said that the government’s repayment timelines will put a strain on the state’s finances within the next seven years, since 51% or Rs 8,667 crore will have to be repaid during that period. “Therefore, the state government would have to work out a well thought-out borrowing repayment strategy to avoid falling into a debt trap,” the report said. “The state needs to become a revenue surplus state as per the target given in the Goa FRBM Act.” According to the CAG report, Goa’s fiscal deficit is 2.5% for 2019-20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-understated-fiscal-revenue-deficit-says-cag/articleshow/87145390.cms||---

The girl allegedly killed her mother as she refused to allow her to marry her boyfriend. The deceased, Yadamma, 45, was a daily wage worker and her husband is a labourer. According to police, Nandini, who is a school dropout, was in love with Ram Kumar, 19, an unemployed youth from the neighbourhood. “Nandini used to meet Ram Kumar secretly and when she sought her parents’ consent to marry him, they refused to give her permission and later Yadamma reprimanded Nandini for secretly meeting him,” the inspector said. On Monday evening, when Nandini was with Ram Kumar at her house, Yadamma came home. Kumar fled from the house and Yadamma admonished Nandini for meeting Kumar. “Nandini informed Kumar about the incident and they decided to kill Yadamma. As per the plan, Kumar came to her house and they strangled Yadamma to death with a stole,” the inspector said. The incident came to light when Yadaiah came home at night. Police shifted the body for post-mortem and took the accused into custody on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/teen-daughter-murders-woman-for-opposing-marriage/articleshow/87144358.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man wins college fee refund battle after 7 years||MUMBAI: Holding Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal’s Dwarkadas J Sanghvi College of Engineering guilty of deficiency in service and unfair trade practice for refusing to refund fees for bio-medical engineering in 2014 within three days of payment to the father of a student who harboured dreams of becoming a mechanical engineer and refused to join the course, a consumer forum has ordered the college to refund Rs 1.23 lakh and pay a compensation of Rs 35,000. The son’s score did not allow him admission to the mechanical engineering course due to its higher cut off, forcing the father to settle for bio medical engineering. At the time of the admission the college staff had assured the father that later he could try and transfer his son to mechanical engineering or withdraw his admission to move to another college. The staff had said that tuition fees will be refunded after deducting Rs 1,000. However, when the father withdrew the admission, the fee was not refunded. “The flip-flop by administrative staff ... can be believed, as this seems to be a tactic to lure gullible parents like the complainant, whose child harbour the dream of studying engineering, but have not scored the requisite marks,” the consumer forum said. The student’s parent, Sanjay Shedge from Borivli, had moved the consumer forum in July 2015. The college claimed that as per the rules a seat could not be filled in that course before cut-off and therefore no fees would be refunded except security deposit. The forum said that bio-medical engineering was seen as a low-interest stream among students who aspired to be engineers, and therefore despite having a low score Shedge’s son gained admission into it. The forum said the college has not brought any proof on record to show that while giving admission to Shedge’s son some other candidate was denied admission due to the seat being blocked by him. “Neither has opposite party 1 (college) brought any waiting list for admission into their bio-medical engineering course on record, showing that at the time when complainant had taken admission, there were students waiting for joining the course. Therefore we opine OP 1 cannot hold complainant liable for seats in their bio-medical engineering course remaining vacant, which is their own responsibility to fill up,” the forum said. The forum said that while Shedge took admission on August 5, 2014, and cancelled it three days later, the cut-off date for the course was only on August 14, 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-wins-college-fee-refund-battle-after-7-yrs/articleshow/87145427.cms||Rebecca Samervel

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy was hearing a PIL filed by Hyderabad School Parents Association (HSPA) that alleged that these private unaided institutions were fleecing students with huge fee. The association had in the past challenged the method of private schools collecting fee contrary to the state guidelines during Covid-19. The association has urged the court to bring in a regulatory mechanism. It also sought a direction to the state to place in public domain the Professor Thirupathi Rao committee recommendations. The bench sought counters from the authorities and adjourned the case to November 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parents-body-knocks-hc-door-on-school-fee/articleshow/87144353.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Kindergarten age is a crucial time where children learn the routine of going to school and develop the habit of eating on their own, playing and socializing with other children and teachers. With schools closed for one-and-a-half years already, students who enter Class I may not at all be used to school environment,” said Samuel Raj, correspondent, Jerusalem Nursery and Primary School. He also added that the government could have at least considered reopening for those who are willing to send their children to school.On the other hand, playschools are also worried about financial survival as they have remained closed for such a long period and are demanding the government to at least announce a tentative date for reopening. “Most playschools are run by women entrepreneurs. It has already been challenging for us to even pay rent. It is not possible to also survive with online classes for such young children. We expect at least some support from the government. The government must also give us proper SOPs before reopening as there are a lot of practical issues in ensuring the safety of students,” said Shafnam Shafana, director, Cute Hearts Playschool.Parents have also been struggling to take care of their children at home, especially if they are working. “My daughter is restless at home and we can only do so much to engage her as both I and my husband are working. At least for few hours, if she can be in kindergarten, it will keep her engaged productively and also let us focus on work,” said M Kanagalakshmi, a parent of a four-year-old girl.Kindergarten teachers also said that by staying at home for too long, children are also prone to being drawn to smartphones or TV to keep them occupied. “Children also become too attached to parents that they may find it difficult to be away from parents and going to school even for a few hours. By meeting other children, they also learn to interact socially,” said K Meenashri, a kindergarten teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/playschools-unhappy-with-govt-decision-to-not-reopen-on-nov-1/articleshow/87144344.cms||---

According to the complaint, Mavunkal had sexually abused the woman’s daughter, when she was a minor. Though the case was registered by the North police, it will be probed by the crime branch, which is investigating around six other cases against Mavunkal. He is currently under judicial custody in various cheating cases registered against him. According to the police sources, the girl was 17 at the time of incident pertaining to the case. Mavunkal had allegedly abused the girl sexually in his house at Kaloor here after promising her financial aid for education and getting admission in college. The girl stayed silent about the abuse for long time out of fear but later told the parents. But they too were afraid of Mavunkal due to his influence among top police officers and politicians. However, they decided to complain after Mavunkal was arrested for financial fraud. The complaint was received by the Kochi city police commissioner who directed the North police to register a case. “The North police have handed over the case details to the crime branch and we have started the probe. The procedures for his arrest and custody will be initiated. The survivor’s and her parents’ statements have to be taken. More details cannot be divulged now,” said a crime branch source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pocso-case-filed-against-monson/articleshow/87144418.cms||---

They also added that low calcium intake is leading to both genders being increasingly susceptible to osteoporosisThe doctors were addressing the media on the eve of the ‘World Osteoporosis Day’ which falls on October 20 every year. “In 2013, 50 million people in India were estimated to be either osteoporotic or had low bone mass. The prevalence of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women has varied from 12% to 60% and it has been shown to increase with advancing age. Women are twice affected from osteoporosis than men in the 40-60 age groups,” said Dr V Sathya Narayana, senior consultant and head, department of orthopaedics and traumatology, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC).Dr UT Vassan, senior consultant and head, Joint and Sports Injury Centre, MMHRC , said that according to Unicef, a quarter of women of reproductive age in India are undernourished. “Their calcium and Vitamin D intake is low, which leads to low peak bone mass. When it comes to food consumption, there is a stark difference between men and women in the same household. Women end up eating the last and the least,” he added. The doctors also said that fractures due to osteoporosis are gradually increasing as well, especially spine and neck of femur. “Fractures can occur with a fall or a minor movement. Some osteoporosis fractures can even be triggered by a strong sneeze or cough. Spine, hip, wrist and shoulder are the most common parts of the body to break in osteoporosis. Early, detectable signs of bone loss are rare. Some signs which may point to osteoporosis are receding gums, brittle nails and a weak hand grip,” spine surgeon Dr R Vetri Nallathambi.Doctors said that osteoporosis, especially in younger population, can be prevented by eating a well-balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, regular exercise and good physical activity, adequate sunlight exposure, avoiding smoking and alcohol consumption and keeping chronic diseases like diabetes and thyroid dysfunction under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/women-over-40-at-higher-risk-of-osteoporosis/articleshow/87144349.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Circular on RTI draws flak from ex-info commissioners||Hyderabad: An internal circular issued by Telangana chief secretary Somesh Kumar instructing all information officers to clarify issues from higher officials before replying under the Right to Information Act application has drawn flak. “It has come to my notice that state public information officers designated under RTI Act in certain administrative offices are furnishing information to the applicants in a routine manner without proper verification of the records with reference to the information sought by the applicant,” Kumar’s October 13 note reads. In the note, Kumar further wrote: “Special chief secretary, principal secretary and secretaries to the government have been requested to instruct the public information officers in their office to obtain orders from special chief secretary, principal secretaries and secretaries to the government head of the department before furnishing the information to the applicant under RTI Act.” Reacting to the circular, M Sridhar Acharyulu, former central information commissioner, said the orders of CS are not in tune with the RTI Act. “If the PIOs are acting without proper verification of records, the government should train the PIOs on maintenance of records, their retention, categorization and analyse the request to give or deny information as per the RTI Act. Before issuing this circular, the CS should have understood that the Supreme Court recognized the discretion powers and independent functioning of the PIOs in the case of CPIO, Supreme Court vs. Subhash Chandra Agrawal, 2019,” he said. He further said that the chief secretary and other higher officials should concentrate on implementing Section 4 (1) (b) of RTI Act, which mandates public authorities to disclose information suo motu on 17 categories. “This will avoid the need to file RTI requests, which eventually reduces PIOs’ burden in answering RTI. This circular will make PIOs very happy as there will be no threat of liability under RTI Act. But the RTI requestors will be worried,” he added. Former state information commissioner R Dileep Reddy echoed similar sentiments and said senior officers like secretaries, principal secretaries and special chief secretaries were not coming forward to act as designated appellate authorities under the law to show some degree of responsibility to ensure transparency. “Issuing instructions to the same set of senior officers is against the provisions of law & spirit of the Act. This will prevent the smooth flow of information into the public domain. This is further dilution of RTIA as GOI already diluted this Act with unwanted & unwarranted amendments,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/circular-on-rti-draws-flak-from-ex-info-commissioners/articleshow/87144348.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The issue of restructuring of loans in the light of unseasonal rain, drought, Covid leading to short margins, and some co-operatives becoming non-performing assets was also raised with Shah. “There are income tax issues pending for 15-20 years, where co-operatives are being told to pay income tax for having paid more than the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to farmers.

This is not the first time that the corporation has highlighted the issues and glitches in IKM software and references to similar communications in the past have also been mentioned in the latest letter sent to the head of IKM. While the corporation needs to update records of around 4.5 lakh tax assessments, the revenue wing has reported that buildings dated from 2016-17 alone can be assessed using the software and it has no facility to register buildings from years before 2016-17 with retrospective effect. Even though service cess has been calculated in the city corporation along with property tax for the past three years, the software has no facility to add service cess to buildings which were assessed before the service cess came into effect. According to the letter sent to IKM, while merging the data base before 2016, the officials tried posting the tax for a whole year; however, the system would still reflect that of half year. It also lists out other technical glitches like delay, frequent instances of system snags which have delayed the process of data updation. The corporation has also raised issues regarding the accounting software of IKM. The officials have reported that the collection from zonal offices are ported to the main office in 15-30 days and this has made it difficult for the accounts wing to promptly check the collection records from zonal offices. The glitches in software have also affected the reconciliation process which needs to be done on an immediate basis. It was following the fund fraud in zonal offices that lack of updated data regarding property tax popped up. The BJP and UDF raised the issue in the council and alleged that people are being made to pay tax repeatedly since the corporation never kept account of tax payments and money was being swindled by the staff. Mayor Arya Rajendran has declared that data updation will be completed within a month. The report submitted to the urban affairs director regarding the issues in tax data highlight lack of proper database, delay in proper updation (posting) as two major issues which have led to data inaccuracy regarding tax payment. The addition of wards following delimitation, rearrangement of wards, tax revision which marked a shift from annual rental value to plinth area necessitated huge transfer of data and updation of information. It so turned out that in many cases, the updation and transfer was incomplete which led to a situation where people have to furnish previous tax receipts while paying for a specific fiscal or else their accounts will show arrears of previous financial years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tasked-with-tax-data-cleansing-revenue-wing-flags-glitches-in-ikms-software/articleshow/87144388.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Police said the trio acted at the behest of Rakesh Reddy, prime accused in the murder case. The arrested were male nurse Mohammed Akber Ali (35), real estate agent K Mangaiah Gupta (58) from Madhapur and contractor K Srinivas (38) from Nagole. Rakesh has been lodged in Chanchalguda prison since February 11, 2019. The case is under trial in a local court since one month. “As the trial is going in favour of the prosecution, Rakesh had decided to threaten the PPs and witnesses. He induced a friend, Gupta, who used to meet him during mulaqat in prison, his associate Srinivas and Akber by offering to give them money if they help him in executing his plan,” west zone Joint CP AR Srinivas said. As per their plan, Gupta and Srinivas gave a cellphone to Akber who sent photos of the threatening letters given to him by Rakesh on WhatsApp. “Rakesh wrote some content of the letters and we suspect that he made some one else write rest of the content. The witnesses were threatened through the letters to give evidence in favour of him and prosecutors were threatened to withdraw from the case. The accused threatened to harm them and their family members,” the joint CP said. Based on a complaint from the PPs and witnesses, three cases were registered at Jubilee Hills, Chandanagar and Rajendranagar police stations recently. During the investigation, Jubilee Hills police along with the west zone Task Force team arrested the trio from their houses and recovered five handwritten letters, four cell phones and other incriminating evidence from their possession. “Witness protection is a very important process of criminal justice system. If any witness feels threatened, they should immediately approach the SHO or DCP concerned or me. We will ensure that no harm comes to them and stringent action will be initiated against the accused,” Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-held-for-threatening-pps-witnesses-in-jayaram-case/articleshow/87144368.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The MIDC has developed an industrial estate on 345 hectare at Ajang. The land was purchased from the Maharashtra State Agriculture Development Corporation (MSADC) for Rs 35 crore two years ago. “There is a huge scope for pharmaceutical companies here. Therefore, we are planning to develop this pharma park. The park will provide all the facilities required by the companies,” said the MIDC officials. MIDC has already developed 200 hectare at Talegaon-Akrale in the Dindori taluka of the district. This new industrial estate is located around 7 km from the Nashik airport. Infrastructure facilities like roads, streetlights and water have been developed at the industrial estates at Dindori and Ajang. Some large industries have already firmed their investment plans in the Talegaon-Akrale MIDC area. Earlier, scarcity of land was a major issue that had affected the industrial growth in the district. Not a single new large-scale industry was set up in Nashik due to the lack of land in the last decade. However, the two new industrial estates are expected to fetch large investments in the future. “There are many existing pharma companies in Nashik district and there is huge scope for new companies to make their investment plans given the good weather conditions here. Hence, it is a positive development if MIDC plans a pharma cluster here,” said Manish Rawal, the chairman of the aviation committee of Ambad Industries and Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA). The government also needs to make efforts to bring more new industrial projects at Nashik, added Rawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/midc-to-set-up-pharma-park-at-ajang-in-malegaon-taluka/articleshow/87143360.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Varanasi||AD(S) MP apologises after rebuke from Anupriya over casteist slur||Varanasi: NDA constituent Apna Dal (Sonelal) MP Pakaudi Lal Kole landed in troubled waters when a video in which he is purportedly using abusive words for Brahmins and Thakurs, went viral on social media on Tuesday. Kole is MP from Robertsganj (reserved) seat in Sonbhadra district. The surfacing of the video led to large-scale protests in Sonbhadra and Mirzapur districts, following which Kole faced the ire of AD(S) leader and Union minister Anupriya Patel. Kole later apologized, claiming the video was doctored to distort his image. On Monday, Kole had gone to address a gathering of Kole fraternity on an inter college campus in Babura area of Mirzapur district to mobilise support for his son and MLA from Chhanbe assembly seat, Rahul Prakash. The video containing his speech delivered at the meeting went viral on social media on Tuesday morning. In this video, he is seen recalling his over 40-year political career and claiming how he kept dominating castes, including Brahmin and Thakurs. The video shows him using abusive words for both the castes and also mentioning how he stopped people of these castes from deposing against him by threatening to blow their houses with dynamite in a case registered against him in the past. After the video went viral on social media, a group of people reached Robertsganj Kotwali in Sonbhadra, demanding lodging of a case against Kole for derogatory remarks against particular castes and also his expulsion from Parliament. In the Halia area of Mirzapur, a group of locals carried out a procession and raised slogans against Kole. Taking serious note of the development, Anupriya released a video message and said that her party strongly condemns the casteist remarks of Kole. “Inappropriate language against any community or caste is not in the culture of our party. Since its foundation, the party has struggled for the rights of deprived, harassed and weaker people of all sections,” said Anupriya while directing Kole to seek apology from people for his remarks. After the release of Anupriya’s video on social media, Kole too issued a video statement as an apology on his letterhead on social media. Kole claimed that his statement had been doctored, which had hurt the sentiments of Brahmins and Thakurs. “I am also deeply hurt by it. What I am today, is due to the blessings of all sections of the society. If I have committed any wrong, I express my apology by joining both hands,” said Kole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ads-mp-apologises-after-rebuke-from-anupriya-over-casteist-slur/articleshow/87145446.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The incident took place around 5 pm on Monday when the boy, a shepherd, had taken his sheep for grazing in the field when a leopard pounced on him. His father and other people nearby had started shouting, and the leopard then left the boy and fled. Forest officials said the boy was seriously injured and was taken to the rural hospital in Igatpuri tehsil town, where he was declared dead. He had received serious neck injuries. The incident has sparked panic among the local residents in the areas. People have demanded that cages be put up in the area to trap the wild animal. Forest officials said they are in the process of putting up three cages in the area. This is the third leopard attack-related fatality in the past 20 days. Earlier, on September 30, a five-year-old girl was killed in a leopard attack at Wadgaon village near Girnare in Nashik taluka. On October 3, a four-year-old girl was killed in a leopard attack at Duber village in Dindori taluka, just 10 km from Wadgaon. Meanwhile, a two-year-old leopard was trapped in a cage put up at Wadgaon village in the early hours of Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/11-year-old-killed-in-leopard-attack/articleshow/87143371.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai-Pune Expressway ghat stretch to get even more rumble strips||PUNE: The MSRDC will set up additional rumble strips at specific points along the 10km ghat section of the Mumbai-Pune Expressway to further control vehicular speed, especially during winter, when heavy fog reduces visibility. A day after three people lost their lives in an accident near the Khopoli exit of the Expressway, an Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) official said the utility was preparing a plan to keep the highway safe for motorists during the cold season. “Speed limits of vehicles cannot be changed based on seasons. But with the ghat section witnessing heavy fog, particularly during the winter, steps are being taken. We are in the process of identifying a few spots on both lanes where rumble strips will be set up. The aim is to further reduce the speed of vehicles. The calculation on the number of strips to be set up is on. We cannot put many strips, as that may prove counter-productive,” the official said. The additional rumble strips on the Mumbai-Pune side of the Expressway will be on the stretch right after the food mall near Khalapur. On the Pune-Mumbai side of the Expressway, these strips will be installed right after one passes the Adoshi tunnel. “The ghat section starts, as one crosses both these points. The fog mainly happens along the ghat section,” the official said. The MSRDC would also consider fog lights along the ghat section while the number of blinkers and reflective tapes would be increased, said the official. “Work on cleaning of the crash barriers is on and blinkers and tapes will be put on them, especially on the curves along the Expressway. Its edges and the median will also see more blinkers and tapes. But the motorists have to stay alert and should not indulge in speeding, overtaking and lane-cutting,” the official said. Three people were killed and six injured in a pile-up involving six vehicles near the Khopoli exit of the Pune-Mumbai Expressway around 5.30am on Monday. The police said speeding was the cause of the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-e-way-ghat-stretch-to-get-even-more-rumble-strips/articleshow/87145453.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Hyderabad||Approach poll tribunal on Tukkuguda municipality chief: HC to petitioner||Hyderabad: Stating that education minister Sabita Indra Reddy, TRS MP K Keshav Rao, MLCs E Mallesham, and K Janardhan Reddy as ex officio members had exercised their franchise twice (during polls in two civic bodies) to ensure victory of TRS nominee as chairperson of the Tukkuguda municipality in Rangareddy district, a public interest litigation petition was filed in the high court. The petition was filed by Racha Laxman and G Krishna Goud of Tukkuguda. Their counsel A Jagan argued before a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy that the legislators could opt for only one local body to exercise their ex officio vote. They had opted for Warangal and a few other local bodies. However, the four voted in favour of their nominee, Madhu Mohan, and ensured his victory, Jagan said, terming the action of the TRS leaders as unlawful. He urged the court to declare the election of Madhu Mohan as illegal as these legislators cannot exercise their franchise as ex officio members at two places. They know the rules, but they had done it wilfully, he added. The bench, however, informed him that there was an election tribunal to hear such matters. “Setting aside the election of a person is not the job of this court. Your remedy is to file an election petition. You have a good case, but you have to go there,” the bench said while disposing of the petition. The bench said that the court was not expressing any opinion on the merits of the case.

We want to ask Modiji whether India will play a T20 match when Pakistan is playing T20 with the lives of the people of India in Kashmir. Poor workers from Bihar are being killed. Is it not Modi who had earlier said that when our soldiers are dying Manmohan Singh-led Congress government was offering biryani to them,” Owaisi said addressing a gathering here on Monday night. India and Pakistan are set to play against each other in the T20 World Cup on October 24 in Dubai. The MIM chief sought to ask what the Intelligence Bureau and Union home minister Amit Shah were doing. “Terrorists are coming from Pakistan. Weapons are being dropped through drones. Is this the ceasefire you (PM) announced on Line of Control. What for,” he asked. He said the Modi government had claimed that almost everything had been set right in Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370. “Nothing has changed in Kashmir. Targeted killings are going on. Whatever is happening is due to the failure of the Modi government. The Centre does not have a policy against the terrorists,” Owaisi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pm-mum-as-pak-plays-t20-with-kashmiris/articleshow/87144386.cms||Roushan Ali

Several people have been reported missing, sparking concerns that the actual toll is likely to be higher. Information TOI gathered from district officials suggested at least 40 deaths in the state in the past two days. Nainital additional district magistrate Ashok Joshi said the district toll could go up to 27. "We have information of people trapped at multiple locations. Our teams have been sent but operations are difficult in this weather," he said. Nainital cut off, fish flood Mall Road The lone railway track to Kathgodam station in Nainital district was washed away by the swollen waters of Gaula river on Tuesday, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded as all 12 trains on the route were cancelled. A dozen national and state highways in the district were also blocked due to landslides. The hill town of Nainital virtually turned into a flooded island, cut off from the rest of the state for the second consecutive day as debris blocked all three routes. While the Nainital-Bhowali road was blocked on Monday afternoon, the Nainital-Haldwani road and Nainital-Kaladhungi road were also blocked for public use by the evening. Nearby towns of Bhowali, Mukteshwar and Ramgarh, too, have lost road connectivity. District officials told TOI the railway tracks can't be repaired until the water level of Gaula recedes. "Trains have been cancelled till October 20. Repairs will begin once the water level goes down. Several roads in the district are blocked and it'll take hours to open them to traffic. We have asked hotel and homestay owners to provide food and relief material to stranded tourists," said Nainital sub-divisional magistrate Prateek Jain. Meanwhile, the water level of Naini Lake rose a foot above the danger mark on Tuesday and flooded the Mall Road, bringing along several species of fish that inhabit the lake. Tourists and residents were spotted catching fish and taking pictures. "Almost every locality in Nainital is flooded and restaurants and hotels are closed. The administration has asked us to provide food and necessities to the tourists," said Ved Sah, a hotelier from Nainital. Naina Devi temple and the iconic Boathouse Club were also wading in water. Officials said even though all floodgates were opened on Monday, the water level has continued to rise. Low-lying areas in Kumaon Himalayas, too, suffered damage from the rain. A bridge was washed away in Haldwani while an elephant was rescued from being swept away in the strong currents of Gaula. PM Modi talks to Uttarakhand CM, assures of all helpPM Narendra Modi has spoken with Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami to take stock of the situation. The Centre has assured Uttarakhand of all required assistance to handle the situation. Later in the day, the CM announced an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh for the kin of the victims. “Till now we have information about 34 deaths and five people are missing. We will give Rs 4 lakh ex gratia to the next of kin of the deceased people. A compensation of Rs 1 lakh will be given to owners whose houses have suffered damage,” the chief minister said, adding that compensation for loss of cattle would also be doled out. Several tourists were stranded at various locations around Nainital on Monday, including 100 that were stuck at a resort in Ramnagar. The premises of the resort and its parking lot were flooded after water from the swollen Kosi river entered the property. Many others who had travelled to hotels and homestays in Bhowali, Mukteshwar and Ramgarh for the long weekend were stranded with no power or network connectivity. A tourist stuck in Bhowali along with five others said the area had no electricity for hours. “People are hoarding rations and we are not sure when we’ll be able to move out. The roads are closed and there is no information on who should be contacted for supply of essentials,” he said. Electricity supply throughout the Kumaon region was affected with Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited confirming that six of its sub-stations were submerged. “Our engineers are working but it is difficult,” said UPCL managing director Deepak Rawat. The CM cancelled all his programmes for the day, including a visit to the national capital. Instead, he visited the Disaster Management Control Room. Dhami, along with DGP Ashok Kumar, later conducted an aerial survey of the rain-hit belts in Garhwal and Kumaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/34-dead-as-record-rains-lash-uttarakhand-trigger-floods/articleshow/87146884.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Delhi||Construction & demolition waste: Rs 3 crore fine levied on agencies in Delhi-NCR||NEW DELHI: Special teams in Delhi and NCR states have inspected 6,596 C&D sites, of which 963 sites were found to be non-compliant with various C&D Waste Management Rules and dust mitigation measures, said Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM). An amount of approximately Rs 3 crore has been levied as environmental compensation against the defaulting agencies, besides orders issued for stoppage of work at 52 locations. In a statement on Wednesday, CAQM said, “As dust emanating from construction & demolition (C&D) sites is a major consistent source of air pollution, CAQM has been actively taking up with the governments of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh for strict compliance of dust mitigation measures at C&D sites. Following the directions of the Commission, dedicated teams were deployed in the states to inspect C&D sites. According to the reports received and compiled by the Commission from Delhi and NCR states, intensive drives are being regularly conducted by the concerned agencies by constituting a number of teams.” C&D activities generate enormous amounts of dust and contribute significantly to PM2.5 and PM10 adversely affecting the quality of air, it added. Between October 1 and 15, 112 teams, including 37 teams in Delhi, 30 in Haryana, 20 in Rajasthan and 25 in eight NCR districts of UP, were deployed to conduct on-field surprise inspections of C&D sites. During this period, 1,268 sites were inspected, including 1,017 C&D sites in Delhi, 98 in Haryana, 89 in NCR districts of Rajasthan and 64 sites in the NCR area of UP. The commission said a total of 60 vehicles were found violating prescribed dust mitigation norms during the field inspections and a total of Rs 81,20,000 was imposed and collected as EC from the erring C&D sites and vehicles. To tackle the problem of dust resulting from construction, remodelling, repair and demolition, such activities need to be strictly monitored and inspected for compliance with various dust control measures on a regular basis, said the commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cd-waste-rs-3cr-fine-levied-on-agencies-in-ncr/articleshow/87169760.cms||---

Dhakne’s comment came on a day when three accidents occurred on the Expressway. A day earlier, on Monday, three people were killed and six injured in an accident that led to a pile-up of six vehicles near the Khopoli exit of the Expressway. “Monday’s accident occurred at a time when we were amidst a road safety campaign on the Expressway and had aimed for a zero-fatality month. The campaign started on October 8 and will continue till November 7. Different regional transport offices in Pune and Mumbai and police are involved in the campaign,” the transport commissioner said. He said the observation this time was that the incidence of lane-cutting was much higher among people driving light motor vehicles rather than those in heavy vehicles. “This was not the trend before,” he said.

According to residents, a 3km stretch from the Octroi post to Bakori Phata on the highway is prone to traffic congestion. Sandip Satav, former deputy sarpanch and a BJP leader, said it is a long-pending issue that must be dealt with on priority with the inclusion of Wagholi in the civic limits. “We have seen some progress, but there is a long way to go as residents and daily commuters have been facing traffic jams almost every day during rush hours,” said Satav. Nitin Kumar Jain, of the Wagholi Housing Societies Residents Association, said traffic management in the area is poor. “Haphazard parking, illegal halting of vehicles, wrong side driving, and encroachments are rampant. ,” said Jain. Sanjay Harpale, a regular commuter, said that driving down the Wagholi stretch was challenging. “An alternative route should be developed to reduce the burden on the highway, which should be used only by long-distance vehicles that do not have to halt in Wagholi and the surrounding areas,” said Harpale. An officer from the traffic police department said they are working on solutions to reduce traffic snarls and facilitate smooth flow of vehicles.  “We will approach the civic administration to get some issues resolved, especially encroachments and space occupied along the road and traffic signals,” said the police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ahmednagar-highway-traffic-snarls-irk-wagholi-residents/articleshow/87144403.cms||Sarang Dastane

However, cybercrime cell of city police helped him in getting his money back from a Portuguese bank. According to the police, Shah had purchased raw materials from Schott, a German company, and was supposed to to deposit Rs 31 lakh in their bank account as payment. But on October 7, Shah received an email that told him that due to change in the firm’s global strategy, he will have to deposit the amount in another of their bank account. Shah failed to notice that the email was slightly different from the original id of the German firm. The e-mail told Shah to deposit the money in Caixa Geral de Depósitos Braga’s Lisbon branch in Portugal and not in the company’s original bank account in Germany. He trusted the mail and accordingly transferred the payment from State Bank of India (SBI) account on October 8. However, the German firm sent an email to Shah stating that they didn’t get any payment. Shah was shocked and when he inquired in the firm’s Mumbai branch, he came to know that he became a victim of fraud. Shah then approached the cybercrime police on October 15 and cops immediately got into action and sent an email to the Portuguese bank, German branch of SBI and Lisbon police. “The money was deposited in the Portuguese bank, but strangely the fraudsters hadn’t withdrawn it. The bank reversed the transaction and Shah got his money back,” said Hardik Makadia, ACP (cybercrime). When asked how the fraudsters managed to get details of Shah’s transaction with Schott and his email id, Makadia said, “It is possible that someone from the company or the client’s side may be involved, or that the fraudsters may have hacked Shah’s email id.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/portuguese-bank-refunds-rs-31-lakh/articleshow/87143656.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Metro contractor booked for fatal barricade crash||PUNE: The Kothrud police on Monday registered a case of negligence against a Pune Metro rail works contractor after a 64-year-old guard from a private security agency succumbed to the serious injuries he had suffered after a protective iron barricade of the mass rapid transit system fell on him at Vanaz on September 9. MahaMetro, which is executing the Metro project in Pune, has put up iron barricades on either sides of roads and near the road dividers (wherever the work is on). The barricade was close to the footpath where the incident occurred. This is the fifth accident (see graphic) in the last over two years relating to Metro work. The police said victim Maruti Laxman Navaskar, a resident of Kothrud, was waiting for a staff bus at Vanaz, as he wanted to go to a company in Pirangut where he was working as a security guard. “ He was standing close to a heavy iron barricade, which was not fastened properly and fell on him around 7am on September 9. He died on October 9 while under medical attention at a private hospital on Paud Road,” said assistant inspector Kisan Rathod of the Kothrud police. Navaskar’s son, Mayur (28), lodged a complaint and the police impounded the barricade. When contacted, Mayur said, “We came to know about the incident when the Metro workers came to our house around 9am on September 9. They took us to the hospital where I tried to interact with my father. He had sustained several fractures to his legs and there were four fractures to his skull. Metro authorities paid the hospital bills, but are so far silent on the issue of compensation.” MahaMetro public relations officer Hemant Sonawane said, “An inquiry will be carried out to fix responsibility for the accident and appropriate action will be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-contractor-booked-for-fatal-barricade-crash/articleshow/87144413.cms||Gitesh Shelke

---||Varanasi||IIT-BHU leads Indo-Australian research hub to carry out intensive activities in field of strategic critical minerals||Varanasi: IIT-BHU is leading an Indo-Australian research hub to carry out activities in the field of strategic critical minerals important for manufacturing, low-carbon economy and Digital India. IIT-BHU director Prof. Pramod Kumar Jain said, “The Indian side is led by IIT-BHU with IIT Bombay, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee, IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIT Guwahati, IIT Indore, IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, NIT Rourkela, NIT Surathkal, IIIT Hyderabad, CSIR Labs as partners. The Australian side is led by Monash University with partners from RMIT University, University of Melbourne, CSIRO, Deakin University, University of Queensland, UNSW, Latrobe University, Queensland University of Technology and Federation University with support from industry partner organisations and leading international researchers.” He said that in due course, the hub will be expanded to the Indo-Pacific region by including researchers from other countries in the region. The hub is able to secure international funding under the Study Melbourne Research Partnerships Program and is seeking funding from several other sources, including the Australia-India Strategic Research Fund, Department of Science & Technology and Ministry of Mines. The hub is planning to organize an international symposium on “Opportunities in critical minerals for Indo-Pacific region” with the involvement of Indian and Australian high commissioner and Indian Prime Minister Office which will ultimately lead to establishment of an Indo-Pacific Centre of Excellence for Critical Mineral Research Hub at IIT-BHU Varanasi in due course. Prof. Jain said that over the next 5-7 year period, the hub will develop transformational technologies for a competitive and environmentally sustainable future for Indian mineral industries through high resource recovery, reduced environmental footprint, reductions in energy and water use, as well as preparing highly skilled future leaders for the sector. The hub will transform the minerals industry of India, establishing a new generation of research leaders to support the innovation needed in creating a green economy for the future. It will provide advice, ideas and expertise to assist policy makers and help secure the vital supplies of resources needed to drive the new energy economy and support the resources jobs of the future. This will ultimately lead to several academic exchange programmes, MoUs on ‘Education, Research and Skills’ and on ‘Cooperation in the field of Mining and Processing of Critical and Strategic Minerals expanding which will later be expanded to Indo-Pacific region involving IIT-BHU Varanasi as the nodal agency. He further informed that India has an ambitious industrial reforms agenda to expand manufacturing capability and to transition to a low-carbon and digital economy. Indian government has set ambitious targets for several sectors, for example, it has set a very ambitious renewable energy generation target of 175GW by 2022 and 450GW renewable energy by 2030. It also aims to have 30 percent of vehicles powered by electricity by 2030, which require availability of critical minerals. Maintaining the constant supply chain of critical minerals is important for India to make successful many government programmes such as Atmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India. He said that the critical metals (CM) are vital for renewable energy applications; however, continuing supplies are uncertain. “Critical metals” for renewable power generation include metals such as lithium, used in batteries, and rare earth elements, used in magnets for wind turbines and electric cars. “To secure supply of critical minerals as demand surges due to the growing manufacturing sector under the ambitious ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Prime Minister of India, robust and resilient supply chains and new and cost-effective tools and flowsheets for recycling extraction and recovery processes will be required, “said Prof Jain. He said that to make India self-reliant in manufacturing capability and to transition to a low-carbon and digitised economy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison jointly participated in 2020, India-Australia Leaders’ Virtual Summit held on June 4, 2020, and committed to elevate the bilateral Strategic Partnership concluded in 2009 to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP). Australia wants to support India to develop a domestic critical minerals processing industry, which would provide Western nations with an alternative to sourcing the materials from China. At present, the Australia-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (‘CECA’) Early Harvest agreement is in the draft stage, under the leadership of the former Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbott AC. The CECA is a precursor to the broad-based ‘Free Trade Agreement’ that is due to be formalized by the end of 2022.The Australian PM had recently announced a $2 billion loan facility for the critical minerals projects which is likely to boost the activity between India and Australia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/iit-bhu-leads-indo-australian-research-hub-to-carry-out-intensive-activities-in-field-of-strategic-critical-minerals/articleshow/87145462.cms||Binay Singh
---||Hyderabad||SPREADING A LITTLE FESTIVE CHEER||Along with all the fun and celebrations, there are many who reached out to Hyderabad’s less privileged – in any small way possible -- to brighten up their festive season. From buying new clothes and plating up hearty meals to taking the festivities to the doorsteps of those unable to step out, these individuals touched multiple lives with their heartwarming gestures, especially at a time when the world is still healing from the aftermath of a pandemic. Some even spent their festival recusing animals and giving them a new home. TOI celebrates some of these social do-gooders. Dressed for Bathukamma Sujatha Surepally is a known champion for women empowerment. From much before Covid-19 struck, she has been helping young girls across the state get an education and become self-reliant. When the pandemic pushed everything online, she ensured that these girls could continue their studies through mobile phones – some donated, some bought by Sujatha. So, when she realised that the 80 teenaged tribal girls from Mulugu forest area would have to spend the Bathukamma festival in their old, ordinary clothes, Sujatha immediately placed an order for new dresses. “It is a festival for women and an excuse for everybody to wear new clothes. It adds charm to the celebrations. Why should these girls be deprived of it?,” said Sujatha. But she didn’t stop just here. Along with other members of her group she also took the Bathukamma celebrations to a women’s home in the city for a day, where the women were given goodies including sanitary napkins – something they have limited access to. “These gestures, I personally feel, give hope to people about there being somebody who is looking out for them. Everybody must have this hope,” Sujatha said. Hot Navratri meals For the last two years now, K Venkata Murali and his team at No Food Waste have been feeding the hungry. Be it patients’ attendants waiting outside hospitals or the destitute living around street corners; the team has catered to as many as possible with excess food collected from homes, function halls and other party venues. During the nine-day Navratri festival too, they continued this work. Only this time, the food was especially prepared in their central kitchen in the city and as opposed to the usual 700-odd people fed every day, they whipped up hot plates of sambar-rice and pulihora for at least 1,200 people every day. Apart from hospitals, the team also travelled to slums and orphanages to offer this festive meal. “This was also the time when there was a wheelchair cricket championship – between Telangana and AP – in Hyderabad. So, we served food to all the 45 players from the two teams there,” said Murali who understands what an important role food plays during a festival or celebration. “It was very fulfilling to see these players enjoy the veg biryani, dal, rice and other accompaniments that we had specially cooked for them,” he added. Safe shelter While the world was celebrating by wearing new clothes, partying, spending on scrumptious food and festivities, there was one man who busied himself attending to the pain of some helpless souls. Meet Raju Bhasker, the founder of Pet Luck Animal Rehab centre, who spent this Navratri rescuing ailing and abandoned animals and giving them a new home. Among them was one-year-old Tara who was rescued right in the middle of Dasara festivities. She was severely malnourished -- devoid of food and water – and badly wounded. “She was recovered from the streets of Erragadda...What breaks our heart is that people passing by, all busy with their festivities, chose to ignore such a painful sight leaving her to die on the streets,” shared a volunteer Noor Ainy who wrote to TOI about Bhasker, popular as ‘Raju sir’ among them. “Luckily she was spotted by one of our volunteers and Raju sir rushed to the site. Tara is under IV fluids now and recuperating,” she said, adding how Bhasker works through all festivals and sometimes loses tracks of time while attending to these animals. “But now it is getting difficult for a man to single-handedly run the shelter that houses 84 babies. We hope more people come forward to help (physically and monetarily) to keep the place going,” Noor said. Wardrobe for all A resident of A S Rao Nagar, Parimala Tadas decided not to buy any new clothes and accessories for herself this festive season. Instead, she cleaned out her cupboards at home and made a pile of old bedsheets, leather purses, TV covers, table spreads and teapoy covers, lac and stone bangles, imitation jewellery sets, old sarees and dresses. “I gave my apartment's watchman some bed sheets since he doubles up as our ironing man and is always in need of these things. Then I gave my domestic help my bangles, purses, jewellery sets. She was so happy that it made me smile. I am sure she will share the happiness with her granddaughters,” said Tadas, who even donated some of her belongings to an old age home. If that’s not enough Tadas also organised an anna danam at house for all the support staff. "These small things always brings greater happiness in life," she said. New shoes; happy feet A regular at the Jasmine Home for girls on the city outskirts, Dr Ashima Sharma and her husband decided to carry some festive cheer with them this time around as they packed 36 pairs of brand-new sports shoes for the 36 girls – all orphans – living on campus. “I see everybody brings them dresses, blankets, school bags. But they are always in ordinary chappals. So, we decided to give them shoes so that they can wear them and walk into a bright future,” said Dr Sharma, professor at the department of emergency medicine, NIMS. The shoes were distributed on the occasion of the International Day for the Girl Child – October 11 – which incidentally was right in the middle of Navratri. “Every girl there is so talented and driven. I am glad we can do our small bit in helping them realise their dreams,” she added. ......................

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Construction sites to shut for a day||Thiruvananthapuram: The work at the construction sites run by the members of CREDAI Trivandrum and Builders Association of India (BAI), Trivandrum, will be stalled on Wednesday in protest against the alleged attack on Arun Unnithan, district vice chairman of BAI, by a trade union representative at district labour office (DLO). Museum police filed an FIR on Tuesday based on a complaint filed by the BAI. According to the complaint, the district labour officer summoned a meeting on Monday to settle the issue regarding loading and unloading rates in the district. According to the complaint filed by the BAI, the builders had earlier expressed the inability to accept the demand of trade unions to hike the loading and unloading rates. When the matter remained unresolved, a meeting was scheduled at DLO. During the meeting, one INTUC representative verbally abused the representatives of CREDAI and BAI and flung a chair at Arun Unnithan in an attempt to hurt him. Arun Unnithan said that such an act nearly threatened his life. “The issue has been going on for months. There is so much disparity in loading and unloading rates between Thiruvananthapuram and other districts. We clearly conveyed our problems in going for another hike this year. All the trade unions had also agreed to this and said that rates of around 18 items would not be changed. It was then that an INTUC representative named Nazar behaved in a violent manner,” said Arun Unnithan. He said that the manner in which some union members resort to violent and unparliamentary ways to curb dissent was unacceptable. Meanwhile, the INTUC Thiruvananthapuram unit issued a press note condemning the incident. “The act of a labourer who verbally abused and assaulted the management representatives was objectionable. Two other office bearers of the INTUC were entrusted with the task of deliberating on the issue. We strongly condemn the action of an individual who is not at all associated with the INTUC,” said a release issued by district president V R Prathapan and general secretary V J Joseph.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/construction-sites-to-shut-for-a-day/articleshow/87144420.cms||---

A day after three people lost their lives in an accident near the Khopoli exit of the highway, a Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) official said the utility was preparing a plan to keep the highway safe for motorists during the cold season. “Speed limits of vehicles cannot be changed based on seasons. But with the ghat section witnessing heavy fog, particularly during the winter, steps are being taken. We are in the process of identifying a few spots on both lanes where rumble strips will be installed. The aim is to further reduce the speed of vehicles on the expressway. The calculation on the number of strips to be installed is on. We cannot put many strips, as that may prove counter-productive,” the official told TOI. The additional rumble strips on the Mumbai-Pune side of the expressway will be on the stretch right after the food mall near Khalapur. On the Pune-Mumbai side of the expressway, these strips will be right after one passes the Adoshi tunnel. “The ghat section starts, as one crosses both these points. The fog mainly happens along the ghat section,” the official said. The MSRDC would also consider the option of setting up some fog lights along the ghat section of the highway, he said, adding that the number of blinkers and reflective tapes would be increased. “Work on cleaning of the crash barriers is on and blinkers and tapes will be put on them, especially on the curves along the expressway. Its edges and median will get more blinkers and tapes. But the motorists have to stay alert and should not indulge in speeding, overtaking and lane-cutting,” the official said.  A transport department official said a meeting was slated soon with the MSRDC to chalk out a plan for winter. “The plan needs to be properly chalked out. We have urged the MSRDC to improve some of the signage. A meeting will be held soon to finalize the plan,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/expressway-ghat-section-to-get-more-rumble-strips/articleshow/87144415.cms||Joy Sengupta

Traffic constable Narayan Somvanshi, who filed a complaint with the Dehu Road police, saidhe had noticed the man riding a two-wheeler without wearing the mask. “When I stopped him, he started abusing me. Seeing that, the traffic at the Chowk was halted,” he said. Somvanshi said the man alleged that the police were unnecessarily harassing people by fining for not wearing masks. “I told him that wearing mask was compulsory and it was good for his own safety. But the man continued to abuse me. He even hurled his footwear towards me,” he said. He then alerted his senior officer and filed a complaint. “When we contacted the man’s family, they also told him to calm down. But he abused them, too,” Somvanshi said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three years on, St Andrews Road in Bandra to be repaired again||MUMBAI: The St Andrews Road in Bandra, which was repaired in a shoddy manner in 2018 by a contractor whose services were then terminated by the BMC, will be laid again. The condition of the popular road, which goes from Bandra’s Hill Road to St Dominic Road and is one of the main connectors for motorists coming from Bandra and Khar and headed to the Worli Sea Link, has been in a bad condition ever since. The road is currently half done in asphalt and another portion in paver blocks. TimesViewThe misuse of public money and the resultant mess in the BMC’s annual road repairs contract is evident. If this contractor has done shoddy work, it implies he has cut corners and used inferior quality material. It is widely believed that such contracts involve kickbacks. As this newspaper has suggested in the past, the only long-term solution is to break the nexus between these contractors, officials and elected representatives.There have also been complaints of a faulty storm water drain network that causes water-logging in the area. The cement concreting that the BMC has proposed for the road now is a part of the Rs 2,000-crore-plus of road work tenders that were floated recently. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria said that he had, in a letter to the BMC additional commissioner in July 2019, proposed that improvement of the road be done in cement concrete with footpath and along with laying of storm water drains. “The St Andrews Road and St Dominic Road are busy roads. The area has various educational institutions such as St Andrews School, St Andrews College, Arya Vidya Mandir and Holy Family Hospital, making it a busy vehicular and pedestrian road,” Zakaria said. He said that the local residents have been for a long time demanding that the road be done in a holistic manner rather than only resurfacing which was proposed in 2018 but left half way. In May 2018, TOI had first reported about how the BMC had taken up repair works of St Andrews Road to replace the existing paver blocks with asphalt. However, this was only half done and the contractor’s services were terminated as residents complained that the repair works were being done in an unprofessional manner. John Soares, a local resident, said that the contractor was not capable of doing the work well and that there was a need to holistically carry out the road work. Activist Zoru Bhathena, who lives in Khar, said that he was surprised when he found St Andrews Road in the list of the roads to be repaired. “The authorities have multiple times re-laid the road, which is questionable,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-three-yrs-on-st-andrews-road-in-bandra-to-be-repaired-again/articleshow/87146181.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Hyderabad||Now I only work on being healthy, happy||By Manik Rajendra Deo Keeping myself happy and healthy is the new normal for me. Before this pandemic I was always anxious about small things. Worrying about some or other thing was normal for me. My biggest worry was my children who are far away from me for their jobs. While neglecting the positive side of the situation -- that they are doing well and growing in their careers -- I always thought if everything will be alright. I always kept waiting for their calls and messages. Always kept asking them about their vacation plans and when they would come home. And then came the first lockdown amid the pandemic. Suddenly, everything came to a standstill. Everyone was forced to remain where he/she was. Everything changed almost overnight. Our daily routines changed and most importantly, people’s worries changed. Everybody was now worried about health and nothing else. Everybody was instructing their family, friends and dear ones to follow Covid-19 protocol and to stay safe. For the first time I told my children not to try and come home until everything goes back to normal because being healthy and safe, I realised, was more important than living together. The first wave and the terrifying second wave taught everybody that nothing is more important than good health. Nothing matters more than health. Health is wealth, good health is real happiness and everything. How foolish I was to worry about small immaterial things and not enjoy the times of real happiness. Now I understand that keeping ourselves healthy and happy is the biggest responsibility. (The writer is a homemaker) ....................... Discipline boosted my productivity By K Sidhisree This year was a rollercoaster ride for many students. For more than a year, I prepared for my Eamcet exam, focusing more on Mathematics. That helped me secure an engineering seat in these unforeseeable Covid-19 times. Through it all, I limited my screen time to three hours and cut down on indiscriminate use of social media – both helped to boost my productivity. In these stressful days, my mother’s guidance helped me stay grounded. She promoted healthy eating habits and homemade food among all members of my family. I included moderate physical exercises and walking in my daily timetable, along with following a proper sleep schedule. This is the lifestyle pattern I adapted to, in this new normal. After my exam, I took pleasure in reading the entire Harry Potter series in detail. Thus, I improved my reading speed greatly. I signed up for a C language course online to start coding in my leisure time. Devoting time to my grandparents and assisting them was the first step towards expressing my gratitude for all that they have done so far. I would like to thank the Almighty for giving the world strength to withstand such a pandemic. Difficulties do come in life and to overcome them, one needs to be strong. We humans need to rise and fly above all negativity to maintain peace.

The campaign will begin on Wednesday as spiralling dengue cases has become a cause of concern. Following the development, health minister Raghu Sharma reviewed the fever situation with senior health department officials. Over the past 28 days (September 20-October 18), the state has reported eight dengue deaths. Some 10 dengue deaths have been reported since January. The pace at which the dengue is spreading in the state can be gauged by the fact that out of the 6,797 dengue cases reported since January this year, as many as 4,725 have been confirmed in the last 28 days. This accounts for 70% of cases reported since January 1. Gehlot directed officials to conduct fogging, not only in urban areas but also in villages. In districts where cases are increasing alarmingly, nodal officers will be sent to contain the spread. Till the level of primary health centres, the government is ensuring the availability of medicines to treat dengue. Taking immediate measures, the health minister imposed a ban on the leave of health workers, while asking those who have been transferred to join for duty immediately at their new posting. A 24-hour control room will be established in all districts and rapid response teams formed to fight seasonal diseases such as dengue, malaria, chikungunya and scrub typhus. He asked officials to fix the responsibilities of health officials at the block, district and zonal levels for effective control of seasonal diseases. “Dengue cases are being reported from most of the districts. In 14 districts, dengue cases are more than 150. Jaipur has reported more than 1,400 cases (since January till date) so far. Besides, 10 deaths due to the fever too have been reported,” said Sharma, health minister. In the past 28 days, Jaipur reported 843 dengue cases, followed by Kota (536) and Jhalawar (485).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/with-8-deaths-over-4-7k-casesin-28-days-dengue-threat-for-raj/articleshow/87145497.cms||---

On Monday Shivpal had said in Kalpi, “If my government is formed, 300 units of electricity will be given free of cost to the people” . Attacking the BJP-led government at the Centre and the state government, he said, "Inflation is at its peak. The youths are jobless. Prices of petrol and diesel are skyrocketing". He said all the bridges and the medical college were constructed in Jalaun district when he was the PWD minister. He has appealed to the people of Kalpi to ensure victory of the PSPL candidate in the upcoming 2022 Assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/netaji-will-be-star-campaigner-of-my-party-in-polls-shivpal/articleshow/87145499.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Environment charges for vehicles going to Sinhagad Fort doubled||PUNE: The forest division, Pune, has increased the environment charges for vehicles going to Sinhagad Fort from Rs50 to Rs100 for four-wheelers and from Rs20 to Rs50 for two-wheelers, effective from October 14. The last such hike in environment charges was in 2012, forest officials said. The move comes at a time when the department is mulling introduction of electric bus service by the PMPML from the foothills of the fort, and a dedicated parking facility for all vehicles at the foothills. The department has two toll plazas at Donje-Golewadi village and Kondhanpur-Awsarwadi. “We utilise these charges for security and maintenance of the fort. Since the cleanliness work is more, and managing traffic has become a major challenge, we had to increase the charges,” said range forest officer Pradip Sankpal. Close to 500 people visit the fort on an average daily since it reopened recently. The department has banned plastic bottles on the fort. “We used to collect a large quantity of plastic garbage, which is not good for the environment. We have roped in 30 locals for cleanliness work and crowd control, with proper Covid-19 norms in place,” added Sankpal. On the proposed bus facility, Pune division’s deputy conservator of forest Rahul Patil said, “We are in the last stages of finalising the parking area for vehicles at the foothills. Thereafter, we will be able to run the bus service. It will take a couple of weeks to start e-buses.” Forest officials said many people visit the fort on weekends, and they expect something similar during Diwali as well. Meanwhile, regular visitors to the fort said that hike in environmental charges should be utilised effectively by the forest department. “There is no proper cleaning of garbage at the fort. Also, guards should be placed at all important corners to control the crowd,” said Chaitnya Kale, a regular visitor. Another visitor, Dhananjay Jagdale, said, “Vehicular movement on the road leading to the fort needs to be managed well. Often, visitors get stuck for a long time in traffic congestion.” Sandesh Shinde, another visitor, said, “The department must start the bus facility at the earliest to address the parking issues and traffic issues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/environment-charges-for-vehicles-going-to-sinhagad-fort-doubled/articleshow/87144434.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sewage, dirt latest threats to Powai lake and its crocodiles||MUMBAI: Amidst stiff opposition to its Powai lake cycle track project, the BMC now faces the ire of activists and the BJP on garbage dumping and sewage flow into the waterbody. The concern is that construction activity around the lake and continued pollution would further diminish a waterbody which has already shrunk by 20% over the years, not to speak of harm to its fish and crocodiles. TimesViewInstead of focusing on fancy cycle tracks and beautification, the BMC must first stop the flow of sewage into the Powai lake. Dumping of garbage into the lake must also be stopped, and hyacinth must be removed. Powai lake is one of the largest water bodies in the city, and it's shocking that it has shrunk 20% over the years. The BMC must not undertake any project that will damage the ecology of the place and the habitat of the crocodiles there.The BMC’s priority should be to stop sewage flow instead of undertaking “useless” beautification projects, said Powai resident Shyam Saksena, who was a member of the Powai Lake Rejuvenation Committee. “When an old lady is ailing, you take her to a hospital, and not a beauty parlour. I have obtained RTI facts showing that since 2013 seventeen culverts and drains have been emptying sewage water into the lake. This is why water hyacinths have accumulated there, which remove oxygen from water, harming fauna,” he said. BJP MP from Mumbai North East, Manoj Kotak, recently met BMC chief Iqbal Chahal and senior civic officials to demand scrapping of the ongoing cycle track project, but he agreed that the BMC should first divert sewage lines from the lake. “Garbage too is being dumped into the lake, and not being removed,” Kotak said. Saksena, a retired engineer from the German MNC Siemens, said, “Powai lake has become a sort of cash cow for officials to make a quick buck by awarding small contracts for cleaning and desilting. But dirty water keeps flowing and silting the lake bed. This will kill the lake.” The BMC said it has formed a committee of state environmental experts to frame mitigation measures. “We will divert drainage entering the lake by connecting it to the main sewer line along Adi Shankaracharya Marg. This sewer line was damaged during Metro works and shall be restored soon. After this, sewage will stop entering the lake,” said a civic official. “Also, hyacinth and floating material like garbage will be removed by harvester machines as a regular upkeep measure.” The committee will also provide “guidance and oversight regarding environmental aspects of rejuvenation and reinvigoration of the natural and physical environment of the Powai lake edge project”, said a BMC official. Some activists say the public too should exhibit responsible behaviour. “People throw plastic bottles and wrappers into the lake from the promenade along Adi Shankaracharya Road. This needs to stop,” said environmentalist D Stalin, who is a member of the wetlands protection panel appointed by the Bombay High Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sewage-dirt-latest-threats-to-powai-lake-and-its-crocs/articleshow/87145504.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The notice, sent through their advocate Prashant Patil, also sought an unconditional public apology from Chopra in newspapers and on digital media platforms within seven days, failing which it warned of civil and criminal proceedings against her. Both Kundra and Chopra are accused in a pornographic content case. Last month, he was granted bail by a Mumbai court after two months in jail.

According to officials, the repeated and unexpected rainfall resulted in largescale crop loss to cardamom farmers. The month of October is when the farmers begin to spray pesticides and fertilizers on the crops, but due to repeated rains even during non-monsoon months they are unable to do so. Farmers said that due to continuous rain capsule rot disease, commonly known as ‘azhukal’, is reported at many cardamom plantations and it causes large scale crop loss. Spices Board assistant director V Vijeeshna told TOI that applications for the crop insurance will be called soon. “The Spices Board will implement weather-based crop insurance this year. Many farmers are raising complaints to us that the rains are causing damage to the cardamom plantations and it affects the production and income from the farming. The weather-based crop insurance will provide protection to all natural calamity related damages of cardamom,” she said. Thomas, a farmer from Kumily said that non-seasonal rains caused huge losses to his plantation. “Due to capsule rot disease my hundreds of cardamom plants were damaged. It caused a large income loss to me. We do not know how to manage such issues,” he said. Climatologist Gopakumar Cholayil said the climate related issues mainly affected the farmers. “Due to unseasonal rains the farming calendars are totally changed and it causes large scale loss for farmers,” he said. “Climate change issues are clearly visible in our state. The repeated cyclonic depressions are pointing towards it,” Cholayil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/weather-based-crop-cover-for-cardamom-farmers-mooted/articleshow/87144461.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Pune||Amusement parks gear up to reopen from Friday||PUNE: Amusement parks are putting in place various safety measures to adhere to Covid-19 protocols after the state government allowed them to reopen from October 22. The permission, however, is only for dry parks, not water-based sports or activities. Amusement parks were shut since March 2020 but allowed to reopen later in December till April 2021, and then shut again amid the second wave. Rajiv Jalnapurkar, chairman, Indian Association of Amusement Parks & Industries (IAAPI), said, “The association formed a committee comprising scientists and doctors who came up with specific SOPs for amusement parks in addition to those issued by the government. This is to ensure the utmost safety of our patrons and staff.” According to Jalnapurkar, the guidelines are venue-specific with details on implementing social distancing while retaining the experience as much as possible as many people visit such places with family and friends. Jalnapurkar said many amusement parks have suffered extensive losses in terms of revenue as well as human resource over the past 18 months. “We invest a lot of time training staff with the intention of retaining them, but many quit with parks being closed,” he said. Amusement park managements have also come up with ways to minimise queues at rides and implementing social distancing. Rayomand Irani, COO, Della Adventure and Resorts, Lonavala, said, “Our maximum capacity is 1,000 people, but we will only allow a certain number of people via online and offline sale of passes to avoid overcrowding and congestion on peak days such as weekends.” According to Irani, sanitiser dispensers have been placed around the park. “We are also going to sanitise and clean all common surfaces at regular intervals,” added Irani. Dhimant Bakshi, joint CEO, Imagicaaworld Entertainment Limited, Khopoli, said fully vaccinated customers and those who have taken at least one dose will be encouraged to visit while at-risk people, such as those aged above 65 or below 10 years, and the symptomatic, will be advised to stay home. “We are also introducing ‘virtual queuing’ where guests can virtually join a ride queue through our app and be notified of their turn. This will help regulate customer flow per ride while indirectly minimizing crowding and mitigating any risk. All rides will be frequently disinfected and sanitizers placed at convenient locations,” said Bakshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/amusement-parks-gear-up-to-reopen-from-friday/articleshow/87144446.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

---||Ludhiana||Elections keep needle of city’s water meters stuck||WASTAGE WORRIESLudhiana: The aim of the water meters’ installation project, which is yet to take off, was to keep a check on water wastage. But with the government announcing a flat rate for consumers of above 125 square yards houses, residents may waste water, thereby adversely affecting the groundwater table, which is depleting at a fast pace. In 2016, the water meter policy was adopted in the MC general house, but could not be implemented to date as the then SAD-BJP government kept it on hold due to assembly elections. Even after the formation of the Congress government, it couldn’t start.The civic body has planned canal-based water supply for the residents and work for the installation of a water treatment plant will begin first. This project is funded by the World Bank on a condition that the MC installs water meters and bills be issued on reading. Instead of starting the work, the government has made the announcement. The fund-starved civic body is spending around Rs 135 crore every year on water supply and sewerage system, but recovering only Rs 34 crore to Rs 35 crore. On treatment of every 1,000 litres of water, it spends Rs 40. The officials claimed if water consumption increased, so would the treatment expenses. However, the MC officers are tight-lipped now. Senior deputy mayor Shyam Sunder Malhotra said, “Work on water meters and canal-based water supply is on and will be provided to the residents. If the government has cleared dues, it will find ways to implement other things as well. I will appeal to the public not to waste groundwater even if it is being provided at nominal rates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/elections-keep-needle-of-citys-water-meters-stuck/articleshow/87143431.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Procession taken out despite Covid ban, 3 booked||Kanpur: Police have booked three persons in connection with the Julus- E-Mohammadi procession that was taken out on Tuesday despite a ban in view of the Covid-19 guidelines. This is a very irresponsible act for which legal action has been initiated by registering an FIR against the culprits,said Asim Kumar Arun, Commissioner of Police. “A case has been registered against Chamanganj residents Hayat Zafar Hashmi, Mohammad Sham and Abdul Haseeb under sections 188, 269, 270, 3/4 Epidemic Act, 51 Disaster Management Act in police station Chamanganj, others are being identified,” added CP further. There were some tense moments on Tuesday after thousand of people assembled near the Yatimkhana for the procession were stopped and informed that permission for the procession had not been received yet. Seeing the tension and the crowd escalating, a heavy police force was deployed in the area. The incident took place after a large number of people from the Muslim community came on to the roads and started raising religious slogans. On the information, senior police officials, along with a large number of police personnel reached the spot and tried to pacify them by apprising them about the Covid-19 guidelines. The crowd, however, remained adamant and later started demanding the officials to allow them take out the religious procession. Sensing the gravity of the situation, the police meanwhile tried to convince the people through religious leaders, but the crowd refused to budge from their demand of taking out procession. When some people present in the crowd tried to move towards the Parade, the police personnel laid a siege and stopped them from proceeding ahead. Instead of going towards the Parade, they moved towards the Nai Sadak, amid the religious sloganeering. The procession then moved towards Moolganj and from there later reached Shivala area. As soon as the procession started heading towards Phoolbagh, ADCP Akash Kulhari reached the spot, under whose leadership the police prevented the procession from proceeding further. Later, the crowd of thousands of people moved towards the Rail Bazar area and dispersed. Similarly, despite heavy deployment of police and PAC personnel, the procession was also taken out in the Jajmau area of the city. Initially, the police tried to stop the procession by putting a vehicle, but in vain. Some people from the crowd later reached the Dadamiyan Dargah. Here, too, the crowd later dispersed after being convinced by police. The situation across the city, however, returned to normalcy after about an hour due to the heavy arrangement by the police. All the gates of the Parade Ground were closed with locks and a heavy police force was deployed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/procession-taken-out-despite-covid-ban-3-booked/articleshow/87145525.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation to issue order soon on restaurant timing extension||PUNE: After state government extended restaurant timings till 12am, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is likely to soon issue an order granting permission to eateries in the city to function till midnight. As of now, city restaurants have a closing deadline of 11pm. A senior PMC official said an order for Pune city is likely to be issued as soon as possible. Some restaurants had expressed apprehension after the PMC did not issue an official notification till Tuesday night, though the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation came out with an order granting 12am extension to restaurants in Mumbai from October 19. The PMC official, however, clarified that the state order cannot be diluted and will be applicable to Pune too. Restaurants in the city, as well as patrons, have welcomed the deadline extension. “The last order in Pune will be 11.30 pm once the new deadline comes into force,” Lovely Narang, president, United Hospitality Association, and owner of Food Music Love, told TOI. “It will help us streamline guests during the festive season, ensuring less crowds at any given point. It will also help disperse the crowd over an extended period of time, which always helps in curbing the spread of the infection,” he said. “In addition, the extension will gradually help Pune’s nightlife come back on track. We are thankful to the government for this decision,” said Narang. Vikram Shetty, owner of Sadanand Resort and Sadanand Regency, said it was about time that restaurants got an extension as Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate are well under control. “A bulk of the population has received one or two doses of vaccination, which will help keep the infection at bay. Opening up is the way to go if businesses have to bounce back,” said Shetty. Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers’ Association (PRAHA) said restaurants had earlier got an extension till 11pm. “Now, the closing deadline has been extended further, which will help the industry immensely. During the festive season, people shop till late in the evening and enjoy eating out. The extension will ensure that they dine out without having to worry about placing an early “last order”, as has been during a good part of the last 18 months,” said Shetty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-to-issue-order-soon-on-restaurant-timing-extension/articleshow/87144439.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid wards fill up at private hospitals, some add beds||KOLKATA: The trickle of Covid patients across Kolkata’s private hospitals has gained momentum over last five days since the end of Durga Puja and could be the first indication of a spike in cases, fear doctors and hospitals who are keeping fingers crossed apprehending a sudden jump in the number of admissions over the next one week. While some have already extended their Covid units, several others are planning an extension for the first time since the second wave as beds are being taken up fast. Positivity rate, too, has gone up marginally in some hospitals. The hospitals had reduced the number of Covid beds after the second wave waned. All Covid beds at Belle Vue Clinic were taken up on Monday. The hospital has now extended its Covid ward from a 23-bed one to 47 beds. Twenty of these are critical care beds. “We had less than 10 patients till Saturday. It has shot up to 23 now and we expect the rise to continue over the next one week. So, we have already extended the ward and are ready for further extension,” said CEO P Tondon. Peerless Hospital has 33 patients in its 40-bed Covid ward but expects the ward to be fully occupied by this weekend. “The number of daily admissions has been around 4-5 since the end of the Pujas. Fortunately, the number of discharges has been same so we haven’t faced a shortage of beds yet. But this could change between Lakshmi Puja and Diwali — the period when the impact of the Puja crowding would be evident. We are ready to add an extra ward,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. At CMRI Hospital, its 18-bed Covid unit got fully occupied on Monday. While the number of patients remained below 10 till the Pujas, a spurt in admissions post-puja has seen all beds being taken up. “There has been a rise in Covid admissions. We have 18 patients admitted now and are keeping a close watch on the situation. If required, we might increase the number of beds soon,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO, CK Birla Hospitals. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has 30 Covid beds, of which 22 are now occupied. “We haven’t seen a spurt in patients as yet. In case there’s one by next week, we are ready to add beds,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, the positivity rate of patients getting tested for Covid has shot up to 6%-7% since the beginning of Puja. “Prior to that, it was around 3%-4%,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. At ILS Hospital, the number of patients shot up to 38 on Tuesday from 27 at the beginning of the Pujas. “We have more new admissions lined up,” said ILS vice-president Debasish Dhar. RTIICS now has 29 Covid patients, including nine in critical care. Positivity rate has spiked from around 5% to 10% at Peerless Hospital, said Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-wards-fill-up-at-pvt-hospitals-some-add-beds/articleshow/87144469.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Sharma received an e-mail from the DCB on Tuesday asking him to appear at their office in Delhi. “He will discuss the case with his legal team and decide on the next move of whether he will go to Delhi or file a reply from here,” said a source close to Sharma. This is the second time he has been summoned by the DCB. Sharma is accused in the case filed by Shekhawat on March 25 this year for criminal conspiracy and unlawfully intercepting phone calls. Earlier, the DCB had summoned him on July 26. He had then requested 15 days of time for some personal work. “He conveyed to the DCB that he would appear via video conferencing if the visit cannot be postponed or can send the answers in writing. However, the DCB never responded to him. Since July, the enforcement agency has never approached him in the case,” said the source. Sharma's petition for quashing the FIR is pending in the Delhi High Court and the next date of hearing is January 13. In July, the court had restrained DCB from taking any coercive action against Sharma. “The DCB cannot take any action against him. The move appears to be an attempt to deflect attention of the people from the upcoming bypolls in the state as BJP is struggling in both the seats,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/del-crime-branch-summonscms-osd-lokesh-sharma/articleshow/87145548.cms||---
---||Delhi||A ride to good health: NDMC plans a 3km cycle track near Nehru Park||NEW DELHI: To promote eco-friendly modes of transport, New Delhi Municipal Council has planned to construct a 3km cycle track next to the boundary wall/walking track of Nehru Park. An official said work on the 2m-wide cycle track would start by the end of next month. “The idea is to encourage people coming to the park to cycle for good health. We will merge the cycle track with footpaths constructed at roundabouts, make cycle parking points and crossings and install tabletop crossings to allow smooth movement of visitors at surface parking lots next to the entrance gates. The tracks will be wide enough to allow movement of two cycles simultaneously. We just need to be careful about leaving sufficient space around trees, even if that means diverting the cycle track a bit,” said the official. In October 2020, NDMC had launched its first phase of project “Cycle4Change” and developed a 5km stretch starting from Bikaner House at India Gate to Jor Bagh Metro Station via Lodhi Garden. “The corridor was not much in use during the pandemic, but it has become popular during the weekends now,” said another official. Phase-II of the project included developing an 11km cycling track connecting government housing colonies to offices in and around North Block, South Block, Nirman Bhavan, Central Secretariat and New Moti Bagh. The proposal was submitted to Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) for scrutiny and approval in August. “Recently, we were asked by UTTIPEC to conduct a trial run along with Delhi Traffic Police on the proposed corridor before going ahead with the project. It will be arranged soon,” said the official. Till the time Phase-II of the project gets all permissions for implementation, NDMC has decided to go for a 3km track in the third phase around Nehru Park in Lutyens’ Delhi. There is also a plan to develop a 100-metre jogging track inside the park. Earlier this year, NDMC had constructed a 3km synthetic walking track after receiving complaints of people losing their balance or hurting their knees while strolling in the rocky area in Nehru Park. “We realised that people were also using the track for running, which was damaging the surface. For their convenience, a plan has been made to construct a 100-metre long and three-metre wide running track near the open gym within the park,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-ride-to-good-health-ndmc-plans-a-3km-cycle-track-near-nehru-park/articleshow/87169875.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: Missing since October 12, bodies of Unnao youth, girlfriend found||KANPUR: Panic prevailed on Tuesday when bodies of a missing 22-year-old youth and his 16-year-old alleged girlfriend, both natives of a village under the limits of Bangarmau Kotwali police station area in Unnao district, were exhumed from a paddy field in the outskirts of the village. The bodies of the victims, identified as Balkishan and the alleged girlfriend, were recovered in a badly decomposed state. As per police, the bodies were at least four to five days old, and they are trying to ascertain the exact identity of the victims through DNA profiling, and their exact time of death. Going by the preliminary findings, the investigators said that it appears that the bodies of the couple were burnt by pouring acid. Police also said they are probing all possible angles, including suicide, as cause of death. Family members of both the victims identified them on the basis of mobile phones, slippers and clothes recovered from the spot. The police are trying to procure the call details of both the mobiles and the location after the disappearance of the victims on October 12. Balkishan's father, Chetram, a native of Bhikariapur village under the limits of Bangarmau Kotwali police station of Unnao, said that he had lodged a complaint with the police after his son was severely beaten up by the father and brother of a teenage girl of the dame village in the late evening hours of October 12. “Somehow he escaped and rushed back to his home. After this, on the morning of October 13, while he was going to the fields, the family members of the teenage girl abducted him. Despite a frantic search, no trace of his son was found,” he had stated in his complaint further.He had also expressed apprehension that some untoward incident could happen to his son. On the other hand, the father of the 16-year-old girl had given a complaint in the Kotwali police station accusing the youth of luring and eloping with his daughter on October 13. “Investigations to ascertain the exact time of deaths of the couple are underway,” said CO, Ashutosh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/missing-since-oct-12-bodies-of-unnao-youth-girlfriend-found/articleshow/87145539.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Ludhiana||Water & sewerage dues: CM Channi’s waiver angers those who paid on time||Ludhiana: The residents who cleared all their dues in time are feeling cheated after CM Charanjit Singh Channi waived outstanding water supply and sewerage charges and fixed flat rate for water dues in future. Taxpayers rued these things would discourage people from paying taxes on time and motivate them to wait for the elections to get such rebates. The municipal corporation officials, however, are awaiting notification to check if exemption is announced only for domestic consumers or industrial and commercial consumers as well. The MC’s outstanding water supply and sewerage dues stand at Rs 431 crore. As per the CM’s announcement, consumers of up to 125 square yards will not be charged water and sewerage bills and above 125 square yards will be charged only Rs 50 per month. Recently, the MC had increased water and sewerage dues by 66%. As per the civic body’s revised plan, dues for 126-500 square yards and above were fixed from Rs 2,100 to Rs 3,600 for six months. An official said, “On Monday evening, a resident cleared his outstanding water supply and sewerage dues for the past several years and then this announcement was made. I received a call from him to refund the entire amount. This is not fair for the residents as well as the civic body because people will stop paying taxes on time and MC’s financial health will suffer, affecting developmental works.” He said they will see the notification copy, after which the final picture will become clear. Ravi Arora, a resident of BRS Nagar and businessman, said, “Ideally, the announcement should have been made for those who cleared all their dues in time and they should have been given at least 50% discount for the next bills, but here offenders get a better treatment. Elections are round the corner and more such announcements are expected.” A Sarabha Nagar resident and businessman, Rahul Verma, said, “The politicians are inculcating bad habits in people. Justice should be done with honest taxpayers, and they should be given a refund. Else, people will start believing that they should not pay taxes on time and wait for the election year.” Despite repeated attempts mayor Balkar Sandhu could not be contacted for his comments. Meanwhile, Congress councillor Mamta Ashu wrote on her Facebook page, “I am thankful to Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for providing free power to all rural water supply schemes of the state along with reducing water usage charges to Rs 50 per month for domestic connections of all categories having plot size above 125 sq yards in municipal councils/nagar panchayats and municipal corporations. However, MC revenue would be lost. I request the CM to announce free electricity for municipal corporation tubewells. Because a large chunk of MC funds is used for paying electricity charges for its tubewells. If this decision is taken by the chief minister, it would help in utilising those funds (meant for paying electricity charges for MC tubewells) for other developmental works.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/water-sewerage-dues-cm-channis-waiver-angers-those-who-paid-on-time/articleshow/87143467.cms||---

He also said Congress would not even get a deposit. During an informal chat with reporters here on Tuesday, he said Congress want to only put up a weak candidate to help benefit TRS turncoat and BJP candidate Eatala Rajender. Exuding confidence of the party’s victory, he said the TRS defeated a veteran leader like K Jana Reddy in Nagarjuna Sagar by-election and that Eatala was not a big leader like Jana. “Neither Eatala nor BJP is owning each other in the election though the former minister technically is sailing with the BJP. BJP leaders are saying ‘Jai Eatala’ and not ‘Jai Sri Ram’. Similarly, Eatala is not uttering the BJP word with the fear of losing votes in the election. There are rumours in the political circles that both Rajender and former MP G Vivek will join Congress after some time,” KTR said. While claiming that he was not going to Huzurabad for campaigning as he did not take part even in Dubbak and Nagarjuna Sagar by-election campaign, he questioned why TPCC chief A Revanth Reddy was not going to Huzurabad for campaigning despite the fact that it was his first election after taking over as Telangana Congress head. On KCR’s entry to national politics and federal front, KTR said TRS chief will take an appropriate decision at an appropriate time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ktr-cong-bjp-colluded-to-win-but-trs-will-come-up-trumps/articleshow/87144482.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: CPM leader booked for disappearance of daughter’s child||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Peroorkada police on Tuesday registered a case against local CPM leader Jayachandran and his wife for “forcefully” taking away their daughter’s child, who is missing now. The case was registered a year after their daughter Anupama filed a complaint in this regard. Anupama, 22, an SFI worker, fell in love with the youth wing leader of the party Ajith, a dalit Christian, who was already married. Her parents were not keen on the alliance. Getting a complaint registered against Jayachandran took so long as he was a CPM leader, the couple alleged. Anupama had approached the local police, state police chief, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the child welfare committee, but in vain. The case got registered only after media highlighted the issue. “We are still searching for our child and we are desperately waiting for his return. Today happens to be his first birthday, but we do not have him with us,” Anupama said. Jayachandran, in a TV news channel debate on this issue a few days ago, had said that the child was handed over to the child welfare committee with Anupama’s consent. Incidentally, Anupama, who was also part of the debate, immediately denied giving the consent. Anupama said her parents had forcefully taken away the child and she did not have the strength to resist as she had undergone a caesarean surgery. Incidentally, her husband got legally separated from his first wife in January this year and Anupama and Ajith now live together. agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-leader-booked-for-disappearance-of-daughters-child/articleshow/87144488.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: ‘Low pressure moves away but light rain likely today’||KOLKATA: The city remained cloudy and received multiple spells of rain on Tuesday even as a low-pressure, that has been triggering showers across south Bengal since Monday, moved away towards Bihar. A strong southeasterly wind, however, continued to blow into Gangetic Bengal, carrying in moisture and clouds from the sea. Kolkata received 6 mm rain till 5.30 pm on Tuesday. Under the impact, Kolkata and its neighbouring districts could receive light to moderate rain till Wednesday, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). A heavy rainfall alert has been issued for north Bengal till Wednesday. While some places of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Alipurduar received heavy rain on Tuesday, parts of Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri could be lashed by a heavy downpour on Wednesday, according to a IMD bulletin. The rain could continue in Darjeeling and Kalimpong on Wednesday. The city witnessed three more house collapses across north and Port areas between Monday evening and Tuesday morning.In Kolkata, the rain remained restricted to repeated spells of drizzle and rarely got heavy. “With the low-pressure moving away from Gangetic Bengal, the rain intensity was low. But southeasterly winds continued to fetch clouds that made the showers continue. We expect the rains to stop by Wednesday, though thunderstorms may still occur in some south Bengal districts,” said an RMC official. Several places across coastal districts of South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore received a heavy downpour throughout Tuesday. Bakkhali, Saagar Island, Digha and Shankarpur were drenched by continuous rain. Even though it rained since Monday afternoon, no major waterlogging was reported in Kolkata. According to KMC sewerage and drainage department, the intensity never crossed 10 mm an hour. That saved the city from inundation. “Going by rainfall pattern recorded by our major drainage pumping stations, the intensity was much less compared to that of the end-September rain that had caused waterlogging across large areas,” said an official. Accumulated rainfall recorded by KMC showed areas like Belgachhia, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Kidderpore, Ballygunge, Behala received over 40 mm rain in past 24 hours. But, since the intensity was less, even low-lying areas like Muktarambabu Street, Amherst Street, Camac Street, Behala and areas off Bypass could escape flooding. Three houses collapse in 24 hrs The city witnessed three more house collapses across north and Port areas between Monday evening and Tuesday morning. Though a car was partially damaged, no one was injured in any of these incidents. The police said the major incident was reported from Burtolla when a three-storey dilapidated building located on Hemendra Sen Street (in pic above) collapsed around 10.30am on Tuesday morning. No one was staying at the house. The house collapsed and fell on an adjoining garage of a multi-storied building. The second incident was reported thirty minutes later from Ward 25 in Girish Park when the first floor balcony of the three storey building on Gour Mohan Mukherjee Street collapsed. The third incident took place on Monday night at Kabitirtha area of Kidderpore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/low-pressure-moves-away-but-light-rain-likely-today/articleshow/87144485.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The court reasoned that while the act of holding hands did not reflect any sexual intent, there is cogent evidence to show that the accused used criminal force by pulling the hand of the girl. “The accused had knowledge that such acts will amount to outraging the modesty of the victim,” the special Pocso court said. The accused has been in jail since November 12, 2020, and his sentence will be set off against the period of detention undergone by him during investigation and trial. While the accused was also booked for touching the minor’s body inappropriately, he was acquitted of those charges. ‘Girl felt bad and informed her mother about bewde uncle’Sentencing a man to a year of rigorous imprisonment for pulling the arm of his 8-year-old neighbour, a special Pocso court said that the accused had knowledge that such acts will amount to outraging the modesty of the victim. As far as the accused touching the chest of victim, there is no cogent evidence on record. There is material variance in the evidence and statement of the victim before the police, metropolitan magistrate court and also in the history narrated at the time of medical examination,” the court said. It further said there was no evidence on record to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed sexual assault and caused sexual harassment. The court added that as far as the act of pulling the girl's hand, there is consistent and cogent evidence and it has gone unchallenged.The accused was also fined Rs 10,000, out of which Rs 8,000 will be given to the child as compensation. While the maximum sentence for outraging modesty is two years imprisonment, the court said that considering the nature of offence, age of the accused (31) and that his mother is dependent on him, a year’s sentence will meet the ends of justice. Among the four witnesses was the child, her mother, a neighbour and a police officer. The child told the court that the incident took place at 8.30 pm. Referring to the accused as “bewde uncle” (drunkard uncle), she confided in her mother. The father confronted the accused and then went to the cops. The neighbour told the court that on the day of incident he had seen the accused very drunk, hence, asked him to go home. Relying on the witness statements, the court said, “The evidence on record reflects that the accused was in an inebriated state at the time of incident. The accused pulled the hand of the victim and the victim felt bad and therefore she immediately informed her mother and the report came to be lodged.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-girl-felt-bad-and-informed-her-mother-about-bewde-uncle/articleshow/87146218.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Visakhapatnam||Maoists face leadership crisis as top guns age||VISAKHAPATNAM: With virtually no fresh recruitment and fast dwindling support of villagers in the last few years, the Maoist Party is in leadership crisis. According to sources, 15 of the 24 members in the party central committee and politburo are over 60 years and recent pandemic coupled with vector-borne diseases in the jungles has further weakened the extremists. The recent death of Akkiraju Haragopal alias RK has added to the crisis. Though the leadership baton was passed on to Basavaraj from Ganapati two years ago, the outlawed extremist group has been struggling. There has been no replacement to the Maoist leaders and cadre killed in encounters or due to ailments. While six members of the central committee and politburo died, two others had surrendered to the police in the last six years leaving a big vacuum. Moreover, eight members of the 20-plus central committee, and four of the 12 politburo members are believed to be undergoing treatment for various health issues. Sources said there is no potential second-rung leadership in all stages of the organisational setup. It is estimated that the Maoist Party once had more than 20,000 armed cadres and around two lakh militia members across the nation. Now it has come down to less than 7,000 armed cadres and a few thousand militia members. Student wings like Radical Students’ Union (RSU) and Radical Youth League (RYL) and farm labour committees have no support base. Information gathered by intelligence agencies recently indicates that there were only 18 central committee members now as against more than 35 in 2010. A few members were inducted 18 months ago to increase the number to 24. The highest body in the Maoists party, the politburo, has only 12 members as against 20 a decade ago. Central Committee leaders Akkiraju Haragopal alias RK of Andhra Pradesh, Ravula Srinivas alias Ramanna, and Haribhushan of Telangana, Dev Kumar Singh alias Aravind of Bihar, Narayana Sanyal of Bengal, Sridhar Srinivasan of Tamil Nadu and Purledu Mukherji of Bengal died in the last six years. Central committee members including Oggu Satwaji alias Sudhakar and Jeenugu Narasimha Reddy alias Jampanna surrendered. Around 10 Maoists' top guns, including the new chief Namballa Kesava Rao alias Basava Raj are in both politburo and central committee. Ten of the top Maoist leaders are from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Police statistics show Maoists had around 350 to 400 armed cadres in Andhra-Orissa border along with around ,2000 to 3,000 militia members. But the number has now come down to less than 100. “There is no quality recruitment though the Maoists had some recruitment with uneducated tribals who would not sustain long. Cops are now reaching communities in villages. They are also carrying out focussed operations,” Visakha rural SP B Krishna Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/maoists-face-leadership-crisis-as-top-guns-age/articleshow/87146219.cms||Siva G

According to the businessmen, the daily increase in fuel rates is hitting the industry hard. In a meeting on Tuesday, the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) office-bearers and members urged the Centre to take steps to control the price rise and reiterated their old demand of bringing both the fuels under the GST regime so that they can at least claim the tax paid on the high-value purchase.FICO chairman KK Seth said, “In just six months, the rates of petrol and diesel have shot up by about Rs 15 per litre in the city. In April, the petrol rate here was around Rs 92 per litre, which at present is Rs 107.50 per litre. The price of diesel at that time was Rs 83 per litre and it has now climbed up to Rs 97.30 per litre. This is an alarming situation for the industry, as our business and personal expenses have taken a huge hit due to the incessant hike.” FICO president Gurmeet Singh Kular said, “Fuel prices are rising at record speed and the worst sufferers are businessmen as there is a huge requirement of petrol and diesel in several industrial processes, like running power, machinery and commercial vehicles. Even a single paisa increase in the fuel rates costs us dear and there has been a Rs 15 to Rs 20 hike in six months! The government is silent on the issue, letting the petroleum companies have a free run.”The association general secretary, Rajeev Jain, said, “If the government cannot bring down the prices or fix them for a certain period, then it should at least bring petrol and diesel under the GST regime so that we can claim the taxes paid on their purchase.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/fuel-price-hike-hitting-industry-hard-bizmen/articleshow/87143477.cms||---

While the police caught two members of the gang, two others managed to give the police the slip by hurling a crude explosive at them. The operation was conducted by the officials of the city narcotic cell and Karamana police. The arrested gang members, include Rajeesh, 22, and a teen, who is suspected to be under the age of 18. The age of the teen is being verified. Five kilograms of ganja, a small quantity of synthetic drug, MDMA, three air pistols and two machetes were seized from them. According to the police, the gang was hiding in Killi Tourist Home at Killipalam under Karamana police station limits. The police searched the lodge as part of a vigil against drug mafia in the wake of some recent violence between drug peddling gangs. The two youths jumped from the third floor of the building after hurling the explosive and distracting the police officers. A search is on to track them down. The police suspect that the gang might have been in a conflict with some other gang and hence kept the weapons with them for protection. Narcotic cell assistant commissioner Sheen Tharagil led the operation and Fort assistant commissioner S Shaji and Karamana station house officer inspector B Aneesh were also in the team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/two-drug-peddlers-arrested-from-city-lodge/articleshow/87144493.cms||---

---||Kanpur||SIT releases photos of lynching suspects||Bareilly: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the Lakhimpur Kheri violence released six photographs of suspects who had allegedly ‘lynched’ three BJP workers after Union MoS for home Ajay Mishra’s son’s convoy allegedly mowed down farmers at a protest site there on October 3.  It has also announced cash rewards -- without mentioning the amount -- for information about the suspects and assured that the identity of the informers will be protected. The pictures released by the SIT show a few men with sticks and black flags in their hands near burning vehicles. Sources said police are trying to ascertain whether the attack on the BJP convoy was ‘intentional or an act of retaliation’. Meanwhile, many called the posters a violation of rights and something that may put these men at risk. Human rights activist Trilochan Singh Gandhi said, “Sharing pictures of the farmers publicly without even knowing their names or without having any evidence to link them to the violence may put them in harm’s way. A few of the suspects might actually be the ones who were carrying out the rescue work after the violence. Everyone was angry and it was visible on the faces of most of the farmers present at the spot, but it doesn’t mean that everyone is a criminal.” SN Sabat, additional director general, Lucknow zone, however, said, “It is a legal process which we normally follow in all other cases as well.” Bareilly: The four aides of Union MoS Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra, who were arrested by the SIT on Monday, were sent to 14-day judicial custody being produced before a remand magistrate on Tuesday evening.They were arrested in connection with the killings of four farmers and a journalist on October 3. Sumit Jaiswal, who got a cross FIR registered against farmers is a key accused as he was seen coming out of the Thar SUV in a video that had gone viral In the FIR registered against the protesters by Jaiswal, he admitted that he escaped from the spot after protesters attacked his vehicle. The other three accused were identified as Shishupal, who was allegedly driving the third SUV (a white Scorpio), Nandan Singh Bisht and Satya Prakash Tripathi. The SIT is yet to recover the white Scorpio or identify its owner. Senior prosecution officer SP Yadav told TOI, “All the four accused have been remanded in judicial custody till November 2. Our application seeking their police custody will be heard on Thursday as the lawyers have called a strike on Wednesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sit-releases-photos-of-lynching-suspects/articleshow/87145556.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vaccine footfall drops at private CVCs||KOLKATA: Number of vaccine recipients has dropped sharply across the city’s private hospitals post-festival. The decline has been sharper than the last one in September and has left private hospitals worried even as a spurt in admissions has been reported this week. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), that would record between 500 to 600 doses till two weeks before the festival, has seen a steady drop in numbers as Durga Puja approached. “We are getting about 120 to 130 recipients over the past three days,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (east), Narayana Health. First, it was a change in government policy to restrict private hospitals from conducting off-site inoculation camps that had led to a reduction in private CVC footfall. Later, the government opened more state-run CVCs to offer the vaccine free that reduced the turnout at private CVCs. Medica Superspecialty Hospital, that was vaccinating close to 5,000 recipients a day in June, July and August, now has only about 40 to 50 recipients trickling in for the jab. “The drop in footfall started from August-end. Now, we are administering around 60 doses a day. Due to this drastic dip in footfall we have closed our vaccination centre at the Jadavpur stadium and the drive is being carried out only from the hospital premises,” said Medica Group chairman Alok Roy. Before the Puja, around 70 to 80 recipients were taking the jab at Fortis Hospital daily. After the festival, around 10 are turning up a day. “This was bound to happen as the number of people who would purchase the vaccine shrinks. And now most are second dose recipients,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. The AMRI Hospital group used to administer 5,000 to 6,000 doses in June-July. The count has dropped to 450-500 doses. Currently, all three units put together are vaccinating between 100 and 150 recipients a day. “The drop in vaccination is majorly due to massive drive being done by government, NGOs and private organizations. The festive season and the rains are other reasons,” said Debasish Dhar, group vice president, ILS Hospitals that is seeing about 40% drop in its CVCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccine-footfall-drops-at-private-cvcs/articleshow/87144494.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Nagpur||Celebrate but vaccinate: New mantra ahead of festivities this year||Nagpur: With a very few number of Covid-19 cases and almost no deaths even after Ganesh Utsav and Navratri festivals, the pandemic is turning towards endemic in Vidarbha region. Markets, cinema halls and restaurants are opening up like pre-Covid conditions, making people enthusiastic about celebration of Diwali, the biggest festivity of the year. This has led the city health experts to come up with the next level of precautions for the common people ahead of the festival. They said vaccination is important, so “celebrate, but vaccinate”. “I think, 1 % positivity rate in the population of 25 lakh is acceptable. Ours is very less. So, instead of waiting for zero case which is impractical and impossible theory, we must move ahead now,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. According to him, better idea is to find out unvaccinated pockets and target them to achieve at least 90% coverage. “Children under-10 years of age are largely safe. They are mixing up and playing together since almost two months but not many cases were detected. I think outdoor mingling has no problem at all,” said paediatrician Dr Vijay Dhote, who is the president of Academy of Pediatrics (AOP), Nagpur. Physicians said that Covid-19 is no more deadly for healthy people. “The cases coming in last two months are not manifesting any serious kind of disease. Patients require general care and they are recovering in home isolation. If your health parameters are fine and you have taken both doses of vaccines, there is no need to fear during festivities,” said general physician Dr Mahesh Shah. Those who have pre-existing health complications must take additional care, said doctors. “Having blood sugar, hypertension and other conditions can bring you to hospital in case you get infected with the virus. People with comorbidities must take vaccine. Elderly people also must complete their vaccine schedule at the earliest,” said geriatric care specialist Dr Nilay Vishwakarma. Doctors have suggested people should wear masks and wash hands frequently, not due to Covid-19 fear but as a part of hygiene habits. “Masks may protect from the air pollution that rises during Diwali. Washing hands saves us from many bacterial infections too,” said paediatrician Namrata V.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/celebrate-but-vaccinate-new-mantra-ahead-of-festivities-this-year/articleshow/87144521.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Kolkata||Immersion in Hooghly dips by 30% this year||Kolkata: The Hooghly river saw around 30% reduction in the immersion of Durga idols, thanks to the localised immersion of some idols this year. Immersions had concluded on Monday. According to sources, nearly 1,700 big idols were immersed in the Hooghly this year, down from 2,400 idols immersed in 2019. KMC officials and cops said that around 3,500 immersions — both big and small idols, including those from housing societies — took place in the Hooghly this year. This figure would have been much more, had the 2,000 idols not been immersed in seven large ponds across the city. But, environmentalists said the need of the hour was to move towards zero idol immersion in the Hooghly and other rivers to stop pollution. Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) laid synthetic liners in the ponds so that the paints and sludge of the idols could be lifted out immediately after the immersions, before they mixed with the water. Green crusader Subhas Datta, whose long legal battle forced the KMC and KoPT to withdraw the structures of idols immediately after the immersion, said, “Since Durga Puja involves religious sentiment, religious leaders should come forward to save the Hooghly by dissuading Puja organisers from immersing the idols in the Hooghly.” “I am in favour of introducing an award for puja committees that can complete immersion in the most eco-friendly way. Why would such a great festival not be a champion of ecology?” asked Datta, who keeps monitoring the immersion after the festival every year. “The conditions of our rivers are deteriorating. Bengal has a high number of dying or dead rivers. Immersion only accelerates the process of decay. Despite stricter regulations of CPCB, the immersion heightens river pollution,” said Naba Dutta, secretary Sabuj Mancha, which launched the statewide river rejuvenation movement. Lead and chromium are toxic even in very small quantities for human beings. These heavy metals can enter the stomachs of human beings through food chains and leave harmful effects on health. The immersion of idols poisons the water by increasing acidity and the content of heavy metals. Heavy metal pollution caused by idol immersion can damage the ecosystem as it kills fish, affects plants, blocks the natural flow of the water, causing stagnation. It damages the health of human beings by polluting the drinking water sources, thus causing breathing problems, blood and skin diseases, said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an environmental activist. National Mission for Clean Ganga banned immersion in the Hooghly and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 for violation of order. “Adequate arrangements should be made for designated idol-immersion sites within the municipal area or banks of the Hooghly... ,” the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/immersion-in-hooghly-dips-by-30-this-year/articleshow/87144530.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Sawant offered clarification to the question by Goa Forward Party MLA Vijai Sardesai who had sought to know if the controversial bill will be allowed to be lapsed. “The government should give a clear answer about the status of the bill,” Sardesai had said. No sooner than the bill was tabled in the House in July when the state witnessed one of the shortest sessions of Goa legislative assembly in recent years, the issue snowballed into a huge controversy. Though the Sawant government was confident of the bill’s smooth passage, it subsequently gave up realising that public opinion had turned against it, with the proposed new legislation being perceived as the tool to marginalise sons of the soil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bhumi-bill-with-law-dept-wont-be-sent-to-guv-for-assent-cm/articleshow/87144536.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||When even 90%+ can’t help you make the cut at Delhi University||NEW DELHI: For Konica Jha, studying BA (H) political science at Hindu College was a long-cherished dream. However, despite a 95% in her Class XII board examinations, she couldn’t secure a seat in her dream college this year. Soaring cutoff marks at Delhi University (DU) have left several students in the 90-95% bracket dissatisfied as they were unable to get into their preferred colleges. “In the first cutoff, I was clearing the cutoff for Kalindi College for political science. So I decided to take admission there. This was not my first choice, but there is nothing that can be done now,” Jha said. “All other colleges have cutoffs as high as 98% and 99% even in the subsequent lists and the colleges where I was making the cut with my marks were not too highly ranked,” she added. Many others said that despite scoring high marks in their board examinations, they had to settle for lesser ranked colleges as the most popular colleges had sky-high cutoffs. Mohit Rally, a DU aspirant with 95.6% in his boards, said, “Though I wanted to be a student of Hindu or Hansraj college, I had to settle for Rajdhani College as the cutoffs everywhere else is very high. I am displeased with my current admission, and still looking for more options under the subsequent lists.” With a 95% in her boards, Shubha Gupta had hoped to secure admissions into a North Campus college. However, she has not been successful yet. “I took admission in Janki Devi Memorial College, but my dream was to study in a North Campus college. The cutoffs are so high that it is becoming impossible. However, I am still looking forward to a better option,” Gupta said. Lavi Bharti, who scored 92%, echoed Gupta’s views. “I have enrolled myself into Mata Sundri College, but will wait to see if the subsequent lists offer a better option,” she said. Several students also said that following the declaration of the board results, they anticipated that DU would have high cutoffs and had, therefore, taken admissions in other universities. Gurliv Kaur, who scored 96.25%, said, “I always wanted to study in one of the top 10 DU colleges. But once the results were out, I realised that I will not get through psychology in the best colleges — be it LSR or Gargi. The cutoffs in the first list itself went up by a couple of percentage points. So I decided to take admission in Christ University where I will be pursuing psychology.” DU released the third cutoff list last Saturday for admissions to undergraduate courses. Many courses are no longer being offered in the more sought-after colleges, and even the available courses continue to have high qualifying bars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/when-even-90-cant-help-you-make-the-cut/articleshow/87144555.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Agra||34 dead as record rains lash U'khand, trigger floods||Nainital/Dehradun: As unprecedented rainfall battered Uttarakhand, drowning houses and people, precipitating floods and washing away bridges, the official death toll climbed to 34 on Tuesday, with the worst-hit district of Nainital recording at least 18 casualties. Several people have been reported missing, sparking concerns that the actual toll is likely to be higher. In fact, information that TOI gathered from local officials in each district suggested at least 40 deaths in the state in the past two days. Nainital additional district magistrate Ashok Joshi said the toll in the district could be as high as 27. “We have received information of many people trapped at multiple locations. Our teams have been sent to all these areas but due to the weather conditions, rescue operations have been very difficult,” he said. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami to take stock of the situation. The Centre has assured Uttarakhand of all required assistance to handle the situation. Later in the day, the chief minister announced an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh for the kin of the victims. “Till now we have information about 34 deaths and five people are missing. We will give Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia to the next of kin of the deceased people. A compensation of Rs 1 lakh will be given to owners whose houses have suffered damage,” the chief minister said, adding that compensation for loss of cattle would also be doled out. Several tourists were stranded at various locations around Nainital on Monday, including 100 that were stuck at a resort in Ramnagar. The premises of the resort and its parking lot were flooded after water from the swollen Kosi river entered the property. Many others who had travelled to hotels and homestays in Bhowali, Mukteshwar and Ramgarh for the long weekend were stranded with no power supply or network connectivity. A tourist stuck in Bhowali along with five others said the area had no electricity for hours. “People are hoarding rations and we are not sure when we will be able to move out. The roads are closed and there is no information on who should be contacted for supply of essentials,” he said. Electricity supply throughout the Kumaon region was affected with Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) confirming that six of its sub-stations were submerged. “Our engineers are working but it is difficult. In Champawat as well, power supply has been affected,” said UPCL managing director Deepak Rawat. The CM cancelled all his programmes for the day, including a visit to the national capital. Instead, he visited the Disaster Management Control Room in the state secretariat and interacted with the district magistrates. He directed authorities to prepare and hand over a report on the losses caused to farmers by incessant rains. Dhami, along with DGP Ashok Kumar, later conducted an aerial survey of the rain-hit belts in Garhwal and Kumaon. After reviewing the situation, the CM said, “The calamity has caused major losses. I have been going to the affected areas and meeting people. Tourists who are stuck are being taken to safer locations.” (Inputs by Pramod Dalakoti)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/34-dead-as-record-rains-lash-ukhand-trigger-floods/articleshow/87143534.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Kochi||Ernakulam administration all set to handle water flow from Idukki dam||KOCHI: The district administration has completed all preparations as water from the Cheruthoni dam in Idukki is expected to reach Aluva-Kalady area by 12 in the midnight. The water reached Neriyamangalam around 5.30pm on Tuesday. Officials expect that water flow from Periyar to Vembanad Lake will be smooth if there is no rain at night. Meanwhile, district collector Jafar Malik has issued an order suspending the functioning of all quarries till Sunday in the wake of an orange alert issued by the India meteorological department in Ernakulam on Wednesday and Thursday. He has also asked authorities concerned to evacuate people from landslide-prone areas identified by the geological survey of India and Kerala disaster management authority. People from 43 places will have to be shifted to safer places. Traffic movement in hilly regions has also been restricted from 7pm to 7am, except for emergency situations. Public have been advised not to park their vehicles near waterbodies in hilly regions as chances are high for flash floods and landslides. Vehicles should also not be parked under the trees. On Tuesday, Idamalayar dam released 4.4 million cubic metre (mcm) water from 6am to Periyar River. The powerhouse in Idamalayar generated 1.5 million units (mu) of energy as against 1.65mu on normal days. Both the machines in the powerhouse operated in full scale. “We will continue to release the water until an order is issued by the district collector. Water in the dam is 165.62m at 5pm,” said an official in the dam. Hydrology officials, who were examining the flow of water in the Periyar River, recorded no rise in water level after the release of water from Idamalayar dam. “There are no flood possibilities in Aluva going by the current situation. But we have taken all emergency measures, including setting up relief camps,” said a revenue official in Aluva. District officials said people should be vigilant as heavy rain and flow of water from canals and other waterbodies might change the current situation. Water level at the point near Marthandavarma bridge was .935m at 6pm, while the flood warning level at this point is 2.50m. Water level at Mangalapuzha point was 0.78m at 6pm while the flood warning level is 3.30m. Water level in Kalady was 2.1555m at 6pm and the flood warning level here is 5.50m. In view of the Orange alert, 13 fishing boats have been moved to Aluva for rescue operations in case of any emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/district-admn-all-set-to-handle-water-flow-from-idukki-dam/articleshow/87143549.cms||---
---||Nagpur||HC slaps Rs50k cost on N Kumar’s firm for delay in filing case||Nagpur: Coming down heavily on a city based private firm — N Kumar Projects and Infrastructure Limited for filing a petition, three years after the civic agencies took action against it for defaulting the municipal tax, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has slapped Rs50,000 fine on it. “We find that contentions which are now being raised for the first time by the petitioner before this court cannot be heard. On this ground alone, this petition to the extent the contentions are not specifically pleaded, deserves to be dismissed,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said. The firm was told to deposit the amount into account of the ‘High Court Legal Services Sub-Committee’ within two weeks, failing which, this petition would be again put up before the same bench for further orders. The petitioner questioned action taken by civic bodies for realization of municipal tax, which was demanded from it at the enhanced rate. As it failed to pay the tax, a warrant of attachment of its property was issued on June 26, 2018. Prior to it, demand notices were also issued to the firm but its office-bearers failed to respond. The petitioner then challenged the respondents’ action in HC this year, contending that it neither issued any notice nor it had received any. “The facts and circumstances pointed out that the petitioner has agreed to respondents’ action in assessing and levying municipal tax by enhancing “annual rateable value” and therefore, the petitioner cannot question the same. We, therefore, find that there is no substance even in the submission that no notices were issued to it,” the judges said before dismissing the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-slaps-rs50k-cost-on-n-kumars-firm-for-delay-in-filing-case/articleshow/87144551.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Activists object to MahaRera nod for housing project in Navi Mumbai||Mumbai: Environmentalists and citizen activists in Navi Mumbai have objected to state housing regulatory authority MahaRera’s decision to register a building project, which they claim is inside a protected wetland. Last month, MahaRera issued a registration certificate to a project called ‘Infinite Residency’ proposed by developer Mistry Constructions at Navi Mumbai.“You are requested to kindly withdraw the above registration immediately before any third-party interest is created in this project,” said Sunil Agarwal, a local resident, in a letter to the authority. Agarwal had earlier dragged the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) to court for allowing construction on wetlands. Cidco claims these water bodies are not wetlands. When contacted, a MahaRera official said the project was registered based on permissions granted by Cidco. “Cidco passed the building plans and sanctioned a commencement certificate. The complainants can file an objection with us if they can prove that the registration has been obtained fraudulently,” he said. The official said MahaRera in the past has cancelled registrations of several projects for submission of incorrect information. In November 2017, the Wetlands Grievance Redressal Committee had stopped dumping of soil in wetlands in this specific area. In April 2018, the Bombay high court asked for removal of dumped soil from the same pockets after an inspection by Jayrame Gowda of the state Mangroves cell. “In January 2020, the environment minister himself stopped work in these pockets when more than 700 trees were cut,” the official said . Three years ago, TOI had reported on a golf course and a residential project planned on a large water body surrounded by mangroves next to the NRI Seawoods Complex in Nerul. It sparked outrage among residents and environmentalists. Cidco’s controversial plan to award the 35.5-hectare project—the size of four Oval Maidans—to the builder was later challenged in the high court, which struck down the project. The high court order had also directed Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation and the state to preserve mangroves, wetlands and lakes in the satellite city. The order came on two PILs filed by Navi Mumbai Environment Preservation Society (NMEPS) and local resident Sunil Agarwal. They had sought protection of lakes, wetlands and mangroves. Subsequently, Cidco and Mistry Construction Company Pvt Ltd filed an appeal in Supreme Court, which stayed the high court order. “The SLP is pending for hearing,” said activists. Local sources said the value of the plot is in excess of Rs 400 crore. “Out of 35.55 hectares integrated golf course project, 34 hectares are wetlands. It is pending before Supreme Court, and still the project is being allowed to go ahead in a balance area of approx. 2.5 hectares,” they said. Said environmentalist D. Stalin: “This registration is in complete disregard of the orders of the high court and Supreme Court, which have expressly banned reclamation of wetlands and construction on them.” TOI tried to reach out to the developer, but the firm could not be contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/activists-object-to-maharera-nod-for-housing-project-in-navi-mumbai/articleshow/87146249.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Kanpur||SP will be my first choice if coalition is formed: Shivpal||Jhansi: President of Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party Shivpal Singh Yadav said that the BJP governments, both at the Centre and in UP, have failed to fulfil their promises they had made to the people. If any coalition is formed before the UP assembly elections, the Samajwadi Party will be his first choice, Shivpal said. He was addressing a press conference on Tuesday after a stopover for the state-wide ‘Samajik Pariwartan Rath Yatra which arrived here on Monday night. He said his ‘yatra’, which had started from Mathura, would culminate in Ayodhya. “Time has come to change the present inefficient government in UP. The aim of our ‘yatra’ is to create public awareness against BJP. We are ready for coalition with the like-minded parties to form a non-BJP government in UP. We are doing a survey of the state and will be fielding our candidates accordingly. It is sure that whichever party gets our support will form the government in the state”, Shivpal said. Hitting at the BJP for being anti-farmer, Shivpal said he has his full support for the agitating farmers. “In the name of privatisation, BJP is only benefiting the rich. The MSP is not giving any benefit to the farmers”, he said. He also flayed the BJP led government at the centre for its foreign policy due to which India’s relations with the neighbouring countries have soured. When asked about the reasons for parting away from the SP and forming a new party, Shivpal said, “I have given my forty years to the Samajwadi Party, helping the party to reach great heights, and I never wanted to part away. But with changing circumstances, I formed a new party with the blessings of Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav) whose blessings are with me”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sp-will-be-my-first-choice-if-coalition-is-formed-shivpal/articleshow/87145592.cms||Arindam Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid-wary families worship Lakshmi sans priest||KOLKATA: This year saw a Lakshmi Puja with a difference as many households chose to go ahead without a priest and performed the rituals on their own. Yet others decided not to bring home a new idol as they preferred to worship the old one to avoid visiting the markets. With the Puja tithi (timing) commencing on Tuesday and coming to a close by Wednesday afternoon, most of the people chose Tuesday to worship the goddess of wealth. Many homes in the city, especially those with senior citizens, chose to continue with last year’s trend of worshipping the goddess without a priest. Some people got their idols delivered at home from Kumartuli this year while they ordered the Puja items for home delivery from local ‘dashakarma bhandar’. Rita Dey, a resident of Madurdaha, who works in the HR department of DPS Newtown, will be doing the Puja on her own without a priest this year too. “There are many things I am no longer using like the nouka, which had to be bought from the store, to stock Puja items. But I wanted to keep it as safe as possible,” she said. Aparna Majumdar will be assisting her mother-in-law in the Puja as the Garia family will not call the priest this time, too. They have decided to worship the small brass idol, which they have at home, instead of bringing any clay idol. Businesswoman Sanchita Chatterjee, who deals in leather exports, felt that by doing the puja on her own, she has personalised it and is enjoying much more. Ushashi Bhattacharya, radio programme officer of Vidyasagar University, said, “The Puja without a priest makes me feel like attending to a guest with the best I can offer.” Kumartuli artisans said at least 60%-70% of the idols had been ordered online. “People looked at WhatsApp pictures, mentioned budgets and ordered idols,” said Babu Pal, secretary of the Kumartuli Idol Makers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-wary-families-worship-lakshmi-sans-priest/articleshow/87144557.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The government after discussion with affected parties and if they are willing, will file a joint affidavit in the Supreme Court, Sawant said during Question Hour, responding to the question tabled by Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte. Already meetings have been had with the affected parties, he said. “Since the appeal is pending in the Supreme Court, the consultations were held with people who are directly set to be affected by the highway expansion in Porvorim,” Sawant told the House. He said the affected parties had raised two to three issues, including expansion in FAR. The government will not go ahead without their confirmation. The affected parties went to court since their requests were rejected by the local authorities, Khaunte said. He also sought to know the nature of compensation that would be paid to people affected by acquisition of land for a link road at Mopa as well as stretch of the road at Porvorim. Three villages in Pernem are set to be affected by the proposed link road. They have been tilling the land for several years, and their demand is they should be compensated with land at an alternative site. He said in some cases, land belongs to comunidade and present day tenants—offsprings of original tenants—who do not have documents in their name to show their ownership rights. Regarding Mopa residents, Sawant said the process to pay compensation has started, and land owners were being paid as per prevailing rates. “People who lost their houses will be rehabilitated,” he said. As regards to tenants in Porvorim, he said they should submit whatever documents, including title documents, that reflect their ancestors’ name as tenants, and their case will be considered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/grievances-on-natl-highway-expansion-will-be-resolved/articleshow/87144554.cms||---

The byelection to Gandhinagar division to be held within a month’s time will set the ball rolling for the power play. While the UDF opposition tries hard to wrest the seat from the LDF, the ruling front chalks out plans to retain it at any cost. The byelection to Ernakulam south division, to be held in a few months, will add to the tug of war. As per the UDF’s plans, if the front wins both the byelections, it can be seen as a mandate for wresting the power from LDF in the corporation. As of now, the ruling LDF enjoys the support of 36 councillors, including independents. While the UDF has the support of 32 councillors, including independents and an LDF rebel, BJP has four councillors. Of the council with a strength of 74, two seats are now vacant due to the demise of K K Sivan of CPM, the councillor from Gandhinagar, and Mini R Menon, the BJP councillor from Ernakulam south division. “We will win byelections to both the seats. Then, our strength will go up to 34. Some of the independents who now support the LDF have promised to join us once we win the byelections. So, our effort is to win both the seats,” a UDF leader said. Though Gandhinagar has been a stronghold of the CPM, the majority was just a little more than 100 votes when the Sivan won from the division in 2020. The majority of Poornima Narayan of the CPM, who won from the division in 2015, was more than 1,200 votes. So, there had been a dip of more than 1,000 votes. This is a major factor which worries the LDF leadership. Moreover, LDF is yet to decide its candidate, while the UDF candidate P D Martin, a known face in the area who has been active in the politics for the past four decades, has already started campaigning. According to sources with the LDF, a former councillor, who repeatedly suffered defeat from neighbouring divisions in the past two local body elections, is an aspirant for the seat.  “If he is the candidate, CPM will lose the seat,” a strong supporter of the CPM from the division said. If the UDF is able to wrest both Gandhinagar and Ernakulam South divisions, the front will go ahead with their plans to capture power in the corporation. At the same time, the LDF leadership also made it clear that the front will start poaching UDF councillors to retain power if the opposition tries to sabotage the ruling front.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-to-witness-political-tussles-as-bypolls-near/articleshow/87143558.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Officials said the mentoring curriculum included various aspects of STEM higher education, including the availability of course choices, entrance exams, examination patterns, preparation needed for the entrance exams, resources available for preparation and financial aid schemes provided by the government. Officials said, in a survey conducted before the programme was launched, it was found only 38% of the girl students had a holistic idea about the timelines and their target examinations. A government spokesperson said, after implementation of the programme, this number had gone up to 91%. At the event, Sisodia said, “Our education system has perfected its ability to cater to the top 5% of our students. But you and I need to work hard to make sure that all 100% of our children have the opportunity to fulfil their potential. I urge all of you to motivate your friends to become mentors.

The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was 69, as against 46 on Monday. However, experts said the good effects of rain were over and air quality could deteriorate to “moderate” to “poor” category on Wednesday. With Delhi and the neighbouring states receiving good rain, pollutants were washed out. However, the pollution level started rising on Tuesday morning. According to Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) data, 14 monitoring stations were in the “good” category at 9am on Tuesday, but not a single one of them remained in the same category by 7pm and five entered the “moderate” category. VK Soni, head, environment and research centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “Northerly winds prevailed over the region on Tuesday. However, as northwesterly winds are expected on Wednesday, the pollutants released from stubble burning will become favourable for transportation to Delhi. Around 550 fire counts were recorded by Indian Agricultural Research Institute through satellite imagery. The air quality is likely to deteriorate to moderate to poor category on Wednesday and Thursday.” System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, the forecasting body under Union ministry of earth sciences, said the impact of stubble burning was low on Tuesday. Its bulletin said, “Local land surfaces are wet, so dust re-suspension is the minimum and this has led to low PM10. Presence of western disturbance has led to scattered rainfall over north India, so there is low biomass burning. This condition has improved AQI with low PM2.5. With dry conditions and wind direction mainly from the northwest, AQI will degrade in Delhi.” CPCB had on Monday enforced certain measures under the “poor” to “moderate” category of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) as air quality was predicted to touch the “moderate” to “poor” range between October 21 and 24. The sub-committee, formed by Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region for the operation of GRAP, had given the suggestions after reviewing the meteorological and air quality forecast. While an AQI reading of 50 or below is classified as “good”, readings between 51 and 100 fall in the “satisfactory” category. Those between 101 and 200 are classified as “moderate”, while “poor” air ranges from 201 to 300, “very poor” from 301 to 400 and “severe” from 401 to 500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/too-good-to-be-true-rain-benefits-start-wearing-out/articleshow/87144568.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: After 5 years of renovation, Yadadri temple to reopen on March 28 next year||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s dream project — the refurbished Yadadri Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple — will be reopened to devotees on March 28, 2022. The renovation of the temple had begun about five years ago. KCR on Tuesday announced that the temple would be thrown open to people after performing ‘Maha Kumbha Samprokshanam’ on that day. A week prior to that, Sudarshana Maha Yagam and other rituals would be performed on March 21.KCR, who went around the temple complex for nearly six hours on Tuesday, inspected the ongoing renovation. The CM said muhurtham for the temple reopening was fixed by Chinna Jeeyar Swamy. At the reopening ceremony, over 5,000 to 6,000 Ruthviks along with another 3,000 to 4,000 priests from Tirumala, Bhadradri and other major temples across the country would perform the rituals. KCR said invitations would be extended to seers from various mutts and peethams across the country. The renovation of the temple had begun about five years ago.KCR said the government had also decided to provide gold coating to the main temple ‘Vimana Gopuram’ on the lines of Tirumala hill shrine. “For providing gold coating, it was estimated that 125 kg of gold worth Rs 60 to Rs 65 crore is required. The gold would be purchased through the Reserve Bank of India. Since we need a huge quantity of gold, it was decided to accept donations from individuals and organisations. I am donating one kg and 16 tolas of gold,” the CM said. KCR said many people were also coming forward to donate money for construction of cottages on the temple premises. He hoped that the Yadadri temple would attract several lakhs of devotees on the lines of Tirumala. The CM inspected the works on special doors at the main entrance done by Pembarthy artisans. He discussed with the officials on construction of Gandi Cheruvu, Pushkarini, Kalyana Katta, Deekshaparula Mandapam and Satyanarayana Vrata Mandapam, etc. He specially examined the Narsimha Swamy Kalyana episode drawn in the Tanjore style of painting. Temple architect and Sthapathi Ananda Sai explained to the CM the progress of work. When temple archakas requested for sanction of house sites for them, the CM instructed minister Jagadish Reddy and Yadadri district collector Pamela Satpathy to allot plots for the priests and employees as the decision had already been taken. The CM also instructed officials that all those who lost shops during construction of ring road should be given 1,000 square ft shops free of cost near the Kalyana Katta complex. He said no one dependent on the temple for generations should be left high and dry. Later, the CM personally handed over the hand-written muhurat letter of Chinna Jeeyar Swamy to temple executive officer N Geetha Reddy and asked her to place the letter at the lotus feet of the deity.

The first set of this train had arrived at the end of the last month. The new metro train set will now be assembled and parked at the depot constructed at polytechnic ground near Gurudev crossing. Both the metro trains will be utilised during the trials, which will commence from mid of November. This metro train also has three coaches like the previous one. For the priority corridor between IIT and Motijheel, eight metro trains will ply. While two of them have arrived, six more trains shall come to the city by January 2022. A total of eight metro trains will run on the nine kilometre long corridor stretch. Each train has a capacity to accomodate over 900 passengers. For the first time, it could be noticed that the metro train is orange and grey in colour. Meanwhile, the work on the priority corridor is going on at a rapid pace and is nearing completion so that the trial and then the final launch of the metro services could be held as per the schedule. While, the work at metro stations is almost coming to end and now finishing work is still going on, installation of signalling system is also almost complete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/second-set-of-metro-train-reaches-city/articleshow/87145606.cms||---

Credit for the triumph goes to the team’s middle order, with Neelam remaining not out in the entire tournament. She scored an unbeaten 14, 79, 31 and 56 in the four innings. During the quarterfinal match against Punjab, Uttarakhand was at 34/5 on the scoreboard; and it seemed unlikely that the team would reach the semi-finals. However, Bhardwaj’s scintillating knock of 79 helped chase the target. The teenager, a resident of Ramnagar, lives in a slum, inhabited mostly by daily wagers, near the local railway station and has gone through severe financial struggle. Her father used to work as a daily-waged labourer in a ply factory. He died on duty in an accident, which took place a day before the first Covid-19 lockdown was enforced in March 2020. After her father’s death, her mother was forced to work as a domestic help in posh localities of the city. Bhardwaj’s coach Mohammad Israr Ansari, who has taken care of her career and finances since she was 8-year-old, told TOI that Bhardwaj made her state U-19 debut when she was about to turn 12-year-old. “I took her to a selection trial camp in Doon where organisers refused to let her participate because she was not even 12 but after seeing her bat, they gave her a chance and a few days later, she was a part of the Uttarakhand U-19 team. She has already made her debut in the state senior women’s team but didn’t get enough chances,” said Ansari, who is a coach at a local cricket academy. Ansari added, “I have guided her since she started playing cricket. I even asked local businessmen, politicians and others to extend a helping hand but no one has provided any significant help.” “It is a major achievement for the state. The knock which I played against Punjab is my most memorable cricketing memory since at one stage we were down and out. Even the final is special,” Bhardwaj said. She added, “My mother used to work but she stopped because she has some health issues. Our family’s expenses are taken care of by my coach Israr.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-teen-brings-home-first-ever-domestic-trophy/articleshow/87143561.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Bareilly||Lakhimpur Kheri ‘lynching’: SIT releases suspects’ photos||BAREILLY: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the Lakhimpur Kheri violence released six photographs of suspects who had allegedly "lynched'' three BJP workers after Union MoS for home Ajay Mishra's son’s convoy allegedly mowed down farmers at a protest site there on October 3. It has also announced cash rewards -- without mentioning the amount -- for information about the suspects and assured that the identity of the informers will be protected. The pictures released by the SIT show a few men with sticks and black flags in their hands near burning vehicles. Sources said police are trying to ascertain whether the attack on the BJP convoy was "intentional or an act of retaliation". Meanwhile, many called the posters a violation of rights and something that may put these men at risk. Human rights activist Trilochan Singh Gandhi said, “Sharing pictures of the farmers publicly without even knowing their names or without having any evidence to link them to the violence may put them in harm's way. A few of the suspects might actually be the ones who were carrying out the rescue work after the violence. Everyone was angry and it was visible on the faces of most of the farmers present at the spot, but it doesn’t mean that everyone is a criminal. It is a violation of human rights and we will raise this issue.” SN Sabat, ADG (Lucknow zone) said, “It is a legal process which we follow in normal cases as well. It is not a violation of human rights, and releasing the pictures won’t put them at risk." A senior member of SIT told TOI, “We have identified a few suspects. We can’t call them anti-social elements as they are only suspects at the moment. People sharing their details or whereabouts will be rewarded and their identity will not be shared with anyone. We questioned nine farmers on Tuesday and they were sent back home.” Police had lodged an FIR against unidentified protesters under sections 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons), 336 (rash or negligent act to endanger human life) and 302 (murder) of the IPC for the lynching of the BJP workers on a complaint by BJP worker Sumit Jaiswal. Jaiswal, along with the Union minister’s son Ashsih Mishra, is also an accused in a case filed by farmers. Sources said Jaiswal didn’t mention the fact that his SUV had run over farmers following which the crowd retaliated. Four farmers died and at least 12 others sustained injuries in that incident; a few of them are still in hospital. The SIT had earlier summoned over 50 farmers and nearly 20 of them have been questioned since Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-sit-releases-photos-of-suspects-involved-in-lynching-of-3-bjp-men/articleshow/87143556.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nagpur||Portion of under construction Pardi to Kalamna flyover caves in||Nagpur: A portion of the under construction Pardi-Kalamna flyover in east Nagpur collapsed on Tuesday evening. Reports said some 10 girders of the bridge between two columns fell near Mahakalkar Sabha Gruha near Bharat Nagar Chowk on Kalamna ring road. No casualty was reported at the project being built by National Highways Authority Of India (NHAI). A team of city police and Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fire and emergency services had reached the spot on getting information. Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar said, “Legal action would be contemplated if NHAI lodges a complaint. Local corporator Pradip Pohane too reached the spot and told TOI that the portion of the bridge collapsed at around 9.20pm. “The flyover portion collapsed just after an autorickshaw drove under it with six passengers,” said eyewitness and local NCP leader Ravinish Pandey. Eyewitnesses told TOI there were no casualties as the road beneath the flyover was closed for vehicular movement. The traffic was closed recently to speed up the flyover construction work. Only vehicles on service road along the flyover were allowed below it, said local residents. “It seems the bearing on which the bridge stood must have broken. If you see, the bridge has caved in, it has not broken. We will investigate the fault. It is too early to say anything now. The bridge was constructed two years ago,” NHAI project director NL Yeotkar said. A local resident, Paramjeet Singh Kalsi, said construction of the flyover portion between Kalamna and Gomti Hotel Square was almost complete. Kalsi had earlier raised the issue of substandard flyover construction work by private firms. The project is part of five flyovers of 6km length costing Rs650 crore by NHAI, which is being constructed by GDCL-SMS. The foundation stone for the project was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. After missing several deadlines, recently NHAI had claimed the project will be ready by 2022. Since work commenced, the multi-wing Pardi flyover project was always in the news for wrong reasons. Steel rods of a pillar for the flyover near Pardi had bent over in the past. The slow work and ill-maintained road beneath the flyover has also led to many road accidents, claiming many lives. Pandey claimed a blacklisted company was allotted work here due to political support and nexus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/portion-of-under-construction-pardi-to-kalamna-flyover-caves-in/articleshow/87144573.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Goa||Oppn focuses on poor roads, says govt has no control over contractor||Porvorim: The deteriorating condition of the national highway from Patradevi to Canacona took centre stage for 30 minutes during Question Hour in the assembly on Tuesday. Since the four-laning work has begun, several motorists have either died or been maimed. Independent MLA Rohan Khaunte put the government on the spot with PWD minister Deepak Pauskar finding it difficult to give a satisfactory reply.  “The highway work started in 2016. Since then roads have turned so bad there is no guarantee you will return home safely. While people are suffering, there is no control over the contractors doing the work. No engineer is willing to take any responsibility,” Khaunte said. Quoting the report of the ministry of road transport and highways, Khaunte said that in 2019, 3,440 road accidents were recorded in the state. Of these, 1,160 were due to bad road conditions leading to 66 deaths. Khaunte added that the contractors have been given a free hand, so much so that they pay no heed to complaints lodged. Even when elected representatives want to point out corrections in the highway work, no one listens to them, he said. While Pausakar came under fire over the haphazard state of the roads, his replies were limited to how the work is divided into three packages involving three different contractors, and that site inspections are carried out every month. Pauskar said the road work from Patradevi to Mapusa will be completed by December. The issue of rehabilitation of people whose land was acquired has been settled. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had to intervene after Khaunte complained that the PWD minister did not reply to the question on quality of work. Sawant said two contractors were issued show-cause notices. The government had also written to the national highway authority of India, and the ministry of road transport and highways. "The defect liability period has not ended since the work is ongoing. Contractors will have to correct all defects before project handover. The project will be completed in December,” Sawant said.  His reply failed to impress members leading to an uproar in the House with members demanding a half hour discussion on the condition of roads but it was declined. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat asked whose responsibility it was to maintain roads during expansion works. “Is it that of the contractor or PWD?” he said. The chief minister said the contractor is responsible for maintenance and it will be directed to repair the roads under flyovers on a war footing before November 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-focuses-on-poor-roads-says-govt-has-no-control-over-contractor/articleshow/87144559.cms||---

The e-fraud took place at 1.20pm on September 20, when the victim, Sunil Shinde, was at work at a Cidco site in Karanjade village in Panvel taluka. Hence, a FIR was registered at Panvel City police station on Sunday, after a month-long probe by the police. As per the FIR, the fraudster told Shinde that it was the last day to redeem his credit card reward points. The conman sent Shinde a text message with a link to a bogus website. Once Shinde filled in his credit card number and confidential three-digit CVV code on the website, Rs1.88 lakh was immediately debited from his account. Shinde realised that he had been cheated and blocked his credit card after informing the bank’s customer care about the fraudulent transaction. A police source said clicking on the fake website might have given the fraudster remote access to the victim’s mobile data, enabling him to access the OTP for the fraudulent transaction of Rs 1.88 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/man-duped-of-rs-rs-2l-on-promise-of-credit-card-reward-points/articleshow/87146257.cms||George Mendonca

---||Agra||Jail-themed restaurant proposed outside Mathura jail||Agra: A jail-themed restaurant outside Mathura jail premises similar to the one run by Tihar Jail in Delhi may come up soon if the authorities give the approval for it. The restaurant will serve food prepared by prisoners. The idea was proposed by the Uttar Pradesh Apradh Nirodhak Samiti, a semi-government organization, with an aim to provide employment to rehabilitate inmates after their term ends and to let people have a glimpse of the life inside. If approved, the restaurant will be the first such facility in UP. Chairman of the samiti Umesh Sharma said he has sent a proposal to the effect to the director general (prison) and the additional chief secretary (home) for an approval. “People are curious about life inside a jail and many want to taste prison food due to astrological beliefs,” he said. Once the restaurant is operational, priority will be given to hiring convicts who have served their full term. The profit will be used for rehabilitation of the prisoners and they will also get a salary while working for the restaurant, he added. In keeping with the jail theme, the entrance of the restaurant will be designed like a prison gate and the interiors will comprise prison cells with dining tables and chairs. “Handcuffs, waiters in prisoner’s uniforms, red lights and other fixtures will be added to give an authentic look of the jail,” said Sharma. The project, estimated to cost Rs 25 lakh, will also have a home delivery system. Jail superintendent Brijesh Kumar confirmed that Sharma had discussed this proposal with him on October 2 and the same had been sent to the higher authorities for approval. Sharma said Mathura is the best district to launch such a project as it attracts people from across the world due to its association with Lord Krishna, who was also born in prison. He hoped that once this project is approved, it can be introduced at other prisons as well. Many such initiatives have been taken across jails in the country. Delhi’s Tihar has been running such a restaurant since 2014. In a Kerala jail, inexpensive food and bakery items are sold through cafeterias or distributed through mobile vans. The Burail jail in Chandigarh offers a wide range of food items which can also be ordered online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/jail-themed-restaurant-proposed-outside-mathura-jail/articleshow/87143573.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

They were arrested in connection with the killings of four farmers and a journalist on October 3. Sumit Jaiswal, who got a cross FIR registered against farmers for the alleged lynching of three BJP workers, is a key accused as he was seen coming out of the Thar SUV in a video that had gone viral, purportedly from the Kheri violence site. In the FIR registered against the protesters by Jaiswal, he admitted that he escaped from the spot after protesters attacked his vehicle. The other three accused were identified as Shishupal, who was allegedly driving the third SUV (a white Scorpio), Nandan Singh Bisht and Satya Prakash Tripathi. The SIT is yet to recover the white Scorpio or identify its owner. Senior prosecution officer SP Yadav told TOI, “All the four accused have been remanded in judicial custody till November 2. Our application seeking their police custody will be heard on Thursday as the lawyers have called a strike on Wednesday.” When TOI asked a senior member of the SIT the junior Union home minister will be summoned for questioning as the Thar SUV was registered in his name, the official replied, “The minister is not an accused in this case yet, and we are not going to summon him as of now. Investigation in both the FIRs is going on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/4-aides-of-union-mins-son-sent-to-14-day-judicial-custody/articleshow/87143570.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The medical gap analysis helps healthcare providers to determine the areas in need of upgrades within the prevailing system. In other words, it identifies and defines the prevailing healthcare issues and gives clarity on the discrepancies between the current healthcare system and the desired outcome. It will also help in appointing an adequate number of doctors, other staffers. Vikas Dhakane, additional commissioner, PCMC, told TOI, “We are auditing the primary and secondary hospitals via the private agency to identify the current status of the medical sector in the twin towns. Our primary observation is that the development of the medical sector, geographically and demographically, is uneven. Hence, one could easily see that the newly developed areas like Charohli has almost no medical facilities whether private or government.” National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers’ norms provide insights into the medical services required for a particular population. “We are planning the medical need for the city for next one year, five years and 10 years. The plan will also provide key findings for the next 20 and 30 years needs for the civic body,” he said. The medical gap analysis, according to Dhakane, will save a lot of time, energy and finances for the civic body in the future needs as well. “Since we will have a readily available plan for the medical infrastructure, our spending will be streamlined and will offer multispeciality services for the citizens,” he said, adding that the government institutions can leverage the private sector and expand their capacity for service delivery and training for better medical services offering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-opts-for-medical-gap-analysis-to-improve-facilities/articleshow/87144584.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Woman installs app on father-in-law’s mobile to spy over asset row, caught||HYDERABAD: In a bizarre case that initially had cops in splits, a 79-year-old man approached the cybercrime team saying his daughter-in-law was spying on him. Initially doubting his claim, cops began probing and to their surprise found the woman had installed a call recording app in the man’s phone and linked it to her email. As a result, recorded phone conversations were getting mailed to her. The complainant Vaikuntham is a businessman from Karimnagar who has four sons. But he along with his wife lives with the family of their 45-year-old second son in Karimnagar. For the past few years, his second daughter-in-law, a 40-year-old housewife, started pestering him to distribute his property among his four sons so that she and her husband could live separately. However, Vaikuntham and his wife did not agree to divide the property. “A few months back, Vaikuntham noticed that his second daughter-in-law was making sly remarks referring to private conversations he had with other family members over the phone to which she was not privy to. Vaikuntham initially suspected that she might have overheard him talking over the phone,” cyber crime assistant commissioner of police KVM Prasad said. A few months back, Vaikuntham and his wife moved to their elder son’s house in Begumpet and before reaching the city he kept a few valuables in an almirah and hid the keys at a secret spot in the house after discussing with his son. “Recently, when Vaikuntham and his wife returned to Karimnagar and opened the almirah, they realised that a few valuables were missing. They informed about the same to their son in Hyderabad and a complaint was lodged with us without mentioning what was missing. When we verified the phone, a call recorder linked to the email of the victim’s second daughter-in-law was found in the phone,” said the ACP. “Alleging that without his permission, his daughter in law and son had installed the app in his phone, the complainant requested us to take legal action,” Prasad said. Police registered a case under section 43 r/w 66, 66-C of the IT Act and has launched an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-instals-app-on-dad-in-laws-mobile-to-spy-over-asset-row-caught/articleshow/87146251.cms||---

While in 2015, the tarballs appeared on Goa’s coast on different days in 13 such instances, in 2021, 12 cases of tarballs landing on the beaches have been reported, that too in a single day. As per the reply tabled by environment minister Nilesh Cabral in the state assembly, 33 cases of tarballs having appeared on Goa’s coast have been reported since 2015. After 12 such cases in 2015, the incidence came down, with four cases in 2016, two in 2017 and one each having come to light in 2019 and in 2020. However, in 2021, the tarballs returned to the state’s beaches like never before. In a single day on September 12, tar landed on 12 different beach stretches in the state from North Goa to South Goa. The tarballs left the beaches of Mandrem, Arambol, Morjim, Keri, Ashvem, Calangute-Baga, Caranzalem, and Miramar scarred in North Goa. In South Goa, the beaches of Velsao-Cansaulim and Cavelossim were affected. Cabral has stated in his assembly reply that the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) has pointed to a report by the National Institute of Oceanography. As per the report, the origin of the tarballs appearing on Goa’s coast has been identified as the high seas off Mumbai. “The state has its own state oil spill disaster contingency plan. The Board had communicated the same to the department of environment and climate change, Goa, regarding the publications of NIO scientists indicating the source tracing of tar balls to Bombay High region,” Cabral has said. Earlier, Cabral had already announced that the state has written to the Union environment ministry, asking it to address the issue. As the tarballs appear to be originating from a region beyond the state’s control, the Goa government has asked the Union ministry to step in. As per the reply tabled in the House, GSPCB has said that it already has a plan in place to clean-up and for remediation of the tarballs that surface on Goa’s beaches. However, the Board has said that the issue of prevention of tarballs appearing on Goa’s beaches will have to be addressed by the state oil spill crisis management group committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/this-year-sees-highest-reports-of-tarballs-after-2015/articleshow/87144585.cms||---

Fed up with the nuisance and angry over authorities’ inaction, residents want stricter punishment for offenders. Residents say the already-narrow lanes become more congested due to wrong parking. Also, it becomes difficult for them to manoeuvre turns. They say vehicles are parked in no-parking zones and still no one acts against such offenders. “I commute from Race Course to Rajpur road every day for work. Most stretches on the route are narrow. And with vehicles parked on both sides, navigation becomes tricky,” said Manish Bohra, a tax consultant. Residents feel people do not pay heed to no-parking warnings put up at several places. “We have a designated underground parking. There are several no-parking notices outside the complex and still people choose to ignore those. Repair work further aggravates the situation during peak hours. Officials need to start taking strict action against all offenders,” said Rashmi, a manager at a food outlet at MDDA complex. A shopper at Paltan bazaar, another chokehold point in the city, said it is simply easier to run errands this way. “I have never had an issue with parking my car outside any shop. We quickly finish off our errands and leave. Everyone in the city does it this way,” said the man. It’s not only commuters who suffer, shop owners, too, are at the receiving end as they say their businesses have taken a hit as people avoid stopping by establishments that lack parking space. “We have lost many customers as they prefer going to shops where parking space is available. Something needs to be done about the parking situation,” said Rajendra Virmani, a clothing store owner at Rajpur road. Gridlocks are often witnessed at Ghantaghar, Dilaram chowk and Great value crossing. Maintaining that traffic department is acting and issuing around 50 unauthorised parking challans on an average per day, Swapn Kishore Singh, superintendent of police, traffic, said, “Our teams act against offenders. We resort to traffic diversion around bottlenecks or construction sites.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/haphazard-parking-chokes-doon-roads-residents-call-for-action-against-offenders/articleshow/87143578.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

These were the findings of a study undertaken by seven organisations across four countries and led by Icrisat. The study, which involved nearly 1,000 children, adolescents and adults, studied the benefits of six different types of millets — finger, pearl, sorghum and a mixture of kodo, foxtail and little millets. The participants consumed millets for period ranging from 21 days to 4.5 years. The reviews were conducted from October 2017 to April 2021. “The researchers found that millets increased haemoglobin levels by as much as 13.2%. Four studies in the review also showed serum ferritin increasing by an average of 54.7%. Ferritin is an iron containing protein in the blood and is a clinical marker for iron deficiency,” Icrisat said. The research also showed that various methods of processing millets can increase the amount of iron bioavailability. For instance, millet snacks made by extrusion increased bioavailable iron 5.4 times, while fermentation, popping and malting more than tripled it. Commenting on the findings of the study, S Anitha, the study’s lead author and senior nutritionist at Icrisat pointed out that millets can provide all or most of the daily dietary iron requirements of an average person. “Although the amount of iron provided depends on the millet variety and its form of processing, the research clearly shows that millets can play a promising role in preventing and reducing high levels of iron deficiency anaemia,” she said. Stating that 1.74 billion people were anaemic in 2019, Dr Jacqueline Hughes, director general, Icrisat, said, “The need for a solution is critical, and therefore bringing millets into mainstream and government programs is highly recommended.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/millets-can-help-fight-anaemia-icrisat-study/articleshow/87144891.cms||---

Parents said that many schools are trying to arm-twist them by stopping online classes contrary to the HC order. “Health of our children is our priority,” said Venkata Sainath K, joint secretary of Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA). There are more than 32 lakh students studying in over 10,000 private schools in Telangana. “In Hyderabad, hardly 40% of students are attending primary classes, while it is about 70-80% for high school students in private schools,” said S Srinivas Reddy, honorary president of the Telangana Recognised School Management Association (TRSMA). The numbers in the districts were even lower, he said. “Not even 15-20% primary students are attending physical classes. In high school, about 40%-50% of students are present,” he said, adding that schools were yet to start buses. “While Covid is the main reason, a rise in dengue, typhoid and mystery fevers have only added to the pressure on parents about safety,” Venkata Sainath added. The budget school managements, which have been pressing for reopening schools as they could then charge the full fee, are hoping for better attendance after the Dasara break. The managements said that the parents would have to send children to school if exams were made must and there was no possibility of automatic promotion. “(For the Dasara break) Many private schools were planning to close only for three to four days and then continue with classes. With children sitting at home for nearly 18 months, we decided to continue with classes keeping in mind the loss in learning,” said TRSMA president Shekhar Rao Y.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-bat-for-e-classes-as-pvt-schools-mount-pressure/articleshow/87144824.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

At a meeting organised by ReAct Asia Pacific — a city-based AMR advocacy group — on Monday, over 50 experts from health, health, veterinary, agriculture, pollution control and environment sectors discussed the possible impact of AMR in health systems. “Antibiotic misuse, lack of clean water and sanitation, and inadequate infection prevention & control are major drivers of AMR in Telangana. There needs to be a multi-sectoral plan to contain AMR in the state,” said Dr T Gangadhar, technical adviser to the Telangana government and professor at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences. Dr Gangadhar suggested that some of the mechanisms put in place for Covid-19 response can also be utilised for AMR surveillance. It was pointed out at the meet that, at present, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi have come up with their own action plans while Telangana needs one on an urgent basis. “It is also very important that different people working on ground — both in human and animal health sectors — routinely share data on AMR to address the issue at large,” said Dr Anuj Sharma, Technical Office (AMR, Infection Prevention Control & Labs) at WHO country office for India. The experts called on the Telangana government to consider prevention and control of infectious diseases, both in communities and healthcare settings of humans and animals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-emphasise-on-need-for-amr-action-plan-in-state/articleshow/87144879.cms||---

They ended the protest only after the chief minister Pramod Sawant assured to intervene. The house was adjourend till 2.30pm Dhavalikar continued to protest even after the adjournment and when most members and officials had left the House. Sawant, who was among the few to leave the House last, saw Dhavalikar sitting and requested him to discontinue his protest. Sawant summoned legislative secretary Namrata Ulman and told her that she ought to have been present in the House till the grievance of MLAs was settled. At the beginning of the House, Dhavalikar had raised objections after his calling attention notice on Sanjivani sugar factory was converted into zero hour mention. Dhavalikar said it was not justifiable that discussion on an important issue such as the functioning of Sanjivani sugar factory, was pushed to zero hour. He said he tried to raise the issue in the last session as well, but it was not allowed. Later, it was agreed that one of the two calling attentions listed for discussion during the day, would be dropped to allow that of Dhavalikar. The two-day session ended on Tuesday, the last sitting of the Seventh Goa legislative assembly prior to polls which are expected early next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dhavalikar-gaonkar-protest-over-sugar-factory-functioning/articleshow/87144602.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Can civil engg prof teach AI? Old hands pushed to teach new tech||Hyderabad: Skewed demand for core engineering courses due to introduction of emerging technology courses has hit the faculty members from disciplines such as mechanical, electronics and electrical hard. Faculty are now compelled to upgrade their expertise to teach computer science engineering (CSE) related courses. This year, the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTUH) gave a big push to emerging technology courses by adding additional number of seats to accommodate the growing demand. Niche courses such as those within the CSE streams such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data sciences were some courses introduced. “We are being asked to undergo various development programmes for emerging technology to be able to teach computer science students. Colleges are not keen to continue courses in core disciplines and are instead focusing only on computer science branch,” said a faculty member from a private engineering college in Medchal. Teachers rued that colleges have introduced courses without evaluating the number of faculty they have to teach them. “Due to this, many are now building pressure on faculty members from core disciplines to upgrade their skill-set for AI, ML, data sciences and other emerging technologies. In some colleges, teachers are being asked to leave on grounds that there is no demand for them,” said Aineni Santhosh Kumar, president of Telangana Schools Technical Colleges Employees Association. However, JNTUH officials say that faculty members should look at it in a positive way. “Today, even in mechanical engineering, there are additional courses such as 3D printing, additive manufacturing that come under emerging technology. Various sectors are transforming and adopting AI/ML. The idea to upgrade the faculty members is not to let pull down core disciplines but to equip faculty members with additional skills as per industry demands,” said JNTUH registrar, Manzoor Hussain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/can-civil-engg-prof-teach-ai-old-hands-pushed-to-teach-new-tech/articleshow/87144670.cms||Preeti Biswas

In some cases, such calls have led to inter-state efforts following which senior citizens have been reunited with their families. Of all calls received by the helpline, around four per cent are said to be rescue. As many as 336 elderly citizens have called on the helpline seeking rescue of whom five have been successfully reunited with their families. Among those rescued is 65-year-old Shardamma Balram Kamsani from Hyderabad who was taken to Mumbai on the pretext of visiting Shirdi Saibaba temple and abandoned there. She was living with her sister’s family. Her sister’s son left her at the highway near Sion, after they deboarded the bus. “After reaching Bombay, they alighted and told Shardamma to wait, making her sit at a bus stop on the highway. They assured her that they will come back soon but left that place. She waited throughout the day, from 8 am till night but they didn’t turn up. The local patrolling police team found her on the highway. They took her to Sion police station in Mumbai and recorded a video,” said B Shailaja, director department of disabled and senior citizens. On seeing the video, the Telangana team swung into action and ran all background checks, visited Mumbai, shifted her to a temporary shelter, counselled the family which finally arrived in Mumbai to take her back. “This was the first ever experience of an interstate reunion for all of us. We have seen quick action and prompt response from all stakeholders to make it possible. We also got support from Sion police, staff of Manav Seva, NIA and Elder Line in Maharashtra,” Shailaja added. In another case, 65-year-old Taruni Devi Paul from Bokaro was found lying on the roadside in Nimboliadda area in July this year. She had come to Hyderabad with just a bag full of vegetables after being rebuked by her family. A passer-by dialled the elder helpline number — 14567 — to inform about her condition. This was followed by a visit from a field response officer (FRO) who found her with stitches on her hand and unable to move. She was shifted to the Pain Relief and Palliative Care Society in Kukatpally. Later, she told the FRO about her family and expressed her wish to go back. An effort to trace down the family was launched and her family was traced. Of all calls received by the helpline, around 4% are said to be rescue.

This despite the earlier high court order on August 31 clearly saying that schools must provide online classes to all students who did not wish to come. In 26,285 government schools in the state, more than 20 lakh students are studying in classes 1-10. “Though content is available through TSAT app, students wouldn’t know what they need to watch without a schedule. This is a major reason why many are forced to attend physical classes in government schools,” said Revathi P, a government teacher. Unlike earlier, students were left to fend for themselves from September 1 when schools reopened as the state stopped releasing schedule of digital classes telecast via Doordarshan and TSAT. While the content uploaded during the pandemic was on TSAT website and app, teachers said that it was highly impossible for children to search and learn on their own. According to teachers, attendance in primary schools was comparatively more than in higher classes. “About 2 lakh to 3 lakh students of class 6 to class 10 are not attending physical classes as hostels are yet to reopen. So, attendance in primary schools is a little higher,” said teacher Chava Ravi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-school-students-left-sans-online-option/articleshow/87144845.cms||---

The deceased Kanu Vadhiya had gone to answer nature’s call around 9am on the bank of the river passing near his village. Vadhiya went to fetch some water in the bucket from the river when a crocodile grabbed Vadhiya’s leg and pulled him into the river. People near by saw Vadhiya being pulled away, but they could not dare to rescue him. Vadhiya’s body, floating in the river, was fished out in the afternoon. Police said that he may have died of drowning and not because of crocodile’s attack. “There were no injury marks on his body except his leg, so there is a possibility that he may have died due to drowning,” said a cop. Forest department officials said that at least four to five crocodiles have been sighted in the river after the monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-pulled-away-by-crocodile-dies/articleshow/87144120.cms||---

AI and ML can help students from the manufacturing sector to future forward towards disruption in the industry,” said Rajesh Khosla, president and CEO of AGI Glaspac. Other industry experts area concerned that the push for IT courses may eventually result in an imbalance in various sectors. “If engineering colleges lose focus on traditional engineering courses, we fear that in years to come, students may not even seek admissions in core disciplines resulting in a shortage of engineers with core expertise,” said one expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/balance-must-to-boost-graduate-employability/articleshow/87144689.cms||---

Wait a bit longer||Vadodara: Not just the citizens, even the ruling BJP seems to be disappointed when it comes to the pace, or lack of it, of work on the longest flyover to be built inside a city in the state. The construction work of the flyover has been delayed by a couple of years. The project was supposed to be completed by the end of 2020. When the project got cleared in 2017, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) took pride in the fact that it was the first municipal corporation in the state to execute the longest flyover to be built within the city limit. But the hiccups and hurdles that the project faced too were unique. The BJP members and citizens alike were looking forward to timely completion of the project. The city BJP was hopeful that work on the flyover would get over before the end of 2020, when the civic polls were scheduled. But the flyover was not completed even by early this year, when the rescheduled polls were held. Now, it is expected that work on the project will get over by June 2022 if the work is done on war footing. “Since the present board took over the VMC, the deadline has been extended to September 2022. But we are working hard to ensure that it is completed by June 2022, two months before the scheduled deadline,” said VMC standing committee chairman Dr Hitendra Patel. Officials attribute the multiple delays to the Covid-19 lockdown as well as the extensive shifting of service lines and underground cables. “The drainage and water supply lines that had to be moved. Also, there were cables of various other agencies that had to be shifted. This cost us a lot of time,” said VMC’s in-charge city engineer Shailesh Mistry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/wish-to-fly-over-old-padra-road-wait-a-bit-longer/articleshow/87143694.cms||Sachin Sharma

A majority of these cases were detected over the last two months. Earlier in 2018, 194 dengue cases were confirmed in the district. So far, at least 95 people, including 78 children, suffering from fever have died in the district. However, the health department has confirmed only one death due to dengue. Following Monday’s heavy rainfall, the health department officials warned that dengue cases are likely to rise over the next 15 days due to a spike in mosquito breeding in waterlogged areas. Confirming the highest number of dengue cases in the last 10 years, district disease surveillance officer Dhruv Kumar said, “Over 18,000 samples of patients suffering from fever have been tested in the last 50 days. Out of these, 350 dengue cases have been confirmed. Health department teams are conducting door-to-door surveys in the rural areas to identify patients suffering fever and ensure their treatment. A cleanliness drive and anti-larvae spraying in villages to prevent the vector-borne diseases from spreading is on on a war footing. All the cases of deaths are being investigated”. Meanwhile, the district is also experiencing a shortage of platelets. The waiting period to get one unit of platelets at the 21 blood banks in Agra district is almost 48 hours, admitted health officials. SN Medical College, the largest government centre in Agra region, is suffering from a shortage of platelet kits. In-charge of the SNMC blood bank, Dr Neetu Chauhan, said, “Since the dengue outbreak, demand for jumbo packs of blood and platelets has increased manifold in two weeks. We have run out of platelet kits. We have placed orders for the supply to a private agency."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/350-dengue-cases-confirmed-in-agra-dist-highest-in-10-years/articleshow/87143585.cms||Deepak Lavania

Online classes are set to be discontinued even for primary students by several schools, said parents. While some schools are starting offline classes from this week, several others have decided to start classes from November. “I received a mail from my son’s school intimating that offline classes will begin from the second week of November,” said a parent whose son is studying in class 3 at a private school in Gachibowli. Another parent, whose child is studying in class 1, questioned the reason behind deciding to start offline classes for primary school students. “Who will send kids to school until the pandemic is over? Why are schools even thinking of starting physical classes for younger kids?” the parent asked. Several schools have sent out messages informing parents about discontinuation of online classes. “School resumes offline on campus from October20,” read a message from a school in Secunderabad. Similar messages were sent from managements of many schools across the state. Parents said that while those with children in high school are more inclined to send their wards for physical classes, the same is not true for the ones with children in upper primary and primary students. “With schools discontinuing online classes, parents have no option except to send their kids for physical classes. Many are worried that their children might lose out as others are attending offline classes,’ said K Venkat Sainath, joint secretary, Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA). Sainath said instead of discontinuing online classes, managements should leave it up to parents whether or not to send their children to schools. Budget school managements, meanwhile, said they are hoping attendance wil improve in coming weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parents-unsure-but-schools-plan-to-go-offline-post-break/articleshow/87144834.cms||---

Altogether 28 samples of ghari were collected from 14 sweet-making units including Sumul Dairy and Choryasi Dairy in Bhagal as well. The collected samples have been sent for testing at the public health laboratory of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). On Monday, the health department teams collected 31 samples of mava from 17 sellers in different areas and sent these for testing to laboratory. Ghari, a high calorie sweet made of a mixture of different types of fried gram flour snacks, is most sought-after delicacy in Chandni Padva as revellers eat it with ‘Bhusu’ and flavoured rice flakes or pauva. A large quantity of ghari is sold and consumed during the festival and every year SMC’s health department tests the sweet ahead of the festivities. “We collected mava samples earlier and on Tuesday collected samples of ghari as the sweet will be consumed in huge quantity during the festival. Normally, results from the laboratory will take around 14 days but we have requested for early reports,” said an official from the food department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/quality-checks-for-ghari-done-ahead-of-chandni-padva/articleshow/87143964.cms||---

Sawant said the state government has promoted the police personnel based on recruitment rules. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat had sought to know whether time-bound recruitments are being carried out in the police force, and whether the same is carried out in a transparent manner. Kamat said that 26 DySp posts are vacant and 18 posts have been filled, 15 PI posts vacant, three posts of commandant are vacant of IRBn, nine posts of deputy commandant and 21 posts of DySp are yet to be filled. Kamat said that he suggested that complaints should be received by the officer of the rank of police sub-inspectors, and that in urban police station like Margao, Panaji, Mormugao, Mapusa among others, the government should deploy one police inspector for investigation and one for maintaining law and order as this will increase the efficiency of the force. Madkai MLA Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar sought to know how the government will promote PI to DySP when the matter is sub judice. The high court had admitted a petition filed by 14 police inspectors challenging seeking filling up of posts of DySP only by promotion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/promotions-of-cops-soon-says-sawant/articleshow/87144637.cms||---

But with three AI unions and the management set to begin conciliatory talks next week at the labour commissioner’s office, the deadline for submission was extended. A joint action committee of AI unions threatened an indefinite strike from November 2 in protest against the decision to get quarters vacated. On Monday, the deputy chief labour commissioner sent the strike notice to AI and fixed a meeting between both parties for October 27. A status quo will be maintained, said a unions’ circular to members, urging them to not to submit the undertaking. On October 5, AI had told over 7,000 staff to submit the undertaking by October 20 that they will vacate quarters in six months post-privatisation. In its strike notice, unions said colonies are on land leased in perpetuity by AAI to AI. Mumbai airport is a tenant, and there is no reason for AI to vacate the colonies in a hurry and hand over the land to Mumbai airport, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-air-india-staff-get-time-to-give-undertaking-to-leave-quarters/articleshow/87146278.cms||---

The Fugana police are investigating the murder and trying to identify the assailant with the help of CCTV footage. Atul Kumar Srivastava, SP (Rural), said, “A case has been registered in the matter and a police team has been sent to arrest the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/shopkeeper-shot-dead-in-busy-market-in-mngr/articleshow/87143625.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Nagpur||Rly shuts down IRSDC, station devpt at risk?||Nagpur: The Railway Board’s decision to shut down station redevelopment subsidiary Indian Railways Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC) is likely to hit the redevelopment of Nagpur station and other stations and make them world-class. On Monday, the Railway Board directed the initiation of closure formalities and the IRSDC has been asked to hand over all the stations to the respective zones. Redevelopment plans and documents also have to be handed over. IRSDC general manager Ashwani Kumar did not respond to TOI calls. Now redevelopment of Nagpur and CSMT, Mumbai, will be handled by the Central Railway. The Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC), under the aegis of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), has already cleared the redevelopment proposal of the railway station in September 2020. The IRSDC was to develop 600 stations in the country including Nagpur and CSMT in Mumbai. These redeveloped hubs were to be called ‘Railopolis’, as it will attract huge investment and business opportunities. In the quest for qualification (RFQ), six parties had already evinced interest to redevelop Nagpur station at the cost of Rs 465 crore. IRSDC was a special purpose vehicle (SPV) incorporated under the aegis of Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), Ircon International Limited (IRCON), and Rail India Technical and Economic Services Limited (RITES). Now it will be merged with RLDA. Railway affairs expert Alok Patel said, “Railway zones are poor at project execution. They have been consistently unable to finish critical projects in a timely manner. With some delays running into decades, not only have zones lost money in cost-escalations, but also potential revenues.” “The sorry state of most stations is proof that the existing Indian Railways organization lacks the bandwidth, vision, or intent to reimagine or build world-class facilities for passengers. A separate unit like IRSDC was created to specialize and address this issue,” said Patel. IRSDC had begun planning and RFQ/RFP processes for several major stations like CSMT, New Delhi, Amritsar, Sabarmati and Gwalior among others. It is unclear what the fate of these projects will be going forward. The move seemed inevitable after Sanjeev Sanyal, principal economic advisor to the central government, recommended choosing between Railway Land Development Authority (RLDA) and IRSDC. According to the proposal, both agencies were involved in station redevelopment, management and other related works and thus had significant overlap. Activity at the SPV has been dwindling over the past several months with little information on the progress of RFPs floated. A senior Central Railway official said, “The orders were issued only a day ago and it would be too early to comment at this juncture.” Patel said, “Handing over redevelopment to zonal railways will delay or completely derail big-ticket projects like Nagpur. Take for example Central Railway’s Nagpur division, it has completed only a 20km stretch of the critical 76km 3rd & 4th line project between Nagpur-Sewagram. CR expects to complete the project, sanctioned in 2012-13, in March 2024.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rly-shuts-down-irsdc-station-devpt-at-risk/articleshow/87144679.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||India||IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath to leave job and return to Harvard University||WASHINGTON: IMF's Chief Economist Gita Gopinath will leave her job in January next year and return to the prestigious Harvard University, according to the global financial institution. The 49-year-old prominent Indian-American economist had joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the Chief Economist in January 2019. She was the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics at Harvard University when she joined the Washington-based global lender. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Tuesday announced that the search for Gopinath's successor would begin shortly. “Gita's contribution to the Fund and our membership has been truly remarkable - quite simply, her impact on the IMF's work has been tremendous,” Georgieva said. Mysuru-born Gopinath is the first-ever woman Chief Economist of the IMF. Harvard University had extended her leave of absence on an exceptional basis by one year, which has allowed her to serve as Chief Economist at the IMF for three years. “She made history as the first female Chief Economist of the Fund and we benefited immensely from her sharp intellect and deep knowledge of international finance and macroeconomics as we navigate through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. “Gita also won the respect and admiration of colleagues in the Research Department across the Fund, and throughout the membership for leading analytically rigorous work and policy-relevant projects with high impact and influence,” Georgieva said. The IMF said that as part of her many significant initiatives, Gopinath co-authored the “Pandemic Paper” on how to end the COVID-19 pandemic that set globally endorsed targets for vaccinating the world. This work led to the creation of the Multilateral Task Force made up of the leadership of the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation and the World Health Organisation to help end the pandemic and the establishment of a working group with vaccine manufacturers to identify trade barriers, supply bottlenecks, and accelerate delivery of vaccines to low- and lower-middle income countries, the IMF said in a statement. Among her other key accomplishments, Gopinath helped set up a Climate Change team inside the IMF to analyse, among other things, optimal climate mitigation policies. “I would like to express my personal appreciation to Gita for her impressive contributions, her always wise counsel, her devotion for the mission of the Research Department and the Fund more broadly, as well as her widely recognised inclusive and accessible approach to colleagues and staff,” Georgieva added. Born in December 1971 to Malayalee parents, Gopinath had her schooling in Kolkata and graduated from the Lady Shri Ram College of Commerce in Delhi. She did Masters from the Delhi School of Economics as well as from the University of Washington. Gopinath did her Ph.D in economics from Princeton University in 2001 and she was guided by Kenneth Rogoff, Ben Bernanke and Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas. She joined the University of Chicago in 2001 as an Assistant Professor before moving to Harvard in 2005. She became a tenured Professor there in 2010. She is the third woman in the history of Harvard to be a tenured professor at its esteemed economics department and the first Indian since the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen to hold that position.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/imf-chief-economist-gita-gopinath-to-leave-job-and-return-to-harvard-university/articleshow/87146954.cms||---

---||Delhi||North civic body launches app for funeral services||New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has developed an app-based online crematorium/burial ground booking system, which will help in checking real-time availability of slots, allow online payment of ritual fees, and generate digital cremation slips. The app seeks to provide civic facilities to people in an easy way, said mayor Raja Iqbal Singh, who launched the app on Tuesday. “They can go to the corporation’s official website, https://mcdonline.nic.in/, and click on the online services tab to log in to the crematorium/ burial grounds slot availability section in the north corporation area,” the mayor said. “Through this platform, digital cremation slips will also be issued,” he added. There are 12 crematoriums within the north corporation area, including the facilities at Nigambodh Ghat, Inderpuri, Panchkuian Road, Satnagar, Beri Wala Bagh, Wazirpur JJ Colony, Paschim Vihar, Haiderpur, Rohini Sector 26 and Mangolpuri. There is a cemetery and a burial ground at Mangolpuri. The crematoriums at Inderpuri, Rohini Sector 26 and Panchkuian Road were developed during the Covid pandemic. “The app will save time as people don’t have to visit the crematoriums or the burial ground physically or call multiple facilities for checking availability, and later waste time in depositing fees at the counter,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-civic-body-launches-app-for-funeral-services/articleshow/87144703.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Five held for siphoning off Rs 1.3 crore from NRI a/c||NEW DELHI: Five people, including a woman, have been arrested for allegedly siphoning off Rs 1.3 crore from the bank account of a Germany-based NRI. The mastermind, Sumit Pandey (24), a commerce graduate, earlier worked with the same bank. His co-accused, Shailendra Pratap Singh (42), had done MCom from Delhi University. Singh asked his associates, Jagdamba Pandey (22) and Adarsh Jaiswal (23), to withdraw money by forging signatures on the victim’s cheque book. The fifth associate, Neelam (32), an MEd, impersonated the victim and got the account’s credential changed and requested for a new cheque book and ATM card by calling the customer care. A case of cheating was registered in November 2020 at Rajendra Nagar police station on the complaint of Kanika Girdhar, the NRI residing in Germany. “When she tried to log into her bank account, she was denied access. When she approached the bank, she was told that her FDs had been liquidated and Rs 1.3 crore had been fraudulently withdrawn through online transfers, cheques and ATM. The bank said a fresh cheque book and ATM card were issued recently to her alleged brother, Vishal,” said DCP (Central) Shweta Chauhan. Girdhar said she didn’t have any siblings and had not requested for a new cheque book and ATM card. During investigation, Pandey revealed that he accessed the complainant’s bank account and got to know that Rs 1.3 crore was lying in it. He passed on the information to Singh, who hatched the conspiracy to withdraw the money. Singh started a fake company, Workforce India Pvt Ltd, at Badkhal Chowk in Faridabad to purportedly supply labourers to construction companies. “He hired 10-odd labourers and made them open accounts in multiple banks. He got the registered mobile number of the complainant’s account, which had gone dormant as it was not in use for three months, re-issued in the name of one labourer and set up internet banking on it. He then started transferring money into the accounts of the labourers,” said the DCP. A Tata Nexon, a motorcycle, Rs 27 lakh cash and two iPhones were seized from the accused. Singh had also purchased property worth Rs 41.5 lakh in Shastri Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5-held-for-siphoning-off-rs-1-3cr-from-nri-a/c/articleshow/87144696.cms||---

The water is likely to inundate low-lying areas of the district by Tuesday night. Several villages have been evacuated, and the people have been shifted to relief camps. Residents have been advised to keep at least a 50-metre distance from the rivers. In the Terai region, incessant rains in the past 48 hours caused huge damage to paddy crop. In Agra, massive crop loss has been reported, particularly bajra and paddy, which were sown on over 3 lakh hectare land. Waterlogging in the fields is set to adversely affect mustard, chilli, and vegetable crops. The agriculture department on Tuesday started assessment of crop loss in Agra, Firozabad, Etah, and Kasganj districts. Farmers have been advised to register their losses on toll-free numbers provided by the state within 72 hours for claims under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. They can alternatively reach out to their tehsildar or sub-divisional magistrate to record their losses. “The last time when such an amount of water was released into the rivers wreaked havoc in 181 villages. Water levels will increase during the night by up to 2.5 metres. Our rescue teams are ready, but it is extremely important to stay cautious,” said Arvind Kumar Chaurasiya, district magistrate, Lakhimpur Kheri. “Untimely rainfall has resulted in over 50 per cent crop loss to bajra and paddy farmers across the district. Vegetable crops have also been affected. It is a season for wheat cultivation, which will now be delayed as waterlogged fields will take time to dry up. Potatoes will have improper germination while mustard crops sown will be ruined,” said Rajveer Lawaniya, district president, Bharatiya Kisan Union, Agra unit. Meanwhile, rains on the Uttarakhand hills and plains are posing a threat to seven districts in Uttar Pradesh. Storage level at Kalagarh dam across the Ramganga river is at 363.5 metres -- very close to the danger mark. Authorities have released around 5,000 cusec water into the Ramganga. Districts under threat are Bijnor, Amroha, Moradabad, Rampur, Bareilly, Shahjahanpur and Farrukhabad. Dam authorities have already informed four divisional commissioners, senior police officers, and seven district magistrates to take all precautionary measures. Moreover, the Ganga is swelling rapidly. Its water flow has jumped up to 1.99 lakh cusec from 45,000 cusec within 24 hours. Ganga water has entered two villages, Brahampuri and Ravali. A primary school has already been flooded. A small bridge connecting half a dozen villages with the district headquarters has got submerged in water. Villagers are using boats to get to their destinations. According to officials, there are 312 flood-affected villages in the district located on the banks of various rivers. Twenty-five are along the Ganga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/incessant-rains-wreak-havoc-in-west-up-flood-alert-issued-crops-damaged/articleshow/87143651.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nagpur||Cops reunited 9 minors, 5 women, 3 sr citizens with families at Koradi over Navratri||Nagpur: Cops deployed at Koradi temple premises managed to reunite at least nine minors with their families among the thousands of devotees thronging the place during Navratri festival between October 7 and 15. The cops also reunited five women and three senior citizens with their families after they were lost in the crowd. Every year, such tragedies are common during Navratri festival at Koradi temple, with people, especially minors, going missing. This year, cops deployed a dedicated team to ensure missing complaints are dealt with promptly and with priority, apart from the regular feature of the police help centre, which remained operative with a mini CCTV camera set up round the clock. CP Amitesh Kumar stressed more on strategic crowd management than just static bandobast and crowd management. A mini control room-cum-help desk was made operational round-the-clock for this purpose. Zonal DCP Manish Kalwaniya said efforts of the dedicated team helped rescue minors and other people separated from their families. “Each complaint of lost or missing person was dealt with by the dedicated team. They were tasked only in trying to trace the missing one or their family members,” said Kalwaniya, adding announcements from the police help centre were also reaching the nook and corner of the premises, which also helped trace many persons. “Even before documentation and formalities, our focus was to trace out and reunite,” he said. Senior inspector Krishna Shinde of Koradi police station said reuniting a woman with her two-year-old son was the highlight of the entire effort. “The woman was in distress and sobbing profusely at the police help centre. She was busy on the mobile phone when her baby wandered away,” he said. “We alerted the entire security bandobast on receiving the complaint of the missing child. He was traced soon afterwards and the mother’s face reflected her relief," he said. Shinde said the entire force on bandobast was alerted if any missing or lost complaint was lodged at the police help centre. “Each cop would get alerted and start following the announcement. They would communicate and coordinate seamlessly for any help or assistance required,” said the senior PI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-reunited-9-minors-5-women-3-sr-citizens-with-families-at-koradi-over-navratri/articleshow/87144691.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Goa: House refers tree, tenant bills to select panel||PORVORIM: The Goa legislative assembly on Tuesday referred the Goa Preservation of Trees (Amendment) Bill, 2021 which dilutes the power of the tree authority, and the Goa (Verification of Tenants) Bill, 2021 which proposes stricter penalties on those failing to submit details about their tenants to police, to the select committee. The opposition pointed out to the government that the Goa Preservation of Trees (amendment bill 2021) dilutes the power of the tree authority, and with this amendment major infrastructure projects like those proposed in Mollem will be excluded from its purview. Opposition members said that if the bill is passed, people will once again protest as it would mean that the bill is passed for the benefit of the three linear projects. Stating that there was no tree census conducted in the state, Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte said that the state government seeks to amend Section 7 of the prevailing act and change the preservation status of all trees within its jurisdiction. “The state government aims to curtail the power of the tree authority,” Khaunte said. The independent legislator said that as per the prevailing law, the tree authority was responsible for the census of trees within as well as outside forest areas. The Porvorim MLA said according to the existing act, the tree authority is responsible for development and maintenance of nurseries, supply of seeds, saplings for growing more trees inside or outside forest areas, and hence the amendment restricts the duties of the tree authority. Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco also pressed for sending the bills to the select committee Chief minister Pramod Sawant later agreed to their demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/house-refers-tree-tenant-bills-to-select-panel/articleshow/87144682.cms||---

---||Patna||Patna breathes easy as AQI turns ‘good’||PATNA: The city breathed easy as its air quality index (AQI) dipped by 26 units in the last 48 hours to reach 39 on Tuesday, which falls in “good” category, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The dip was due to meteorological conditions and late night showers on Monday followed by an increase in local wind speed, which washed away the pollutants in the atmosphere to a greater extent. The prominent pollutants in city’s air are ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns). According to the CPCB’s bulletin released at 4pm, the overall AQI of 39 for Patna was the average of data reading from individual areas having continuous ambient air quality monitoring station. It includes DRM office (38) and Patna City (38), where ozone was the prominent pollutant in the air. Meanwhile, CO was prominent pollutant at S K Memorial Hall (66) and Eco Park (28). At BIT-Mesra station where AQI level was recorded at 26, PM10 was the major pollutant in the air. An AQI between below 50 is classified as “good”, between 51 and 100 “satisfactory” and between 101 and 200 “moderate”. “Poor” air ranges from 201 to 300, “very poor” from 301 to 400 and “severe” from 401 to 500. Experts said the prominent pollutants for past several days was CO and ozone, suggesting high concentration of vehicular emission. However, PM 10 and PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns) were there earlier due to dust in the air. Ashok Ghosh, chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), said the new sensor in monitoring station was quite sensitive. “We have to recalibrate all the stations to ensure that there is no faulty data detection. We have to see whether there are some sources of ozone which have been increasing in certain areas or it’s an error of machines. We have set up a pollution monitoring unit with two dedicated staff to analyse the scientific reason about this shift from PM 2.5 and PM 10 to ozone and CO. We will find out the reason in the next couple of weeks,” he said. He added, “Rain, wind velocity and climatic conditions have led to the dip in AQI. However, once the movement of westerly wind begins and mercury drops, the AQI level may start deteriorating.” The Air Quality Early Warning System of the ministry of earth sciences has forecast the spell of relatively clean air to continue for the next 24 hours. The AQI is likely to increase from October 21 with the change in meteorological conditions and dry spell, it added. In terms of average AQI, Patna fared the better this October than in 2020 and even previous years. The average AQI this October was 96 as against 119 in 2020 October 2021 and 2020 saw six and three “satisfactory” air quality days, respectively, but no “poor” day was recorded in October this year. Last year in October, a “poor” AQI level of 208 was recorded on day 19 while the remaining 15 days were “moderate”. This year, four “good” days and nine “moderate” days have so far been recorded in October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/city-breathes-easy-as-aqi-turns-good/articleshow/87144699.cms||Faryal Rumi

According to locals, the issue of garbage being dumped in the open persisted for several weeks before officials took the initiative to clean the entire space. “Despite complaints to the local civic authorities, people would repeatedly use the space as a dumping ground. With the number of dengue and other viral fever cases increasing, it is very important that we keep our surroundings clean,” said Ankit Mathur, the citizen reporter who highlighted the problem. Another citizen from the same street said that it was a recurring problem and officials must conduct regular inspections in the area to see that the problem does not resurface. “The garbage was piling up so much that the commuters taking the road were facing a serious problem because the heaps of garbage completely blocked the road on the street. When it rains, the slush gushing out from the garbage makes the road very slippery. We are happy that the issue is resolved now,” said Mohammed Imtiaz, a resident of Hussaini Alam. “We have deputed our staff to ensure that the garbage was immediately cleared from places where there is open dumping. Our team is also keeping an eye to make sure people use proper means of garbage disposal in the area and avoid dumping it in the open,” said Ashok Samrat, zonal commissioner, GHMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hussaini-alam-road-finally-loses-its-stink/articleshow/87144704.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Journey of ‘Landscape’: From adorning a wall to Sotheby’s||Bought for $100 — barely Rs 8,000 — in Detroit in the 1980s, an artwork by one of India’s most influential modernists, F N Souza is estimated to sell for £500,000 (around Rs 5 crore) at an auction in Sotheby’s London on October 26. Though the final selling price may be much lower or higher depending on bids, it’s quite a trajectory for a piece that was quietly hanging on the walls of an American collector for four decades. Oblivious to its value, the current owners submitted its details on the auction house’s online pricing platform, leading to its rediscovery. Titled ‘Landscape’ (Red Building), the painting — which shows the English city’s rectilinear skyline — not only represents Souza’s brief yet significant affair with European cityscapes in the post-war 1950s, but also belongs to 1955, a landmark year that marked the beginning of his ascent in London following six years of rejection and strife. It was in 1949, two years after he co-founded the era-defining Bombay Progressive Artists’ Group, that Goa-born Souza had left Bombay to establish himself in London. “The period from 1949-1955 was a hard one for Souza,” wrote acclaimed art critic Edwin Mullins in 1962, adding: “For those six years, he tried to interest London galleries in his pictures only to be told that they were not good enough. Once he and a friend carried an enormous picture from North Kensington where he lived to Bond Street, because a gallery had expressed a slight interest in his work, only to have it rejected and carry it all the way back to North Kensington”. Souza’s breakthrough show in 1955 later earned him the patronage of wealthy New Yorker Harold Kovner and of Detroit-based founder of the London Arts Group, Eugene Ivan Schuster. Schuster would bring Souza and his paintings to America, where the artist would spend three decades before returning to India towards the end of his life. That’s how ‘Landscape’ — which was found illustrated in an artist’s inventory list from the Schuster Gallery archives alongside over 100 of the artist’s paintings — surfaced at a charity auction in Detroit in the 1980s and caught the eye of a collector.

---||Delhi||North corpn makes it must for school teachers to apply for transfers online||New Delhi: To make the system of transfer of primary school teachers transparent, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has made the entire process online. Any teacher/principal will need to apply online and no physical application will be processed. They can select five schools each, and based on vacancies and on first-come-first-served basis, a transfer will be approved to any of these schools. The policy, however, gives priority to people with genuine needs such as medical illness, physically challenged, women and widows. Mayor Raja Iqbal Singh said teachers would not have to run here and there for their transfer. “It will also reduce human interaction,” he added. The corporation has around 700 schools catering to 2.8 lakh students. Education committee chairman Alok Sharma said an applicant would need to apply through their biometric ID. “The computer will automatically allocate a school. The system will do away with the practice of undue pressure from some teachers for transfer to a school close to their home,” he said. The portal will accept applications for a week, following which it will become non-operational, Sharma said. “We already have 300 applications and we can’t afford to transfer all teachers near their home. Also, if so many transfers are done in the middle of a session, students will suffer. The portal will again become operational in June 2022. We are doing everything as per the central government guidelines,” he added. “Teachers demanding transfer will need to explain the reason in detail,” said the chairman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpn-makes-it-must-for-school-teachers-to-apply-for-transfers-online/articleshow/87144759.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Maurya, who was felicitated at Meerut’s Chaudhary Charan Singh University on Tuesday, had posters across the city calling her Baby Rani Maurya ‘Jatav’ — a suffix she has not used before. The Jatavs comprise 11% of Dalit vote bank in Uttar Pradesh which amounts to 21% of total votes in the state. The community has traditionally voted for BSP chief Mayawati. Talking to the media, Maurya said she was adding “Jatav” to her name as it was “important for Dalit community to know that she belongs to them”. Maurya also compared herself to ‘Gautam Buddha’ and said just like he left his kingdom to work for the poor and downtrodden, she had also quit the post of governor as she wanted to work for the people of her community in UP. “I am glad that my party agreed to my wish and I was given an opportunity to work for my people. they have had high hopes from may other leaders who termed themselves as ‘Dalit’ leaders but no one was ever seen on ground except during the time of polls. They have faith in me which is why thousands of people from 14 districts have gathered in Meerut today,” she said. Maurya also praised BR Ambedkar and said that if he had not written the constitution, Ramnath Kovind would not have been the President and she would have never become the governor. “We would not have got these posts if the constitution was not made,” she added. “Maurya is a prominent Dalit face. We have many Dalit workers on the ground and she is one of them. UP BJP is organising a series of felicitation events for her, especially in Dalit dominated constituencies, across the state. One such event was held at CCSU today and she will soon be visiting all 14 districts that fall in west UP, from Rampur to Saharanpur, early next month,” said Hansraj Pappu, regional president of BJP’s SC Morcha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/former-ukhand-guv-baby-rani-to-take-on-mayawati-in-up/articleshow/87143673.cms||Ishita Mishra

Shah had laid the foundation stone for the project. Sawant said that all the procedures was followed properly The Curtorim MLA accused the government of trying to destroy the sugarcane industry in the state. “Let the CM say that whether he wants to finish this industry,” he said. Lourenco questioned whether the state government had held a general body meeting of the sugar factory to hand over the land to NFSU as it is a cooperative society. Intervening in the discussion, Sawant hit out at the Curtorim MLA for ‘diverting’ the issue. “We are discussing issues related to sugar factory farmers, while he is trying to divert the debate,” he said. “We should feel proud that the home minister laid the foundation stone for the NFSU. We have to welcome this university,” Sawant said. The chief minister urged the legislator not to play politics, to which the Congress MLA denied the charge and empahsised that he had brought up the topic in the interest of the farmers.

As the Tamil Nadu Open University (TNOU) had recently concluded their short excavation at the site, the forum sought the state archaeology department to take up a long-term excavation.The research forum headed president Karu Rajendran said that the village situated in Alangudi taluk had once accommodated multiple forts, which he substantiated with literary and archaeological evidence. Hero stone dating back to the second century was also found in recent years indicating the hamlet’s age. TNOU, after obtaining permission from the state archaeology department, completed their findings through excavation between July and September at a cost of Rs 1 lakh. A canal-like structure made of brick was discovered in the study. To explore the full archaeological potential of Porpanaikottai, the research forum approached the state Tamil development and archaeology minister Thangam Thennarasu with a demand to resume the excavation. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/call-for-excavation-at-porpanaikottai/articleshow/87144731.cms||---

He was carrying at least Rs 1 lakh in cash but only Rs 12,000 was recovered. The family, residing at Wadi, was planning to celebrate Harsh’s birthday on October 21. Mantri, the only son of his parents, had left home for the office of his family-owned business at Khobragade compound in Wadi. When his father Santosh reached office, he was surprised to hear that Mantri was not in. Mantri could not be contacted as his phone was switched off. “When my wife called, the phone rang and stopped immediately. Soon we received the message about his death after someone had picked up a diary from his pocket to make a call to my nephew as his number was scribbled in it,” said Santosh. Santosh claimed his son had no enemies. “My son would reach office early. After a lunch break, he would resume work again. In the evening, he would walk back home with my older daughter,” said Santosh. “After discontinuing studies two years ago, I don’t know if he maintained any friendly ties with anyone outside our family and friends,” said Santosh adding that Harsh was spotted at Wadi naka by an acquaintance. A relative said the body and face were unrecognizable. “I identified him on the basis of his shoes,” he said. The relative added that Harsh was a jovial and happy-go-lucky person to have ended life. The family also ruled out any financial stress or constraint. Santosh claimed his son did not have any two-wheelers. “Whenever he travelled on business it was in the family-owned cars. Harsh never went by train too,” he said. According to police, Mantri boarded the Bengaluru-bound Rajdhani Express from Nagpur station. His body was apparently run over by the the Tamil Nadu Express. “We are yet to scan the CCTV images and are currently working on theories and clues,” said senior inspector Dilip Khobragade of Warora police station. Khobragade said that police have sought Mantri’s call details. “It's most likely that he may have jumped off a running train or was pushed down. Its unlikely that he was dead and the body placed on the track,” he said. Sources from Nagpur railway station stated that CCTV footage between 9 am and 11 am did not capture any images of Mantri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bizmans-death-on-rly-track-remains-a-mystery/articleshow/87144739.cms||Soumitra Bose

As per data available on the Patna high court website, there was a little change in the number of cases which were instituted in subordinate courts in 2020 from 2019, but the count of the cases disposed came down drastically as either courts were shut or had to work virtually. Altogether 4.76 lakh cases were instituted in 2020 and just 1.74 lakh could be disposed of. In 2019, 5.98 lakh cases were instituted and 4.05 lakh disposed of. In 2018, 4.93 lakh cases were instituted and 3.61 lakh disposed of, taking the case clearance rate to 73.09%. The poor case clearance rate increased the pressure on the subordinate courts which forms the backbone of the judicial system. The real-time data on the National Judicial Data Grid shows that 4.67 lakh civil and 28.95 lakh criminal nature cases are pending for disposal before the subordinate courts across the state. The total pendency is 33.63 lakh cases. Most pending cases are one to three-year-old. However, there are still 11,210 pending cases in subordinate courts (4,353 civil and 6,857 criminal). This huge pendency of cases is on the shoulders of 1,388 judicial officers of the subordinate judiciary who are posted in different courts across the state. The overall sanctioned strength of judges in subordinate courts in the state is 1,953. However, more than 560 posts are lying vacant. Bihar State Bar Council chairman Ramakant Sharma said the government should fill up vacant posts of judges and increase sanctioned strength as per state’s population and increased pressure on courts as a result of the pandemic. Patna civil court public prosecutor Vijay Kumar Sinha said the situation would ease only when the courts start functioning in complete physical mode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/just-36-cases-disposed-of-at-subordinate-courts-in-20/articleshow/87144758.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Delhi||Four of gang held for firing at SUV in southwest Delhi||NEW DELHI: A day after an SUV driver was injured in a firing reported in South West Delhi’s Kishangarh area, Delhi Police’s Special Cell on Tuesday said they had arrested four members of the Manjeet Mahal gang from Dwarka for their involvement in the case. Police said that the incident took place around 1 pm when the victim, Shafiq, and two others—Somraj and Krishan—were returning home in their SUV after attending a 2020 murder case hearing. Somraj, who is the complainant in the present case, was one of the suspects in the 2020 murder case in which one Ashok Maan was killed. The attackers tried to kill Somraj but missed their target and Shafiq, who was driving the vehicle, got injured, said an officer. When the SUV reached Kishangarh, it was intercepted by the accused and a total of four rounds were fired at the spot in which Shafiq received injuries on his temple and his hand. Somraj was sitting next to the driver seat and Krishan on the rear seat. Deputy commissioner of police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said that they arrested Abhishek Malik (26), Wazir (26), Annu Gilodia (22) and Kapil Kumar (24) based on information. “Three sophisticated pistols, 75 live cartridges, three empty cartridges and an ID card of one Harender Maan have been recovered from them,” DCP Yadav said. Malik disclosed that Mahal and Ashok Maan were very close friends and in February 2020, Somraj along with his associate had allegedly committed the murder of Maan. Since then, Harender Maan (nephew of Ashok Maan) wanted to take revenge from Somraj. “Mahal had directed his gang members to eliminate Somraj. Before the incident, they did the recce of Somraj’s route. On Monday, they received a tip-off about the movement of Somraj and then started firing on his car,” the officer said. Explaining the profile of the four accused, an officer said Malik was earlier shot by one Rohit after a quarrel. The bullet is still inside his body. To take revenge, he joined the Mahal gang. “Wazir had helped other associates in the escape of gangster Vikash Dalal from police custody in Faridabad in 2018. Kumar and Gilodia came in contact with Malik through their common friends and started to work with him,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-of-gang-held-for-firing-at-suv-in-southwest-delhi/articleshow/87144753.cms||---

This has sparked speculation of him being the next to join the SP. Besides Rana, BSP national general secretary RS Kushwaha also joined the SP on Sunday. Talking to TOI, SP leader from Meerut, Atul Pradhan -- who facilitated Akhlaq’s 45-minute meeting with Akhilesh Yadav – said the outcome will be fruitful, with the former MP joining the SP soon. “It was a healthy discussion. Akhlaq maintained that UP can get rid of bad governance only if Akhilesh becomes chief minister. We will work together to make this happen. Official announcement of him coming into the party fold will be made soon,” added Pradhan. Akhlaq could not be reached as his phone was switched off. If he joins the SP, it will be the second big name in west UP to have moved to the SP from the BSP. Earlier this year, Sunita Verma, who was Meerut mayor, and her husband Yogesh Verma jumped the ship after being expelled from the BSP in 2019. In eastern UP, former MP and BSP national general secretary Veer Singh along with Ajeem Bhai, who is a former MLA, had joined the SP. The party also managed to pull out Sibghatullah Ansari, former BSP MLA and brother of jailed gangster and legislator Mukhtar Ansari, to the party earlier in August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bsps-ex-mp-meets-akhilesh-sparks-rumours-of-party-switch/articleshow/87143702.cms||Ishita Mishra

But, buses and trucks are not allowed to access the ROB considering the age of the structure.At a cost of Rs 2.82 crore, the civic body has completed constructing a retaining wall in the Main Guard Gate end of the RoB as the stretch was washed away in the heavy rains in June 2020. Two layers of bitumen were laid, road markings and painting on the retaining walls are yet to be completed. Officials said that railways have refused to permit the movement of buses and other heavy vehicles as the RoB was built in 1866. “We have established barriers to prevent the movement of buses and heavy vehicles.

---||Lucknow||UP assembly elections: SP constitutes state executive, focus on non-Yadav OBCs||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party on Tuesday constituted its state executive comprising 72 members. While Naresh Uttam Patel has been retained as president of the statute unit, the party has appointed jailed MP Azam Khan’s son Abdullah Azam as secretary. The focus, however, remained on non-Yadav backward classes with a chunk of the appointments made from the category. It was the first time that Abdullah Azam has got a responsibility in the party’s organisational set-up. Abduallah has successfully contested the 2017 assembly elections on the SP ticket from Saur constituency in Rampur. However, the Allahabad High Court declared his election null and void after which Abdullah had moved the Supreme Court. Political observers are of the view that the SP leadership had evidently tried to strike a balance of castes and geographical representation of almost 80 per cent of districts and accommodated all age groups as well. “There are only four Yadavs among 24 secretaries. The party clearly seems to have focussed more on reaching out to non-Yadav OBCs,” said a political commentator. As per the list of newly appointed office-bearers, senior leader Raj Kumar Misra continues to be the treasurer. The party has appointed Dr Fida Hussain Ansari, Jai Shanker Pandey and Jag Pal Das Gujar as the vice-presidents of the state executive. The executive committee has Raj Narayan Bind, an OBC, as the principal general secretary apart from Shyam Lal Pal and former minister Tilak Chandra Ahirwar as general secretaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-constitutes-state-executive-focus-on-non-yadav-obcs/articleshow/87145802.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Pune||Pune: Colleges reopen today for fully vaccinated students||PUNE: Teachers are preparing for a hybrid teaching method consisting of online and offline teaching simultaneously at least for the initial period as colleges are set to reopen from Wednesday onwards after state government orders. The emphasis would be on practical training that students have missed during the last few months and those dependent on theory completely would be conducted blended classes. Seema Purohit, principal of Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce,said that around 30% of her students have decided to stay back. “The students and parents feel that if the cases again start increasing, they would need to go back. Hence, they have requested us to also keep the online teaching as they would like to stay at home and learn. We will continue teaching in a blended mode. The remaining 70% wish to come back to the campus. Those who are fully vaccinated have already taken up lodging in the college hostel. We are putting one student per room in these hostels at the moment as we have the space,” Purohit said. N S Umarani, pro-vice-chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University, said that some departments will start offline from tomorrow while some, where admissions are still going on, will continue to be online. “We are also adopting a blended model of teaching because outstation students would need time to come here and many may come after Diwali. Our hostels have started for students who are completely vaccinated and we are allowing them to stay as per the capacity of the room. We have already appealed to all students to get vaccinated and if they need help, they can always contact the health centre of the university where vaccination can be administered. All the departments are in the process of collating the vaccination data of their own students,” Umarani said. Jaya Rajagopalan, principal of St Mira’s College for Girls, said while 90% of her college staff is fully vaccinated the number of students who have taken both doses of vaccine is very less. “The rest have taken one dose of the vaccine. We have made all the necessary arrangements for reopening the college and all precautionary measures are in place according to the SOP given by SPPU. We have taken a survey of the students and very few of them are fully vaccinated, which is a requisite for attendance,” Rajagopal said. B V Nair, a parent, said that his daughter will attend the classes from Wednesday. “She started college last year but has not yet seen her classmates in person till now. So, she is very excited to go to college. She is fully vaccinated. Moreover, we, as a family, have travelled and we also go out to eat sometimes. Going to college for a few hours will definitely be safer especially when the institutions have taken all precautions. They will always wear a mask and also sanitise our hands using a pocket sanitiser. The sanitisation of hands has become second nature to many of us. I was worried about my daughter not getting enough practical exposure in her course and I am glad that the college is reopening,” he said. Some other colleges are also catering to a mixed format of teaching. “We will have to go for a blended method of teaching initially as not all students are vaccinated. The video recording and the face-to-face teaching shall continue for the initial few days,” VN Jagtap , principal of MCES College of Pharmacy said. Colleges have also collected vaccination information from their students. “We have collected the vaccination information of all the students and told all heads to plan to conduct practical and theory for eligible students following Covid-19 guidelines in offline mode and for others in online mode. Hardly 35% students have taken both the doses and remaining have taken the first dose. Let's see the response of eligible students. It will take time to smooth out the process. Students from outside the city have to check their accommodation and other arrangements,” D S Bormane, principal of AISSMS College of Engineering, said. Some students are wary about the reopening. “We are hoping that there is no change in the decision now as there have been too many reopenings and shutdowns. We want the college to conduct classes smoothly and we are aware about the precautions that require to be taken. All of us would follow them judiciously as we don't want classes to halt again,” Siddhesh Sawant, a student, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-reopen-today-for-fully-vaccinated-students/articleshow/87144754.cms||---

They have identified space for vehicle parking on the plots of the Trichy Corporation and railways nearby to prevent people from parking their vehicles on roads.The Yaanaikulam ground in Singarathope was identified for parking two-wheelers and the railway ground near Fort railway station will be used for parking cars. “We have also identified the corporation’s vacant land near Holy Cross College for parking vehicles if needed. Bishop Heber School in Teppakulam is also considered for use,” S Mathivanan, traffic police inspector said. For now, the parking spaces are offered without user fees. Bishop Heber School ground, if opened for parking, may charge a user fee, official sources said.Unlike last Diwali, traders eye a surge in business as Covid-19 cases continue to remain under control. With people wanting to move out with families after a while, police said that vehicular movement near commercial hubs has increased. Already around 30% surge in two-wheelers and cars were reported in Singarathope, Main Guard Gate and Teppakulam. To prevent bottlenecks due to on-street parking, police officials said that commercial streets including WB Road, Madurai Road, College Road and Salai Road have been earmarked as no-parking roads. A section of traders welcomed the move as traffic congestion has been taking a toll on their business. “Traffic bottlenecks are always a threat to us as authorities might be forced to relocate our business,” S Muruganandam, a street vendor on NSB Road, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/parking-to-be-streamlined-for-diwali-shoppers-in-trichy/articleshow/87144750.cms||Deepak Karthik

Since the state government approved development plan and development control regulations of metropolitan region in January 2018, the NMRDA has been dependent on Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fire department, which does not have sufficient staff even for the city. NMRDA commissioner Manoj Kumar Suryawanshi has approved establishment of first fire station at Jamtha on Wardha Road and accordingly the process to recruit fire officer and assistant fire officer has started. The process to procure machineries and engage firemen on contract basis is also likely to begin soon. The authority decided to set up first fire station on Wardha Road as a large number of high rise buildings have been constructed in Besa, Beltarodi and adjacent areas. A few hospitals, industries, educational institutions etc have also come up in the areas. NMRDA officials told TOI, “First fire station will come up at Jamtha. Later, fire stations will be set up division-wise as per requirement followed by necessary recruitment.” Apart from ensuring safety, the fire station will also help the NMRDA in disposing of applications seeking fire NOC, compliance, building plan sanction and occupancy certificate early. Having own fire station and staff will also help in regular inspection and monitoring, they said. The NMC’s fire department needs around 900 staff, but is operating with only 174. “A large number of industries, saw mills etc are situated in the metropolitan region. Timely arrival of fire tenders prevents loss of life, material, machineries etc. Due to shortage of manpower and also distance, it takes time for NMC fire tenders to reach the metropolitan region in case of any eventuality. Therefore, we had requested the NMRDA to set up its own fire stations and appoint staff. We are helping them in setting up the mechanism,” said NMC officials. Suryawanshi is also exploring the possibility of setting up a fire college near the Jamtha fire station. It will help in giving firemen training to local youths and also reduce the cost on operating the fire station. Owing to lax monitoring due to absence of own fire station and staff of NMRDA, a large number of unauthorized constructions have cropped up in metropolitan region. Need is to inspect these buildings, industries and regularize or initiate action as per norms. With the addition of NMRDA infrastructure, the number of fire tenders and staff in the district to handle any emergencies will go up. It is mandatory for all agencies to contribute in fire fighting, under their respective jurisdictional areas, in case of emergencies. In A Nutshell *State government approved development plan and development control regulations of metropolitan region in January 2018 *NMRDA has its own town planning department for approval of layouts, building plans, regularization etc *The authority failed to establish its own fire station, staff *NMC’s fire department is facing severe shortage of staff *NMRDA also depended upon NMC’s fire department *Apart from city’s 222 sq.km area, NMC’s fire department has to look after metropolitan region spread in 3,567 sq.km area covering 721 villages in nine tehsils of the district *This delays approvals or regularization of layouts, building plans etc *Timely arrival of fire tenders is very important to prevent financial loss and saving lives *NMRDA has initiated process to develop own fire stations, starting with one at Jamtha *Process to recruit fire officer and assistant fire officer has also started||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmrda-plans-own-fire-stations-officials-for-metropolitan-region/articleshow/87144756.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

He also said that Deccan Sugar Technology Association (India) has been engaged for the task. “After the DPR, we will send the proposal to the Union government. The state government has not stated that the factory would be closed. We will take a decision after the DRP is submitted,” Sawant said. During the session, the opposition slammed the government for its past assurances to continue with the operation of the sugar factory and now instead opting to set up an ethan plant which could cause pollution. Sawant also expressed concern over the possibility of pollution from the proposed plant. Replying to a calling attention tabled by Madkai MLA Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar, Sawant said that sugarcane was not procured by the factory during the past two years. He also said that a sugarcane nursery has been set up at the site. The state government has decided to pay a subsidy to cultivate sugarcane for the next five years, Sawant said. Dhavalikar had raised the issue in the House, stating that cultivators have been adversely affected after the lone state-run sugarcane factory was shut, while also pointing out that the government had failed to implement a proper policy.

---||Kolkata||Friends, kin bid farewell to Kankulia murder victim||Kolkata: Two days after Subir Chaki, MD of Kilburn Engineering Limited, was found murdered at his Kankulia Road home, his family gathered at Peace World in Park Circus on Tuesday to collect his body that was kept at the mortuary for his son, Riddhiman, to arrive from London. The family conducted the last rites in the afternoon. “We had pushed back the last rites for a day as we waited for Riddhiman to arrive from the UK. He reached on Tuesday morning. We took Subir’s body to the Keoratola crematorium. His daughter and son carried out the last rites,” said Mainak Chaki, Chaki’s cousin.  Subir’s wife, Anuradha, son Riddhiman, sister Subidita and other family members first brought the body back to Uniworld City in New Town, where they lived. “The body was kept on the premises, where neighbours and other residents of the complex paid homage. He was like a guiding star to all of us. We are yet to come to terms with his death. We hope police probe the case and arrest the accused at the earliest,” said a nextdoor neighbour of Chaki . The housing association has suspended all major activities, including Bijoya Sammilani, slated for next month in Chaki’s memory. The hearse carrying Chaki’s body left the complex around 2.30pm and reached Keoratola, where more relatives, friends and colleagues waited to bid him a final farewell. “We want justice. The killers must not be allowed to go scot-free,” said a family member. Chaki’s friends from IIT-Kharagpur and IIM Calcutta could not believe that he was no more, and that he met with such a violent death. Almost everyone remembered him as a soft-spoken man who was not only knowledgeable but also eager to learn. Among his friends was Arindam Guptaray, who was four years’ Chaki’s junior at IIT Kharagpur. While Guptaray had studied electronics and telecommunications, Chaki was in the mechanical engineering department. But despite the age gap and different departments, the two had been close as both lived in the RK Hall at IIT. “He was a hall senior and very erudite. He was eager to help anyone who came to him. Our days were different, when the seniors would take us under our wings after the ragging phase got over and RK Hall did not have the tradition of physical ragging. Today, seniors don’t mix with juniors as freely. I remember having gone to him for help when I stood for the position of indoor games secretary of the hall and he promised to vote for me,” said Guptaray, a data analyst in the US and is down in the city for a vacation. Another friend, Dipak Pramanik, who was three years junior to him, felt the same way. Pramanik went on to do his MBA from IIM Calcutta after his BTech, much like Chaki, though the latter did a PGCGM, a three-year evening course of IIMC conducted from the Harrington Street campus, unlike the two-year course that Pramanik did from the Joka campus. They both received their MBA degrees in 1987. “Can anyone imagine such a tragic end to a man with such an illustrious career?” he said. Abraham Stephanos, an IIM Calcutta contemporary and currently the MD of Tata Steel Dowsstream Products Limited and a prominent figure of the CII in Eastern India, said, “He was a thorough professional and very knowledgeable. It was a sheer pleasure working with him. I am shaken by the news.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/friends-kin-bid-farewell-to-kankulia-murder-victim/articleshow/87144776.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Lucknow||Ayodhya holds aloft its secular fabric on Barawafat||AYODHYA: Following the age-old tradition of Awadh, Hindus participated in Barawafat or Eid Milad Un Nabi celebrations and joined in the Juloos-e-Mohammadi' to mark the birthday of Prophet Mohammad in Ayodhya on Tuesday, holding aloft the temple town’s syncretic culture. The 'Barawafat' procession was taken out after two years, following the lockdown and the debilitating Covid second wave, which prevented gatherings. The Barawafat procession started from Nirmochan ghat on the western flank of Ramjanmabhoomi, wound its way through the temple town to conclude at Choti Deokali temple. While the procession negotiated its way through the streets, sadhus and mahants stood on both sides to greet Muslims. Pilgrims, who were in Ayodhya to offer prayer at Ramjanmabhoomi, also folded hands to pay respect to the ‘alam' (green flag). Talking to TOI, corporator of Ayodhya Municipal Corporation, Haji Asad Ahmad, said, “We consider all temples as our homes and sadhus as our family. In every Muslim festival, Hindus of Ayodhya stand by us and provide support and aid.” Another ‘Juloos-e-Mohammadi’ was taken from Chowk in the heart of Faizabad that wound its way through the city. When the procession passed by the residence of Ayodhya's BJP MLA Ved Prakash Gupta on Zanana Hospital Road, BJP workers gathered there in large numbers to shower petals of marigold and rose and greet Muslims by hugging them and shaking hands. Talking about communal brotherhood in Ayodhya, local trader leader Sushil Jaiswal, said, “This is our culture. We celebrate all festival together and greet them on Barawafat as they greet us on Ram Navami.” Local BJP leader Amal Gupta said, “There is no vote-bank politics in our personal relations. Though we are staunch Hindus, we respect our Muslim brothers and take part in their festivals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-holds-aloft-its-secular-fabric-on-barawafat/articleshow/87145816.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Niira Radia summoned in Rs 300 crore loan fraud case||NEW DELHI: Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police has summoned former corporate lobbyist Niira Radia in connection with a recent case in which three people were arrested for siphoning off more than Rs 300 crore that was taken as a loan from Yes Bank to build a hospital. Police officials said the summons was sent on Monday. “She has been asked to appear before police in three days after it was sent to her,” a source said. The cops didn’t comment on reports whether Radia is in London or whether a lookout notice has been issued against her. Recently, EOW arrested Yateesh Wahaal and Satish Kumar Narula — directors of Nayati Healthcare and Research NCR Pvt Ltd — and Rahul Singh Yadav, proprietor of Ahluwalia Construction. According to police, they took the loan on the pretext of developing a hospital in Gurgaon. “We have found that Radia had shares in Nayati Healthcare,” an officer said. Police said the complainant, a doctor, was a shareholder in OSL Healthcare Pvt Ltd that had signed an MoU for operating and managing the hospital’s various services. Later, the company faced financial problems and the majority shareholders sold their shares (51%) to the firm of the accused. “The company diverted majority of the amount to a dummy bank account opened in the name of Ahluwalia Construction. It was opened only to deceive the complainant and the lender, and to divert the loan amount,” additional CP (EOW) R K Singh said. Dr Rajeev Kumar Sharma filed the complaint against Naarayani Investment Pvt Ltd, the holding company of Nayati Healthcare and Research NCR Pvt Ltd, and its promoters and directors Radia, her sister Karuna Menon, Narula, Wahaal and others, police said. EOW has found that Naarayani Investment Pvt Ltd has 93% of the shareholding and Radia is its main promoter, Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/niira-radia-summoned-in-rs-300-crore-loan-fraud-case/articleshow/87144799.cms||---

---||Patna||Rising prices of fuel, essential items spoil household budget ahead of festivities||PATNA: Soaring fuel prices have pushed up the cost of essential commodities, disturbing the household budgets of middle-class families. Citizens are bearing the additional financial burdens at a time when jobs are scarce and sources of income drying up amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Many families are forced to make compromises even with their diets. Shubodeep Ranjan and his family of six have been struggling to cut the household expenses. Ranjan (43), who resides at Bahadurpur and works in an insurance company, said all the savings that he had kept for his children’s education and medical expenses were being spent on meeting the household needs. “For the last 4-5 months, I have not saved a single penny; rather the money that was saved is also being used to meet the daily expenses. As the prices of foodgrains, groceries and vegetables have reached new heights, we have changed our menu and reduced the items on the plate. If my wife cooks vegetable, she ensures enough water to compensate for pulses. Besides, there is also medical expenses of my mother and prices of most of the medicines have increased up to 20%,” Ranjan said. Abhishek Kumar, a schoolteacher and resident of Kankarbagh, said, “To maintain the household budget and our daily expenses, we eat daal and vegetable on alternate days. Seasonal vegetable prices have increased by 40-50% in a month. While chana and arhar daal is at around Rs105/kg, mustard oil is at Rs185 and refined edible costs Rs170/kg. The cost of one full LPG cylinder has gone up from Rs720 before the pandemic to Rs998 without any subsidy,” he said. “As the schools have reopened, the expenses further increased. I am planning how to reduce more expenses to meet the additional financial burdens of paying full school fee and conveyance charges from November,” Abhishek added. Saloni Shrivastava, a homemaker and resident of Khazanchi Road, said her family decided not to buy crackers and new clothes this Diwali. “Even in Dussehra, we did not spend money on buying things or going out. Travelling is already expensive as even buse and auto fares have been increased. During the pandemic, my husband’s salary was cut by 20%, instead of any annual increment,” she said. “To maintain, the household budget, I cook only one vegetable for both dinner and lunch. We have also reduced the daily milk consumption from 2 litre to 1 litre a day. During daytime, when no one is at home, I use a fan only. When the kids return from school, we switch fan and light of only one room where they can study and I can do my work. The electricity bill has also increased. It is such an unfortunate time for the middle-income group,” said Rajni Sharma, a resident of Jagganpura. Binay Kumar, a resident of Patel Nagar, said one can feel the pinch as cost of almost every essential commodity, be it cooking oil, milk, vegetables or rice, has increased. “As if the pandemic-induced paycuts were not enough, we now have to deal with soaring prices of essential products. Ealier, I spent Rs 700-800 on petrol per month. Now, it has increased up to Rs 1,550 whereas the kitchen budget has reached Rs4,500-5,000 per month from Rs1,800-2,200 earlier,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rising-prices-of-fuel-essential-items-spoil-household-budget/articleshow/87144811.cms||Faryal Rumi

Police sources said that on Tuesday, they arrested the key accused, identified as Malhari, who allegedly planned the murder because he suspected his wife was having an affair with the victim. Malhari’s accomplice and brother-in-law, Mohan, was also arrested. In the intervening night between October 12 and 13, the Khopoli fire brigade received a call that a tempo was ablaze on the expressway. They found the driver’s charred corpse inside. The Rasayani police registered an accidental death case, and identified the deceased as Sadashiv Chikale (32), a Pune resident. But Chikale’s family suspected Malhari, and told cops he had quarrelled with Chikale. Cops scanned CCTV footage and saw a car pursuing Chikale’s tempo from Kalamboli onwards. They tracked the car’s registration number and the accused’s mobile tower location, and arrested him and his aide. They are searching for a third suspect. Malhari confessed to assaulting Chikale till he fell unconscious, and then bundling him back inside the tempo, before setting it on fire.

The restaurant will be one among the five other locations at Akurdi, Baramati, Chinchwad, and Miraj stations across the Central Railway. A ‘Restaurant on Wheels’ has already been opened at Mumbai CSMT two days ago. The restaurant coach mounted on rails is located at the Heritage Gully, opposite platform number 18, CSMT. The project is under the innovative ideas of the catering policy of the Indian Railways announced in 2017. Senior divisional commercial manager (SrDCM) Krishnath Patil said, “The restaurant, which will be operational in a month, will be made using a discarded AC-III rail coach which will become a landmark eating house at the station. The railways will earn Rs42 lakh towards annual revenue from the project, which has been bagged by Haldiram’s.” Patil said half of the coach will have a fine-dining place while there will be also a takeaway counter. The interior of the restaurant will be furnished by the party in such a way that passengers, as well as the public, can enjoy the experience of dining in a rail-themed setting. The rates and menu of the restaurant will be decided by the licensee as per market rates approved by the railways. The restaurant will be open for passengers and the general public as well. Central Railway CPRO Sanjay Sutar said, “Central Railway plans to explore the possibility of opening similar restaurants at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Kalyan, Neral, Lonavala and Igatpuri in Mumbai division.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/restaurant-on-wheels-at-nagpur-station-soon/articleshow/87144816.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

A dozen national and state highways in the district were also blocked due to landslides. The hill town of Nainital virtually turned into a flooded island, cut off from the rest of the state for the second consecutive day as debris blocked all three routes. While the Nainital-Bhowali road was blocked on Monday afternoon, the Nainital-Haldwani road and Nainital-Kaladhungi road were also blocked for public use by the evening. Nearby towns of Bhowali, Mukteshwar and Ramgarh, too, have lost road connectivity. District officials told TOI the railway tracks cannot be repaired until the water level of Gaula recedes. “Trains have been cancelled till October 20. Repairs will begin once the water level goes down. Several roads in the district are blocked and it will take hours to open them to traffic. We have asked hotel and homestay owners to provide food and relief materials to stranded tourists,” said Nainital sub-divisional magistrate Prateek Jain. Meanwhile, the water level of Naini Lake rose a foot above the danger mark on Tuesday and flooded the Mall Road, bringing along several species of fish that inhabit the lake. Tourists and residents were spotted catching fish and taking pictures. “Almost every locality in Nainital is flooded and restaurants and hotels are closed. The administration has asked us to provide food and necessities to the tourists," said Ved Sah, a hotelier from Nainital. Naina Devi temple and the iconic Boathouse Club were also wading in water. Officials said even though all floodgates were opened on Monday, the water level has continued to rise. Low-lying areas in Kumaon Himalayas, too, suffered damage from the rain. A bridge was washed away in Haldwani while an elephant was rescued from being swept away in the strong currents of Gaula.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/3-approach-roads-blocked-as-nainital-cut-off-kathgodam-rail-track-washed-away/articleshow/87143728.cms||Prashant Jha

The woman had left her home for a friend’s birthday celebrations around 11pm, but a couple of hours later, and just 300 metres from her house in Om Vihar, she was spotted by a food delivery executive being attacked by three men. Watch: Woman #stabbed to death allegedly by jilted lover in #Delhi https://t.co/gdXPfsQryl— TOI Delhi (@TOIDelhi) 1634695522000Police said they received a call at 1.20am on Tuesday about the incident on Matiala Road in Om Vihar near Uttam Nagar in west Delhi. The cops found the victim in a pool of blood with a knife lying nearby. She was later identified as Dolly Babbar, who worked as a freelance event organiser. At Dolly’s house, her younger brother, Lakshay, said he had received a call from his sister’s boyfriend about her being in danger. “He informed me that Dolly had rung him up and told him that Ankit Gaba had put a gun to her head and was threatening her,” alleged Lakshay. “Soon after, Dolly’s phone fell silent. Sometime later, policemen arrived to tell us about how she had been found bleeding from stab wounds on her hands, neck, chest and back.” The brother also claimed that Gaba, 25, had been pursuing Dolly for a number of years but she constantly declined his proposals. This was corroborated by Dolly’s cousin, Sanjana, who stated, “For a long time, Ankit has continuously asked her to be in a relationship with him, but she regularly turned him down.” Lakshay also conjectured that the attack could be due to his own affair with Gaba’s younger sister five years ago. Meena Babbar, Dolly’s mother, recalled her leaving home around 11pm for the cake cutting ceremony at a friend’s house. “She told me not to worry and that she would be home by 1am. Around 1.30am, the cops knocked on the doors instead,” the mother said. Dolly, she added, was a strong and a bright woman who looked after the family. She had lost her job during lockdown but had slowly restarted. Her father drives an autorickshaw. The spot where she was killed is alleged to be a meeting spot for antisocials. A neighbour of the Babbars said, “We even put up a CCTV camera there, but someone stole it. Every day, the local boys consume liquor there and threaten us if we speak out about it.” The neighbour also claimed that many of them saw the attack but didn’t dare go to Dolly’s help fearing for their own safety. One of the three accused youth lives near the crime scene. His sister, however, said, “I don’t think my brother could have killed Dolly. He considered her a sister and had accepted a rakhi from her. Yes, he left home and hasn’t returned.” Police have established the presence of Gaba and two friends, both possibly juveniles, at the crime scene. Shankar Choudhary, DCP (Dwarka) said, “The girl was stabbed by a boy who was her alleged ex-lover. A case of murder has been registered.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/23-year-old-stabbed-to-death-killer-believed-to-be-a-youth-she-spurned/articleshow/87144840.cms||Sakshi Chand

The programme, which is being organised at Ayodhya’s VHP headquarters in Karsewakpuram will be attended by over 500 RSS functionaries and coincides with PM Narendra Modi’s visit to eastern UP, where he will inaugurate an international airport at Kushinagar. Besides Bhagwat, Hosabale and Joshi, Sunil Kulkarni and Jagdish Prasad will also attend the event. The RSS chief arrived to a rousing welcome at the RSS office in Faizabad, where he will be staying for three days. The area has been fortified with heavy deployment of policemen. Bhagwat will also visit Hanumangarhi temple and Ramjanmabhoomi and take stock of construction of Ram temple along with members and office-bearers of the temple Trust. Top sources told TOI, Bhagwat has scheduled a meeting with chairman of temple construction committee, Nripendra Mishra, secretary Champat Rai and Trustee Anil Mishra. This comes exactly four months after the Sangh had summoned key Trust members to Mumbai for a closed-door meeting amidst swirling controversy over land deals hammered out by the Trust. Hours before Bhagwat’s arrival, Mishra held a brainstorming session with Trustees and representatives of construction companies — L&T and Tata Consulting Engineers after taking an overview of the construction work at Ramjanmabhoomi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bhagwat-in-ayodhya-to-steer-rss-camp-review-temple-work/articleshow/87145835.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Our previous pleas have been ignored.” The previous plea was made by associations and athletes to the then chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who assured them that stadiums will henceforth not be utilised for election purposes. “Since elections are still some months away which gives the office of the Election Commission sufficient time, some alternative premises can be considered for such election-related procedures,” Heble said in GBA’s appeal to chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday. During the SAG general body meeting last week, Sawant had asked state associations to promote the “Fitness Ka Dose Aadha Ghanta Roz” campaign of the sports ministry. At the same meeting, Goa Table Tennis Association president Vero Nunes raised the issue of stadiums being taken over during elections, disrupting sports activities. “We are shocked to hear that the stadium is being taken over for election purposes, despite apprising the chief minister of the issue during the recently-held SAG general body meeting. “Sports will not come up if there is no continuity in training and there are such disruptions. Government needs to step in and create a model where sports training is taken seriously and sportspersons are groomed to win laurels at the highest level through uninterrupted hours of high-intensity training,” said Nunes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/players-asked-to-make-way-for-evms-at-indoor-stadium-in-campal/articleshow/87170221.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Conman dupes sr cop’s friend with fake FB profile, held from Rajasthan||Kolkata: The CID’s cyber section has caught a 34-year-old man from Rajasthan, who reportedly created a fake Facebook profile of a top Bengal police officer and used it to dupe a friend of the cop into parting with lakhs of rupees. The fraudster, Tausif, reportedly contacted the friend through the fake FB profile and sought financial help, citing emergency. The unsuspecting victim transferred the money, police said. The modus operandi is not new with multiple complaints being reported so far, most of them against members of the Bharatpur gang. “But here, the victim actually paid, convinced it was a genuine appeal for help,” said a DIG at Bhawani Bhawan. So far, very few targets had fallen for the trap, police said. According to police, the fake profile that Tausif created was that of a DG of a police wing of Bengal. He sent a friend request to the cops’ friend and messaged him, asking for the money. Once the fraud came to light and an FIR was lodged, Tausif was traced with the help of the IP address from where the message was sent, a CID source said. Following his arrest last week, Tausif’s mobile, used to create the profile, was confiscated. He was brought to Kolkata and produced in a local court on Tuesday. Fraudsters have created fake online profiles of several cops, including a deputy IG, a commissioner and three superintendents of police, with the intention of conning their contacts. The CID had recently arrested an accused after a fake profile of the director of security, Vivek Sahay, was created in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/conman-dupes-sr-cops-friend-with-fake-fb-profile-held-from-rajasthan/articleshow/87144962.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Power theft of Rs 5.6 crore exposed in western Maharashtra||PUNE: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has exposed power theft worth around Rs 5.64 crore in western Maharashtra over the past three months. Of this, Pune district alone accounts for more than Rs 3 crore. The power distribution company has now initiated criminal action against consumers involved in this theft, under Section 135 of the Indian Electricity Act. MSEDCL recently conducted a special one-day drive for exposing such thefts across Sangli, Satara, Solapur, Kolhapur, and Pune districts in Western Maharashtra, where the theft of power amounting Rs 1.28 crore was exposed across 1,418 locations. “In the past three months, across three drives, we have exposed theft of power amounting to a total of Rs 5.64 crore at 4,983 places across Western Maharashtra,” read the statement from MSEDCL. The statement highlighted that in the special drives, Pune district saw power theft worth Rs 3.41 crore exposed across 2,535 places — the highest in Western Maharashtra. MSEDCL’s acting Pune regional director Ankush Nale has asked the authorities concerned to initiate stringent action against those involved in such illegal activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/power-theft-of-rs-5-6-crore-exposed-in-western-maha/articleshow/87144808.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra's weekly shot count slips in October||PUNE: The first two weeks of October recorded the lowest weekly vaccination count in Maharashtra since August-end despite the launch of mission ‘Kavach Kundal’ in the second week of the month to cover maximum beneficiaries. CoWIN statistics showed that Maharashtra was administering over 50 lakh-odd shots each week in September, which dropped to 36-43 lakh-odd jabs each in the first two weeks of October, in spite of enough vaccine dose availability in the state. A senior health department official said, “The average number of jabs administered in October dropped in comparison to September, mainly because of festive season, including Navaratra. The authorities had predicted this because many women tend to fast during the nine days of the festival. They avoid vaccination during festive and fasting periods, lest they experience minor side-effects.” The official said mission Kavach Kundal has now been extended till November 2 and the citizens’ response to vaccination has increased after the festival. “Some districts and municipal bodies have demanded further extension of the mission now,” the official said. The public health department plans to increase the pace of vaccination to an average 10-12 lakh jabs in the state per day till Diwali. “If at all a drop in vaccination turnout is witnessed during Diwali, which starts from November 4, these numbers will stand Maharashtra in good stead. We plan to conduct maximum vaccinations before November 4, as the festival could coincide with many taking a break and heading out for small vacations,” the official said. State officials said there were currently around 60 lakh doses available in the state, in addition to the tentative quantity of nearly 30-35 lakh doses that the state receives every week. The state has been getting an average of 1.80 crore vaccine doses in a month since recently. The officials said the long gap of 84 days between two Covishield doses might have had a role to play in drop in October jab count. Dr Kapil Zirpe, member of the Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit at Ruby Hall Clinic, said with the second wave waning, it seems that many have let their guards down. “This may also have had a role to play in vax numbers dropping, apart from the festive season. Covid-appropriate behaviour is also being flouted, which is a matter of concern.” Dr Zirpe said some might have also stayed away from jabs during the recent festivities because minor side-effects after vaccination could be a downer in such periods of fun. Experts said as vaccination has become part of routine in the last few months, people might have started taking it casually. “Vaccination was a hot topic till a few months ago, but now seems to have become a routine for many. The government should once again start promoting vaccination in a big way. If Covid is to become endemic, vaccination will have a major role to play,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mahas-weekly-shot-count-slips-in-oct/articleshow/87144800.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Dehradun||Video of tusker stuck in swollen Gaula river has activists fuming||Dehradun: Spurring a debate on whether Corbett and Rajaji National Park should remain open through the year is a viral video of an elephant stuck in the middle of the raging Gaula river in Nainital. The tusker, however, passed through the struggle of reaching ashore, forest officials said. Pictures of landslides and swollen rivers, too, have left activists fuming. “Both parks have rivers and torrents flowing through them and this was the main reason why these were shut till November for wildlife to be at peace. The state of affairs and what tourists are experiencing will only bring bad publicity affecting tourism in our state,” said Reenu Paul, a Doon-based green activist. Seconding the activist’s views, Padma Shri recipient, Anoop Shah, who explored Corbett on foot during the 70s to get a glimpse of tigers, feels the move will bring behavioural changes in animals. “In the early 70s, clicking a picture of Corbett’s tiger used to be a task but now they are the easiest ones to be photographed. While elephants, which were gentle at that time, have now become aggressive as they charge at the smallest of movement.” Shah feels such changes are a “result of too much disturbance that we are causing to animals in their habitat therefore, it is imperative that national parks should be closed for a certain duration”. Also, experts are of the view that measures are needed for the upkeep of Corbett and Rajaji. With an aim to boost economy and generate jobs, Corbett National Park has, this year, thrown open its Bijrani, Dhela, Jhirna and Garzia for night stay commencing October 15. Usually, Bijrani zone is opened for tourism only with Dhikala zone on November 15, while Dhela, Jhirna and Garzia are opened only for day visits. Rajaji Tiger Reserve was also thrown open for tourists in the first week of and only after NTCA’s direction, its core zone was shut for tourism activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/video-of-tusker-stuck-in-swollen-gaula-river-has-activists-fuming/articleshow/87143744.cms||Shivani Azad

A proposal regarding the same has been put forth in the standing committee meeting. The district had received around 2.5 lakh syringes for from the state earlier. The PCMC has a target population of around 17 lakh. Of them, about 14 lakh have received their first shots, while around 7.34 lakh beneficiaries have received both the shots. As per the district health office, Pune would receive highest number of Covid vaccine doses in the remaining part of October because the state has promised more doses than that supplied in September this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-to-buy-5l-syringes-for-covid-vax/articleshow/87144826.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||Right to bail comes before that of continuing probe, says Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: While issuing directions to ensure the right of an accused for bail by default, Delhi high court said being set free took precedence over the right of the prosecution to carry on investigation and submit a chargesheet. Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri, in his 24-page judgment, said, “The right to seek default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC is a fundamental right and not merely a statutory right, which flows from Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It has been held to be an indefeasible part of the right to personal liberty under Article 21 and such a right cannot be suspended even during a pandemic.” TimesViewMany undertrials are socially and economically disadvantaged. They can hardly know the intricacies of the law. That makes it even more incumbent on authorities to give them due consideration and care when dealing with petitions. The Delhi High Court has rightly issued a slew of directions to streamline the process.The judgment came on a petition by an accused against a trial court’s order by which his revision plea seeking default bail was dismissed. The man was arrested on January 18, 2020 in a dowry death case and sent to judicial custody the next day. A magistrate court kept extending his custody. During the pandemic, his custody was extended till April 29, 2020. The maximum period for which the petitioner could have been put under judicial custody was 90 days and if the chargesheet was not filed within that time, the accused was entitled to default bail. In this case, the period came to an end on April 18, 2020. The court said, “When the petitioner was produced before the jail visiting magistrate on April 15, 2020, the magistrate without any application of mind and rather unmindful of the fact that 90 days were expiring on April 18, mechanically extended the petitioner’s judicial custody till April 29.” It added that the order of remanding an undertrial or extension of custody was held to be a judicial function requiring due application of mind. The high court directed that while extending the custody of an undertrial prisoner, the magistrate/court should not mechanically extend it for the maximum period of 15 days as prescribed under Section 167(2) CrPC. It said the custody should be extended while keeping in mind the 60th, 90th or 180th day of completing the investigation and submission of chargesheet. “The undertrial shall be produced before the court concerned on the next day, ie on the 61st, 91st or 181st day, so that he can be duly informed of his fundamental right to seek default bail if no chargesheet is filed in the maximum period prescribed or the permitted extended period of investigation,” added the court. The court also directed the district legal services authority to ensure that the remand advocates/legal aid counsels were instructed to keep an undertrial informed of his right to seek default bail and the date of accrual of such right. The jail authorities would also have a corresponding obligation to inform the undertrial of the same. The judge also modified the format of custody warrant and included a column indicating the day on which the right of “default bail” would accrue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/right-to-bail-comes-before-that-of-continuing-probe/articleshow/87144833.cms||---

Over the past four months, nearly 81,124 names were deleted. “Of the 7,600 names to be deleted from the 21 assembly constituencies, the maximum names are from Hadapsar,” the official said. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI that the process to delete the duplicate names in the electoral roll was taken up on a priority basis. “We had regular weekly follow-ups with all the officials associated with the process over the past three months. We have finally managed to reduce the number of duplicate names. The process to delete the remaining 7,600 names will be over soon,” he said. Another district election official said the process to update and check the voters list was delayed due to the Covid pandemic last year. “There were difficulties in getting the booth-level officers, as they were assigned for Covid duty. This had delayed the process. The activities, however, resumed this year,” the official said. The process to delete the duplicate names involves giving a notice to the address of the voter, following it up with filling up Form 7 and then the panchnama by the booth-level officers. The booth-level officers have to personally verify that the person is not at the address by checking with his or her neighbours and then sending a notice to the last address mentioned in the voters’ list. The administration is optimistic to verify and delete the 7,600 names within time. “We should be able to do it in the three months ahead of the final roll publication. We managed to narrow down the figures in the last three months. We have received a huge number of applications for new enrolment and also changes in address. Work on this is also on,” deputy election officer Mrinalini Sawant said. 7.6k duplicate names in dist poll roll remain for deletionPune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Mumbai, Thane, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Panvel, Mira-Bhayander, Solapur, Nashik, Malegaon, Parbhani, Nanded-Waghala, Latur, Amravati, Akola, Nagpur and Chandrapur will go to the polls in February-March 2022.

Pune district has 78.87 lakh registered voters. Of the 4 lakh voters who did not have their photographs on the electoral roll, 2.44 lakh have to update their pictures. The process of electoral list update will continue after the draft roll publication on November 1. The final electoral roll will be published on January 5. State chief electoral officer Shrikant Deshpande has directed all the district administrations to step up the voter registration drive, especially in colleges. He has also directed the officials to ensure registration of more migrant workers engaged in industries. Associations representing industries have been requested to conduct voter registration camps Election officials have urged citizens to check their names on the voter helpline mobile app and carry out corrections or updates online. The voter-centric services, which include new registration, form for deletion, correction, change in address, are all part of the app.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/7-6k-duplicate-names-in-dist-poll-roll-remain-for-deletion/articleshow/87144822.cms||Nisha Nambiar

It has also warned of fining the violators from November 1. MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar said several establishments have failed to comply with the guidelines as per the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules-2016 and MCC Solid Waste Treatment Bylaws. “In accordance with SWM rules and the MCC bylaws, apartments and establishments (hotels, hospitals, lodges, wedding halls, catering, and the like) with more than 30 households have been mandated to construct on-site composting units and process the waste at source. Several notices regarding the same have been issued to all such bulk solid waste generators. Still, the directions have received fewer responses. At present, the Karnataka high court is hearing a writ petition on SWM by MCC. A government inquiry is under way into the progress made in implementing SWM measures by the civic body,” the commissioner said. Apartments that fail to comply with the rules will have to deposit Rs 15 per flat at the beginning of the month. The fine receipts must be handed to sanitation workers before handing over solid waste. This will be followed by a fine of Rs 25 per flat in the second month. In case of failure to produce the challan, waste will be rejected and legal action will be initiated against bulk waste generators, the commissioner warned. The fine challans can be collected from the health department of MCC, he said, adding that citizens may contact 0824-220310 (318) for details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mcc-warns-action-against-bulk-waste-generators/articleshow/87142702.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: Upper Sileru pumped storage project gets govt nod||VISAKHAPATNAM: Amid the ongoing coal supply shortage, the state government has given in-principle approval to Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation (AP Genco) to execute pumped storage hydroelectric project at Upper Sileru in Visakhapatnam district by exploring the most techno-economic feasible option. The state government has directed APGenco to take steps for installing reversible pumps in the Sileru system to integrate it with solar and wind power for grid stabilisation. The objective of the project is to generate 1,350 MW of power during peak hours. For the project, the AP Genco will utilise 1.7 TMC ft of water from the Guntawada reservoir (upper) at Upper Sileru, and pump 1.7 TMC of water from Donkarayi reservoir (lower) back to the Guntawada reservoir during the off-peak hours. The project will also help maintain grid stability during the times of sudden fluctuations. The project will provide round-the-clock power to consumers and help meet future energy demand in the state, officials said. Managing director, AP Genco, B Sreedhar, said that about 410 hectares of land will be required to install the project. “The installed capacity of the project is 1350 MW (nine units with each unit having a 150 MW capacity) The Genco completed topographical and hydrographic survey. The geotechnical investigation is about 77% finished. The Upper Sileru pumped storage hydro project is considered to be the biggest in the state after Srisailam and Polavaram hydro projects,” said Sreedhar. “WAPCOS Limited, the consultancy firm wholly owned by the Union ministry of Jal Shakti, has been entrusted with the responsibility of preparing a detailed project report, including obtaining all clearances for the establishment of pumped storage project at Upper Sileru,” added Sreedhar. According to the state energy officials, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked the officials to coordinate with Sigareni Collieries, Coal India and others to procure more coal for the AP Genco’s thermal power plants to improve power generation in the state. The chief minister also asked them to explore all ways for better transportation of coal to the state and coordinate with the Union government to transport coal through Shipping Corporation of India. Energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said that the chief minister directed the energy department to fully focus on long-term measures to strengthen the power sector and enhance energy security.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/upper-sileru-pumped-storage-project-gets-govt-nod/articleshow/87144831.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

TRS working president KT Rama Rao said that he will be visiting Tamil Nadu along with senior party leaders after November 15. During his recent conversation with two DMK MPs, KTR had reportedly discussed about the DMK’s organisational structure. “We want to study the model and organisational structures of both DMK and AIADMK,” a TRS general secretary said. Party sources said the two regional parties in Tamil Nadu have a strong presence and in the past few decades have gone from strength to strength while national parties like Congress and BJP have been struggling to make inroads in that state. Sources said the ruling TRS has 66 lakh members across the state and organisational committees right from village to state level. The party is going to convene its plenary in the next few days and elect its president. KTR said a regional party like TRS surviving and strengthening was no joke. He said in the undivided AP, only two political parties — TDP founded by NT Rama Rao in 1982 and TRS formed by K Chandrasekhar Rao in 2001 — have emerged as strong regional parties. Party sources said KTR had a chat with the two DMK MPs who met him while handing over a letter of Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin seeking KCR’s support on abolition of NEET. On NEET, KTR said they may not sail with Tamil Nadu as several students from Telangana were pursuing medicine course in other states. “Any decision will be taken in the best interests of Telangana students,” he said. He said after the November 15 public meeting, the TRS would conduct training classes — from ministers to ward leaders — for nine months across the state. On groupism and infighting within the party in various districts, KTR said this reflected the party’s inner strength.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No blood alcohol test, drink-driving not proved, says court||MUMBAI: A magistrate court recently acquitted a Colaba resident booked in 2019 for drunken driving after the police admitted that they had neither obtained his blood sample nor recorded the statement of any other person at the spot. “To sum up the glaring features emanating from the evidence on record, it is crystal clear that there is no evidence on record to conclude that the accused drove the vehicle under influence of alcohol at the relevant time, therefore, by mere stretch of imagination it cannot be concluded that way. The prosecution has miserably failed to prove guilt of the accused,” the court said. Niraj Yadav was booked at a nakabandi near Badhwar Park, Cuffe Parade, at 2.30 am on January 1, 2019, after a breath-analyser showed alcohol. Yadav was booked under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act, which prescribes a maximum sentence of six months for anyone found guilty of driving drunk or under the influence of drugs. Under the section, to qualify as “drunken driving” alcohol exceeding 30 mg per 100 ml of blood has to be detected in a breath-analyzer test. Yadav pleaded not guilty. The prosecution examined only one witness, the police official who booked Yadav. The court said the breath-analyzer report was not proved. “One more important point is that there are no details of the alleged vehicle possessed by the accused at the relevant time … . In the background, except the bare words of this sole witness, there is no even other corroboration on record to support the prosecution story,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-blood-alcohol-test-drink-driving-not-proved-in-mumbai-court/articleshow/87146313.cms||Rebecca Samervel

A not-for-profit organisation has been using narrative songs, known as Bharud, to educate rural communities about the dos and don’ts in situations where they spot a leopard or find themselves confronted by the animal. Sumedh Tarde, head of projects and communications at ResQ, said, “When we found that one of our volunteers has been performing Bharud, we thought of adapting it to convey the message of man-animal conflict to villagers.” He added, “ The performances revolve around why leopards are being spotted on agricultural land, animal behaviour, safety precautions that need to be taken by humans for themselves and their families, and what to do if one finds oneself in front of a leopard.” A team of five performers, including Anil Sawale Maharaj, a Bharud performer and volunteer at ResQ, have hosted two such sessions, spreading awareness about human-wildlife conflict, through songs in Manjri village in Haveli Tehsil and Kasarsai village in Paud Taluka, each with over 100 villagers in attendance. ResQ aims to take this initiative to villages around Pune where leopards have been spotted in recent times. A volunteer at the NGO said that the initiative has struck a chord with villagers. “We have seen an increase in participation from villagers after the Bharud sessions,” he said. A villager who attended one of the Bharud sessions said, “The session caught our attention because it was presented in a different manner. This form of poetry involves use of puns, which are amusing and make it easy for us to remember. The children also enjoy learning in this fun way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lessons-in-verses-on-human-wildlife-conflict-strike-a-chord-with-villagers/articleshow/87144844.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Delhi||Delhi court raps Tihar Jail authorities for ‘vague’ med report despite its order||NEW DELHI: Non-compliance with the direction of any court is not only a serious misconduct on part of the jail authorities but also constitutes a penal offence under Indian Penal Code, additional sessions judge Anuj Agrawal said after the Tihar Jail authorities sent a “vague” report about an undertrial whose health condition was serious. The court’s observations came after the medical officer, in charge of the Tihar Jail dispensary, submitted the “vague” report and the jail authorities forwarded it in a “mechanical manner” without going through it. The judge noted that the jail authorities did not make any effort to ascertain the medical condition of the undertrial before releasing him on interim bail. It said that in the report, which was sought from the jail superintendent concerned for the just adjudication of the accused’s bail plea moved on the ground of his precarious health condition, it had been mentioned that the undertrial was hospitalised on October 1 and released on interim bail by the court on October 9. “It has further been mentioned that no further medical status can be submitted in view of his release from the jail.” The report of the medical officer is “as vague as it can be. Even the jail superintendent has forwarded the same in a mechanical manner... and without making any effort for ascertaining the medical condition of the applicant prior to his release, more so he himself had written a letter dated 08.10.2021 regarding serious health condition of the applicant”, the judge said in the order. The court then directed the director general (prisons) of Tihar Jail to file a detailed medical condition of the accused before his release. After receiving the detailed medical report, the court warned both officers to be careful. In the detailed report, it was mentioned that the accused was even shifted to the ICU. “It has further been reported that the accused was managed in the ICU for a few days. Further, the general condition of the accused is stated to be not stable as per standard protocol,” the court said. In view of his precarious health condition, the court granted him bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 10,000 with one surety of the like amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-raps-tihar-for-vague-med-report-despite-its-order/articleshow/87144860.cms||Usha Das

To add aesthetic value and free up space, bins were installed at 28 places in the city at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore. The best part is these bins can be emptied into garbage trucks using a crane without sanitisation workers’ help. The project drew appreciation and was considered successful in the beginning but with the passage of time, it fizzled out. “One can see garbage outside bins, which defeats the purpose of their installation. Though vehicles come to lift garbage every day, those are unable to clean the entire place as every nook and corner is littered,” said Mahesh Kangar, a grocery shop owner at Kargi chowk. The bins have a capacity ranging from 1.5-3.5 metric tonnes. A senior health official in the city said they needed to increase the number of bins to at least 100 and the capacity to 4 metric tonnes to keep up with the garbage generation in the city. Meanwhile, in residential areas, many feel it is the public who is to blame for the situation. “Instead of paying nominal fee for door-to-door garbage collection, residents choose to dispose of waste in the corner of streets. There are several unauthorised dumping sites in prominent residential areas, which is only adding to the problem. They don't even put in the efforts to throw garbage in bins,” said Yesh Veer Arya, a Canal road resident. The city is replete with such dumping sites in areas like Dalanwala and Race Course. Around 90 vehicles are engaged in garbage collection but sources say more are needed, adding that there should be more underground bins. Four years after they were first installed, the number of the binsremains the same. “We are working to identify more spots in the city where these bins can be installed,” said Kailash Joshi, chief health officer, DMC. Officials claim the system is working smoothly and garbage collection is being done round the clock. The city also has at least 200 sets of dry and wet waste garbage bins, and produces between 350-400 metric tonnes waste per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/underground-bins-fail-to-rid-city-of-litter/articleshow/87143775.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Fish is a good source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids which help heart. While the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends per capita fish consumption to be 18 kg, it is just 8.07 kg in Andhra Pradesh. The state has a 974-km coastline and has rivers, canals, reservoirs, lakes and other waters bodies suitable for fishing and setting up of fish tanks. As per estimates, Andhra Pradesh produces over 42 lakh tonnes of fish per year and exports it to various parts in the country and abroad. People from Lakshadweep consume more fish, 105.6 kg per person, followed Andaman and Nicobar Islands which has an annual per capita fish consumption of 59.01 kg. Speaking to TOI, P Laxman Rao, joint director, fisheries department, said the fish consumption in state is low when compared to most of the states in the country. AP is not alone in lack of appetite for fish in the country, fish is the ‘last thing’ in a few other states. “Aiming to provide fish to every household and increase its consumption to help the aqua farmers, AP government has decided to set up aqua hubs and supply quality products to consumers at affordable prices. People can get live fish, fresh fish and ready to eat fish and also dry fish at the hubs. Vizag city will contribute 15 fish hubs,” said Laxman Rao. Consumption of chicken is more compared to fish in AP. The average demand for chicken meat (broiler and country chicken- ‘Naatu Kodi’) is over 10 lakh kg per day in the state. “Some people don’t choose fish claiming it is smelly and needs to be cleaned patiently. So, there is more demand for broiler chicken than fish,” said T Appala Raju, president of Broiler Chicken Association in North Andhra Pradesh. Besides omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D and B2, fish is rich in calcium and phosphorus and is a good source of minerals such as zinc, iodine and iron. Eating fish at least two times a week is good for health, expert feel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-tops-in-fishery-lags-in-consumption/articleshow/87144847.cms||Nalla.Babu

On the first of the three-day programme to count carnivores, the focus will on be identifying evidence like pug marks, scats and scratch marks, the officials said. Forest range officer D Prabhakar Rao said that over 70 percent of the forest staff pertaining to 36 beats are taking the survey this year. On the directions of the national tiger conservation authority (NTCA), the officials are now recording data on a mobile application. For this, an Android-based app Monitoring System for Tiger Intensive Protection & Ecolological Staus (M-Stripes) has been developed. “All the data, including the pug marks, scat and other signs of carnivores that we record on the ground will directly reach NTCA through the mobile application. This has made the process quick and easy for the field staff,” said Rao. Forest range officials from Telangana were sent to Bandipur to get trained in using the app before the survey began. The exercise will conclude on October 25.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) issued a clarification after political parties objected to the works and residents started protesting under the banner of “Taljai Bachav Abhiyan”. A group of NGOs recently met Shiv Sena leader Sachin Ahir and demanded intervention of the state environment ministry in the matter, following which the PMC issued the statement. A group of citizens had carried out a signature campaign at Taljai hills to raise their voice against the project. Residents claimed that the project would hamper the hill’s flora and fauna, while the proposed concrete structures would disturb the ecology. “The PMC plans to safeguard and secure the local trees as well as the species. No indigenous trees have been uprooted for the project,” stated the PMC’s Monday release. It added that the civic body had no plans to carry out concreting work at the site. The jogging track would be built with natural resources. The Pagoda and gazebo would also be built with environment-free material, the civic body stated. The PMC has finalized the plan for the biodiversity park, which will be built on 107 acres for Rs120 crore. Activists said many people go to the hill for morning and evening walks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/biodiversity-park-wont-harm-environment-says-civic-body/articleshow/87144851.cms||---

Data obtained from city mandis shows that prices of tomato have seen a hike of 50%, onion 37.5%, potato 50%, spinach 50%, brinjal 25%, capsicum 50%, lemon 25% and coriander 20% since October 1. Mandi association members attributed decline in supply from other states following rain and fuel price hike as main factors behind the spike in cost and said that the upward trend is expected to continue in the coming days. People who are battling with a financial crunch due to the pandemic, said they have to cut down on expenses to spare money for food. “The cost of a plate of healthy meals has increased by 10-15% in just 15 days. Besides, petrol prices have crossed Rs 102 per litre. The cost of a litre of mustard oil is over Rs 200. It is becoming difficult to manage in Rs 30,000 income for my family of six,” said Sunil Srivastava, an adhoc computer operator in a government department. Rimjhim Singh, a private school teacher, said her family has not bought any clothes this festival season. “My husband is also a teacher and the majority of the income goes to EMIs for house and car, besides school fees of two kids and medicines for in-laws. Earlier, we were able to save some amount, but now there is no saving,” she said. Janak Verma, a security guard who earns Rs 12,000 per month, said he had to get his two-room house in Balaganj repaired and white-washed this Diwali, but has now shelved the plan. Arti Tiwari, a housewife, said, “Potatoes, onions and tomatoes are the staple of any kitchen, but if prices continue to rise like this, there will be no taste left in our food.” General secretary, fruits and vegetable traders’ association, Dubagga, Shahnawaz Hussain said, “There is a shortage in supply of tomatoes and onions from Nashik following rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/short-supply-of-veggies-triggers-spurt-in-prices-in-festive-season/articleshow/87145856.cms||Pranchal Srivastava
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Covid vaccination turnout in October dips, target might be delayed||LUCKNOW: The steady upward trend of average daily Covid vaccinations has taken a dip in October. Health department officers attribute the drop to low turnout due to festival season. Experts, however, warn that people should not delay vaccination for any reason. The drop in the pace of vaccination also means that the target to fully vaccinate the entire adult population of Lucknow by the first week of January will be delayed by a month. The mass immunisation campaign against Covid-19 began on January 16. Initially, the drive was only open for healthcare and frontline workers, but gradually was expanded to all aged 18 years or above. The vaccination rate increased rapidly in August and September with the health department organising several mega drives involving non-government and religious organisations. However, the rate of vaccination in October so far has been 26,151 daily, a decline of 31% in comparison to September’s 38,018 average inoculations per day. As on date, of Lucknow’s 36 lakh adult population, 13.2 lakh (37%) people have been fully vaccinated with two doses, while 16.4 lakh people have received a shot and are waiting for the gap period to be over to get the second. About 6.4 lakh individuals have not received any dose so far. This means that to cover the entire remaining population, the health department will have to administer 29.2 lakh doses. With the current pace of vaccination, it will take at least 112 days (till February first week) to fully vaccinate every adult with the two-dose course. Earlier, based on September’s rate, the estimate was that this target will be achieved by January first week. Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said that many people avoided vaccination during Navratra as they were on fast. He added that he was confident that the turnout for vaccinations will increase after Diwali. “We will organise more mega drives to compensate for the decline in October,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vax-turnout-in-oct-dips-target-might-be-delayed/articleshow/87145862.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

These agents get entry into the premises of the hospital to collect samples of patients who require some specialized tests which cannot be performed in the in-house lab of the GMCH. However, some of them were seen misleading some poor patients and collecting their samples for general tests available in the hospital. GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta told TOI that that entry of such agents will be banned in hospital from now. “With the help of our security guards, we have detected at least 10 such persons who represent private laboratories and roam around the casualty and other wards. They were misleading the poor and illiterate patients,” said Dr Gupta. Many patients coming from the periphery consider these agents as employees and staffers of the GMCH and do not file any complaint against them. Recently, a patient had filed a complaint with Medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande. “Almost all important tests can be conducted in GMCH itself. However, the private agents get entry illegally and they mislead the patients. They ask for money and collect samples from the wards. Eight such agents were caught while taking samples, and the GMCH administration has handed them over to police,” said Dr Gawande. However, whether the directors and owners of the private labs involved in these activities will face action or not is still not clear. Dr Gawande has appealed to the patients not to fall prey to such agents as all major tests are done in the GMCH lab itself. For some specialized tests, the GMCH health workers collect the samples and the hospital sends it to specialized labs like in AIIMS, Nagpur. Patients are not charged any fees for such arrangements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/private-lab-agents-misleading-patients-at-gmch-to-face-action/articleshow/87144877.cms||---

Alarmed by the incidents, TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu approached the Union home ministry and sought security by central forces. He alleged that YSRCP activists were involved in the attacks. Naidu also called governor Biswabhushan Harichandan over phone and explained to him the series of attacks on party offices in the state. He also briefed senior officials in the Union home ministry. TDP sources said the home ministry has agreed to deploy central forces at party office in Mangalagiri. The attacks on TDP offices and residences of a few TDP leaders created tension in the state. Though there was no official confirmation on who the attackers were, the TDP chief blamed the YSRCP leadership. He alleged that YSRC leaders encouraged party cadres to attack rival party offices and residence of opposition leaders. The attackers hurled stones at TDP central office. The window panes were damaged in the incident. The assailants also damaged a few cars parked in the party office. A cameraman was reportedly injured in the incident. The TDP cadres, who were present at Mangalagiri office when the attack took place, rushed out of the office in panic. The TDP cadres staged a rasta roko on national highway in protest against the attack, resulting in heavy traffic jam on NH 16. Similarly, unidentified people attacked TDP leader Kommareddi Pattabhiram’s residence in Vijayawada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tdp-chief-seeks-security-as-offices-attacked/articleshow/87144888.cms||Samdani MN
---||Pune||Damaged kidney among death causes in black fungus: Study||PUNE: Chronic kidney disease and sudden (acute) kidney impairment can increase the chances of deaths in patients with Covid associated mucormycosis, a collaborative study of Pune doctors has revealed. The most commonly known factor for contracting mucormycosis in recovering Covid patients is the combination of uncontrolled diabetes and the use of steroids. Though diabetes is the predisposing factor to contracting mucormycosis in Covid patients, the doctors have not found its association with mortality. The impact of diabetes on mortality in patients with Covid associated mucormycosis (CAM) — an invasive fungal infection — needs further evaluation in a more extensive study, the doctors have underlined. “Mortality rates vary substantially in various studies of CAM. However, studies assessing the predictors of mortality in CAM are lacking. In this study, we aimed to determine the predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with CAM,” chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe, the study’s lead researcher, said. The doctors included 84 patients diagnosed with CAM and referred to the Ruby Hall Clinic between March and May 2021 in the single-centre, retrospective, observational study. Clinical, laboratory and in-hospital outcomes were noted. They analysed factors associated with in-hospital mortality in these patients with CAM. Of the 84 CAM patients analysed in the study, 15 who succumbed during the treatment either had chronic kidney disease (CKD) [3] or acute renal failure (12). “In patients with Covid-19, CKD incidence is higher (4.09%) compared to the general population (0.46%). The presence of CKD increases mortality significantly. This is also clear from our observation that mortality increases in CAM patients who develop AKI (Acute kidney impairment) during the course of the treatment,” said Zirpe, also a member of the Covid task force in Pune. Besides CKD, spread of mucormycosis to eye and brain spaces, and the use of the drug tocilizumab were significantly associated with high mortality rate. “We have analysed that the involvement or spread of mucormycosis in the brain (intracranial) and eyes (orbital) increases the fatality rate to as high as 90%,” Zirpe said. The doctors also analysed the use of tocilizumab in Covid patients who went on to develop CAM and its impact on mortality. “Though the use of immunomodulators like tocilizumab are possibly indicated to be implicated in CAM, no current evidence identifies if prior use of tocilizumab is associated with increased mortality in CAM. However, we observed significantly increased odds of in-hospital mortality when tocilizumab was used in the management of Covid-19 infection,” Zirpe said. The take-home message is clear. Ensuring that the patient does not slip into renal dysfunction during the treatment and appropriate medical/surgical care is rendered to arrest the spread of mucormycosis to eyes/brain are the keys to avoid deaths in Covid patients with mucormycosis. “Careful clearance of damaged sinus tissues in the face’s deeper region — pterygopalatine fossa — is key to prevent mucormycosis spread to the eyes and brain,” said Sassoon hospital’s ENT surgeon Sameer Joshi, who has treated several CAM patients with excellent recovery rate. Earlier this month, health experts had said steroids should be used rationally in Covid-19 patients to reduce the risk of mucormycosis, popularly called black fungus infection, if there is a third wave. Besides, the experts said, diabetes patients needed to take extra precautions because mucormycosis was common among diabetics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/damaged-kidney-among-death-causes-in-black-fungus-study/articleshow/87143832.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The father of the newborn had complained to police that the hospital handed him a male baby during discharge, though the hospital records show the mother gave birth to a baby girl. Musthafa, a resident of Koteshwara in Kundapur, complained that his wife Amreen had delivered a baby girl at the hospital on September 27. In his complaint at Mangaluru North police, Musthafa alleged the hospital kept the baby in NICU for 17 days and on October 14 they handed over a baby boy, instead of a girl during discharge. Meanwhile, the hospital authorities had stated the baby born to Amreen was a boy and not a girl. They have also denied any possibility of the baby being exchanged as alleged. According to hospital authorities, the gender of the baby was wrongly written in the case sheet as female, instead of male. Musthafa said the court granted permission for DNA tests on parents and baby based on his request. “We requested the court to grant permission to conduct DNA tests. The court has granted permission for it,” he added. Sources said the samples will be sent for DNA tests either to Hyderabad or Bengaluru. Mangaluru North police had registered an FIR against the hospital on October 15. The investigation will continue based on the DNA reports, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/court-permits-dna-test-in-baby-exchange-case/articleshow/87142750.cms||---

Burning crackers with toxic metals that are life-threatening or sowing crackers and nurturing a new life? For those who would go with the latter, meet the 100 farm labourers and home makers from Paradsinga, a small village about 60 kilometres from Nagpur, who have launched a battle of ‘Barood versus Beej’. Producing probably the first seed crackers in the country, these women have launched the project under the Gram Art Project (GAP). “These crackers are handmade and contain local seeds, ethically sourced by local farmers and forest dwellers. A replica of real crackers, these ones have been made by using recycled paper and designed by a team of dedicated graphic designers,” said Shweta Bhattad, renowned artist and co-worker of GAP. Dangerous chemicals present in conventional crackers have been replaced by a variety of seeds — the microgreen ladi contains seeds of red amaranthus, green amaranthus, senna tora, radish, mustard, purslane and spinach; tikli comprises of coriander seeds, rocket has cucumber seeds, while anaar and laxmi bomb have seeds of golden shower tree, agasti and sonapatti and okra respectively. The idea behind the initiative was to find a healthy alternative for crackers. “There has been a lot of discussion on ban on crackers. We realized that people have sentiments attached with crackers and children too want them. So, we decided to create something which looks exactly like firecrackers but does not harm human health, environment, animals and birds,” said Bhattad. To celebrate a conscious Diwali, all you have to do is soak these crackers in water for 1-2 hours, then sow the seeds in wet mud. And you’ll soon see the benefits of your healthy reaping. “All the seeds can be planted in kitchen garden, pots or any open space. We have chosen local seeds instead of hybrid ones so that you can share what you grow,” added Bhattad. Does the artist think that it would be difficult for people to give up crackers as often they are attached with religious sentiments? “I don’t think any religion promotes harming the environment or humans. Lord Ram himself was a nature lover. It’s time to start a constructive debate on these practices,” she said. To support rural women and save the environment, one can buy these crackers at www.gramartproject.org.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/barood-vs-beej-battle-to-spark-green-diwali/articleshow/87144895.cms||Manka Behl

Around 65 BJP councillors met top RSS leader in the party’s state unit Chandra Shekhar on Tuesday demanding the removal of Dhabai. BJP Councillors at JMC Greater said it was clear that Dhabai, a BJP councillor, was working on the orders of the state Congress government. A BJP councillor said, “This is a really sad state of affairs in the Greater corporation. No work is going on in the system and officials are not working as per our needs. We have been humiliated by the officials. We just want RSS to take some action against Dhabai.” BJP councillors had lunch in a hotel before going to meet Chandra Shekhar, RSS member at his office. Sources said that Shekhar has given them assurance that RSS will try to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Another Councillor said that none of the BJP councillors was given importance in the corporation and no development work was going on. “We are fed up with the current working scenario of the corporation. We want RSS to take some action against the officiating mayor. If this is not going to be done, we will take matters into our own hands,” said a councillor. While no councillor was ready to come on record, when asked for an official quote councillor Sukhpreet Bansal said that the meeting was a ‘regular one’ and no discussion was held regarding the mayor. “It was nothing serious. We BJP councillors just met our higher officials to discuss routine matters,” said Bansal. In the meeting, Paras Jain, suspended BJP councillor was also present. The matter of suspension of mayor Somya Gurjar and three councillors is sub-judice in the court. Till the matter is decided, new elections cannot be conducted but with such opposition in the party, some decisions may be made on the level of high command.

---||Nagpur||Follow etiquettes, maintain decorum: HC to law officer||Nagpur: Taking a government law officer to task, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court warned him to follow etiquettes and maintain decorum of the judiciary. “As we were in the midst of dictating orders, the law officer, representing the collector here, came forward and started making submissions. Stopping the dictation, we heard him. He says that the salary to each and every such doctor has been paid. We must note here with disapproval that he is not supposed to address the court and that too by interfering in the process of dictation of an order,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said. The censuring came while hearing a suo motu PIL based on a TOI report regarding severe bed shortage during the Covid pandemic earlier this year with Shreerang Bhandarkar being appointed amicus curiae. The bench, however, pardoned law officer VR Bhute after he tendered an unconditional apology. “We find that he may not be well conversant with the court’s decorum or otherwise he would not have continued with his submissions. We accept his apology and request him to be more careful in future. The copy of this order should be sent to the collector for information and response,” the judges said. While disposing of an application, they further asked the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to relieve the doctors on bond whose services have been temporarily provided under HC’s directives with immediate effect. Earlier, intervener’s counsel M Anil Kumar pointed out that he has received information from some doctors that no salary has been paid to them. “The collector is directed to verify as to whether or not the salary has been paid to any of such doctors. If not then ensure that the same shall be paid within 15 days from the date of the order,” the bench said. Another application was filed seeking permission to divert the CSR fund of MOIL of Rs3.5 crore for installation of cryogenic oxygen plants proposed at two places — Umrer and Saoner Taluka. “However, details of the plant and estimate and sanction for administrative approval accorded for these works have not been placed on record. We request government pleader Ketki Joshi to place all these details in the form of an additional affidavit together with all relevant documents on or before the next date,” the judges noted. Representing Lata Mangeshkar Hospital, its counsel Akshay Naik informed that the Maharashtra government is yet to comply with the HC’s June 2 order on reimbursement of the scholarship fees. “The time given for compliance was two weeks from the date of submission of the list of the eligible students. The list was submitted on June 5. We request the government pleader to seek instructions in the matter. If it is found that this order has not been still complied with, we further request her to ask the authorities to comply with the order of this court before further directives are issued,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/follow-etiquettes-maintain-decorum-hc-to-law-officer/articleshow/87144918.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

So far, five agencies have approached for developing the app. Officials told TOI that a decision on the agency, to be tasked with developing the app, would be finalised by this week. The app would be ready within two weeks for use by local authorities, said officials. “The district disaster management authorities (DDMAs) will decide on the government agency to be appointed for developing the app to check Covid protocol violations. We will be able to finalise the same soon,” said relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Gupta. The authorities want to ensure that a system is in place in case there is case spurt or a third wave. Officials said after the technical bid, a financial bid will be under consideration, which should not take more than 10 days. While the system will be ready, the chief minister would issue necessary directions on the date of implementation, added the officials. The department has also consulted the law and judiciary department to decide on pending cases under the DDDMA. “Besides seeking court intervention for cases where the fine is not paid willingly, citizens can also approach the DDMA and complain about any Covid violation. The DDMA should take cognisance of the violations in 30 days, and if there is no intervention, citizens can even approach the court seeking the same,” stated Gupta. The agency will have to build, operate and maintain the system and there will be a transferable fee for the agency. Once the new system is in force, uniformity of fines can be expected. The entire amount collected will be utilised for setting up Covid infrastructure. With the festivities coming up, the officials are keeping a watch on reckless behaviour. State health experts have warned that even if there is a decline in numbers, one cannot throw caution to the wind. While vaccination has been intensified, the local authorities have been asked to keep a strict watch on Covid-protocol violations. Over 90,000 cases have been registered in the state for Disaster Management Act violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/e-challan-app-to-be-ready-ahead-of-diwali-officials/articleshow/87143839.cms||Nisha Nambiar

In many areas of Tilak Nagar, roads on the side have been dug up for laying cables for internet. There was information about the permission from the JMC-Greater. When asked about the documents, the contractor said that he has documents of permission from 2019 to dig up roads. Saini said, “I was informed by someone that the contractor is digging up roads in the area. When I inquired about the permission, he showed me documents from 2019. I refused to accept it and got it stopped immediately. I have asked him to get a fresh permission from the corporation for digging the roads.” Already the work of pipeline laying is going on in the area. Roads from the middle have been dug up by the PHED which only a few days back have started getting repaired by the municipal corporation. Now, with digging up roads for cables is another nuisance for the residents. Contractor Subhash Rao said that due to Covid, he wasn’t able to complete the work then. “I wasn’t able to complete this work in 2019 as it was a matter of life and death due to pandemic. Now, with situation becoming normal, we have started work again.

Categorically denying the role of YSRC cadre in the attacks, she said Naidu is an expert in hatching such conspiracies. “I suspect the attacks could have been a conspiracy by Naidu. He may have hired his party activists to attack party offices and then start shouting from the roof,” Sucharitha said. YSRC legislator and senior leader TJR Sudhakar Babu said the party never encourages physical attacks against anyone. “Our party does not believe in violence. Party president and chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has the guts to face his political rivals through democratic process in elections,” he said. He, however, said some of the poor, who were disturbed with the alleged attempts of Naidu to stall welfare schemes, including YSR Jagananna housing scheme, might have resorted to attacks.

The initiative allows people to get a sapling planted at any of the 20 identified parks in south Delhi areas and name it after their dear ones. A nameplate of the applicant or the gift recipient will be placed on the tree guard. The south corporation will take care of the sapling throughout its life and issue an e-certificate to the applicant. People can avail the facility by simply logging into https://giftatree.sdmc.online/. TimesViewThe initiative creates a linkage and a bond between planting of trees and a family’s personal memories. It is an environment-friendly move that will engage the citizenry. Such initiatives have been carried out before, but in a city where a “good air” day is an occasion for celebration, this step is welcome.SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said that the initiative was a unique way to encourage people to celebrate their special occasions by contributing to the greenery and protecting the environment. “Each tree can absorb nearly one tonne of carbon dioxide in its whole life, which helps in controlling global warming. Besides this, plantation is the easiest way to protect the environment. Through ‘Gift a tree’ initiative, people can get saplings planted in selected parks of SDMC on the birthday/marriage/anniversary/other special occasions for their dear ones,” said the commissioner. “To avail the facility, people will have to spend about Rs 2,000-2,500. The parks are located in all four zones,” said a south corporation official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plant-saplings-in-south-delhi-parks-name-them-after-your-dear-ones/articleshow/87144981.cms||---
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: In Badvel, YSRC tells people to reject BJP, its ‘anti-Dalit’ stand||AMARAVATI: Branding BJP as anti-Dalit, deputy chief minister Narayana Swamy appealed the electorate of Badvel assembly constituency to keep away from such forces. He said Dalits should keep a wary eye on leaders like Adinarayana Reddy who made derogatory remarks against the people from Scheduled Castes (SCs). YSRC organised a massive ‘atmeya sammelan’ of Dalits at Porumamilla town in Badvel constituency on Tuesday.  Addressing the meeting, deputy chief minister said Jagan is the only leader in the history to have given due respect and position to Dalits. He said Adinarayana Reddy won the 2014 elections on YSRC ticket but switched to TDP for the sake of ministerial berth. He alleged Adinarayana is most opportunist on the earth as he moved to BJP soon after TDP lost power. “Dalits should be aware of such people and party,” said Narayana Swamy .  Education minister Dr Adimulapu Suresh said neither BJP nor TDP has any respect for the Dalits. He said Naidu had demoralised Dalit leaders during his rule.  He added Jagan has never treated Dalits as mere vote bank but encouraged their development as real leaders. “A majority of the schemes launched under Nava Rathnavalu are actually aimed at empowering the Dalits. The makeover of the schools under Nadu-Nedu scheme are aimed at helping the poor children from the Dalit communities get equal opportunity. It is the responsibility of the Dalits in the constituency to ensure the victory of YSRC with a margin of over 1 lakh votes,” Suresh said.  Kadapa MP YS Avinash Reddy asked BJP leaders to explain whether the BJP-ruled states have effectively implemented welfare schemes as has done by AP. He said BJP leaders owe an apology to voters for increasing fuel prices. Government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy and PR minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy,were also present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/in-badvel-ysrc-tells-people-to-reject-bjp-its-anti-dalit-stand/articleshow/87144938.cms||Samdani MN
---||Mysuru||Dasara festival ushers in much needed hope for tourism sector||Shrinivasa.MMysuru: The downward spiral of the Covid-19 curve, coupled with a proportional increase in the percentage of the populace that has been vaccinated across the country, has helped put the ailing tourism industry in the Heritage City back on track. That as many as 36,000 people passed through the turnstiles of the Mysuru Zoo on Ayudha Puja and Vijayadashami (October 14 and 15 respectively) – a three-fold rise compared to the number the zoo registered on the holidays in 2020 – attests to the fact that tourists are returning to some of the city’s most popular destinations.Data revealed that, while 9,033 people visited the zoo on Ayudha Puja, 27,093 thronged the establishment the next day. The rush at the turnstiles kept the cash register ringing, with the zoo earning nearly Rs 37 lakh in just two days, while the revenue the zoo recorded throughout the Dasara festivities was Rs 77.6 lakh.Although the figures pale in comparison to those the zoo registered in the years prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, the spurt, both in terms of the number of visitors and the revenue, compared to the previous year is undeniable. The zoo earned a mere Rs 19.5 lakh throughout the Dasara season in 2020. That the zoo earned Rs 1.6 crore throughout the ‘Naada Habba’ season in 2019 sets the collection for the two succeeding years in perspective.Spike in occupancy at hotels between October 13 and 16 is yet another indicator of the hospitality sector’s upswing in fortunes. “The average occupancy at most hotels was around 60% till October 12, but the figure spiked to 90% in the last four days of the festival. We think the occupancy will remain high for the next few days. We don’t think this is an anomaly, and are optimistic about the future,” said president of Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association Narayana Gowda.The double-decker bus service that was launched to offer tourists glimpses of the Heritage City, proved immensely popular, with the authorities being compelled to double the number of vehicles – from two to four – to accommodate the rush. Assistant director of tourism department, Mysuru HB Raghavendra said, “Ridership is low during the day, but people are eager to see the illuminated cityscape in the evening.”The jump in the number of tourists at some of the city’s hotspots has been accompanied by a spike in the number of visitors at Old Mysore region’s two most popular wildlife destinations: Bandipur and Nagarahole. Tourists, mostly from Bengaluru, are also flocking to the verdant expanses of the Western Ghats in Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts.President of Coorg Homestay Association BG Ananthashayana said that the tourism sector in the hilly district was witnessing an upswing after three years. “Tourists are returning to Madikeri in large numbers. There are hardly any rooms available at hotels,” he added.Year-long expo at KEA grounds?In what is likely to buoy the tourism sector further, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai hinted tat the possibility of extending the exhibition at the Karnataka Exhibition Authority grounds beyond the Dasara season. Bommai said that the government would decide on the feasibility of having the exhibition throughout the year. The CM also expressed hope of celebrating the Mysuru Dasara with its customary fanfare next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/dasara-festival-ushers-in-much-needed-hope-for-tourism-sector/articleshow/87142791.cms||---

More than 100 women cops — three each from 33 police stations — would be executing the scheme. Following a latest government resolution and an earlier standing order, the city cops are all set to introduce ‘police didi’ on Wednesday, when a three-day training programme would be kick started in the presence of CP Amitesh Kumar. Joint CP Aswati Dorje said constables selected as ‘police didi’ would meet girls in schools, colleges and hostels to create awareness about various aspects of sexual assaults, undue advances and means to tackle such situations. The aim is to train the girls in tackling pressure situations and attacks on them, she said. “Awareness about sexual abuses like ‘good touch’ and ‘bad touch’, dos and don’ts while interacting with strangers, especially in the digital world, avoiding dark spots and secluded zones etc would be inculcated in the minor girls,” said Dorje, who has engaged a Mumbai NGO ‘Aangan Trust’ for training the women cops in the three-day programme. “This type of initiative has proven track record of bringing out the concealed atrocities and also prevent further damage,” said the joint CP. Dorje said the ‘police didi’ scheme would be fruitful in helping, supporting, sensitizing, advising and creating awareness among the girls regarding various types of sexual assaults and related complexities. “Our target audience also includes teenagers, who had eloped or escaped from home to explore another world and somehow managed to return. We want to apprise them about the trafficking traps and other fallouts which can irreversibly destroy their lives,” said Dorje, referring to cases of gang rape of teenagers which came to fore this year. “The ‘police didi’ would also help the girls in understanding how to report any incident without remaining a silent victim,” she said, adding teachers, parents and principals too would be included in the gamut of the scheme. In the long run, the scheme would be expanded to include members of the public and social organizations as force-multipliers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citys-police-didis-to-keep-minor-girls-safe/articleshow/87144939.cms||Soumitra Bose

The businessman Yagnesh Rathod lodged a complaint of extortion and criminal intimidation against Natvarsinh Gohil at Pradhyumannagar police station on Monday evening. On Tuesday, police arrested Gohil based on Rathod’s complaint. Rathod told police in his complaint that he had borrowed Rs 4 lakh from Gohil in July 2015 and was paying him an interest of Rs 16,000 every month. Later when he needed money, he again borrowed Rs 5 lakh. Since then, Rathod was paying him a total monthly interest of Rs 33,000. As Rathod was unable to pay him the money, Gohil started threatening him and asked him to pay him Rs 12 lakh. Against the borrowed amount of Rs 9 lakh, Rathod, until the lockdown, had paid Rs 19 lakh. Police said that Gohil used to threaten Rathod by saying that he will kill his parents if he would not pay the money. On October 17, Gohil went to Rathod’s home on Sadhu Vaswani Road and threatened again. Fearing that Gohil would execute his threats, Rathod approached police and lodged a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-held-for-extortion-issuing-threats/articleshow/87144157.cms||---
---||Kolkata||CBSE schools gear up for 1st offline exams in 18 months||Kolkata: Schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) are bracing for the first offline examination in classrooms since the board exams were cancelled due to the Covid outbreak in March 2020. The board examinations in 2021 were also cancelled. From this year, the board has split the Class X and Class XII exams into two semesters. The first semester is set to begin from November 16 and will be held in schools. Exams for both classes X and XII will be based on MCQs and the duration of each paper will be 90 minutes. Unlike board exams that were held in halls in the past, the proposed exams will be held in a number of classrooms with only a dozen students in a room to enable proper distancing. More gates will be used for entry and exit of students to prevent crowding. Also, the rooms where the exams are held will be sanitised everyday. “We are going to form two panels for evaluation and assessment as downloading and uploading of optical mark recognition (OMR) sheets used for answering MCQ papers and correcting them involves a lot of work and requires a dedicated team,” said Mahadevi Birla World Academy principal Anjana Saha. Salt Lake Siksha Niketan academic director Rekha Baishya said sanitization at the school would start from Thursday. South Point authorities said special sanitization and anti-viral treatment of classrooms have been planned to ensure safety. “Apart from the usual temperature checking and sanitization of classrooms, we will be taking self-declaration on adherence to Covid norms from teachers, staff and students daily. An isolation room will also be in place for use if required,” said school trustee Krishna Damani. DPS Ruby Park has lined up multiple entry-exit points for examinees. Principal Joyoti Chaudhuri said the provision was meant to avoid crowding. “Signage will be put up at relevant points to guide students to their respective seating rooms. Thermal scanning will be done at entry points for all students and exam functionaries. Separate rooms will be present for students if they have temperature beyond permissible limit,” she said. While school authorities are glad to have kids back on campus, most students are also delighted to be back in school after being forced to stay away from classmates for over 18 months now. But parents remain concerned. “I’m not confident about the move since my son isn’t vaccinated. But I will have to send him to school as there is no choice,” said Sagarika Kundu, mother of an examinee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-schools-gear-up-for-1st-offline-exams-in-18-months/articleshow/87143848.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Daughter-in-law flees to Agra with jewellery, woman files FIR||JAIPUR: A woman has filed an FIR at Bajaj Nagar police station alleging that her daughter-in-law allegedly fled with jewellery and ornaments when the entire family was under quarantine after contracting Covid. Police said an FIR was registered by one Kalpana Vardani on Sunday. She alleged that the entire family was suffering from the infection and had under quarantined themselves following the doctor’s directions. On May 25, she learned that her daughter-in-law Lubhawna left for Agra in a taxi. She also took away keys to two closets with her. The family claimed that when she inquired her as to why she left during a lockdown, she replied that she had to attend a family function and had booked a taxi. As per the complaint, the family contacted the girl’s father two months later and he replied that his daughter does not want to live with them and allegedly threatened to file a case too. Police said the complainant had alleged that some of her jewellery was missing from the house and suspected that Lubhawna took it with her. While an FIR under Section 379 (Theft) has been filed, police said they are investigating if there was any family dispute involved. A preliminary investigation has begun based on the family’s FIR. Officials said they have sought details of jewellery and ornaments missing from the house. A complaint in the case was filed on September 13. “The case is under investigation. We are examining to determine if indeed items were stolen as alleged by the family. There could be some family issues involved too, which can not be ruled out as yet,” the official said, adding that details of items and the keys have been sought.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath urges people to gift khadi on Diwali||LUCKNOW: Crediting the popularisation of khadi and promotion of traditional crafts through schemes like ‘one district-one product’ under the ‘Vocal for Local’ programme as the reason for the improvement in UP’s rural economy, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said that the state’s unemployment rate had shot down from 17-18% in 2017 to just 5% in the current financial year. The CM was speaking at the inauguration of a ‘Khadi Mahotsav’ to celebrate ‘Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav’, which has been organised to mark the 75th year of India’s Independence, where he appealed to people to gift khadi and local products, especially on occasions like Diwali. The CM also distributed loans and toolkits among beneficiaries, including Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Sericulture awards and cheques under the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Khadi Marketing Development Assistance Scheme. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the call for Atma Nirbhar Bharat for which he said that desi, swadeshi and local products should be encouraged, promoted and linked with new technique under ‘Vocal for Local’. The coming days belong to khadi, which has become very popular among people,” the CM said, adding that in the intelligence report he receives routinely, it was pointed out that people were very excited about the Khadi Mahotsav. He said that khadi was a brand symbolic of Independence and now also of Atma Nirbhar Bharat. The state government, the CM said, had initiated several programmes under which new techniques, toolkits, loans etc were distributed among artisans to improve the production and quality of khadi, especially in view of its rising demand. “Women are the backbone of rural economy. If they earn some money working in the village then their families do well. Their empowerment will help in fulfilling the dream of gram swaraj,” the CM said. He said that the central and state governments were carrying out several projects to empower local artisans and strengthen handicrafts and traditional skills. As a result, he said, over the past four years 1.68 lakh people had got jobs in UP. MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said that khadi was a symbol of Independence and satyagrah but its importance was being lost in India. “When Modi ji became PM, he said that khadi should also become a symbol of fashion and that it should reach every home. We have worked towards modernising the process of manufacture of khadi. Under PM Rozgar Srijan Yojna, 1.55 lakh units have been set up through which 2-3 lakh direct employment has been generated,” he said. The minister added that in 2000, only 22 tons of silk was produced in UP which has now touched 300 tons. However, it is still massively short of the demand for 3,000 tons, leaving massive scope for increasing silk production in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-urges-people-to-gift-khadi-on-diwali/articleshow/87145899.cms||---

Students will be allowed to change their subjects, courses and streams within two weeks — by mid-December — after completion of final registration data uploading process. The colleges will have to upload the details, including scanned copies of their mark sheets, pictures, signatures and reservation certificates, on the university’s portal. Hard copies of all certificates and documents will be verified later. “Registration of the student is very important. Besides being important for examinations and registration purposes, it also gives an estimate about how many students have taken admission in a particular course in a college. It eliminates the attempt by some colleges to admit more students than the number of seats they have,” said a university official. Colleges will have to complete all the processes related to students changing courses, subjects or streams within two weeks of submission of details for registration. “Once the registration is complete, students will not be allowed to make any changes. The university has requested the principals to complete this process within two weeks of submitting the details. Necessary changes will be made before registration is completed,” said a principal of a college. The colleges will publish notices on their websites, directing students to apply for change in subject or course. “As per the directive of the university, we will have to do this online. So, students will be directed to mail the college authorities if they want to change their subject or course,” said a principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cu-students-may-change-subjects-till-mid-dec/articleshow/87143863.cms||Zeeshan Javed

City police commissioner Chandragupta on Saturday prohibited the sale and use of low-cost horns following inconvenience being caused to the public. City police were quick to seize the locally made device being sold in a public place. These low-cost horns that produce loud noises were being used by a few youths on motorbikes to attract attention and to frighten fellow road users. Vendors selling these horns were from north India. People had come to the city following Mysuru Dasara celebration to make a living by selling trinkets including inexpensive devices. Assistant commissioner of police (traffic) SE Gangadharswamy said special drives were carried out and police seized sound-producing materials from sellers and youths using them after the ban order from the police commissioner. “Bothering public or road users is punishable. Even using shrill horns or altered bike silencers attracts action. Any vehicle user violating the norms will be booked,” he said. A traffic inspector told TOI that wrongdoers are being penalized for violation of norms.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Traffic cops draw plans to curb e-rickshaw menace||JAIPUR: With the number of e-rickshaws on city roads increasing, the police have finally woken up to traffic hindrances caused by these omnipresent vehicles. DCP (traffic) Shweta Dhankar told TOI that police held a series of meeting with drivers and assigned “left lane” driving to ensure that they do not impede vehicular movements on crowded market roads. She also said that efforts are being made to regularise e-rickshaws. “A uniform will be sanctioned for e-rickshaw drivers,” she said. These rickshaws have often been blamed for slowing down traffic and operating without any clear guidelines. One of the many complaints includes that e-rickshaws often swarmed a particular point that often leads to traffic chaos. To resolve the problem, the traffic police will soon sanction area-wise routes to drivers. Since 2016, the city has witnessed a tremendous surge in e-rickshaws. They cost significantly less than conventional taxies. Due to lax regulation, many of these vehicles spurt in the past five years. Officials said that many drivers have taken these battery-powered rickshaws on rent. "E-rickshaws are used for varied purposes, from ferrying passengers to delivering goods and materials. Because they cost less, they are also high in demand. Many shops use them to deliver items to their customers," an official told TOI on the condition of anonymity. After heavy buses were barred from plying inside walled city markets, e-rickshaws became a favoured mode of transportation. But this also led to a significant amount of traffic problems The market roads of Ramganj, Manak Chowka, Ghat Gate and Badi Chauper every day witness a swarm of e-rickshaws piling up on the road, forcing the traffic to move at snail’s pace. “The speed of these e-rickshaws is about 25km to 35km. Ideally, they should not carry more than four passengers, but they often carry six to seven passengers which further declines their speed. Because they travel at a slow speed, they cause traffic jams in their wake,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/traffic-cops-draw-plans-to-curb-e-rickshaw-menace/articleshow/87145904.cms||---

R Venkatesh at VV Puram police station has managed to gather about 300 books for the small reading library, despite his high-pressure job schedule. Venkatesh said that most of the time people and a section of police officers at the station keep checking updates and messages on their phones and waste their leisure time. This could impact their physical as well as mental health, he added. To curb their social media obsession, the small library has been opened, he said. The reading library has earned praise from residents and officers. Gopal Krishna, a retired librarian, has already donated a few books to the library. He praised the initiative of setting up the library inside a police station. Books provide authentic information and develop awareness in a reader. “I visited the library and donated few books,” he said. The majority of the 300-odd books are on physical and mental health, hygiene, culture and the life of freedom fighters, litterateurs and Jnanapeeth awardees. To start with, only Kannada booklets are kept. Pavan BK, a head constable, said the library would encourage police officers to develop a reading habit. “The concept of the library in a police station is good. Policemen who are on night duty can use some time to read books, instead of being hooked to their mobile phones,” he said. People visiting the police station for work related to their passports and other services have to wait to get signatures from officers. At that time, they can read about health and culture, Venkatesh said. The reading library was opened by Mushtaq, a seller of used books, on Vijaya Dashami. Mushtaq has been selling books for the last two-and-half-decades in the police station area. Venkatesh also started a library in Lakshmipuram police station when he was posted there some months ago. The purpose, he said, was to encourage the police and the public to cultivate a habit of reading. The inspector is himself a voracious reader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/inspector-starts-library-in-station-to-curb-smartphone-obsession/articleshow/87142802.cms||---

Addressing Nishad Chetna rally in Ghazipur, Sahani stressed on the need to press for the demands of the Nishad community, including reservation and restoration of their traditional means of livelihood. “Abhi nahi to kabhi nahi (It’s now or never),” he said. VIP is holding a series of rallies across the state, especially eastern UP districts, to woo Nishad voters. VIP will hold rallies in Ghazipur, Gorakhpur, Sultanpur, Fatehpur, Mirzapur, Jaunpur, Varanasi, Agra, Azamgarh, Ambedkarnagar, Ballia, Ayodhya, Prayagraj and Muzaffarnagar till October 31. Besides VIP, the Nishad Party, which is an alliance partner of the BJP in the assembly elections, is vying for the support of Nishad community. After being made an MLC and given the assurance that the state government is working on the legalities to give reservation to Nishads in UP, Nishad Party chief Sanjay Nishad has been maintaining a low profile and has not raised any new demand. While Nishad Party will contest its second assembly election next year, VIP is testing political waters for the first time in Uttar Pradesh. National spokesperson of the party, Dev Jyoti, claimed at least 20 Nishad-centric political outfits registered in UP had extended support to VIP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vip-will-play-role-of-kingmaker-in-state-polls-says-sahani/articleshow/87145903.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: Crowds at Kanaka Durga temple surpass expectations||VIJAYAWADA: Dasara celebrations at the Kanaka Durga temple were a huge success this year, say temple authorities. Altogether 5.7 lakh devotees had darshan of Goddess Kanaka Durga during the nine-day-long festivities, as per official records of temple authorities, while another 2.5 lakh Bhavani devotees visited the temple after the festival concluded. The number of Bhavani devotees, however, were not included with other devotees who visited during this period. Dasara is the biggest event at the Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanams, drawing as many as 15.23 lakh devotees during celebrations in 2019. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, temple authorities restricted this number to 10,000 devotees per day for darshan in 2020 and a total of 1.6 lakh devotees had darshan. This year, temple authorities initially decided to permit only 10,000 devotees per day for darshan, which was later raised to 50,000 devotees. Officials also decided to permit devotees who had booked online tokens for darshan. After online bookings received poor response from devotees, officials sold tickets at special counters. However, estimates of temple authorities were off the mark as a huge turnout of devotees was registered right from the first day of festivities. A total of 1.45 lakh devotees had darshan at the temple on Moola Nakshatram day, almost equalling overall footfall of devotees during Dasara in 2020. Meanwhile, temple authorities had to face criticism for not maintaining social distancing at the temple. The temple received a revenue of Rs 1.02 crore revenue through online sevas and Rs 3.02 crore through ticket sales at counters. Altogether, 15.79 lakh Laddu Prasadams were sold during the festival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/crowds-at-durga-temple-surpass-expectations/articleshow/87144961.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vegetable price hike prompts market inspection by task force||KOLKATA: A spike in vegetable prices across city markets prompted the state agriculture market task force to conduct surprise checks on Tuesday. Tomatoes seemed to be the most expensive among the vegetables as it sold for over Rs120 a kg on Tuesday. Even three weeks earlier, its price was Rs 25 a kg. The rates of beans and capsicum also remained high, said Jogesh Dhar, a retailer at Jadu Babu Bazar at Bhowanipore. Though the task force conducted the surprise checks at only a few retail vegetable markets, the members visited a few major wholesale markets to check whether there was any demand-supply gap or not. According to the task force members, their inspection of retail markets revealed that prices of several vegetables, including cauliflower, cabbage, ladies’ fingers, bitter gourd, ridge gourd and pointed gourd, were high and that the rates had been steadily going up. “After comparing prices, we have reasons to believe vegetable prices at some retail markets are unreasonably high. We have taken up the matter with the market committees and asked them to keep a vigil on the price hike,” said a task force member. Kamal De, president of the task force, pointed out the excessive rain and the release of barrage water had damaged huge quantities of crops and that had adversely affected the supply. “Most farmers are yet to recover from the losses. The demand-supply gap is pushing the prices up,” De said. A member, who was part of the inspection, said as rain damaged production, prices were unlikely to go down any time soon. “Fields are under water. There is little room for the prices to drop,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vegetable-price-hike-prompts-market-inspection-by-task-force/articleshow/87144994.cms||Saikat Ray

Landslides at multiple locations along NH-10 cut off Siliguri from Sikkim and Kalimpong. The wooden Ghorkhay bridge that connects Lingsay and Lingsaykha to Pedong and Kalimpong has been damaged. The road connecting Gokay with Single Bazar was also damaged by a landslide, affecting movement of vehicles to Manebhanjan. A taxi driver died at 3rd Mile between Algarah and Lava when a tree fell and hit the vehicle. The traffic at 29th Mile stopped after 3pm. The road connecting Lebong in Darjeeling and Yankoo mineral spring was damaged by a landslide at the Chhetrigaon-Harsing area. “We had some guests here and fortunately a large group left for Siliguri yesterday. But we still have a small group that is stuck,” said Debanjan Basu, who runs a homestay near Lebong. “I was out for my trip but cancelled it after I heard about the landslides,” said a Siliguri driver, Anjil Tamang. Akansha Dahal, who studies at a college in Assam, was supposed to reach New Jalpaiguri station by 6.30pm. “I left Pakyong at 7am and was supposed to board a train to Assam from NJP. But I could reach Siliguri at 8pm after taking a detour,” she said. Tourists were also stranded at Kedarnath and Nainital in Uttarakhand as rains continued to batter the hill state. Nainital was cut off from the rest of the state after landslides at multiple points. Chinsurah resident Chumki Roy got stranded at Kedarnath following landslides. While two members of the group managed to come down and reach Gaurikund, the rest of the team members got stuck.

---||Lucknow||BJP man crushed to death in Balrampur||Lucknow: A Bharatiya Janata Party activist was brutally murdered by his rivals who first slashed him with a sharp-edged weapon and then drove a tractor over him, crushing him to death in Balrampur on Monday evening. The deceased BJP worker Krishna Shukla was a pradhan representative and organization secretary of the party at local level. After preliminary investigations, police officials said Shukla had rivalry with one Jitendra Pandey against whom he had lodged a case of attempt to murder in December 2020 over a conflict on fielding their respective candidates in the gram pradhan elections. On Monday, Pandey and his aides spotted Krishna alone and cornered him. They first assaulted him with a sharp-edged weapon and then ran a tractor over him, the family members of Shukla informed police in their complaint. The accused abandoned the tractor and fled. Balrampur superintendent of police Hemant Kutiyal said an FIR was registered and a massive manhunt launched to nab the accused. “It is alleged that Krishna Shukla had staged an attack on himself and framed Jitendra Pandey nine months ago following which the latter was sent to jail,” said Kutiyal. Prime accused Jitendra Pandey and his aides Rajesh Kumar Yadav Mahant, Umakant, Rahul, and Satish have been named as accused in the murder of the local BJP leader, the SP added. “We have constituted teams to arrest the accused and all those found harbouring or protecting them,” he said. Police officials visited the spot of crime on Tuesday and recorded statements of witnesses. Police sources said that Krishna Shukla had been at loggerheads with Jitendra Pandey and Rajesh Kumar Yadav Mahant since 2015. “Krishna had contested the panchayat elections in 2015, but had lost to Rajesh” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-man-crushed-to-death-in-balrampur/articleshow/87145905.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kol Pol to get high-end forensic lab to put a leash on cyber crime||Kolkata: After a lab for the Special Task Force, Kolkata Police is planning to modernize its cyber crime investigation lab within the next four months. On the procurement list this time are no less than 27 items — a combination of software and the supporting hardware that will include software solutions for imaging and deploying desktops, laptops, tablets and servers and database tools. The state home department has already set aside Rs 2.2 crore for the new lab, the tenders for which were issued this month. The technical bidding is expected to take place on October 29, which will be followed by demonstrations and finally the financial bidding. Senior state cyber experts, who are being consulted in this project, stated the lab “could help extract data that otherwise could have taken a much longer time by approaching a third party.” Owing to the rise of cyber attacks, having an effective forensics lab is essential, they argued. “We require case-specific imaging and cloning of hard disks and extraction of data from smart phones and other devices in our day-to-day police work for aiding investigation. The proposed forensic infrastructure would help in mitigating these requirements in an effective manner and help in detection and prevention of crime faster,” explained a senior officer from the cyber cell of Kolkata Police. The experts also stressed on why such a significant amount would be required to set up the lab. “Quality forensics laboratories can be demanding in terms of cost, and the structures where these services are offered have the tendency to be costly,” said Bivas Chatterjee, a cyber expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-pol-to-get-high-end-forensic-lab-to-put-a-leash-on-cyber-crime/articleshow/87143908.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Not only does Chevella has a sentimental value but also proven lucky for YSR. In 2003, YSR embarked on his first big padayatra from Chevella — covering 1,467 kilometres — and went on to become the CM of AP, which was united then, in 2004. Five years later, he again launched his campaign for the assembly elections from Chevella and won the electoral battle. Party sources said Sharmila chose Chevella for the reason as she wants to establish her footprint in Telangana and make a mark. Her brother, AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy launched his Odarpu yatra from Chevella in 2010 and continued till he won the election in AP. She undertook her first padayatra in united AP in 2012 and covered 3,112 km. ‘Praja Prasthana Yatra’ began on October 18 in Idupulapaya and ended on August 4, 2013, in Ichapuram in Srikakulam. In 230 days, she travelled through 2,250 villages in 116 constituencies, including 14 districts. Though party leaders have unofficially said election strategist Prashant Kishor’s team will cooperate with party, there has been no official confirmation yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chevella-and-padayatras-go-hand-in-hand/articleshow/87144996.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The gruesome killing triggered a wave of panic and fear with several locals asking police to arrest the accused as soon as possible. Jaipur (Rural) SP Shankar Dutt Sharma said the victim was identified as Geeta Devi, a resident of Khetpura village in Jamwa Ramgarh. She had taken cattle for grazing around 10 am. Shortly after 1 pm, a villager was passing through farms spotted blood splattered all over the area. He found Geeta Devi in a pool of blood and raised an alarm. Several villagers had gathered at the spot by the timeJamwa Ramgarh police arrived. Sharma said the accused also attacked the victim’s throat and robbed her silver ornaments. Police suspect that the accused had cut her feet with a sharp object, possibly an axe, to steal her anklets. “The jewellery she was wearing was found missing. Therefore, prima facie it appears to be a case of murder for gain,” an official said. A posse of senior officials including SP, two ASP rank officials and DSPs inspected the crime scene. Sharma said a special team was constituted to investigate the matter. The rural police sent different teams across nearby villages to follow up on leads. “The crime spot is a secluded place with a few people passing through the dirt road. There is a suspicion that the accused were waiting for some target to loot. The incident appears to have happened before1pm,” an official said. Police summoned the FSL team to collect samples from the spot. “It was a brutal murder.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh rape survivor's immolation: Tainted DSP sacked for abetment to suicide||LUCKNOW: Two months after a rape survivor and her companion set themselves ablaze outside Supreme Court to protest police inaction, suspended deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Varanasi, Amresh Singh Baghel, accused of abetment to suicide and aligning with rape accused MP, Atul Rai, was sacked from the force. Baghel, who was then posted in Varanasi, had fudged facts in his final report to exonerate Rai, a BSP member of parliament currently lodged in Naini prison. Both the rape survivor and his companion had succumbed to burns after their immolation bid on August 16. Two days later, state government constituted a special investigating team (SIT) headed by DG, UP Police Recruitment & Promotion Board, RK Vishwakarma to probe the allegations, which were found to be true. Baghel, who joined civil police as a sub-inspector to be promoted as DSP in 2019, is currently imprisoned on charges of abetment to suicide. The genesis of the case goes back to May 2019, when the rape survivor lodged a FIR against BSP MP Atul Rai, alleging he raped her at his apartment on March 7, 2019, and filmed the act. Rai, who went on the run, fought the parliamentary election on a BSP ticket from Ghosi and won. He later surrendered on June 22, 2019. Since then Rai is lodged in Naini Jail of Prayagraj. On August 8, 2020, he tabled a report replete with errors and fudged documents to prove that the complainant and her male companion had deliberately tried to frame BSP MP Atul Rai by lodging a rape case. A senior home department official told TOI, it’s for the court to decide where the FIR was a frame-up or genuine, not police. This surfaced during the SIT probe, following which Baghel was arrested on September 30 this year and charged with providing false evidence during judicial proceeding, tabulating incorrect facts with a motive, malicious pronouncements during trial and abetment to suicide. After the rape survivor died of burns on August 21, former Varanasi SSP Amit Pathak was attached to DGP headquarters. He too was accused of harassing the rape survivor during his stint as Kashi district police chief. The in-charge of Cantonment police station, Varanasi, inspector Rakesh Singh and sub-inspector Girijashanker Yadav, were also suspended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tainted-dsp-sacked-for-abetment-to-suicide/articleshow/87145962.cms||---

The hospital also served as Covid hospital during the peak of the pandemic. Two months ago, the hospital got the notice from the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) as the building in which the hospital was operating did not have the commercial building use (BU) permission. “Leaving that hospital, we are forced to rent out other premises in the vicinity so that our patients don’t have to go from pillar to post. I am not sure whether we’ll be back,” said the surgeon. A total of 42 hospitals and nursing homes have either got their Form C revoked by the civic authorities or don’t have the BU permission required. The Gujarat high court and the Supreme Court had made it clear that they would not tolerate the flouting of fire safety norms after the major fires in Covid hospitals that proved to be fatal. Another doctor based in Naranpura said that his facility is closed down after the notice. “Mine is the second-generation medical practice. When the hospital was created about three decades ago, no such roles were in force. It’s too difficult for us to retrofit the premises based on the current rules. I have started my practice at another hospital till the issue is resolved,” said the doctor on condition of anonymity. Dr Dilip Gadhavi, president of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), said that they have already made a representation to the chief minister and judiciary. “No doctor would like that his or her premises witness any fire accident. But the fact is also true that majority of the hospitals or nursing homes that have got the notice are either located in mixed-use commercial buildings or are in former ‘gamtal’ land where the contemporary laws did not require specific structure and features,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/42-hospitals-19-schools-stare-at-closure/articleshow/87145138.cms||---

---||Delhi||Corporations have taken no steps to tackle dengue in Delhi, claims AAP MLA Atishi||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi on Tuesday blamed BJP-led municipal corporations for the rise in dengue cases in Delhi. In a press conference, the AAP functionary claimed that the corporations did not take a single step in time to prevent dengue in the capital. This year’s first dengue death was reported from Sarita Vihar in which a 35-year-old woman lost her life. “Dengue cases are increasing day by day in Delhi. BJP should tell what the civic bodies are doing to stop it. It is the responsibility of the corporations to make teams of domestic breeding checkers visit door to door to see if there’s stagnant water in any house or if mosquitoes are breeding somewhere. If it is happening then it is the responsibility of corporations to get the stagnant water emptied, or pour medicine and oil in it,” said Atishi. She claimed that domestic breeding checking did not take place in Delhi. “Fogging is also the responsibility of the corporations. At this time, very little fogging is happening all over Delhi,” Atishi said, adding that it is mandatory to have 10 to 15 breeding checkers for every ward, but over 70% posts are vacant in the anti-malaria department due to misgovernance and corruption by the BJP. The corporations do not have enough fogging machines, she said. “The south corporation has 104 wards but there are only 16 fogging machines. As a result of this, dengue cases are increasing,” Atishi said. “BJP functionaries pocketed the entire budget of procuring medications and machines to fight dengue-malaria,” she alleged. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the AAP functionary was speaking lies. “The corporations are running awareness campaigns, doing fogging, and also checking domestic breeding. The AAP government should give outstanding funds to the corporations so that they can fight it better,” Kapoor stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corporations-have-taken-no-steps-to-tackle-dengue-in-capital-claims-atishi/articleshow/87145054.cms||---

Zomato, which initially apologised and terminated the services of the employee, later reinstated her. Founder Deepinder Goyal said “the country’s level of tolerance and chill needs to be way higher than it is nowadays”. It all started on Monday evening, when a Zomato user from Tamil Nadu ordered food from a local restaurant. On finding one of the food items he had ordered missing, he sought help from customer care. An executive responded by saying she was unable to help after unsuccessfully trying “five times” to get a confirmation from the restaurant. When the customer questioned why he should be denied a refund just because Zomato was facing a language barrier, the executive allegedly said, “For your kind information, Hindi is our national language. So, it is very common that everybody should know Hindi a bit.” The customer later posted a screenshot of the conversation on Twitter. Soon, #Reject_Zomato and #ZomatoSpeakTamil started to trend in Chennai and other parts of the state. On Tuesday morning, the company came out with a formal statement announcing the termination of the employee for negligence towards its diverse culture policy. It termed the incident “unacceptable”. After several political functionaries started reacting to the news, DMK MP Kanimozhi tweeted that customer care units of some companies operate only in select languages and it should be made mandatory for such service providers to serve their customers in their local languages.

A senior official of the SIT told TOI that an FIR was filed at the Bani Park police station on October 1 about fraudulent e-challans being generated, resulting in huge revenue losses.“We are waiting for the IG stamp’s findings of the case. The stamp department’s report will reveal important technical aspects, but we have already begun a preliminary investigation to see how this entire fraud began,” the official said.Police suspect that some people exploited technical glitches in the e-GRAS programme to pocket money that should have gone into the government revenue. “It is suspected that e-GRAS challans were fraudulently reused for registration without paying fees. But it would only become clearer once the stamps department shares its findings of the probable causes,” the official said. Police officials said that the registration and stamps department on Monday had shunted out some of the staff posted in their Jaipur offices. “As per the initial reports, the irregularities were found to be operating at three sub-registrar offices of Jaipur. But we suspect that the embezzlement was operating due to some well-connected nexuses that included, E-Mitra operators, middlemen, and deed writers,” the official claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/e-challan-scam-sit-to-probe-embezzlement-worth-crores/articleshow/87145968.cms||---

This is as opposed to the 20,000-odd taxis that are registered in Goa, roughly 16,000 of which are operational. Figures shared by the directorate of transport reveal that the total number of taxi owners who have actually fitted digital meters are 1,977 as on October 9. However, 3,162 bookings have also been made for the device. The state can therefore expect a little over 5,000 vehicles to have the device installed, so far. Going by the figures, only 25% of taxis in Goa may be digital fare meter equipped. “We will take a call on what needs to be done after the deadline for fitments comes to an end,” a transport officer told TOI. The series-wise fitment of digital meters started from May 5 onwards. The agencies engaged to fit digitals meters are Rosmerta Autotech Pvt Ltd and Securinex Inc with each of the firms having four centres each where the fitments can be done. Currently, the fitment of vehicles registered in the 8 and 9 series is going on – the deadline for which is in the last week of this month. While there are 14,575 all India permit taxis, there are 2,593 all Goa permit taxis and 674 Yellow and Black taxis. In addition to this, there are 2,450 app based taxis in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/only-25-of-taxis-commit-to-digital-fare-meters/articleshow/87145034.cms||Nida Sayed

In a bid to earn easy money, he started duping people on pretext of getting them jobs in excise department, police and army. The first case of cheating was lodged against him in 2015 and since then, 21 cases are pending against him in various courts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. This was revealed by the Jhotwara police on Tuesday, a day after arresting the conman when he was attempting to get grocery worth Rs 10 lakh, while posing as police inspector posted at Rajasthan police lines. Rahul Shekhawat alias Kalu was arrested by a team of Jhotwara police on Monday while he had approached a grocery store situated in Jhotwara and had asked them to provide grocery worth Rs 10 lakh which he claimed would be sent to the Rajasthan police lines. “It was found that he is a secondary school dropout. Since 2012, he started cheating people but no case was registered against him initially as the money he took was very less. However, the first case of cheating was lodged against him in 2015 and since then, he is continuously changing location and is cheating people,” Richa Tomar, deputy commissioner of police (west) told TOI. Initially, he started cheating people on pretext of getting them jobs in army, police and excise department at the Rawla town of Sriganganagar. “He entered into the crime world in 2015 when a case of cheating was lodged against him at Kapurthala in Punjab and till date, at least 21 cases of cheating are lodged against him in Kapurthala (Punjab), Hisaar (Haryana), Jaipur and other parts of Rajasthan,” she added. The accused has also prepared many papers, rubber stamps and fake IDs. “We have got fake IDs from his possession in which he has posed as ACB inspector, police inspector, excise inspector. Also, he has prepared fake rubber stamps of IPS, IAS and other officers including SPs, IGs and excise commissioner.” Jaipur police have also intimated Haryana and Punjab police on his arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/conman-who-posed-as-cop-is-school-dropout/articleshow/87145974.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Lucknow||Congress concern for farmers seasonal: BJP||Lucknow: Reacting to the allegations made by Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on paddy purchase in the state, the UP government said on Tuesday that the Congress had forgotten the state of farmers when it was in power. Government spokesperson and MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said that the Congress lacked similar concern for farmers when it was in power and that the party had shown no respect for former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri’s slogan of ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’. “Had the Congress cared so much for farmers when it was in power, their condition would have been different now. This unnecessary rhetoric has no meaning. People have understood that the party’s concern for farmers is seasonal,” said Singh. Priyanka, who was in Lucknow on Tuesday, had accused the government of not procuring paddy on MSP, compelling farmers to sell their produce below market price. Elaborating on these charges, she had said that in many UP districts farmers were being forced to sell their produce at below MSP resulting in a loss of Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 per quintal. The minister said that the Congress leadership has been turning a blind eye to farmers in its own states while shedding crocodile tears for them in UP. “The procurement of paddy is progressing well in UP. So far, around 4,357.14 tonnes of paddy has been procured at MSP from over 919 farmers through 2,860 centres in the state,” he said. Commissioner, food and civil supplies, Sorabh Babu said that various agencies have, so far, procured paddy worth Rs 846.14 lakh from farmers. He added that arrangements have been made to protect the crop from rain in all mandis and procurement is also being done through the PFMS portal, like it was done for purchase of wheat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/congress-concern-for-farmers-seasonal-bjp/articleshow/87145975.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Under Swachha Mandira Seva Abhiyana, the temple management will carry out swachhata (cleanliness) drives in the afternoon on all Ekadashis with the support of devotees, the temple committee, staff, and NSS/ Scouts units of nearby institutes. More than 1,000 volunteers will clean the temple and the premises of the temple town on Ekadashis in future. Temple managing committee president Mohanram Sulli told TOI that the abhiyana was aimed at creating awareness on cleanliness among devotees. “We have launched this scheme by involving the temple staff, students of educational institutions, and other organisations. Devotees will also be given the opportunity to participate in this swachchata drive as a seva (community service) during Ekadashis. We have already released a calendar of swachchata events to be taken up on Ekadashis till March next year. At least two Ekadashi days are there in a month. On those days, the drive will be held between 2pm and 3.30pm,” he explained. At present, devotees offer ‘urulu seve’ at the temple as part of their vows, he said. “In future, this swachchata seve can also be a part of their seves. Besides keeping the temple premises clean, it will also provide an opportunity for devotees to offer voluntary service. The response to the first swachchata campaign, that was held recently, was good. Fisheries minister S Angara and Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar were part of the first drive,” he said. The temple, located at the foothills of Western Ghats, had recently held ‘Hasiru Kukke’ campaign by planting 2,000 saplings at 14 locations in Kukke village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/kukke-temple-to-observe-swachhata-day-on-ekadashis/articleshow/87142945.cms||---

He was lodged in Avinashi sub-jail under judicial custody. An investigation officer said Arun was engaged in real estate, hotel and other businesses. “We arrested him based on a complaint lodged by Senguttuvan, a resident of Sasi Avenue at SITRA, stating that Arun had taken Rs 1.5 crore from him to buy a tea estate in Valparai by promising him crores of profit after selling the property.” When Senguttuvan learned that Arun hadn’t used the money to buy the tea estate, the officer said, he asked Kovai Thangam’s son-in-law to return the amount. “While Arun had issued him cheques for the amount, they were returned, as there was not enough cash in the bank account.” Based on Senguttuvan’s complaint, the city crime branch police registered a case against Arun under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and a team led by assistant commissioner of police T Partheepan arrested him on Tuesday morning. Arun was produced before a judicial magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody. The officer said Senguttuvan’s daughter 33-year-old Sindhuja had earlier lodged a complaint with the all-woman police (east) against Arun and two of his accomplices for cheating her of Rs 7 crore and threatening her with dire consequences. “She was a friend of Arun. In that case, police had booked the trio under sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 417 (punishment for cheating) and 506(ii) (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and arrested them. However, Arun came out on conditional bail later.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ex-mlas-son-in-law-jailed-in-cheating-case/articleshow/87145066.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kerala: Businessman slams unscientific lockdown on Facebook, ends life||KOTTAYAM: A restaurant owner is suspected to have ended his life minutes after slamming the state government through a Facebook post on Tuesday for the “unscientific lockdown policies” which forced him to take the extreme step. It was Sarin Mohan, 42, the owner of Vinayaka hotel in Kurichy near here who was found dead on the railway track in Kurichy. Police suspect that he might have committed suicide due to financial liabilities. The deceased, who was working abroad, had returned from the Middle East and started a hotel business six months ago. He had also started investing to open a textile shop and a spare parts shop in the same building. However, his business got badly hit in the lockdown which was imposed after the second wave of Covid-19. The hotel business ran into a loss after the government banned dine-in services. He had to pay a hefty amount as rent also. According to relatives, his liabilities increased as the lockdown continued. The textile shop and the spare parts shop could not be opened due to the lockdown. He was also in deep crisis as those who had given him money on credit started demanding the money back. The relatives suspect that he might have ended his life after not being able to handle this pressure. His younger son is autistic. Sarin made the FB post against the government around 4:30am. In the post he has alleged that the government which imposed the unscientific lockdown is responsible for his death. He also said that the government did not help the hotel industry during the lockdown. He said that the government which allowed the beverage outlets to function and allowed to conduct functions of political parties did not do anything helpful for those who were in the hotel industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bizman-slams-unscientific-lockdown-on-fb-ends-life/articleshow/87144018.cms||---

The Kattoor police said passers-by had spotted Sundarrajan, a native of Velandipalayam, in a pool of blood in front of a shop on Ansari Street in the early hours of Friday and alerted them. “Sub-inspector Arjun and team took him to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, where he was tested positive for Covid-19 and died without responding to treatment on Monday morning,” a police officer said. Preliminary inquiry revealed Sundarrajan was friends with Subramani and son Arulkumar, of Velandipalayam, and three of them used to sleep in front of shops on Ansari Street for years together. “They were all lathe workshop employees. On Thursday (Oct 14) afternoon, Subramani had given a mobile phone to Sundarrajan. The same night, he asked Sundarrajan to return the phone. Sundarrajan, who was under the influence of alcohol, did not respond properly and they entered into a heated argument. In a fit of rage, Subramani and Arulkumar assaulted Sundarrajan with a stone and fled,” the officer said. Following Sundarrajan’s death, the Kattoor police, who had initially registered a case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), altered the case to Section 302 (murder) of the IPC and arrested the father-son duo on Tuesday and lodged in Avinashi sub-jail. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/father-son-duo-imprisoned-for-murdering-homeless-man/articleshow/87145069.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The former UP chief minister said that when Congress was in power and witnessed better days, then it totally forgot about Dalits, backwards and women, but now when it has fallen on bad days which are not ending then it first placed a Dalit as chief minister of Punjab and has now announced that 40% of ticket distribution for Uttar Pradesh election will be reserved for women. “This is nothing but drama. If Congress was genuinely concerned about women, then why did it not bring in a law to reserve 33% seats in the Parliament and in state assemblies for women, while it was in power? Congress’ attitude of saying something and doing something else raises questions about its intent and policies,” Mayawati said. She added that women form half the population in UP and in India and it is necessary to ensure not just their welfare but their security and respect. To achieve this, she said, strong will power was required which she saw in neither Congress nor BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pgv-step-to-give-40-ticket-to-women-is-a-drama-maya/articleshow/87145978.cms||---

Rajesh Bhatt, chief fire officer of AFES, said that renewal procedures of fire NOCs at hospitals is going on. “We have proposed a special class of building for medical use,” said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association. “The requirement of medical fields is different in terms of its fire load, oxygen and equipment use. When mixed with other commercial activities, the existing commercial and residential binary might not work in longer run.” It’s also the issue of schools. “About 252 schools were given closure notices. Of this, 125 got NOC, whereas procedure for 70 is going on,” said Bhatt. Bhaskar Patel, president of city school operators’ association, said about 19 schools are staring at closure due to non-compliance of rules. “Several schools had also requested to authorities that they would close it down after the academic year and they be allowed to complete the term. But they will not be allowed to function. The finer details are being worked out, but those who have not taken NOC are old schools where some features are not possible to be implement.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/need-for-special-medical-edifice/articleshow/87145136.cms||---

We had much better roads under Bopal municipality. We see no advantages of being under Ahmedabad municipal corporation,” says Kartik Patel, 17, a resident of Meghna society. Patel’s sentiment resonates across housing societies in Bopal, south Bopal and Ghuma, where residents have been grappling with dust and traffic jams for months now due to wrecked roads and incessant digging. Nearly 71% of the 1.4km stretch between Chittvan in South Bopal to Aaryan Complex on Bopal Panchayat Road will make you feel as if you are riding a bullock cart. About 22% of this stretch is of average ride quality as per the roughness index measured through vibrations by the app, Road Bounce. A concrete road should have fewer than 2,200 vertical elevations on a 100m section to be classified as ‘excellent’ on the index. An asphalt road must fewer than 2,000 bumps. An asphalt road is classified ‘average’ if it has between 2,000 and 3,000 vertical rises over 100m. The road is ‘bad’ if the number crosses 3,000. Another road stretch that has deteriorated beyond recognition is the one linking Ambli Junction in South Bopal to SG Highway towards Bodakdev. Nearly 52% of the road is of poor or average quality. A senior AMC official said that zonal budgets for road repairs and laying new civic lines in the area has been sanctioned and will be handled by the zonal office. “The issues will remain for another 1.5 years as many areas in Ghuma and Bopal are being dug to lay civic lines.” (With inputs from Himanshu Kaushik)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/its-one-hell-of-a-ride-on-bopal-roads/articleshow/87145094.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

The survey shows that 89% of current smokers want to quit smoking now. Over 95% of the children who wanted to quit smoking tobacco is to improve health while those who want to quit smokeless tobacco is not because they want to improve health but as their family does not like them consuming smokeless tobacco.

The Selvapuram police said the trio - 22-year-old R Sanjay Kumar, of Selvapuram, 24-year-old S Vikki alias Vishnuprasad, of Pongaliyur near Veerakeralam, and 22-year-old U Shalful Khan, of Kuniyamuthur - had attacked Selvapuram area DMK secretary Cable Mani, 38, with sickle and knife at his house on Monday night. “Mani suffered cut injuries to his hand and chest. When his supporters rushed to his house on hearing him cry for help, the trio fled. They rushed Mani to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, where his condition is said to be stable,” an investigation officer told TOI. The officer said Mani and his supporters had assaulted Sanjay Kumar’s uncle N Rajesh Kumar, 33, of Perur, while he was standing in front of Selvapuram North Housing Unit on Sunday night. “While we had registered a case against Mani and his 20 supporters based on Rajesh’s complaint, Sanjay, along with his friends, took revenge on Mani on Monday night for attacking his uncle.” Based on Mani’s complaint, the Selvapuram police registered a case against the trio under sections 147, 148 and 307 of the Indian Penal Code and arrested them on Tuesday morning. They were later remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/3-dmk-men-held-for-attempting-to-kill-party-member/articleshow/87145085.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Many other senior leaders and workers have left the Congress in despair. Today in Rajasthan and Maharashtra stories of women harassment and exploitation are heard every day,” she said. Joshi said that the Congress was sure to lose in UP. “Therefore talking about women contesting elections is nothing but a farce,” she said. Joshi said if the Congress leadership was concerned about women’s interest, then why it did not field women in the seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli in earlier assembly elections. “Knowing its defeat in the UP elections, the Congress has started a political stunt of giving representation to women, although they are not going to get anything from it,” she said. Meanwhile, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said that opposition parties, including Congress, were ‘family trusts’, where only family members sit on big posts and there was no room for ordinary workers to grow. He was speaking at Samaj Pratinidhi Sammelan organised by the BJP to woo the OBC. Singh said that the opposition nurtured an objective of looting the country and its people. He categorically attacked the Congress for doing lip service to remove poverty despite being in power for the maximum period after independence. He said that the Congress even denied the existence of Ram and coined words like “Hindu terrorism”. In a reference to PM Narendra Modi, Singh said that it was only in the BJP that a tea seller born in a poor family becomes PM of the country. “Despite holding such a high office, he did not do any favours to his family. “Not one member of his family ever sat in a government car,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/congress-gives-no-respect-to-women-says-rita-bahuguna/articleshow/87145981.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The three from Karnataka, in the age group of 20-21 years, were caught in a rip current and were being dragged into the sea. Spotting them in distress, lifeguards rushed to their assistance and brought them safely to the shore. With the state government dropping restrictions, the tourist influx into Goa has increased with visitors making a beeline to the beaches, said Drishti Marine, adding that Calangute and Baga witnessed the maximum rescues over the weekend. “Monsoon is finally waning and the beaches are now open for swimming and leisure activities. Each morning, Drishti lifesavers map the weather and sea conditions and establish safe swimming zones around the beaches. The public should swim only in the swim zones. Non-swimming zones are denoted by red flags,” the lifeguards agency said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/three-more-tourists-rescued-from-drowning-at-baga-beach/articleshow/87145118.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Congress to field 40% women in Uttar Pradesh elections||LUCKNOW: Minutes after the formal announcement of fielding 40% women candidates in the 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections, the Congress party ran several hashtags and creatives to pump up the campaign pivoting it on its vital decision. Positioning the upcoming election campaign on ‘Bharat ki naari banaam Sarkaar atyachari’, Congress creatives indicated that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was raising issues concerning people, particularly women, in a bid to push the Yogi Adityanath government on backfoot. One such creative said: “Laashon ki ginti jaari hai… Ye hukumat jo hatyari hai; Kali raat mein nikal padi jo… Woh Hind ki naari hai.” Referring to the farmers’ death in Lakhimpur Kheri, another creative said: “Woh hunkari woh garji, himmat na usne khoyi… Dekh hausle uske, past ho gaye sattadhari… Sangharsh uska rang laaya, satta ka jhukna jaari hai… Kab tak rokeinge usko, woh toh Bharat ki naari hai.” Political analysts noted that women voters have played a decisive role in the poll outcome in the past few elections. In 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections for instance, 63.2% of female voters cast their votes while only 59.4% male voters headed to the polling booths. Women had outnumbered male voters in the 2012 elections too, but the difference between the two categories then was barely 1.4%. Earlier in 2007 assembly elections, the male voter turnout of 49.3% exceeded 41.9% of women. Analysts also link the victories of BJP in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections to higher voting by women. The more recent elections in Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal reinforced the rising significance of women in shaping poll outcomes. Analysts lauded Congress for its strategic move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cong-pegs-22-poll-on-women-power/articleshow/87146001.cms||Shailvee Sharda

A meeting was held between representatives of Travel Agents Association of India (Gujarat) and Naved Desai, manager of SVPI airport in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. Indian travellers to Dubai not just need to carry a valid negative Covid-19 PCR test report but also a rapid PCR report for which the test is conducted within six hours of departure. “Dubai-bound passengers face extraordinary rush for getting their RT-LAMP test reports at the airport and at times it comes at the risk of missing their flight. We have recommended a token system of rapid PCR test for Dubai-bound passengers be put in place wherein passengers can book their testing slot. A similar provision is already available for passengers at Mumbai and Delhi airports,” said Virendra Shah, chairman, TAAI. Airport authorities could not be reached for comments however, top sources confirmed that at least 100 machines for conducting RT-LAMP tests have been deployed at the international terminal of the SVPI airport since September. An estimated 19 flights to and from Dubai operate in a single week, suggest airport sources. SVPI airport witnesses estimated footfall of 20,000 passengers in a day which is set to grow in the wake of the festive season rush. Travel agents also advised airport officials to form an advisory committee comprising representatives of the city airport as well as travel industry stakeholders. “This will help us convey practical difficulties that are faced by travellers,” states the representation. TAAI members also asked for flight schedule during runway resurfacing so that travel plans can be made accordingly. “We also suggested a free shuttle service from one terminal to another,” said Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/reduce-rt-pcr-rush-at-airport/articleshow/87145156.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Goa||Campaign to help women learn driving||Panaji: A campaign ‘Moving Boundaries’ to create awareness and encourage women to learn driving to remove roadblocks within the ecosystem and increase their job opportunities in transportation businesses, including taxi and e-rickshaw drivers or as delivery agents, is underway. Jai Bharathi, founder of Moving Women Social Initiatives Foundation (MOWO) reached Goa after touring India on her motorbike over a period of 40 days covering 20 cities to raise awareness on the issue. She is encouraging women to learn driving to increase their job opportunities and to be able to travel safely and expand horizons in all aspects of their lives. “Women all over the world face restrictions on their mobility and are unable to travel long distance to acquire decent education or take up jobs which involve complex or unsafe commute which results in a restricted pool of job opportunities,” Bharathi said. “Creating a safe environment where women have access to reliable transportation and they can drive their own vehicles to earn a living is a great way to increase employment opportunities for women in a sector which has predominantly been male-centric,” she added. The campaign is being undertaken by Shell foundation, a UK-based charity and the UK government in association with MOWO and seeks to promote awareness on the importance of women acquiring the power of driving and travelling safely to expand their horizons in all aspects of their lives. The focus is on enabling women to not only learn driving but also own electric vehicles to generate income which in turn can also reduce carbon emissions from transport. ‘Even Cargo’, a social enterprise providing training, employment, and electric vehicle ownership to women drivers is also supporting the campaign. Shipra Nayyar of Shell Foundation said ‘Moving Boundaries’ promotes safe, affordable, and clean transportation for women for better access to basic amenities like healthcare, education, and jobs and the focus is to also create an environment whereby more women can enter the workforce by learning how to drive and becoming owner-entrepreneurs of their vehicles in the transportation linked sectors such as e-rickshaws and as delivery agents. “Our ambition is to enable equal access to opportunities for women by helping them become more mobile. We hope that in the next 5 years, by supporting and helping build capacity of more such enterprises that train and employ women from low-income households, we will see a sizable number of women drivers owning and driving electric vehicles in over 100 cities and villages across India increasing safe transportation and connectivity for other women,” she stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/campaign-to-help-women-learn-driving/articleshow/87145161.cms||---

Out of 191 properties, CHB could auction only 32, including nine residential freehold; four residential leasehold and 19 commercial leasehold units. Even reduction in reserve prices failed to produce the desired effect during the auction. The board had reduced reserve price of commercial units on leasehold basis by 20% and residential units on leasehold basis by 10%. It earned Rs 16.29 crore against the total reserve price of sold units of Rs 14.54 crore. The board did not receive good response to auction of its commercial and residential properties in the previous auction as well. It had invited e-tenders for sale of 149 commercial units and 33 residential units on leasehold basis. Out of 149 commercial units, CHB could sell only two to highest bidders. The total reserve price of the two commercial units was Rs 1.06 crore while the units were sold for Rs 1.09 crore. Out of 33 residential units, only two could be sold to the highest bidders. Total reserve price of both units was Rs 89.83 lakh, while highest bids received against these units were of Rs 90.85 lakh. Recently, chief executive officer (CEO), Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB), Yashpal Garg wrote a letter to the CHB chief engineer, asking him to fix responsibility of officers concerned and their supervisory authorities for laxity and negligence in the care and maintenance of these vacant units, which the board now found difficult to auction. The letter was written after an inspection by board CEO Yashpal Garg, during which it was found that many CHB properties had been lying vacant and neglected for 30 to 40 years. These were in bad shape and in some, floors were covered with an over one foot layer of bird droppings. Board CEO Yashpal Garg wrote that since many of the vacant units were constructed about 30 to 40 years back and there was almost no care and maintainence, most of them were in bad shape. He pointed out that some of the units were in such a dilapidated condition that they were a risk to life and public property. Because of the poor care and maintainence of vacant units, the CHB could not sell them and now required considerable exependiture for their repair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/of-191-properties-chb-manages-to-sell-only-32/articleshow/87144035.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Rastar Master’ brings education to doorsteps as schools continue to remain shut in Cov times||Burdwan: Khushi Maji, a nine-year-old girl from Jaba Athpara village in Burdwan, proudly shows how she can key in her name on a laptop. “I am even helping my mother learn Bengali alphabets,” she says. Dev Tudu, 9, from the same village, places the style of a Hibiscus flower under a microscope lens and peers through to spot pollen grains. There are many such Khushis and Devs in this village who are attending a different type of school — one that comes to their doorstep and brings with it modern gadgets along with textbooks — to help the students gather knowledge. The unique school is the brainchild of Deep Narayan Nayak, a teacher from local Tilka Manjhi Adivasi Free Primary School under Jamuria One Circle, whom students and their parents fondly call ‘Rastar Master’. “Before lockdown, I would go to school and return home. But after the pandemic was declared and schools shut down, I began to miss school and my students. Though the lockdown eased, schools continued to remain shut. So I eventually began to visit the villages from where my students hailed. That is when I realised that they had become totally detached from education,” recounted Nayak. With no certainty when schools would reopen, he decided to take the school to them and converted the open area in the hamlets into classrooms with the darkened walls of thatched homes acting as blackboards. The initiative that began in Jaba Athpara with 15 students has now grown to around 1,000 children in 11 centres covering eight more villages: Malatipara, Uporjaba, Kathalpara, School para, Simulia, Abipith Adivasi Colony, Sirishdanga Adibasi Para and Jaba Barui Para. Some children also come from neighbouring villages. Most of the children are in the 5-14 age group with a few aged 15-16. Nayak, who teaches in each centre once a week, has also included parents in the learning process. In the beginning, Nayak had only his salary to fall back on to make class arrangements and also provide food for the children. Gradually, he has got help from people who have seen the initiative. Asansol BB College has provided him with microscopes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rastar-master-brings-education-to-doorsteps-as-schools-continue-to-remain-shut-in-cov-times/articleshow/87144092.cms||---

More than 700 colleges affiliated with the two state universities in Marathwada are scheduled to resume activities by following the SOPs issued by the government. Nakshatra Muley, a management student, said classroom teaching does not have a match in virtual teaching systems. “Though online education continued during the pandemic, the teaching-learning process is more effective in the classroom. I am excited to join college and pursue my career goals,” she said. Pramod Yeole, the vice-chancellor of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu), said the university authorities have already established contact with the respective administrations in Aurangabad and three other districts that come under its jurisdiction to resume the working of institutes of higher learning. “We have emphasised that Covid-appropriate behaviour is sacrosanct on campuses and inside classrooms. Necessary review of overall arrangements by the colleges and departments will be done periodically,” he said. The Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University (SRTMU) in Nanded has announced that the option of online learning would continue for students who are unable to attend classroom teaching as per the directives from the government. “We have also told the affiliated colleges to ensure 100% vaccination of students at the earliest. Special camps are being arranged for the desired vaccination with the help of the district administration,” university public relations officer Ashok Kadam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/higher-edu-institutes-set-to-open-in-mwada-today-students-excited/articleshow/87143015.cms||---

At least five persons from Bihar have been killed by terrorists in the J&K in the last 15 days. Md Anamul Haq from Forbesganj block in Araria district thanked the Almighty after safely alighting from Jammu Tawi-Rajendra Nagar Archana Express at Patna Junction late Monday night. He was accompanied by his wife Rubiya and daughters Sabina and Ayesha. Anamul left Kashmir on Saturday, soon after he came to know about the killing of Arvind Kumar Sah from Banka in Lal Bazaar area in J&K on October 13. “There is no dearth of work in the J&K. But the terrorist attack on non-locals has created panic among the family members of Bihari workers, who have been pressurized their kin to return home,” Anamul said while leaving for his hometown by a bus on Tuesday. Anamul worked as a carpenter at Lara Ganjipora in Kulgam region of Kashmir. He said the last two months proved a nightmare for him as well as other workers from Bihar. “The worst came on October 13 when a ‘panpuri’ vendor was shot by the militants,” he added. One Abhay Kumar from Saharsa said he was not in a mood to vacate his rented accommodation, but the deteriorating situation in the J&K forced him to come back. “Nobody will put one’s life in danger. So was the case with me. I had gone there in search of livelihood. My income was sufficient to run a family of five. But adverse situation compelled me to leave for home. Now I will look for some opportunities here for survival,” he said. The stories of Md Zafar Alam, Raheesh and Murtaza from Madhepura district are no different. They all reached Patna Junction at around 9pm on Monday. They said the situation has deteriorated in the last two months. Sagir Ahmed, who worked in a cricket bat manufacturing company, said people fear to move out after dusk. “Ghar se bahar jane mein dar lagta tha (I feared moving out of home),” he said. “People migrate to other states from Bihar in search of job opportunities. Why people will move out, if the same is provided by the government in our home state,” Sagir lamented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-workers-fear-attack-in-kashmir-return-home/articleshow/87144096.cms||Ramashankar

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Terminal change likely for 2 airlines||AHMEDABAD: If all goes as planned, the operations of two domestic airlines at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad may soon be shifted to the international terminal — Terminal 2 — instead of Terminal 1 which is the domestic terminal. Top level discussions are going on to implement this and ease passenger rush at the city airport. A source privy to the development confirmed that operations of flights operated by GoAir and SpiceJet may be shifted to the international terminal, effective January 2022. Domestic flights operated by Air India already operate from Terminal 2 at present. The city airport is undertaking a major runway re-carpeting from January 3, 2022 to May 31, 2022, for which the authorities have recently received approval from the aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). “Discussions are underway to shift operations of two airlines to the international terminal from the domestic terminal from January. The feasibility is still being evaluated and once a proper operating procedure is in place, we will finalise whether and how to go about it,” said a source at the airport. An estimated 20,000 passengers transit through the SVPI airport on a daily basis according to estimates by the city airport authorities. This is expected to grow in the days to come in the wake of the festive season. When the runway re-carpeting will be undertaken at SVPI airport, for 149 days, except Sundays and public holidays, the runway will remain shut for nine hours, from 9am to 6pm. This means flight departures and arrivals will be squeezed either before 9am or after 6pm, causing a lot of passenger rush. At present, some 45 flights operate during the morning hours and 45 during the night whereas some 100 flight movements are spread out during the day, according to airport authorities. This means most of these 100 flights will either be moved to morning or evening whereas the remaining will be cancelled too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/terminal-change-likely-for-2-airlines/articleshow/87145178.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: One-time hotspot Dharavi has seen zero Covid deaths for 79 days||MUMBAI: The city has had only one day of zero Covid deaths since March 26, 2020, but Dharavi – counted among the world’s densest slums – hasn’t reported a single Covid death for 79 consecutive days, according to civic data. Dharavi had emerged as a barometer of Covid’s severity during the first wave, with the BMC officials fearing the infection would spread too fast in the dense pocket for the healthcare system to cope. A 56-year-old garment unit owner, who had hosted Tablighi Jamaat members in one of his flats in Dr Baliga Nagar, was the first case in Dharavi; he died on April 1, 2020. Dharavi has since notched up a tally of 7,128 cases (with only 30 active at the moment) and 417 deaths. No deaths were reported in September and October so far, and August saw a lone death. However, 15 deaths were reported in July. The G North ward’s assistant municipal commissioner Kiran Dighavkar sees this as a progressive improvement. First, the number of cases started falling after the second wave’s peak. “By mid-June, for the first time, Dharavi reported a zero-case day,” he said. The daily tally has been in single or double digits on most days thereafter. “We asked people to voluntarily test themselves free of cost. This had to be done to ensure asymptomatic patients were identified and kept in isolation so they could not spread the disease,” said Dighavkar, whose book, ‘Dharavi Model’, was released by CM Uddhav Thackeray last month. On Sunday, when the city recorded no deaths, BMC cheif I S Chahal said Mumbai would see more “zero death” days as the vaccination drive picked up. Dharavi resident S Jeeva Peter said life is back to normal like before. “People are moving out and the pandemic has almost become a thing of the past,” he said. He said the concept of social distancing and use of hand sanitizers may be prevalent at least in some pockets of the city, but hardly anyone uses them in Dharavi. Covid-19 had entered Dharavi on April 1 last year, and there were days when over 80 cases were reported as well. For instance, May 3 last year witnessed 95 positive cases being reported in one day, while on May 15, there were 84 cases reported. However, on December 25, 2020, the area had reported zero positive cases for the first time ever since the start of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-one-time-hotspot-dharavi-has-seen-zero-deaths-for-79-days/articleshow/87145173.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Lucknow||Global connect: UP, UK varsities to tie-up for trans-nat’l education||Lucknow: Promoting trans-national education partnerships between universities in India and the United Kingdom, the UP government has asked higher education institutes here to come forward and participate in the Going Global Partnership Grants (GGPG). The collaboration is the outcome of the British High Commissioner’s recent visit to UP where he explored possibilities for a link up with the state on various fronts, including education. For this, the higher education department has asked universities, both state and private ones, to take the programme -- encouraging ties in higher education between universities in the state and the UK -- on priority. Director, North India British High Commission, Rashi Jain too has sought help from the UP government in encouraging universities in utilising opportunity thus paving way for more trans-national collaborations in the state. In fact, the British High Commission is holding grant webinars to make the UP universities understand the grant application details and guidelines. Aimed at India-UK partnerships for the co-creation of joint programmes of study, the GGPG will contribute to the NEP 2020 that has a strong focus on internationalisation and at providing flexibility to students and creating a customised programme of study for each individual. The partnerships, said an official, will increase the exchange of ideas and knowledge and deepen understanding through the creation of teaching modules with shared objectives, delivery plans, assessment and quality assurance processes. It will also enhance opportunities for students in India and the UK and experience an international learning experience. The programme entails developing international perspective (of students and academicians) through shared experience of international education as part of their course and qualification. It will also increase mobility to and from the UK by students and staff of higher education institutes in UP. The joint teaching programmes, including virtual delivery and collaborative teaching, semester abroad, development of shared understanding of assessments and curriculum development will allow more students with lesser economic means to experience international education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/global-connect-up-uk-varsities-to-tie-up-for-trans-natl-education/articleshow/87146009.cms||Isha Jain

The Saravanampatti police said 32-year-old Siddiq, a resident of Neelambur on the outskirts of the city, had installed CCTV cameras in his computer sales and service shop at SITRA and his mobile phone was equipped to stream the CCTV feed. “When Siddiq checked the CCTV feed on his mobile phone around 4.30am on Tuesday, he found an unidentified person moving in his shop. Immediately, he alerted his journalist friend and they rushed to the shop. Meanwhile, the burglar came out of the shop and boarded a town bus for Gandhipuram,” a police officer said. Siddiq and his friend managed to board the bus and caught the burglar. He was then handed over to the Peelamedu police. The officer identified the accused as 58-year-old A Saravanan alias Murugesan, a native of Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district. A daily wage labourer, he was staying in a rental room at Ganapathy Ma Nagar in the city. “As he hadn’t stolen anything from the shop, Saravanan was handed over to us, as he had stolen a laptop from our police station limits,” the officer said. The Saravanampatti police have registered a case against Saravanan under sections 454, 457, and 380 of the Indian Penal Code and arrested him. He was later produced before a judicial magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/shop-owner-nabs-burglar-with-help-of-cctv-footage/articleshow/87145167.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Anil Starch: Rs 3.6 crore added to con||Ahmedabad: The city crime branch on Tuesday filed yet another complaint of cheating, this time of Rs 3.65 crore, against Amol Sheth, the promoter of Anil Starch Mill of Bapunagar. This is in connection with a February 2016 case of fraud, filed on the basis of a plea made by a company on SG Road. Sheth, 53, a resident of Koteshwar in Gandhinagar, and his aides were booked in relation to about 10 complaints, including three FIRs filed by the city crime branch. The co-accused are Shivprasad Kabra, and Samprati Sheth who is the director of a company called Siddharth Conmart. A city police officer said several complaints have been filed against Sheth, alleging that he pulled off a fraud amounting to about Rs 18 crore. The latest complaint has been filed by an accountant with Grain Span Nutrients Private Limited, Pankit Shah. The complaint alleges that Sheth procured corn and other raw materials used in the production of starch in February 2016 but did not pay Rs 3.65 crore he owed for the purchases. Shah said that Sheth had begun seeking corn from the complainant’s firm in 2014. Initially, he paid for the raw materials but later he began dodging the complainant whenever the dues were sought. Sheth has been in judicial custody at the Sabarmati Central Jail. A crime branch officer said that Sheth will be arrested through a transfer warrant soon. The crime branch had arrested Sheth and Kabra on October 12 from a resort in Jaisalmer in Rajasthan in connection with a plea filed by a Shilaj resident, Kedar Tambe. In his plea, Tambe said that he had invested Rs 14.50 lakh in the subsidiary firm of Anil Starch, named Anil Tradecom Private Limited, as Sheth had promised whopping returns. Sources in police said that the scam perpetrated by Sheth may reach up to Rs 1,500 crore and they expect more persons to file complaints. Three complaints of cheating were filed against Sheth with CID (crime) in 2019 and 2020. Two complaints were filed with Mansa police of Gandhinagar in 2018; and one complaint each was filed with Shaherkotda police and Navrangpura police in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/anil-starch-rs-3-6-crore-added-to-con/articleshow/87144098.cms||---

Counting of votes began at the Gymnasium Hall on Monday. There were around 41 contestants in the fray for 15 seats. Now, results of 11 seats are awaited. Voting was conducted in two phases due to unavailability of polling booths in a few states. Voters exercised their franchise in Haryana, Chandigarh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Delhi. Sandeep Singh from Punjab won from the graduate constituency with 3,667 votes. Mukesh Kumar Arora from Punjab secured 2,859 votes and the third contestant, D P S Randhawa of Chandigarh, secured 2,386 votes. Randhawa commended everyone for trying their best to restore democracy on campus. He said, “ I am very lucky to be part of the Senate for the fourth term. I and my colleagues will address discrepancies caused by Covid and other reasons and we will try our best to make PU campus a place to learn and teach.” The Senate, the varsity’s Apex governing body, comprises 91 members, 47 of whom are elected from eight constituencies.

On Tuesday, the agitators were assured that some of their demands would be met, provided they called off their protest. But the agitators have appealed for a meeting with the health secretary. The undergraduate students, interns and post-graduate students have been demanding holding of student council election, solving of hostel accommodation issues and resignation of the college principal. What started off as a protest three months ago turned into a relay hunger strike a fortnight ago. With a section of interns and PGTs not reporting to work regularly due to the agitation, patients had been complaining of disruption in service. On Tuesday, officials at Swasthya Bhawan asked the hospital authority to ensure the agitation have no bearing on patient service. The hospital authority initially took a tough stand agains those staying away from hospital duty, but on Wednesday it softened its stance. “We are not confident about the assurances. We appeal to the health secretary to listen to our grievances once,” said one of the student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rg-kar-agitators-refuse-to-budge-despite-assurance/articleshow/87144110.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Need to bolster civil services, subject it to social audit: Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: While the civil services have to be strengthened in order to ensure service delivery to the public, the civil services have also to be subjected to social audit, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Tuesday. “We need an approach by linking both these sides. On one side, there should be proper implementation, while on the other, there should be proper examination,” said the chief minister, while inaugurating a workshop organized by NGO Union and Kerala Gazetted Officers’ Association (KGOA) on the topic “role of civil services in creating a new Kerala”. He said that the government’s functioning is discharged through the civil services and the primary intention should be to serve the public. Vijayan said that the functioning of the civil services is based on acts and rules which are meant for the public. If there is any act or rule which is against public interest or the state’s interest, those cannot be continued. “There could be acts that are irrelevant. Government is taking steps to repeal such acts and rules. When you (civil servants) come across such acts and rules, you should bring them to the government’s attention,” he said. Referring to the government’s latest initiative of offering doorstep services, he said that the government aims at supporting the sections of the society, including the marginalized, bedridden, physically challenged, etc. Stating that there should be changes in age-old practices, he said that in all applications received online, a decision should be taken within five days. Vijayan said that more than 500 services of 60 departments are now available in a single portal, which has brought in a major change. He said that the strengthening of civil services is unavoidable as they are an integral part of governance. But if we take a general picture of civil services in the country, we get a different picture. “An experiment is going on in the country to weaken civil services. This experiment, though at its peak, had begun long ago. It was part of embracing globalization by the country that such a situation for civil services began,” he said. Pointing out the impact of globalization on civil services, he said that the thought at present is that civil services itself is not required. It is being experimented on to what extent the civil services can be downsized. In the last five years, UPSC recruited only 16,000 employees, which shows how frightening the picture is, said Vijayan. Referring to the scrapping of Planning Commission by the NDA government, the chief minister said that when the commission was functioning, it used to be a platform for various governments to raise their requirements. Due to its scrapping, planning itself became absent and the practice of listening to the states also became defunct. The Centre is deliberately withdrawing itself from various services. Though the civil services and Leftist organisations had pointed out the dangers of globalization, only the benefits of globalization were projected then. Lashing out at both Congress- and the BJP-led governments at the Centre, he said that it was not the same team that began the globalisation policies and the ones implementing them now. “Presently, BJP is undertaking all the policies of globalization and liberalization more intensely. Both these parties are at fault,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/need-to-bolster-civil-services-subject-it-to-social-audit-cm/articleshow/87144131.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||PGI to hold bone disorder clinic on first Tuesday of every month||Times News Network Chandigarh: For the first time in the country, a specialised osteoporosis and metabolic bone disorder clinic will be organised on the first Tuesday of every month, starting from November 2 at PGI. A department study pegs the prevalence of osteoporosis at 18% among men and 25% among women in Chandigarh. This was announced a day before World Osteoporosis Day, which falls on October 20. “In India, estimates suggest that almost 230 million women above 50 years of age suffer from osteoporosis. A door-to-door questionnaire-based community survey conducted by the department of endocrinology, PGI in six sectors of Chandigarh, involving 4,285 residents revealed that 3.6% had self-reported fragility fractures,” said Prof Sanjay Bhadada, head of the department of endocrinology, PGI. “Another population-based survey conducted by the department, ‘The Chandigarh Urban Bone Epidemiological Study’ estimated that the prevalence of osteoporosis in Chandigarh was 18% and 25% in men and women, respectively,” he added. The department has also developed the county’s first national online osteoporosis registry, the Osteoporosis Registry of India (ORI) (opregistryindia.com), which will be managed by Dr Rimesh Pal. “This will ensure a large database of patients with osteoporosis, which will help us to estimate national burden of the disease as well as conduct and promote research in the field of osteoporosis,” said Prof Sanjay. Osteoporosis is a major public health problem worldwide and in India. Nearly 30% of all postmenopausal women have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis increases the risk of low trauma fractures, notably hip radius and spine fractures. Hip fractures portend a poor prognosis, with five-year survival comparable to certain malignancies like breast and thyroid cancers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-to-hold-bone-disorder-clinic-on-first-tuesday-of-every-month/articleshow/87144118.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Third wave chances in present situation remote, Covid now endemic, say experts||MUMBAI: The chances of a third Covid-19 wave appear remote under the “present circumstances” with only the Delta and its derivatives as the main SARS-CoV-2 variants in circulation and the weekly caseload dropping steadily, according to experts. “We need to forget about the third wave for the moment. If it does come up, it would be mid- or the last quarter of next year,” said Dr T Jacob John, retired head of the departments of clinical virology and microbiology, Christian Medical College (Vellore). “The epidemic in India has transitioned into the endemic phase,” he added. In late August, WHO chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan had said India was entering “some stage of endemicity”. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid task force, said: “Nobody can predict the timing of the third wave. If a new variant of concern emerges, it cannot be ruled out.” He believes “one more disruption’’ is likely, especially among the under-30 youth. Dr Giridhar Babu, epidemiologist with the Public Health Foundation of India, said: “A wave can occur only if there is a large accumulation of susceptible individuals. It takes time for this accumulation at the state or national level.” Making his point, John explained that the seven-day moving average of Covid cases in India has been below 50,000 for 16 weeks now. John, also former director of ICMR’s Centre of Advanced Research in Virology, made the observations at an online talk, ‘Is the Pandemic Over?’, for the Indian Academy of Pediatrics on Tuesday. He cited calculations based on the ‘reproduction number of the virus’ that showed 450 million Indians were possibly infected during the first wave and another 830 million in the second wave. The remaining 150 million are mostly children, who could emerge as a Covid reservoir, he added. India has been able to fully vaccinate less than 30% of its adult population. “So, we can say we have reached the endemic stage not due to vaccination, but due to natural infection,” said John. Reaching the endemic stage is not the end of Covid. “We are in the endemic stage for the long haul. There is no need for stringent restrictions like those imposed during the earlier waves,” he said. Education, economy and livelihood need to be restored. “Schools shouldn’t shut down because a case was detected as around 90% of Indians have been exposed to the virus,” he added. Babu said there are a few areas where vaccination and infection has been low. “These are vulnerable. It’s possible we will see small bumps here and there, every now and then.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3rd-wave-chances-in-present-situation-remote-covid-now-endemic-says-experts/articleshow/87145199.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Going north for Diwali? Fares flew there first!||AHMEDABAD: Haven’t yet booked for your Diwali travel? Well, if you’re planning to head north this holiday season, be prepared to shell out extra for flight tickets — as high as 200% of the normal fares for some destinations. Amid the festive season rush, airfares to major cities as well as to holiday destinations have skyrocketed. This is particularly true for north Indian destinations. Round-trip airfares from Ahmedabad to Dehradun have surged 200% to Rs 21,090. Travel to Jaipur (163%) and Chandigarh (114%) has become costlier too and you may have to pay a round-trip fare of Rs 11,851 and Rs 17,154 respectively. These are the estimates of online travel portals as well as city-based travel agents. Even airfares to Delhi have jumped 88% to Rs 12,274 for a round trip from the Ahmedabad airport. “Holiday destinations in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh are some of the preferred vacation spots this Diwali,” said Anuj Pathak, president, Tour Operators’ and Travel Agents’ Association of Gujarat (TAG). Pathak added: “With floods in Kerala, most tourists have chosen northern India for their travel plans.” He went on to say: “Since Delhi, Dehradun, Chandigarh, and even Jaipur have good road connectivity to several hill stations, flights to these destinations are running near-full. Therefore, airfares have skyrocketed.” Airlines usually have a dynamic pricing policy which operates on the demand-supply principle. “More people are travelling this time as many consciously chose not to venture out through the past year-and-a-half due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” Pathak said. “This has also pushed the airfares up amid exceptionally high demand.” Besides northern India, Goa has also seen good traction. “Since India’s favourite beach destination reopened from August, the traffic to Goa has remained good,” said Virendra Shah, chairman, Travel Agents’ Association of India (TAAI). Shah added: “The same holds true for Diwali. However, one of the reasons why the airfares have surged is bulk bookings made by certain travel agents.” Even major cities such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Kolkata have reported spikes in airfares. That is primarily due to a large chunk of migrant population going to visit families, travel industry players said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/going-north-for-diwali-fares-flew-there-first/articleshow/87145174.cms||Niyati Parikh

City health officer Dr Sathish Kumar said five teams have been deployed to check adherence to Covid-19 preventive measures by both the traders and shoppers. “They will focus on the crowded areas in the city and ensure people are wearing face masks and shops are not overcrowded. We are planning to increase the fine amount for the violations. Presently, we are collecting around Rs 50,000 as fine a day from the people violating Covid-19 norms.” The officer said they would collect more swab samples from crowded areas such as commercial hubs, bus terminals and railway stations in the days to come for testing. “While the infection rate has been slowing down for a while, we haven’t brought down the number of swab samples being collected a day for testing. We are closely monitoring the infection rate daily.” Another corporation official said the crowd in the commercial areas was a major concern. “The neighbouring Kerala had witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases after the Onam festive season. Since Diwali is a major festive season here, we are concerned about the swelling crowd. We hope there won’t be a third wave after the festival, as predicted by some experts.” The official said the state government was now better equipped to deal with the pandemic, even if there were a sudden increase in the caseload. “Having learned a lesson from the second wave, hospitals are equipped with medical requirement and infrastructure. But the primary focus is on preventing any increase in the cases. And it will be a difficult task without the people’s cooperation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/crowded-commercial-areas-a-concern-for-health-officials/articleshow/87145175.cms||V Devanathan
---||Lucknow||Kushinagar Set For A Flying Start||Gorakhpur: With Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to inaugurate an international airport and launch over a dozen development projects on Wednesday, development is all set to usher in Kushinagar — a much revered pilgrimage site in east Uttar Pradesh. Built at the cost of Rs 260 crore with the state’s longest runway of 3200 meters, the airport will put the district on international aviation map, providing direct connectivity with south Asian countries like Sri Lanka, Japan, China, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam. Besides PM, the opening ceremony will be attended by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, governor Anandiben Patel, union minister for civil aviation Jyotiraditya Scindia and 126 members of Sri Lanakan delegation, including Buddhist monks and pilgrims. Located strategically near Buddhist sites in both UP and Bihar, the airport will serve as a major conduit in the Buddhist circuit consisting of Sarnath, Shravasti, Bodh Gaya, Lumbini, Vaishali, Rajgir and Sankisa. The airport is also expected to create job opportunities in the tourism and hospitality sectors. According to the data of the bureau of immigration, Kushinagar and Shravasti had been witnessing consistent increase in the number of tourists since 2017. Kushinagar received 8.98 lakh, 9.3 lakh, 9.7 lakh and 10.96 lakh tourists in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively while Shravasti received 2.2 lakh, 2.58 lakh, 11.32 lakh and 12.71 lakh in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. Apart from the airport, the PM will also lay the foundation of a government medical college which will be built at a cost of Rs 281.45 crore. CM Yogi has set a target of ensuring admission to 100 MBBS aspirants here for session 2022-23. The medical college will have a hostel and a 500-bed hospital with all facilities. As soon as its construction is completed, about 40 lakh people living in the district and adjoining border areas of Bihar will get free medical facilities. Further, foundation stone for 12 other projects worth Rs 180.66 crore will also inaugurated, including eight projects of flood protection on river Gandak, tourism development of Buddhist circuit under Swadesh Darshan scheme, construction of government college Sukrauli and government residential school for deaf and mute girls and road widening of Kasaya-Ramkola, Rampur Khurd, Kotwa, Ghughli road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kushinagar-set-for-a-flying-start/articleshow/87146023.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: After two years, haj pilgrimage may resume for Indians||Aurangabad: Stating that the Saudi Arabia authorities have lifted the social-distancing norm at holy sites in Mecca, the Federation of Haj Pilgrims Social Workers Maharashtra has said the move could pave way for restarting the annual pilgrimage for Indians after a gap of two years. Federation’s general secretary Shaikh Faisal said haj could not take place for two consecutive years since 2020 due to the pandemic. “With the way things are progressing in India as well as Saudi Arabia, we sense chances of restoration of haj for the year 2022. A review meeting is scheduled under the leadership of Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Union cabinet minister of minority affairs in Delhi on Thursday during which a favourable announcement is expected,” he said. “The quota of haj pilgrims from India is likely to get increased as compared to the previous turn, but likely to remain lesser than the pre-Covid times. In 2019, India had a quota of 2 lakh pilgrims. The bilateral agreement between India and Saudi Arabia will decide the quota for year 2022,” he added. Stating that fully vaccinated individuals would be only allowed to take part in Haj tour, Federation of Haj Pilgrims Social Workers Maharashtra has appealed to the interested pilgrims to take both the vaccine doses. A total of 7,055 pilgrims from Maharashtra, including 1,790 from Marathwada, had registered for Haj during the last turn which was called off eventually due to Covid-19. Over 20 lakh pilgrims across the world used to take part of the Haj tour which is one of the five pillars of Islam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/after-2-yrs-haj-pilgrimage-may-resume-for-indians/articleshow/87143043.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad police filed fewer mask cases during Navratri||AHMEDABAD: City police went soft on people during the Navratri festival period, which is apparent from the cases filed for people for not wearing masks, which fell from 711 cases on October 7, the first day of Navratri, to 400 on October 15, the last day of the festival. The reason for the fewer numbers of mask offences registered according to the police is that with the reduction in Covid-19 cases, they do not need to be harsh on people. “We kept a strict vigil over garba events during Navratri festival and ensured that people wore masks all the time and maintained social distancing. As we were strict and patrolling round the clock, people followed the rules and cases of mask violations have reduced,” said a police officer. On the other hand, the figures suggest that police gradually reduced filing cases for mask violations a week ahead of Navratri. In this month, the highest number of cases, 785, was reported on October 4. On September 30, police filed 985 such cases, which fell to less then half on October 17, when only 426 cases were reported. A police officer said that rather than concentrated drives on catching people without masks, they conduct surprise checks at public places and book violators. He said that the number of active Covid-19 cases is not even in double digits in the city, so there is no need to charge people and raise dissent among them. Sources in the police said that they registered fewer cases during the festival and even during elections, which was apparent during the civic body polls in February. According to city police figures, police registered just four cases for mask violations on February 21, when the civic polls were held for 48 wards of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). That has been the lowest number of mask cases in the city till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-filed-fewer-mask-cases-during-navratri/articleshow/87144139.cms||---

The action has been taken in areas under the south zone, including Mahipalpur, eateries near airport and Khel Gaon. The action came a few days after the civic body issued a closure notice to a restaurant at a mall in Khel Gaon for operating without a health trade licence. The restaurant was in the news last month for allegedly denying entry to a saree-clad woman. “We have sealed a total of three restaurants at the mall in Khel Gaon. While the first one was found to be running without a health trade licence, the rest two were sealed as they were allegedly using the terrace area illegally during the inspection conducted by staff from the public health department,” said standing committee chairman Col (retd.) BK Oberoi. In Mahipalpur, it was found that people were running guesthouses without obtaining any licence or fulfilling the required norms, he added. “We have taken action against 35 complexes violating norms and the drive will continue in the coming days. We suggest people to adhere to all norms, obtain licences to avoid punitive action or sealing exercise,” said the standing committee chairman. Officials added that the eateries and guesthouses, which have been sealed, can reopen only when the owner files an affidavit for not doing any violation in future and also obtain all NoCs from the department concerned before applying for health licence with the civic body. The crackdown comes in the wake of a policy passed by the civic bodies recently, which allows open air restaurants subject to the fulfilment of all norms, including noise control, no encroachment on public land, submitting fees, no concrete construction, etc. The new policy also requires submission of the building’s structural safety certificate from a registered structural engineer with clear mention of using the terrace for serving food (dining), NOC from fire department and health trade licence. “Many restaurants are serving food in the open to guests but have not taken permission from us, so we are bound to take action,” said Oberoi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-seals-35-eateries-guesthouses-in-10-days/articleshow/87145214.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Ahmedabad||Festive freight: Trains packed during holiday period||Ahmedabad: If you plan to travel by train during Diwali and have not booked tickets in advance, managing a confirmed ticket will be a distant dream. For example, tickets for Madgaon (Goa) and New Delhi are available for the next two days, but as one gets closer to Diwali or after the festival, the waitlist is long. Railway officials said that barring the Mumbai sector, almost all trains to the north, central and southern part of the country are running full. Officials said that for the Mumbai sector, the Shatabdi Express and the double decker are taking most of the traffic and hence tickets are more readily available. The officials said trains to Jammu and Goa have waitlists even four or five days after Diwali. The official said that these are not regular trains but special one which do not have unreserved coaches and only passengers with confirmed or RAC tickets will be allowed to travel. An officer said that due to Covid, many trains have been cancelled and are yet to be restored and hence there will be a rush. The rush is similar to the 2019 Diwali season. The officials said that the railways are introducing special trains to meet the Diwali rush and have augmented coaches to clear waitlists. As an example, he said that on Tuesday the railways introduced the Pune-Ahmedabad– Bhagat Ki Kothi special train and on Monday it announced a special weekly train from Ahmedabad to Kanpur which will be operational only for the festival period. Officials said that as usual trains to Uttar Pradesh are going full and the rush is similar for return journeys after November 10. The officer said that they have also noticed that people are booking from Ahmedabad to Mumbai and then to destinations from Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/festive-freight-trains-packed-during-holiday-period/articleshow/87145181.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Podanur post office, located next to the Podanur railway station, was the first one to come up in Coimbatore district in 1882 and catered to the requirements of British officials, railway staff and Anglo-Indian people who settled in Podanur. While the old documents and vintage equipment have been shifted to museums, the post office is still functioning in the same place catering to hundreds of people every day, offering a wide range of services. Four more post offices -Bazaar, Sukrawarpet, Singanallur, Lawley Road- in the city have crossed 100 years of their existence and are still in service. Sukrawarpet and Singanallur post offices continue to function in rented buildings. N Hariharan, a retired postmaster and a postal history enthusiast, said Podanur was the gateway for the British people who wanted to explore places near Coimbatore. The post office was established to provide communication for the British rulers and railway employees and officials. He said Bazaar post office, the second one to be established, was much sought-after for the insured post service. It was the preferred mode of sending and receiving valuables like gold and silver. “The worth of the valuables has to be declared to claim insurance. While the service is still existing with the postal department, many jewellers from the vicinity stopped making use of the service 30 years ago.” Hariharan, the first recipient of the postal department’s Meghdoot award, said that the Sukrawarpet post office helped the weaving community, who had settled in the vicinity to send their finished products such as sari to various places in the country. While many mills had dotted the surroundings of Singanallur, a post office established there had served for the labourers and mill management, who had maintained their accounts. He said, “I had the privilege of seeing the old records kept in the Podanur post office then. I have taken photocopies of some of the records and preserved them. A British postal superintendent, who inspected the office on March 16, 1894, expressed his dissatisfaction with the work of the station’s postmaster and gave negative comments. Another official, who conducted a surprise inspection on July 20, 1916, imposed a fine amount of Rs 8 annas on three postmen.” Historian C R Elangovan said that postal history should be documented, cherished, and passed on to the next generation since it will have a lot of reference points to peek into the history of the city, its people and their life in the past. But sadly, no one has so far put in efforts to document the history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/5-british-era-post-offices-continue-to-serve-city/articleshow/87145241.cms||V Devanathan

Addressing Congress workers at Manika on Monday, Oraon had said RJD is mainly a Bihar-based party and has little public base in Jharkhand. In response to Oraon’s statement, Singh claimed that the minister won from his assembly seat because he fought under the mahagathbandhan banner, comprising RJD. “He (Oraon) would have known his real strength had he contested alone,” Singh quipped. While addressing the media on the issue, Singh said some of the political parties are uneasy over the increased activities of RJD leader and former Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav in Jharkhand in the recent months. He asserted that the huge crowd during Tejashwi’s programme in Ranchi last month was proof of the rising mass base of the party. He said, “Oraon’s claim that hundreds of RJD workers joined Congress at a meet in Manika was baseless. No one has joined Congress from our party.” RJD spokesperson Smita Lakra said the mahagathbandhan parties cooperated to successfully prevent “communal forces” from coming to power in the state. “Under the circumstances, it is irresponsible for a minister to call any of the alliance party small or weak organisation,” she said. Several senior RJD leaders, including state vice-president Rajesh Yadav and spokesperson Manoj Kumar, were also present at the media briefing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rjd-lashes-out-at-oraon-asks-him-to-follow-alliance-dharma/articleshow/87143114.cms||---

Offering special prayers on the spiritual day, the faithful exchanged festive greetings with each other at small religious gatherings. Mosques and madarsas in Jamshedpur were colourfully lit up and the community members decorated their houses with lights. Mohammed A Ali, 50, a Jugsalai resident, said, “Out of the 70 plus small and big mosques in Sakchi, Mango, Jugsalai, Golmuri and Telco, all prominent ones were decorated with colourful lights.” Social events and a blood donation camp were also organised at the Azad Marriage Hall on the Old Purulia Road. Imam Mufti Saifuddin Adak, the cleric of Hussaini Masjid at Zakirnagar of Mango, was honoured with the “Shan-e-Islam” award for his service to the community. At several places, food and fruits were distributed to the poor as a mark of respect to the Prophet. Babar Khan, a member of the All India Muslim Social Welfare Front, said, “Keeping the Covid guidelines in perspective, celebrations are limited to the colonies. No big congregation was organised.” Meanwhile, the police said Muslim community leaders agreed not to take out rallies to mark the festival and deliver ‘kichada’ to the homes of the devotees. SP (city) Subhash Chandra Jat said, “The religious leaders assured that no rally will be taken out to mark the festival.” The administration also deployed police and magistrates in 17 areas considered sensitive. Tight police vigilance was visible in Haldhipokar, Makdampur, Dhatkidih, Jugsalai, Azadnagar, Zakirnagar, in Sakchi market, Telco and Golmuri. The Imarat-e-Shariah chief, Saud Alam Kajmi, said, unlike previous years, this year's Eid Milad-un-Nabi is missing the big rally, which used to be the highlight of the festival. In Garhwa district, the festival was celebrated with great enthusiasm. Devotees thronged the local karbala ground to attend the Julus-e Mohammadi, which culminated in a big procession that marched to Ranka More of Garhwa town through the main thoroughfare, shouting slogans and chanting Naat (verses in praise of Prophet Mohammad). On the occasion, M Yasin Ansari, a veteran social activist and president of the Madarsa Tablighul Islam, said, “The message of Prophet Mohammad is not confined to a particular community but is meant for the entire humanity irrespective of caste, colour and creed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/eid-milad-un-nabi-celebrated-with-religious-fervour-in-jharkhand/articleshow/87143087.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||50 state workers in Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand safe, says mirgrant control room||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government’s migrant control room is on high alert to trace, track and bring back stranded migrants, if any, from Kashmir, where terrorists have attacked them last week, and Uttarakhand, where fresh flash floods have killed over a dozen people so far. Sources in the labour department and the disaster management said officials concerned are continuously tracking the situation in both the states to identify any vulnerable person hailing from Jharkhand. In the last two days, the migrant control room made calls to at least 50 people, mostly migrant labourers who had gone to Kashmir and Uttarakhand for work, to check on their whereabouts. All of them are safe, the sources said. Talking to TOI on Tuesday, Johnson Topno of Phia Foundation, a social outfit that is running the control room, said, “We are on high alert since the terrorist attack in Kashmir a few days ago. Although several migrant workers are now reportedly returning to their home states out of fear, we haven’t yet received any panic call from anyone hailing from Jharkhand. From our end, too, we dug out details of several people who went to Kashmir for work and contacted them. As of Tuesday evening, none expressed their willingness to return, which means they are safe. Similar was the situation in Uttarakhand.” Topno further said they are not letting their guards down and are scanning various platforms to gather information related to Jharkhandi people and extend speedy help whenever required. “Ever since this control room was set up by the state government during the peak of migrant crisis due to the nationwide lockdown in the first wave of Covid-19, it managed to extend help to scores of labourers after coordinating with different state authorities and ensured their safe return,” he added. Recently, the state government ensured the safe return of 61 labourers in four different batches from Himachal Pradesh following reports of brutal assaults on some of them. The control room had swung into action after a few state workers in Himachal approached for help. Chief minister Hemant Soren, too, had taken cognizance of the matter and directed the officials concerned to take up appropriate action. Early this year, about a dozen workers from the state had died during the glacier burst in Uttarakhand. The control room also played a major role in the incident and extended help to several stranded persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/50-state-workers-in-jk-ukhand-safe-says-mirgrant-control-room/articleshow/87143031.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Health workers’ stir threatens to derail Covid-19 vaccination drive in Jharkhand||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government’s efforts to ramp up Covid-19 vaccination numbers across the state might hit a roadblock in the coming days with the ongoing protests of the contractual health workers employed with the state’s health mission set to spread to the districts. Active Covid 19 cases in Jharkhand stood at 125 on Monday evening. Of the total, Ranchi reported 11 new cases. Ranchi also had the most number of active cases (76) followed by East Singhbhum (20). Bhuvnesh Pratap Singh, the interim mission director of the state health mission, said, “Most of the demands of the contractual employees have been agreed upon. We are hopeful that they will continue to work as usual.” The Jharkhand Health Employees Welfare Association (JHEWA), the umbrella outfit of thousands of contractual health workers working in 24 districts of the state, on Tuesday appealed to its members to join an indefinite strike to protest the termination of contracts of several of their colleagues just before Durga Puja. A letter, undersigned by JHEWA secretary Sanjay Kumar, was issued after a meeting of its office bearers in Ranchi on Tuesday afternoon. In the letter, the JHEWA appealed to all its affiliate state health mission contractual employees and general nurse midwives to boycott work indefinitely until further intimation. There are approximately 8,000 contractual health workers across the state. Besides Covid 19 vaccination, they are responsible for health programmes such as routine immunizations, child immunization programmes which are under way. Contractual health workers, including data entry operators, nurses and multipurpose health workers are at the forefront of the state health department’s ongoing vaccination drive in rural and urban areas. “Our protests will continue against the unlawful termination of our colleagues in headquarters, district and block levels. We will continue our stir till they are reinstated. That apart, we also demand regularization,” Kumar said. The JHEWA also demanded that the health department grant leave to the contractual health workers on gazetted holidays and reinstate weekly holidays. Acting state health mission director Bhuvnesh Pratap Singh did not respond to TOI’s calls when contacted. Covid-19 vaccination drive has slowed down in Jharkhand over the past week. On Monday, only 36,390 beneficiaries received their first doses while 48,607 people received their second doses, which only constituted 2% of the total target beneficiaries. The stir comes at a time when over 12 lakh beneficiaries across the state have been waiting for their second doses of Covid-19 jabs beyond the mandatory 84-day period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-workers-stir-threatens-to-derail-cov-vax-drive-in-state/articleshow/87143053.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The accused Sanjay alias Sanju Merani eventually fled with the money. Asif Ranpuri, Merani’s cousin, lodged a complaint of cheating with police as he too had given him Rs 70 lakh on being promised high returns. Police said that Ranpuri, a resident of Mumbai, received Rs 22 lakh initially, but after the money stopped coming, Merani told him to get him more investors and he will ensure that Ranpuri would benefit from it. As Ranpuri trusted Merani, he approached his friends— Zulfikar Dodiya, Nasruddin Dosani, Ajit Magrani, Barkat Dosani and Nuruddin Makrani. The five friends together gave Rs 1.1 crore to Merani on Ranpuri’s word. Merani gave back the victims Rs 11 lakh. But later Merani stopped sending money to all. When the investors asked Merani to pay them the profit or return their invested money, Merani would keep dilly-dallying. On realizing that Merani would never return the money and they had been conned, the six investors approached the police. Cops are yet to arrest Merani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/conman-cheats-six-of-rs-1-5-crore/articleshow/87144185.cms||---

A committee appointed to probe alleged financial irregularity submitted its report to SPU authorities. TOI has learnt that the probe panel has held former chief accounts officer (CAO) Naresh K Bhatt and former auditor chartered accountant K G Patel & Company, Anand responsible for gross negligence in discharge of their duties. At the same time, the report also points out that current auditor failed to point out the irregularities of financial year 2014-15 on time. After SPU’s syndicate members demanded strict action against Bhatt, SPU vice-chancellor professor Shirish Kulkarni earlier this year had appointed a five-member committee headed by retired judge of Gujarat High Court Dhiren Karia, Narendra Dave, retired treasury officer from Rajkot, professor PK Priyan from MBA department of SPU, syndicate member Ketan Patel while the forensic audit assignment was given to Shah Sanjeev & Associates, chartered accountant and certified fraud examiner from Vadodara. “We have received the report which will be placed before the syndicate members on October 22 for future course of action,” said Kulkarni. The report rules out financial fraud or scam but points out accounting mismatch. Before the committee started its probe, the mismatch was said to be to the tune of Rs 29.22 crore but the probe panel has revealed accounting mismatch of another Rs 8.08 crore taking the total financial irregularity to the tune of Rs 37.3 crore. “The books of accounts of any organisation tallies with its audited financial statements. At SPU, the books of accounts were not tallying with the audited financial statements,” Shah said. In financial year 2014-15, there were two separate debit entries in ledger accounts amounting to Rs 29.22 crore and Rs 8.08 crore. “These adjustment entries were passed in the accounts. This was passed to match audited statements with books of accounts,” he said. During the forensic audit, 5,496 ledger accounts of financial year 2014-15 were scrutinised. “We could find adjustment entries in 1,649 ledger accounts,” said Shah, adding that even vouchers to reflect Rs 37.3 crore was||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/spu-rocked-by-rs-37-crore-financial-irregularity/articleshow/87143766.cms||Prashant Rupera

Celebrating good over evil in real life. Celebrations started with the arrest of a taluka development officer (TDO) along with other officials of the taluka panchayat in a graft case last week, followed by the transfer order of an executive magistrate on Tuesday. Sweets were distributed and crackers burst in Shehra after executive magistrate Bharwad was shunted to Dang. Fair price shop owners, elected representatives and political party workers gathered to celebrate the transfer order which many have dubbed as ‘an ouster.’ Sources said there were a series of representations against Bharwad. The complaints had also reached deputy speaker and MLA Jetha Bharwad. “Some had also wrongly perceived that the official was close to the deputy speaker,” said Jetha’s aide, adding that such celebrations were unprecedented in the town. Similar celebrations were witnessed when Shehra TDO Zarina Ansari was held by the ACB along with three others.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/officer-shunted-town-rejoices/articleshow/87143779.cms||---

---||Delhi||700 ragpickers turn Delhi shanties into food gardens||NEW DELHI: Anshu carefully scans the ridge gourds on the rooftop and plucks around two kilos of them for lunch. But it's not from a tony terrace garden that the 15-year-old harvests the vegetables. Anshu's house is a shanty in southwest Delhi's Rangpuri, the cardboard-tarpaulin rooftop green with produce - ridge gourd, bottle gourd and yellowing pumpkin. Her mother, Sarita Devi, a ragpicker, has fitted discarded nets and ropes on the roof for the plants to twine around. Devi is among 700 women waste pickers in Mahipalpur, Wazirabad and Bhalswa who eke their meagre earnings by growing vegetables at home. Trained by NGO Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group and supported by Pondicherry Designs Limited, the impoverished families have nutritious food and an alternative income source. TimesViewThe urban poor are always cramped for space. Growing your own vegetables is a dream for most. This initiative allows them to do so, and in the process helps them financially. The endeavour also makes them feel better about themselves. The government should encourage such inventive and creative measures to widen its ambit. The project, which also aims at creating green spaces in the urban core of Delhi, started in November last year when Chintant conducted a survey on the viability of vegetable gardens to be developed by the urban poor. An experienced farmer showed the women how to take care of the plants and now regularly visits them to oversee their efforts. In the first planting season from March to April, the women grew pumpkin, spinach, ridge gourd and chilli. In the second, in July-August, they changed to Malabar spinach (poi saag), laal chaulai (red amaranth), bottle gourd and spinach. They are now ready for the third planting of the year beginning November and going into December. Apart from vegetables, the women also grow microgreens like black chickpeas, moong, mustard and fenugreek in trays. Bharati Chaturvedi, founder and director, Chintan Group, said, "The thought behind this initiative was that even if women didn't have good incomes, they would still be able to eat nutritional food without spending anything. The second idea was climate change mitigation. We know climate change is going to hit the food crops through rain, flood or drought and prices of vegetables will go up. But these women should have access to nutrition because they eat the least and at last in the family. We helped the women to grow vegetables that can be cultivated in this ecosystem." Shruti Sinha, manager, policy and outreach at Chintan, added that the initiative's basic aim was to ensure food security and nutrition for the women and their families, all of whom worked with waste and hazardous materials. For Poonam Devi, the availability of free vegetables has been a big boon because she has a big family of 13 members. Glancing at the piles of plastic bottles she and her husband have salvaged, she said, "My husband and I earn around Rs 9,000 a month and spend Rs 5,000 out of this to pay our rent and electricity bills. My brother-in-law is handicapped and we have to take care of his children too. We used to survive on chapatis and salt, but now have vegetables too." Poonam Devi also has to pay off the Rs 1 lakh that she borrowed from the waste contractor during the Covid-19 lockdown. "He deducts money from items that we sell to him, but at least now, even though our income is low we can give our children proper food." Poonam adds that the kids are always excited to pluck the gourds and greens when ripe for harvesting. Kohinoor Khatun said she is now able to save around Rs 100 per week on food expenses. The Wazirabad slum resident said, "Chintan has provided us with seeds and other equipment for farming and we only need to water the plants. We didn't have to shell out any money for starting the roof garden. We are able to save additional money these days, the money that we earlier spent buying vegetables from the market. We only purchase onions now." Khatun added it was a relief to her to not have to worry about rising prices of vegetables. Many of the women distribute the surplus harvest to other families, spreading the goodness of the fresh vegetables all around, and Pinki Devi confirmed that exchange of vegetables is also common. Most of the new green thumbs just feel good seeing something grow in front of their eyes. Said a smiling Sudha at Rangpuri, "We are so happy at being able to consume fresh vegetables that aren't contaminated with chemicals." The women are mostly first-timer cultivators though some of them have had prior farming experience in their villages. Asma Begum, who lives near Bhalswa Dairy, has been a Delhi citizen for over 12 years now, but it is only now, when growing vegetables, that she feels life is almost like it was in her village in Assam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/700-ragpickers-turn-delhi-shanties-into-food-gardens/articleshow/87147181.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Delhi||Delhi: 12 target 'very high value' NRI a/c with Rs 200 crore, held||NEW DELHI: Twelve people, including three employees of a private bank, have been arrested on charges of trying to siphon off money from a 'very high value' NRI bank account that had around Rs 200 crore in it. The accused had procured an Indian mobile phone number identical to the account holder's US-based phone number for facilitating the transfer of funds. Following a complaint filed by HDFC Bank, technical investigation revealed that 66 attempts of unauthorised online transactions were made on the account, Delhi Police DCP (cyber cell) KPS Malhotra said. "Further, the accused tried to withdraw cash from the account using a fraudulently obtained cheque book. They even later tried to update the mobile phone number in the KYC documents by replacing the existing registered mobile number," said Malhotra. A team led by ACP Raman Lamba was tasked to identify the culprits based on technical footprint and human intel.  Multiple geolocations were identified and raids were conducted at 20 locations across Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. This led to the arrest of 12 people. The three bank employees included a relationship manager, who issued the cheque book, updated the mobile phone number and removed the debt freeze on the account. The bank employees were named as D Chaurasia, A Singh and a woman whose identity was not disclosed. The interrogation of the accused revealed that the mastermind had come to know that the NRI account was dormant and had a lot of funds. With the help of the female bank employee, they got a cheque book issued and also got the debt freeze removed. Further probe revealed that she was promised Rs 10 lakh and insurance business of Rs 15 lakh, the target assigned to her by the bank for appraisal. Even earlier, attempts had been made to withdraw money from this account. Two cases were registered, one at Ghaziabad and another at Mohali in Punjab. The cheque book of the account later came in the possession of one R Jaiswal. He distributed leaves of the cheque book to his accomplices to get them cleared and promised to share 50% of the money withdrawn from the account. He was to give consent to the bank over the phone on behalf of the actual account holder. Chaurasiya and Singh attempted to update the phone number linked to the account, while the other associates tried to log in to internet banking to transfer funds. "The attempts to withdraw funds, log in to internet banking and update the mobile phone number was only possible due to the connivance of the bank employees," Malhotra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/12-target-very-high-value-nri-a/c-with-rs-200-crore-held-delhi-police/articleshow/87147222.cms||---

The Centre’s decision follows a clean-up aimed at making states accountable for energy consumed. The state is now raising funds to pay Central Generating Stations (CGS) of the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC). Karnataka, which has five electricity supply companies (escoms), owes CGS over Rs 1,000 crore. According to senior government officials, non-payment of dues means 1,000 MW will not be available ahead of the post-monsoon season beginning October-end. Govt will put equity into escoms: Addl chief secyWith coal capacity down to no more than two or three days and the Centre withholding 1,000MW, Karnataka could face a serious power crisis,” said a government official.Energy minister V Sunil Kumar said: “CM Bommai has talked to the Union ministry about the withheld power. We convinced him of the need for a special package to pay the Centre and the finance department okayed it,” he said. Additional chief secretary (energy) G Kumar Naik said the government will now put equity into escoms and they will approach financial institutions to close old loans and take fresh ones at a cheaper interest rate to repay the Centre. “It’s a win-win situation as escoms’ financial health will improve in the long run and loans will be repaid. However, the matter is with the finance department; we’re yet to receive official communication,” he said. Government officials suggest management of books and seeking fresh bank loans may take some time and it could take at least two months to revive the central power share. In the short run, due to copious rainfall and lack of demand, the state may tide over the crisis thanks to 13 hydel stations and renewable energy distribution. Sources suggest thermal power plants are running at a bare minimum capacity to cope with the coal shortage. “With our hydel stations generating at maximum capacity and demand for power from agriculture sector low, it’ll be a matter of months before we see a spike in requirement,” said an energy department official. Currently, the state’s average demand is pegged at 8,000-8,500MW per day and it’s estimated to double in the next two months with Covid-19 threat subsiding and resurgence of economic activity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-needs-to-clear-rs-1000-crore-dues-to-get-1000mw-power-from-govt/articleshow/87147204.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

On Monday, Kutch-based doctor, Devjyoti Sharma, gave a virtual presentation on usefulness of psychotherapy in treating mental illnesses at the WCP organized from October 18 to 21. Earlier, even in the 20th version of WCP, organized in March (delayed because of Covid) yoga psychotherapy was discussed at length. A global association, the WPA has 145 psychiatric societies of 121 countries comprising around 2.5 lakh psychiatrists associated with it. While presenting his yoga theories, Dr Sharma explained that people who engage themselves in Shiv Tandav dance release pent-up emotions, anger and aggression and after relaxation, they can visualize the consequences of anger and start concentrating on peace through meditation. The therapist implored doctors to encourage patients for psychodrama by playing the role of Lord Shiva and releasng their emotions by beating drums and dancing. “It reduces anger, aggression and frustration by relieving emotions and modifying dysfunctional thoughts and behaviour into meaningful functional thoughts,” Dr Sharma said. Presenting Kundalini Yoga, where a person meditates on seven centres or Chakras, as an alternate treatment for mental illness, Dr Sharma said: “Certain body parts contain specific psychic centres, for which awareness is developed through meditating for removing blockage of psychic centres and releasing energy for healing.” Dr Sharma compared well known American psychologist Abraham Maslow’s theory of hierarchy of needs with Kundalini yoga meditation’s Chakras. He further said that after meditation on the seven psychic centres, the person would become aware of his strength, weakness, opportunities and threats one by one which will, therefore, lead him to transform his weakness into strength.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/kundalini-yoga-therapy-gets-thumbs-up-at-world-psychiatry-conference/articleshow/87144251.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

But with an unfulfilled dream, wicket-keeper batsman Pinal Shah has decided to retire from all forms of cricket. Shah will officially approach the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) this week and announce his retirement. “Yes, I have decided to retire from all forms of cricket and will make the announcement within a few days. It was a fantastic experience playing for Baroda and taking up different roles. I faced some tough times but the association always backed me and my teammates too were always supportive,” said 33-year-old Shah who began his first-class cricket career in 2005-06 as a wicket-keeper batsman. “I wanted to carry forward the legacy of More and Mongia who kept wickets for the Indian team and made our city proud. Every passionate cricketer always aims to play for his country so the regret that I couldn’t play for India will remain. But I am content with my performance in first-class cricket,” Shah told TOI. He is expected to take up a key role in the BCA after his retirement. Shah, who was a member of the U-19 world cup squad, played 93 first-class games in his 16-year long career and scored 3,409 runs including a double century. He took 278 catches behind the wickets and executed 38 stumpings. Shah has also played 54 T20 games and scored 471 runs. Impressed with his performance, Mumbai Indians team picked him up for the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008. Having started his cricketing career with Hind Vijay Gymkhana, Shah went on to captain Baroda in many matches and played crucial knocks in the middle order. “The association has given me so much so I want to make a meaningful contribution to Baroda cricket,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/barodas-pinal-shah-to-retire-from-all-forms-of-cricket/articleshow/87143790.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Bengaluru||Muslim marriage doesn’t negate maintenance: Karnataka HC||BENGALURU: “A Muslim marriage is not a sacrament, (and) does not repel certain rights and obligations arising from its dissolution,” the Karnataka high court has said, rejecting a man’s plea and coming to the rescue of his exwife, who has been battling for enforcement of the trial court’s maintenance decree for the past decade. Contracting another marriage after pronouncing talaq upon his first wife, a Muslim man cannot say he has to maintain the new wife and their child, and cite the same as a ground for not discharging maintenance, Justice Krishna S Dixit said. Man ought to have known responsibility towards ex-wife: HCThe petitioner, Ezazur Rehman, had pleaded that he could not pay maintenance to his ex-wife, Saira Banu, as he had remarried and had to provide for his wife and their child. The judge said Rehman ought to have known his responsibility towards his ex-wife, who does not have anything to fall back on. The responsibility of paying maintenance arises from his own act of talaq, and prior to marrying another woman, the court said. Quoting the Quran and Hadith, the judge said the right of a divorced woman for maintenance is conditioned on three cumulative factors — insignificant mehr amount, inability of the woman to sustain herself, and if she does not remarry. A Muslim marriage “dissolved by divorce, per se does not annihilate all the duties and obligations of parties by lock, stock and barrel”, the judge noted in the order passed on October 7. “In law, new obligations too may arise, one of them being the circumstantial duty of a person to provide sustenance to his ex-wife who is destituted by divorce.” The judge observed that marriage amongst Muslims begins with the contract and graduates to the status as it ordinarily does in any other community and this very status gives rise to certain justiciable obligations that are ex contractu (from a contract). The judge also said Rehman’s contention is repugnant to law, morality and ethics and that if such a contention is countenanced, it would only encourage talaq which the law shuns. Citing various conventions on human and particularly women’s rights, the judge pointed out that divorce brings hardship to women, and more so to divorced Muslim women. Divorced women’s tears are “hidden in their veils”, he noted, and it is not that unscrupulous men do not know this.On mehr, the judge said payment of frugal mehr money per se cannot be a defence for an able-bodied man to defy the decree for maintenance. Justice Dixit imposed Rs 25,000 cost on Rehman and requested the trial court judge to execute the same on a war footing and report compliance to the registrar general of HC within three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/muslim-marriage-doesnt-negate-maintenance-karnataka-hc/articleshow/87147269.cms||Vasantha Kumar

While the government has completed the survey of enemy properties identified in South Goa, the high court has set aside 12 of these properties by granting liberty to the custodian of enemy property “to take fresh steps in relation to the property.” In a written reply to an unstarred question by Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that steps towards fresh inquiry into these properties were in process and that a resurvey, if required, will be carried out. In North Goa, a survey of enemy properties in some parts of Bardez and Tiswadi is under progress through the office of the district collector, the reply stated. All the “enemy properties” identified in India, including those in Goa, are controlled by the custodian of enemy property of the Union government, under the Enemy Property Act, 1968 and Rules/Guidelines/Order made thereunder. The act governs the vesting, preservation, management, control, sale, transfer of right, disposal, etc. The ministry of home affairs has nominated the district collector concerned as the deputy custodian of enemy property to assist the office of custodian of enemy properties in discharging its functioning under the act. Following the 1965 Indo-Pak war, properties belonging to Indians who had acquired Pakistani citizenship were considered as “enemy property” and came to be in possession of the Indian government, sources said. During the survey of the enemy properties conducted by the office of the South Goa collector last year, it was found that over 40 apartments and 30 shops across seven buildings, 19 residential bungalows and several commercial houses had come up on the over 15,000 sqm of land identified as “enemy property” at Gogol, Margao. The Gogol land is among 263 such enemy properties located across the state. “In certain survey numbers of the identified enemy properties in South Goa district, buildings/houses/shops have been constructed and purchased by occupants. Eviction proceedings against such occupants under the Public Premises Act is under process before the respective deputy collector and SDO. The custodian of enemy property has directed to offer the sale of such properties valid upto Rs 1 crore to occupants/occupants of the said properties,” the reply tabled in the House said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/3-5l-sqm-of-enemy-property-identified-will-conduct-resurvey-if-needed-cm-to-house/articleshow/87144774.cms||---

No slaughter of cattle or buffaloes was carried out at the complex between April and June. In July, 39 buffaloes and two cattle were slaughtered at the complex. In August the number went up to 250 buffaloes (nil cattle) and in September, it stood at 153 buffaloes (nil cattle). “The Goa Meat Complex Ltd is presently fully operational. It provides facilities of slaughtering of animals in the most scientific way and under hygienic conditions by carrying out antemortem and postmortem examination at the modern abattoir,” chief minister Pramod Sawant stated in his reply to questions by Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco. At present, beef supply comes from traders from Karnataka. On an average, 2,120 kg of beef is received daily from the neighbouring state via road, based on the meat inspection charges collected by authorities. Over the past six months, beef dealers have procured 388 tonnes of cattle beef and buffalo beef. The selling price per tonne ranges from Rs 3.3 lakh to Rs 3.8 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/low-slaughter-numbers-at-goa-meat-complex/articleshow/87144781.cms||---

This was revealed in a written reply by chief minister Pramod Sawant to an unstarred question by Curtorim MLA Alexio Reginaldo Lourenco. The forensic science laboratory at Verna comprises biology/ serology, chemistry, toxicology, narcotics, ballistics, computer forensic and fingerprint divisions. However, certain tests, including DNA fingerprinting, aren’t conducted at this laboratory, and therefore, samples are required to be sent to the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) and Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), both located at Hyderabad. Tests conducted at this laboratory include detection and confirmation of blood, semen, saliva and stains, identification of species of stains, grouping of biological stains, detection of fibre and hair, diatom examination, detection of poison, testing of alcohol, testing of narcotic drugs (charas and ganja only), testing of petroleum products and its residue, analysis of acids and alkalis, retrieval and analysis of data from mobile phones, tracing and comparison of fingerprints and chance prints, as per the reply. Sources said that the state government has decided to set up a DNA fingerprinting division at the forensic science laboratory at Verna, and that procurement of equipment is under way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-spent-rs-25l-to-transport-and-test-dna-outside-goa-since-2012/articleshow/87144838.cms||---

A minimum of 60 rape cases have been reported every year in Goa since 2016. This year, up to September 30, already 54 rapes have come to light. In 2021, the highest number of nine rape cases were reported at Porvorim police station, followed by eight at Mapusa and five at Maina-Curtorim. As per records tabled in the House, of the 387 rape cases reported since 2016, majority are still pending trial, including those reported five to six years ago. So far, only nine of the cases have led to conviction of the accused. A handful of cases have been closed due to various reasons following investigations. The other commonly committed crime against women in Goa, from January 2016 onwards, has been kidnapping. Over the last six year, a shocking 238 cases have been registered in the state. The cases though have shown a drop from 53 in 2016 to 25 and 24 cases, respectively, in 2020 and up to September 30, 2021. Forcing women into commercial sexual activities was the next most common crime. From 2016, 193 such cases have been registered. The cases have shown a recent decline, but only during the pandemic years. Meanwhile, 86 abduction cases have been registered in Goa since 2016. These too have declined during the pandemic. One murder of a female victim took place almost every month in the state between January 2016 to September 2021. In all, 68 murders were reported in as many months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rape-is-most-common-crime-against-women-for-past-6-yrs/articleshow/87144875.cms||---

Civic officials said they have issued notices to the building owners to shift residents to safety and demolish the structures in seven days. The move comes in the backdrop of seven buildings collapsing in the past three weeks following heavy rain in Bengaluru. ‘Some structures are showing cracks’Revenue minister R Ashoka had ordered BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta to conduct a special drive to inspect structurally unsafe buildings in the city. A report prepared after the inspection drive said that the west zone had the most unsafe buildings in the city at 121 and was followed by south (115) and east (113). A senior BBMP (east) officer said most of the unsafe buildings are replete with violations. “They do not have any setbacks and there is a tendency to construct buildings in violation of the rules,” he said. “Most of these are duplex buildings where the extra floor is added without permission and foundational strength,” the official explained. Poor maintenanceThe buildings identified as unsafe in the west zone are old and with no maintenance. “The owners do not periodically look into the stability of the building. This can lead to walls or ceiling collapsing,” a west zone officer said. “We are fortunate there have been no causalities in these incidents over the past month,” Raghu, BBMP’s additional town planning officer said. “Some of the identified buildings have developed cracks and are uninhabited. Their owners haven’t been traced. A special team of engineers will submit a report if these buildings should be demolished,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/503-buildings-unstable-raze-them-in-a-week-bbmp/articleshow/87147326.cms||---

Twelve office bearers were inducted into the party while nearly 200 Congress workers attended the meeting and extended their support to TMC. Commenting that the state's economy has completely gone down, Faleiro said the BJP government has become helpless and is repeatedly taking loans, which is a very bad sign. “Goa is the richest state in India, but this government has looted it,” Faleiro said. He also highlighted various issues affecting the state including rising unemployment and increasing inflation. Stating that TMC is the only option to get rid of all these problems, he promised to look into land issues in Sattari. Former Valpoi block Congress committee president Dasharath Mandrekar said that he and his members left Congress because the leadership of the party had failed to recognize their hard work, but were always thinking of their personal benefits. “We will work together to strengthen TMC under Faleiro,” Mandrekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-valpoi-12-cong-members-join-tmc/articleshow/87144906.cms||---

Business hours of these establishments had so far been curbed to 10pm. With the extension, shop timings are back to pre-Covid times. While pre-Covid closing timing for vegetarian restaurants was 12.30am, restaurants and bar owners, who had hoped the state would restore their 1.30am deadline, were left disappointed. "Many sectors like colleges, theatres and amusement parks will reopen this week, and we want to see the impact on cases. We want to give further relaxations, but in a phased manner," an official said. District administrations can curb timings depending on conditions, but cannot give an extension without the disaster management authority's consent. ‘Timings extended to prevent overcrowding’The order issued by the state government said that with the extension of timings, all other guidelines like 50% capacity for restaurants and the need to have fully vaccinated staffers in shops will continue. “The government observed that in light of the upcoming festive season, staggered timings for functioning of establishments like shops, restaurants and hotels will only lead to more crowding, hence a decision was taken to extend the timings,” the official said. District administrations have been allowed to restrict timings considering local conditions, but they cannot give further extension without the consent of the state disaster management authority. The hospitality industry felt the timings should have gone back to the pre-Covid hours. Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) senior vice-president Pradeep Shetty said, “We welcome the Maharashtra government’s decision of extending the time of operations for restaurants till midnight. The additional two hours will provide much-needed succour to the beleaguered hospitality industry. The sector has been one of those most affected by Covid restrictions. However, we wish extension had been granted till the pre-Covid deadline of 1.30am and, considering the onset of the wedding season, it had been accompanied with the lifting of restrictions on banquets, weddings and events. The current limit of a hundred guests for weddings and social events is prohibitive and unviable under present circumstances.” AHAR president Shivanand Shetty said, “We will comply with the order, but it would have been better if timings had been extended till 1.30am as it is festival time and people like to spend time outside with friends and relatives. Restoring timings to pre-Covid days will help the industry recover quickly from the state of disorder it has been pushed into for the past 18 months.” Viren Shah of the Retailers Federation said that although most standalone shops in the city shut by 10pm, the 11pm deadline will help malls do some additional business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/restaurants-in-maharashtra-must-shut-at-midnight-shops-at-11pm-says-govt/articleshow/87147386.cms||---

---||World||Melbourne welcomes vaccinated Sydney residents without quarantine||SYDNEY: Travel restrictions between Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's largest cities, eased on Wednesday as Victoria opened its borders to fully vaccinated residents from New South Wales amid a rapid rise in immunisation levels. With cases trending lower in New South Wales, including Sydney, residents will be allowed quarantine-free entry into Victoria for the first time in more than three months. Travellers from Melbourne who wish to enter Sydney, however, must undergo a two-week home quarantine. Daily infections in Victoria rose to 1,841 on Wednesday, up from 1,749 a day earlier. A total of 283 cases were reported in New South Wales, well down from the pandemic high in September. The relaxation in border rules comes ahead of Victoria lifting the lockdown in Melbourne, the state capital, on Friday as double-dose vaccination rates in people above 16 neared 70%. More restrictions will be eased when rates pass 80% and 90%. By Friday, Melbourne's 5 million residents would have endured six lockdowns totalling a cumulative 262 days since March 2020. Australian media say this is the longest in the world, exceeding a 234-day lockdown in Buenos Aires. Australia had enjoyed a Covid-free life most of this year until a Delta outbreak began in Sydney in June, which quickly spread to neighbouring Victoria. Other states are Covid-free or have very few cases. Sydney and Canberra exited their months-long strict stay-home restrictions last week after racing through their vaccination targets. Even with the Delta outbreaks, Australia's Covid-19 numbers are far lower than many developed nations, with about 149,000 cases and 1,577 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/melbourne-welcomes-vaccinated-sydney-residents-without-quarantine/articleshow/87147393.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Copious rain turns arid Kolar, Chikkaballapur green||BENGALURU: Once parched and dry, Chikkaballapur and Kolar districts have witnessed a gradual transformation in their landscape, which is now marked by large stretches of blue and green because of good rain spells in the recent years. Until two years ago, most parts of the region were arid due to scanty rainfall. Farmers could not even find a grazing area in the barren landscape. With no water, dry lake beds greeted livestock. However, copious rain has turned the landscape verdant. Using the moisture content in the soil, farmers in the districts have started growing rabi crops. Moreover, cows, buffaloes, sheep and goats enjoy grazing on the green pastures. According to Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) data, October rain has been a record of sorts for Chikkaballapur and Kolar — the two districts have received 150% and 113% excess rainfall, respectively. While Chikkaballapur received 235mm between October 1 and 18 as against the normal rainfall of 94mm, Kolar got 188mm as against the normal of 88mm. The neighbouring Tumakuru district too recorded more than average rainfall — 205mm as against the normal of 89mm. At 172mm, Ramanagara recorded its highest rainfall during the current spell (103mm more than the normal). “Farmers can heave a sigh of relief and so can drinking water managers. We have received reports from field units that rainfed cultivation has gained momentum in the five districts around Bengaluru which generally get poor rain,” a senior official of the agriculture department said. The official added though the perennial crops, mainly coconut, had been severely affected due to drought, the recent spells have given farmers a hope of revival. However, the issue has to be studied further. The rainfall has revived the fortunes of cattle rearers too. Green grasses are growing in almost all parts, mainly rivers and lake beds. Trough has led to downpourWhat is triggering abundant rainfall in October? Manoj Rajan, commissioner, KSNMDC said: “The trough between cyclones over Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea has resulted in the heavy downpour. The trough is passing through north interior Karnataka. The low pressure developing in the Bay of Bengal is also contributing to this. Every year, we witness a similar situation during October and November.” “Ponds and lakes have enough water this time, thanks to copious rain in September and October. We are able to find green pastures for our livestock and grow good crops,” said Mallesh, a farmer-leader in Chikkaballapur district, who owns seven acres of parched land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/copious-rain-turns-arid-kolar-cballapur-green/articleshow/87143977.cms||Manu Aiyappa

A senior UP government official said in 2017 only four airports in the state had regular flights - Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Agra. While Prayagraj, Kanpur, Bareilly and Hindon have since been added that list, Kushinagar will get onboard Wednesday - indicating a more than doubling of operational airports in the recent past. The state's biggest airport - in Greater Noida's Jewar - is going to become operational by mid-2024 and serve as Delhi-NCR's second hub. Ayodhya is going to get Maryada Puroshottam Shri Ram Airport. Once these two are ready, the number of international airports in UP will rise to five - up from the three that include Lucknow, Varanasi and Kushinagar. Bareilly Airport, which opened a few months back, now has direct connectivity with Mumbai and Bengaluru and the jhumka city is now the aerial gateway to nearby industrial areas and the Kumaon hills. A senior UP government official said work is currently on at airports in 10 more cities - Aligarh, Azamgarh, Moradabad, Shravasti, Chitrakoot, Sonbhadra, Agra, Saharanpur, Noida and Ayodhya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-narendra-modi-to-open-uttar-pradeshs-ninth-airport-in-kushinagar-today/articleshow/87147389.cms||---

A chunk of 1000-acre land was being exchanged between two state corporations to make the proposed deep sea port more attractive for leading Indian as well as international bidders. The chairman of WBIDC Rajiva Sinha told TOI that the land swapping was possible with the initiative of state chief secretary H K Dwivedi. The Mamata Banerjee government has invited bids for development of the greenfield port at Tajpur in East Midnapore district on design, build, finance, operate and transfer basis earlier this week. The CM is giving top priority to this port, which could be a game changer for the state economy. Sinha pointed out that 1000 acres at Dadan Patra Bar near Tajpur was earmarked for a solar project under WBSEDCL while Goaltore land was earmarked for building industrial parks by WBIDC. However, the land parcel at Goaltore is far from the rail head and is not ideal for industrial projects. “This is why we thought of exchanging these land parcels. The Goaltore land would be now used for solar project where location is not very important. The land parcel at Dadan Patra Bar will be used for port-related activities. Getting 1000 acres land is a big thing for the port,” he added. Meanwhile, it is learnt that KfW, formerly KfW Bankengruppe, the German government-owned development bank, based in Frankfurt, will finance the WBSEDCL solar project. Earlier this year, several global players, including DP World and Port of Singapore, had shown interest in developing the port following the initial expression of interest (EoI). The port was proposed on a straight beach front and located very close to mineral-rich belts of West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. WBIDC had floated the tender for Tajpur port following the cabinet approval, which was chaired by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “We have invited proposals from experienced and qualified bidders for the development of the port. The proposed site is located less than 200 km from Kolkata and less than 10 km from a railway station in Digha,” said an official of WBIDC. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier said that around Rs 4,200 crore will be invested by the state government in this project. The project is expected to draw a total investment to the tune of Rs 15,000 crore. The total employment through the project would be over 25,000. The West Bengal Maritime Board (WBMB) would be the nodal agency for undertaking development of proposed port projects and managing the PPP (public-private partnership) transaction. Bengal is set to get the country’s first floating solar power plant. The 500MW plant is likely to attract an investment of Rs 2,500 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tajpur-port-gets-1000acre-govt-land-swap-boost/articleshow/87145976.cms||---

Trinamool, in an article and an editorial in its mouthpiece, also said it should be the Centre, not the state, that should speak on events in a foreign country. “How can the Bengal CM speak on the internal affairs of another country?” seconded party secretary-general Partha Chatterjee. The article said a detailed probe was required in the events in Bangladesh. “The Bangladesh home minister says there is a planned conspiracy behind the incidents. The mask needs to be ripped off these conspirators and their collaborators,” it says. “There has been a wave of protests in Bangladesh itself against these acts of violence,” the article continues. “It proves that while some people have resorted to this planned attack, people in Bangladesh want brotherhood and unity. But it also needs to be seen who gains from this violence? Are these sudden attacks by a religious fundamentalist group an isolated event? This requires a detailed probe on the instigators.” The editorial says: “Fundamentalists have various religions in different countries, but they complement each other in their efforts to use religion for votes. They instigate people and common people suffer.” “It is a fact that the Sk Hasina government has also taken strong action,” it continues. “To give hope, to protest these attacks, there have been meetings, processions and rallies in Bangladesh. Several Muslim organisations have stepped forward in protest. These processions are giving hope and faith.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-vulture-politics-on-bdesh-violence-tmc-mouthpiece/articleshow/87145551.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Babul Supriyo resigns as Asansol MP, takes dig at Adhikari family||KOLKATA: Former Union minister and BJP-turned-Trinamool Congress politician Babul Supriyo on Tuesday tendered his resignation as Lok Sabha member from Asansol, the seat he won in 2014 and 2019 on a BJP ticket. Babul called on Speaker Om Birla in New Delhi to submit his resgination letter more than two-and-a-half months after his “alvida” post on social media on July 31 where he had announced his plan to give up his Lok Sabha membership. He had taken it back after a meeting with BJP seniors in Delhi. On September 18, Babul switched to Trinamool and sought an appointment with the Lok Sabha Speaker for September 20 that didn’t materialise. “I am no longer associated with BJP. I thought if I am not with the party, I shouldn’t continue as MP for myself,” Babul said. Soon after resigning, the Trinamool leader seized the opportunity to take a dig at leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari, who had been taking a moral stance against defectors. “Will Suvendu now ask his father (Trinamool MP Sisir Adhikari) and brother (Trinamool MP Dibyendu Adhikari) to resign as MP? They are not part of Trinamool,” Babul said. Coming out of the Speaker’s house, Babul got emotional. “My heart is heavy as I had begun my political career through BJP. I thank the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi), party chief (J P Nadda) and (Union home minister) Amit Shah. They had confidence in me. I am indebted to Swami Ramdev-ji who helped me get the ticket and also Rajnath Singh-ji who gave me confidence,” said the former Union minister. Babul botched speculation that he might contest from Asansol on a Trinamool ticket. “Asansol is special to me. I will now expedite the development work I sanctioned during my tenure as MP. The work needs cooperation from the state government,” he said. From July 7, when Babul was dropped from the Union ministry till Tuesday, when he formally gave up his Parliament membership, it was a roller-coaster ride for the singer-cum-politician. Feeling let down after losing the ministerial post, Babul had decided to resign as MP and quit politics. Eventually, Babul joined Trinamool. “I made an emotional decision. But I must say that emotional decisions are not always impulsive,” he said on Tuesday. The former Union minister in his Facebook post had written about his growing differences with Bengal BJP leaders. Babul felt the differences among senior leaders were “harming the party”. Babul also didn’t like the way he was benched when he wanted to expedite development work. He thus chose a team (party) that included him in the first eleven. In his parting message, the singer in Babul took to a popular Bengali number to bid goodbye: Besh kichhu shomoy to thaklam…kichhu mon rakhlam, kichhu bhanglam…chollam (I stayed for quite some time… touched some hearts and broke some… farewell).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/babul-resigns-as-asansol-mp-takes-dig-at-adhikari-family/articleshow/87145210.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bangladesh attacks spur Bengal BJP call for CAA||KOLKATA: Continuing violence on minorities in Bangladesh has sent ripples across borders with Bengal BJP citing the incidents of “religious persecution” as a fit case for implementation of CAA in Bengal. BJP’s Ranaghat MP Jagannath Sarkar wrote to PM Narendra Modi urging speedy implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Bengal to reassure the minority Hindu refugees from Bangladesh. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said this was not the first time that minorities in Bangladesh had come under attack. “It happened earlier too when monks at Ramakrishna Mission, Chinmay Math, Gaudiya Mission had to flee the country and take shelter here. The Sheikh Hasina government controlled the violence then, but it could not be stopped. The Citizenship Amendment Act was made for the purpose of giving shelter to such people who are subject to religious persecution,” Ghosh said at a Jantar Mantar dharna in Delhi on Tuesday, wondering why Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee was silent on the issue. MP Sarkar sought the PM’s intervention. “I urge you to implement CAA as soon as possible…if strong steps are not taken, that will encourage the fundamentalist groups in West Bengal,” he said in the letter. Ghosh raised concerns over chances of tension spreading elsewhere. “With each day’s delay in controlling the violence, people are losing faith in the government in the country. If this is not stopped now, it will have repercussions elsewhere too,” he said. VHP on Tuesday staged a protest on Rani Rashmoni Road here. It urged the Hasina government to take steps to restore peace in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bdesh-attacks-spur-bengal-bjp-call-for-caa/articleshow/87145553.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||First semester ICSE, ISC exams postponed||KOLKATA: The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) has postponed the first semester ICSE and ISC 2021-2022 exams, which were originally scheduled to start on November 15. A circular announcing this, issued by council chief executive and secretary Gerry Arathoon, reached school principals late on Tuesday, saying the decision was taken due to “reasons beyond our control”. A revised schedule would be announced “in due course”, according to the circular. The decision comes a day after the CBSE declared its first term offline board examination schedule: from November 30 for Class X and from December 1 for Class XII. While CBSE’s exam would be offline, the council had given a choice to parents on the ICSE and ISC examinations, which were to be held a fortnight before the CBSE exams. Most students had opted for online exam from home, and parents had mostly not given consent for holding the exam from school, confirmed school principals. Principals, students and parents said they were disappointed, since they were already far into preparing for the first-ever “app-based” online board exam. School heads said that earlier in the evening, a circular had arrived, saying that the training for proctors, which was supposed to happen on Tuesday morning and had been postponed, was rescheduled to Wednesday. Principals said they were waiting for the meeting that the council had scheduled for October 21, where the modalities of the app-based online exams would be discussed. “Postponement at a stage when the examinations are a little over three weeks away is tough, when we had already prepared so hard by selecting proctors, getting details from students about the devices they would use,” said a principal. Another principal said, “You cannot have two boards doing two different things in a Covid situation. If children from one board can come to school to write a test, why can’t another board do that?” A student argued that the postponement would mean that schools would utilise the time to rush through with the second-semester syllabus, which would distract them from revising the first-semester syllabus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/first-semester-icse-isc-exams-postponed/articleshow/87145902.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Executive murder probe points to multiple assailants, say cops||KOLKATA: Senior corporate executive Subir Chaki (61) and his driver Rabin Mandal (65) had put up a valiant fight before they were overpowered and stabbed to death, probably by more than one assailant, police said on Tuesday, explaining the multiple stab wounds inflicted on both the victims. Their bodies were found at Chaki’s Kankulia Road house late on Sunday. The police have also concluded that the twin murders took place within an hour of Chaki arriving at his ancestral house at 5.20pm. The executive’s cellphone, which is missing, was switched off at 6.17pm. Mandal’s phone was found beside his body. “From the injury marks, it looks like the duo offered stiff resistance but were overpowered,” an investigating official said. The cops have also formed an idea of the type of knife used in the murder from a bloodstain on a pillow. On Tuesday, sniffer dogs repeatedly picked up a trail from the house to Ballygunge railway station, indicating that the killers got away in a train. CCTV footage around the station are being checked. The motive behind the killings, however, still remains a mystery with no cash, valuables or documents missing. The cops suspect the murder may be linked to a property deal since Chaki had put his house up for sale and had possibly visited the address to meet a prospective buyer or broker. Chaki’s mobile location is being tracked to check his whereabout between 2.40pm when he left his New Town apartment in his car and 5.20pm when he reached Kankulia Road. Call records of the two deceased are also being checked to draw up a list of people who had called them up. Till Tuesday evening, police had interrogated a dozen people, including three real estate brokers based in Gariahat and the driver and helper of a mini-truck that was on Sunday evening parked next to Chaki’s Mercedes, blocking the view of a CCTV camera installed in a building opposite Chaki’s house. A four member anti-homicide wing team visited Chaki’s office at 4 Mangoe Lane and recorded the statements of his colleagues. Questions ranged from who spoke to him last and whether he was facing any trouble in office. A four-member team from the detective department also visited the executive’s New Town home and spoke to his family members. The cops are also scanning his recent monetary transactions to check if he had received any advance against the Kankulia Road property or if he had any urgent requirement for funds. “The most vexing question is the motive. At least one of the killers knew the layout of the house and had even locked the door that leads to the rented office on the ground floor,” said an officer. The scientific wing of DD carried out a 3D imaging of the murder spot for better analysis and for use in court later if required. The forensic team also picked up blood samples from the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/exec-murder-probe-points-to-multiple-assailants-cops/articleshow/87145888.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||BJP candidate faces ‘go back’ slogans in Dinhata||Jalpaiguri: BJP’s Dinhata candidate Ashok Mandal was barracked during his campaign in Nayarhat on Tuesday morning by alleged Trinamool Congress supporters who chanted ‘go back’ slogans. The hecklers mobbed Mandal and BJP’s Natabari MLA Mihir Goswami, and forced them to cut short the day’s programme. “They (Trinamool) are not allowing us to conduct our bypoll campaign. This proves how undemocratic the ruling party in the state is. We have filed a complaint with the Election Commission and lodged two FIRs at Dinhata police station. We have named Trinamool leaders involved in attacking our candidate,” said BJP’s Cooch Behar district president Malati Rava Roy. Tuesday’s incident was a repeat of what happened at Bamanhat Bazaar a day before. Police had had to intervene and escort the BJP leaders out of the market area on Monday. Trinamool leaders rubbished the allegations. They said residents were not allowing Mandal to campaign because people were resentful of the bypoll thrust upon them by BJP MP Nisith Pramanik, who resigned as MLA after winning the seat to retain his Parliament membership. “BJP is heaping allegations on us because it knows it will lose the bypoll,” a senior Trinamool leader said. The heckling of Mandal has evoked sharp reactions from certain sections of the Rajbanshi community among whom he has clout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-candidate-faces-go-back-slogans-in-dinhata/articleshow/87145109.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||Kolkata||Mischief with Bangladesh violence images will invite legal action: West Bengal police||KOLKATA: Bengal police on Tuesday said legal action would be taken against anyone trying to use images attributed to the ongoing violence in Bangladesh to instigate trouble in the state. In a statement, police said: “(A) Few video clips from Bangladesh relating to Durga Puja are being circulated on WhatsApp and other social media platforms with mischievous intention of creating law and order problems in WB. Please refrain from spreading such videos which are liable for legal prosecution.” Police also shared an image of an incident in Bangladesh that was being passed off as an one in Bengal, on which action has been taken. The measures were taken after Nabanna again alerted all SPs and police commissioners to be especially vigilant over social media as there were reports that some groups were trying to utilize the incidents of vandalism in Bangladesh during Durga Puja and instigate communal tension in Bengal. TOI had reported of a similar alert on Monday. A senior official said top officials had been asked to keep track of all social media posts due to apprehensions that some forces might try to misuse the Bangladesh incidents to foment trouble in Bengal. Already, there are reports of widespread circulation of the murder of a person in Bangladesh being passed off as one that took place in Bengal. The official said: “All units are being instructed to keep a sharp vigil on videos that are being forwarded. Even small matters of communal overtures are to be reported promptly at the highest level.” The official added: “Any post that spreads hatred, falsehood or rumours are to be dealt with sternly, as some groups and individuals have launched a concerted effort on social media to spread communal hatred and create law and order issues.” On Friday, the Bengal Intelligence Branch had issued a missive to all senior officers to alert them about any sensitive situation being created in border areas due to some fundamentalist organizations that have turned proactive after the incidents in Bangladesh. Officials said the aim was to stop distribution of fake or edited videos with ulterior motives and to this end, they were trying to advise people not to indiscriminately share or forward videos or posts without checking their veracity as this was an offence under the IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mischief-with-bdesh-violence-images-will-invite-legal-action-bengal-police/articleshow/87145534.cms||---

India, in turn, is ensuring full operational preparedness to take care of any contingency along the frontier. ‘Working to mitigate threat to Chicken’s Neck’ India also assiduously works towards mitigating the threat to the vulnerable Siliguri Corridor or the “Chicken’s Neck”, eastern Army Command chief Lt-General Manoj Pande said. The government is also examining whether the existing border pacts with China, including the Border Defence Cooperation Agreement (BDCA) inked in October 2013, should be reviewed in wake of the continuing 17-month-long military confrontation in eastern Ladakh. Read AlsoIndia, China face off along LAC in Arunachal PradeshThe face-off lasted for a few hours before the troops disengaged and Indian troops outnumbered the Chinese at the location, sources said. There was no damage to the Indian defences in the face-off that took place between the two sides at the location, they said.Lt-Gen Pande, on his part, said Indian Army’s efforts “have been to respect the bilateral agreements and protocols” and “not show any aggression” in keeping with “our larger strategic guidance”, notwithstanding the actions or responses from the People’s Liberation Army. “But consequent to what happened (in eastern Ladakh) and what we need to do in the future, this is something I reckon is being looked at the highest levels,” he added. Many PLA reserve formations, which were mobilised last year, continue to remain in place in “depth areas” across the 1,346-km border that Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim share with the Tibet Autonomous Region in the eastern sector. “There has also been an increase in the scale and duration of PLA exercises, with a focus on integrated joint operations, this year. But these exercises are taking place in their traditional training areas in the depth,” said Lt-Gen Pande. On the Line of Actual Control, there has been “a marginal increase” in Chinese patrols and the number of border defence troops in several areas like Asaphila due to infrastructure development. “But we have adequate force-levels in every sector. In the eastern command, we are ensuring that our preparedness, our ability to react to any contingency remains very high. We are also maximising the use of technology for ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance),” he said. The Siliguri Corridor, the narrow strip of land that connects the northeast with the rest of India, however remains a major concern. The 73-day face-off at Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction in 2017 began after Indian troops blocked Chinese attempts to extend a motorable track towards the Jampheri Ridge, which overlooks the Siliguri Corridor. The fallout has been that the PLA has constructed military infrastructure and permanently deployed troops in north Doklam. With China keen on controlling Doklam, it last week also inked an MoU with Bhutan for expediting their bilateral boundary negotiations. “Yes, the Siliguri Corridor is sensitive for us. We are looking at a ‘whole of nation’ approach, with the armed forces, Central Armed Police Forces, central agencies and state governments working together, to mitigate this threat,” said Lt-Gen Pande. Both India and China are “fully aware of each other sensitivities” in the region. The officer said he did not fully agree that there was stark military asymmetry with China.

---||India||NIA to investigate 4 cases of civilian killings in J&K||NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) will probe four cases relating to recent civilian killings by terrorists in J&K, the victims being Srinagar pharmacist M L Bindroo, Sikh school principal Supinder Kaur and teacher Deepak Chand, Bihari vendor Virendra Paswan, and two Bihari labourers — Raja Reshi Dev and Joginder Reshi Dev — killed in Kulgam. NIA has been roped in to probe the larger conspiracy behind the killings, purportedly at the behest of groups like LeT & its arm The Resistance Front that get Pakistan support. Targeted hits seen as attack on ‘positive’ J&K narrative The home ministry will hand over four relevant cases to NIA for probing the origins of the attacks, seen as a move by ISI-backed terrorist groups to attack a “positive” narrative in J&K which has lately focused on normalcy and development. The attacks on minorities and migrants are intended, feel security forces, to instil fear in the mind of “outsiders” that they are not safe in the Valley. The victims included workers who were catering to local labour needs as well as the influx of tourists. According to the UT administration there were over million tourists visiting Jammu & Kashmir in July, 1.1 million in August and 1.3 million in September. The seeming peace and normalcy, along with measures to rehabilitate Kashmiri Pandits, ran contrary to the terror script and led to the provocative targeted killings. The changed strategy of terrorist groups comprises roping in local Kashmiri youths who are not yet on police or intelligence radar to carry out one-off attacks in return for money or drugs, so as to project them as indigenous acts. The youths are suspected to have carried out the latest killings with pistols handed over by the terrorists. Sources said some overground workers involved in the civilian killings have been identified and are either already picked up or likely to be detained for questioning. The network, runs across Srinagar, Budgam, Pulwama, Shopian, Anantnag and Kulgam, a source disclosed to TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nia-to-investigate-4-cases-of-civilian-killings-in-jk/articleshow/87147649.cms||Bharti Jain

The focus areas, according to official readouts of the participating countries, will be trade, technology cooperation, Big Data and maritime security, with the objective to generate synergies that go beyond government-level cooperation. Israel’s foreign minister Yair Lapid and Jaishankar joined the meeting from Jerusalem, while the others attended virtually from their countries. Lapid was quoted saying later, “Around this virtual table, there is a unique set of capabilities, knowledge and experience that can be used to create the network that we all want to see created.” “I think the word we’re looking for here is synergy, because this is what we’re going to try and create starting with this meeting. Synergy that will help us work together on infrastructure, digital infrastructure, transport, maritime security and other things that preoccupy us all... The key to success is how quickly can we move from ‘government-to-government’ to ‘business-tobusiness’,” he added. Jaishankar said, “Discussed working together more closely on economic growth and global issues. Agreed on expeditious follow-up.” In his brief comment, he said, “The three of you are among the closest relationships we have, if not the closest.” He added, “I think it is very clear that on the big issues of our times we all think very similarly and what would be helpful would be if we could agree on some practical things to work upon.” The group discussed the possibility of working together on joint infrastructure projects. The meeting also deliberated on each country appointing a senior level bureaucrat to be part of a joint working group to materialise these decisions. All four ministers promised to meet in person during the Dubai Expo in the coming months. US state department spokesperson Ned Price in a statement said Blinken and his three counterparts discussed expanding economic and political cooperation in West Asia and Asia. “Blinken and the ministers also discussed people to people ties in technology and science, and how to support global public health in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic,” the statement said. In his remarks, Blinken described Israel, the UAE and India as three of “our most strategic partners” and said that by “bringing friends together in new ways, we are making these partnerships even greater than the sum of their parts”. Blinken added: “I think that is what this gathering is about. Sitting here in Washington I can say very simply that with Israel, the UAE and India we have three of our most strategic partners. And given so many overlapping interests — energy, climate, trade, regional security — this seems like a really good idea to try and use this new format.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-quad-takes-shape-with-focus-on-tech-trade-big-data/articleshow/87147686.cms||Indrani Bagchi

In his remarks, Blinken described Israel, the UAE and India as three of “our most strategic partners” and said that by “bringing friends together in new ways, we are making these partnerships even greater than the sum of their parts”. Blinken added: “I think that is what this gathering is about. Sitting here in Washington I can say very simply that with Israel, the UAE and India we have three of our most strategic partners. And given so many overlapping interests — energy, climate, trade, regional security — this seems like a really good idea to try and use this new format.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-quad-takes-shape-with-focus-on-tech-trade-big-data/articleshow/87147685.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||India||SIT releases photos of suspects who ‘lynched’ BJP men in Kheri||BAREILLY: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the Lakhimpur Kheri violence released six photographs of suspects who had allegedly “lynched” three BJP workers after the convoy of junior home minister Ajay Mishra’s son’s allegedly mowed down farmers at a protest site there on October 3. It has also announced cash rewards — without mentioning the amount — for information about the suspects. The pictures show a few men with sticks and black flags near burning vehicles. Sources said police are trying to ascertain whether the attack on the BJP convoy was “intentional or an act of retaliation”. Meanwhile, many called the posters a violation of rights and something that may put these men at risk. Human rights activist Trilochan Singh Gandhi said, “Sharing pictures of the farmers publicly without even knowing their names or without having any evidence to link them to the violence may put them in harm’s way. A few of the suspects might actually be the ones who were carrying out the rescue work after the violence.” SN Sabat, ADG (Lucknow zone) said, “It is a legal process. It is not a violation of human rights, and releasing the pictures won’t put them at risk." A member of SIT said, “We have identified a few suspects. We can’t call them anti-social elements as they are only suspects at the moment. We questioned nine farmers on Tuesday and they were sent back home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sit-releases-photos-of-suspects-who-lynched-bjp-men-in-kheri/articleshow/87147714.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

While Moscow said a joint outcome document will also be adopted following the talks, both Russia and India expressed reservations about the conduct of the Taliban in recent months that has seen them reneging on promises made to women and minorities. India’s ambassador to Russia D B Venkatesh Varma said in Moscow a few days ago that ``in the last several months, unfortunately we have seen that Afghanistan is a story of broken promises’’. ``Whether the Taliban will stand by their commitments and back words with deeds - we will wait and see,’’ he told Russian daily Kommersant. The Moscow Format talks were preceded by a meeting Tuesday of the extended troika in which Russia, China and Pakistan, according to Moscow, exchanged views on common security threats and expressed interest in providing Afghanistan with urgent humanitarian and economic assistance. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, however, said after the meeting that recognition for the Taliban government was not under discussion and that Moscow was still prodding Taliban to fulfil the promises they made when they came to power. India is likely to back a proposal by Russia at the talks for a UN conference to provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. PM Narendra Modi had called for urgent and direct humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people and an ``inclusive administration’’ in his G20 address. Before sending any aid though, India wants an enabling environment for the UN to ensure a non-discriminatory distribution of aid to the Afghan people. The Taliban will be represented in the Moscow Format talks, in which they are hoping for steps towards international recognition, by a delegation headed by Abdul Salam Hanafi, second deputy of the prime minister. Interestingly, the US did not participate in the troika-plus meeting apparently because it was ``logistically difficult’’ but expressed support for the format. While no real breakthrough is expected in the talks on Wednesday, the participating countries are expected to press the Taliban for a more inclusive administration. Both Russia and India believe that the current Taliban government is not inclusive and that it shouldn’t receive any international recognition in its current form.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/inclusive-afghanistan-government-on-agenda-of-talks-in-russia-india-to-attend/articleshow/87147733.cms||Sachin Parashar

---||Mumbai||Corporates turn to ex-govt sleuths as frauds increase||MUMBAI: “So what exactly did you say to him?” asked the CEO of an automobile company to a forensic investigator who had casually walked out of a room after interviewing an employee accused of taking kickbacks. Investigators had unearthed suspicious transactions but were unable to pinpoint where the money was parked. The investigator, who is associated with a large consultancy, said he simply stood over the employee and stared him down for a few minutes, and the latter spilled the beans. “I did not say a word,” laughed the investigator, who until two years ago was an officer with Mumbai police. As corporate frauds rise and investigations get more complex, major professional services firms are taking on more former law enforcement officers—whether from the police department, ED, CBI or Customs. ‘Training for intel gathering unavailable in pvt sector’Earlier, there was a limited pool of such professionals and identifying the right candidate took time,” said Mukul Shrivastava, partner, Forensic & Integrity Services, EY. Recruitment was limited to three or four employees a year. “But the situation is different now. Requests from former law enforcement officers looking to join forensics have increased to about two or three a month,” said Shrivastava. Consultancies, including the big four ones, have seen a surge in corporate investigation assignments such as cases involving fraud by employees, espionage by competitors, siphoning of funds by debtors or even due diligence about a potential CEO. Credential investigation and background verification are becoming mandatory in large corporates and multinationals before carrying out any merger or acquisition. “Formal training for imparting intelligence gathering knowledge or skills isn’t available in the private sector in India. So, the only people who have relevant experience and expertise are those who have done it for a living with law enforcement agencies. These are also individuals who have the relevant contacts and understand the importance of operating with stealth,” said Nikhil Bedi, partner and leader, forensic, Deloitte India. Many fraud investigations do not involve just accounting anymore. They could unearth economic crimes that would require a probe by other enforcement agencies. “With this change, we need individuals with a good amount of skill in crime investigations, documentation and skill for managing investigations that can come under scrutiny by enforcement agencies,” said Sivarama Krishnan, partner and leader, cyber security, PwC India. Former law enforcement officers can also bring a different perspective to a forensic project. In one instance, a company engaged in media and telecom suddenly faced rising costs and a drop in revenues, prompting it to appoint a consultancy firm for a forensic probe. “Our first instinct was to check that company’s financials. But an IPS officer who had joined us suggested we look at the customers. He quickly deduced a flaw that had allowed bogus customers to get on board,” said a partner with the firm. In another instance, during an investigation undertaken by a consultancy, a former law enforcement officer merely examined documents and pointed out that some of them appeared potentially fraudulent. Firms could also use former law enforcement officers to train employees on how to start with a probe or what to look for, with illustrations from real life. “Often, for several investigators, the opportunities and pay packages that consultancies offer seem to be a big attraction. That, along with the fact that now consultancies are also entering into more complex investigations, the scope for law enforcement officers is only increasing,” said D Sivanandhan, former DGP of Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/corporates-turn-to-ex-govt-sleuths-as-frauds-increase/articleshow/87147755.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||India||Government revisits proposal of 2014 panel on new umbrella green law||NEW DELHI: Exploring ways to draft a new umbrella green law subsuming all existing environmental legislations, the government has revisited recommendations of the sevenyear old high-level committee that had suggested clubbing Air Act and Water Act with the Environment Protection Act of 1986 while treating laws on forests and wildlife separately. Though the process to streamline existing green laws through certain amendments had been in progress at the environment ministry for the last couple of years, the recent move was triggered by the Centre’s plan to treat this aspect on priority as it figured in the 60-point action plan following the meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with secretaries and ministers last month. “We have been working on amending the Indian Forests Act (IFA) and the Forest Conservation Act (FCA). A consultation paper on amending FCA, 1980 has already been released, seeking inputs from stakeholders. As far as the single Environment Act is concerned, the recommendations of the 2014 highlevel committee are being minutely studied,” said an official. The committee, chaired by former cabinet secretary T S R Subramanian, had been constituted under the Modi government’s first term. It had submitted its recommendation to the ministry in November, 2014. “It is practically impossible to subsume all environmental laws in one act/legislation. It has never happened anywhere in the world and it is not only impossible to draft such a legislation: implementation will also be impossible. How can provisions with respect to air pollution, water pollution, poaching of wild animals, EIA, and Access and benefit sharing of traditional knowledge be merged together in one law,” said Ritwick Dutta of Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE). Dutta, an environmental lawyer, said, “It is important to appreciate that environment is a complex subject and given the environmental challenges, there is need for more specific laws to deal with environmental issues. To subsume all laws in one legislation is in simple words a plan that is designed to fail at the very inception itself.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-revisits-proposal-of-2014-panel-on-new-umbrella-green-law/articleshow/87147837.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Kochi||Kerala: Floodgates opened in advance to avoid 2018’s ‘man-made’ deluge||KOCHI: Three shutters of Cheruthoni dam, part of Idukki reservoir, were opened on Tuesday in view of the heavy rainfall in its catchment areas in the last two days. The shutters of Idamalayar dam in Ernakulam and Pampa in Pathanamthitta were also opened in the morning after the water level reached danger levels. The India meteorological department (IMD) has, meanwhile, issued heavy rainfall alerts for most parts of the state in the next two days. Orange alert for very heavy rainfall of 12-20cm has been issued for 11 districts on Thursday and 12 districts on Friday. The flow of water was monitored in between opening the shutters to avoid any untoward incident, said KSEB officialsThe shutters of Cheruthoni dam were last opened in August 2018, when the state witnessed the worst floods in a century. Kerala State Electricity Board had faced huge criticism as the dam shutters were opened without proper warning, causing massive destruction in downstream areas. The district administration had shifted 64 families in five villages this time to avoid casualties. Besides 2018, the shutters were opened only twice earlier — in 1981 and 1992. ‘Shutters opened in a staggered manner’Sirens were sounded before opening the shutters. The dam safety wing of KSEB said they were opened in a staggered manner at 11am, 12 noon and 12.30pm. They were opened by 35cm each, releasing 0.331 million cubic metres (mcm) of water per second into the Cheruthoni river. The flow of water was monitored in between opening the shutters to avoid any untoward incident. Power minister K Krishnankutty and water resources minister Roshy Augustine were present on the occasion. KSEB officials said there was no need to impose any travel restriction on Cheruthoni bridge this time. The bridge was submerged in August 2018, blocking the traffic on Puliyanmala-Thodupuzha state highway. "The water is now flowing at nearly half the height of the bridge and there are no traffic curbs on the route," one of them said. The inflow into the dam, as per the 9pm bulletin, was 0.662 mcm/ hour. The water level was 2398.1ft, which is 94.26% of the total storage. The catchment areas of the reservoir had received 168mm rainfall on Saturday and the water level in the dam rose over 2.25ft within eight hours. Those residing on the banks of rivers have been shifted to camps and a high alert sounded across districts. The water level in Mullaperiyar dam at 5pm on Tuesday was 134.1ft as against the maximum storage level of 142ft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/floodgates-opened-in-advance-to-avoid-18s-man-made-deluge/articleshow/87147786.cms||---

Addressing the media in Kannur on Tuesday, Satheesan said the authority itself has become a disaster and demanded that it be reconstituted to make it effective. “The low pressure system originated in the Arabian Sea on Oct 8 and on Oct 9 many foreign agencies predicted that it would move towards Kerala after coming down a degree (latitude). Later, IMD predicted it would hit the state between Kochi and Kozhikode. Still, KSDMA did not issue an alert and came up with a red alert 90 minutes after it caused mud slips. They are not doing proper monitoring and are issuing red alerts after everything is over,” Satheesan added. He said that the government failed in implementing risk mitigation measures to address natural calamities caused by climate change during the last three years after the floods in 2018. “Recurring natural calamities due to climate change have made it clear that Kerala is fast becoming an ecologically-fragile area prone to floods and landslides. Adding to the risk, Arabian Sea is increasingly giving rise to low pressure systems. We should address the issue and come up with long-term projects to mitigate their impacts,” he said. Satheesan said that while the CM (after visiting the Netherlands) had announced Room for Rivers project, the proposed SilverLine project went against it as over 55% of the line would be built on embankments that would block water flow, leading to floods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kerala-ksdma-failed-to-act-must-be-rejigged-says-vd-satheesan/articleshow/87147773.cms||---

The less fortunate ones in coffins. The bodies of Yogendra Rishi Dev and Raja Rishi Dev of Araria — killed in Kulgam on October 17 — arrived at Patna airport on Tuesday. In Purnia, meanwhile, villagers of Kariyat bid a tearful farewell to Mohammed Muzahid Alam, who was killed last Wednesday. At least five people from Bihar have been killed by terrorists in the last 15 days. Those who have returned alive are thanking God. Like Mohammed Anamul Haq from Forbesganj, who reached Patna on Monday night. He was accompanied by his wife Rubiya and daughters Sabina and Ayesha. “There is no dearth of work in J&K. But the attacks have created panic. Family members have pressured workers to return home,” said Anamul who worked as a carpenter in Kulgam. Abhay Kumar, from Saharsa, said he didn’t want to vacate his rented accommodation but the worsening situation forced him to return. “I had gone in search of a livelihood but nobody will put one’s life in danger.” The stories of Mohammed Zafar Alam, Raheesh and Murtaza from Madhepura district are the same. All of them alighted at Patna Junction at around 9pm on Monday. Sagir Ahmed, who worked in a cricket-bat manufacturing company, said, “I feared going out of my house.” He lamented that there were not enough job opportunities in Bihar, which was forcing people to look for work elsewhere. At Patna airport, a host of politicians, including Bihar deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, labour resources department minister Jibesh Kumar and BJP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi, paid floral tribute to the slain labourers. The body of Muzahid, a mason by profession, had reached his village on Sunday night. His wife Dilkho Bano is worried about the survival of her family. “He was the sole breadwinner... I have to look after four minor children,” she said. Muzahid’s younger brother, Mohammed Dilwar, said over 300 people from villages like Bisrupa, Bhakhri, Amna, Bagulabari, Bahadur, Adhkaili and Amnakismat in Dagarua block are working as labourers in different parts of J&K. “Most of them are still stuck in the Valley, their family members are worried about their safety,” Dilwar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bihar-migrant-workers-return-from-terror-hit-valley-some-in-coffins/articleshow/87147882.cms||Ramashankar

The civic body appointed IAS officers zonal level monitoring officials ahead of the monsoon, expected to set in around October 27, and has held three meetings to tackle the issue that invariably brings many areas to a standstill every year. The civic body maintains 31 canals of which 16 are in core city areas and 15 in extended areas. All canals have desilted before monsoon. About 620km of the 1,894km length drain network, that includes about 3,842 drains, has also been desilted, said an official adding that the numbers are updated every day as the work is ongoing. “We have men and machinery available and have deployed them in all zonal offices for emergency operations. Tree pruning is being carried out every day and we are monitoring the work closely by inspecting drains every day,” said commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. Critical locations where up to 2ft water stagnation is possible includes Kargil Nagar in Thiruvottiyur , Kailasam Street and Meenambal Nagar in Tondiarpet, Pullianthope High Road and Senthil Nagar in Thiru Vi Ka Nagar, Korattur North Avenue, Habibullah Road and R A Puram 1st Main Road in Teynampet, Bazullah Road, R K Shanmugam Salai in Kodambakkam, AGS Colony in Velachery, Selva Nagar and Semmencheri housing board in Sholinganallur and Ram Nagar and Mylai Balaji Nagar in Perungudi. “There were 306 such locations in 2015 and they have been reduced to 23 after several interventions including storm water drain construction and other infrastructure interventions. This year, apart from just constructing drains, we have focused more on de-clogging major inlet and outlet points of all drains, canals and lakes. We have also de-clogged silt catch pits on all streets to ensure water doesn’t stagnate at all. This work is being monitored daily by IAS officials,” said Rajendiran, chief engineer and in-charge of storm water drains department. He added that if there was inundation in some location due to reverse flow in the sea, the civic body will ensure that it is cleared in an hour using pumps and other machinery. Apart from this, meetings were conducted with all line departments including public works, forest, TNEB and revenue departments to ensure there is coordination during the monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/civic-body-races-to-finish-work-ensure-a-flood-free-chennai/articleshow/87147879.cms||Komal Gautham

As per the data submitted in the assembly by former industries minister E P Jayarajan on October 29, 2019, as many as 223 new quarries were granted permits in the state after January1, 2019, till then. These include 47 fresh quarries in Ernakulam, 35 in Palakkad, 32 in Malappuram, 23 each in Kozhikode and Kannur, 16 in Pathanamthitta, 15 in Thiruvananthapuram, 12 in Kollam, nine in Kottayam, six in Thrissur, two each in Idukki and Kasaragod and one in Wayanad. There are at present 586 authorised quarries functioning in the state. As many as 436 applications for quarrying permits have been put on hold after the green tribunal came up with an order mandating 200 metres of buffer zone for every quarry. As per government sources, there are hundreds of unauthorised quarries functioning despite court interventions. This is also evident from the government’s statements in the assembly that though several applications are pending and permits of several quarries revoked, there is no shortage of construction materials in the state. A report by a committee of experts set up to examine the causes of incidents of heavy rainfall, flooding and landslides, had found indiscriminate changes in land-use pattern and quarrying as major contributing factors for the recurring natural hazards. The report pointed to a close link between hard rock quarrying and slope failures in the form of landslides. The committee had recommended the restriction of quarrying and mining activities at high landslide prone areas and to enforce regulations at low landslide prone areas. Figures from the mining and geology department reveal that the state mined whopping 3.53 crore tonnes of granite----the highest-ever quantity----in 2018-19. Along with other minor minerals, it fetched the government Rs 171.28 crore--- a 12.7% rise compared to the preceding year. To bring some control over illegal quarries, then then director of mining and geology department, K Biju, had written to district police chiefs to book illegal quarries under the Section 9B of Explosives Act, 1884. Though the mining and geology department, the nodal agency for granting for quarrying licenses, is also engaged in detecting illegal quarrying, its intervention limited as it does not have enough manpower resources to contain the illegal activity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/223-new-quarry-permits-issued-after-2018-kerala-floods/articleshow/87147730.cms||KP Saikiran
---||India||Focus on 2nd dose as India nears 100 crore vax landmark||NEW DELHI: India’s Covid-19 cumulative vaccination coverage on Tuesday crossed 99 crore. This includes more than 70 crore people who have been administered the first dose and 28.9 crore who have received the second dose. As India got closer to the one billion mark, the health ministry urged state governments to step up the vaccination drive and also focus on second dose coverage as a sizeable number of people eligible for the second shot have not got it yet. As cumulative doses administered crossed 99.08 crore on Tuesday evening, the government described it as a “milestone”. Highlighting the vaccination count, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted saying, “Go for it India, continue to rapidly march towards our milestone of 100 crore #Covid vaccinations.” We are at 99 crores 💉Go for it India, continue to rapidly march towards our milestone of 100 crore #COVID19 vacci… https://t.co/HgBVYWBdNW— Dr Mansukh Mandaviya (@mansukhmandviya) 1634622840000In the 18-44 years category, 39.7 crore have got their first shot, and the figure is 11.5 crore for the second dose. Over 16.8 crore people have received their first shot in the 45-59 years age group. In this age bracket, around 8.7 crore have got the second shot. In case of senior citizens over 10.6 crore have got the first dose and over 6.2 crore have taken the second shot. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, in a review meeting on Monday, congratulated states/UTs on their effort to vaccinate all citizens and underlined the need to push for full vaccine coverage. The ministry has asked states and UTs to identify and prioritise districts having low coverage for focused action and explore requirement for mobilisation efforts, addressing local challenges, need for additional Covid vaccination centres and improving access in rural areas. States have also been asked to share their strategy to enhance second dose coverage. The ministry also sought suggestions in formulating new norms for international travel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/focus-on-2nd-dose-as-india-nears-100-crore-vax-landmark/articleshow/87147914.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Over 4,800 adverse events after Covid jabs reported in Kerala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala recorded 4,827 adverse events following immunization (AEFI) related to Covid-19 vaccines till September, as per data obtained through RTI. The figures furnished by the directorate of health services (DHS) show that the share of adverse events in the state has been very low (0.01%). Till September 5, about 2.96 crore doses of Covid vaccine were given in the state, of which 4,509 minor AEFI, 71 severe AEFI and 247 serious AEFI cases were reported. DHS data show that 174 deaths were reported within 30 days after vaccination. The RTI document adds that all deaths which occur following vaccination may not be due to vaccination but may also be coincidental. AEFI is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and may not necessarily have a causal relationship with the vaccine. The adverse events are classified by severity and frequency as minor, severe and serious. Death comes under serious AEFI. Officials said that district level causality assessment is being undertaken across the state. An expert committee constituted for the state will further analyse this data and submit it to the Centre. In minor AEFI, Kannur with 1,164 cases reported the highest number, followed by Palakkad (812) and Thrissur (436). Thrissur with 47 cases reported the highest number of serious AEFI and 37 deaths. Idukki and Kasaragod with five cases each recorded the lowest number of serious AEFI till September. “Kerala had a very negligible percentage of adverse events following Covid vaccination. We are investigating each case which has been reported so far in all the districts,” said an official. The low percentage of adverse events is going to boost the vaccination campaign, officials said. “As per our latest estimates, around 1.25 lakh people are to take both doses. It may not be entirely due to vaccine reluctance, we hope to plug this gap soon,” the official added. A statement in Parliament in February 2021 shows that of the total AEFIs reported across the country, most of the events were minor AEFIs like anxiety, vertigo, giddiness, dizziness, fever, pain, rashes, and headache which were self-limiting and all people had recovered. Approximately 17 lakh doses of Covid vaccine will be administered in November since many people are due for the second dose in the first two weeks of November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/over-4800-adverse-events-after-covid-jabs-reported-in-kerala/articleshow/87147728.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The plan was suggested as part of the airport expansion project, which includes adding more facilities like the MRO, a fuel farm and more parking bays to equip the airport to handle passenger and aircraft traffic in the coming years as plans for a second airport are progressing slowly. The MRO will be set up over 3,000sqm by the side of the secondary runway. The land has been ear-marked for the purpose near a set of parking bays and hangars. A tender has been floated to identify a contractor who will build and operate the facility for 30 years. Firms interested in bidding will be visiting the airport in the coming weeks. The project is to be completed in a year. Sources said the MRO’s hangar will come up in front of a set of remote parking bays where planes can be parked. An airline hangar is also nearby. “The MRO will have qualified manpower, equipment and space to handle maintenance and overhaul of planes. An airport the size of Chennai’s needs an MRO. It will help airlines to maintain planes in Chennai instead of taking them abroad at huge cost,” a source said. In the absence of adequate MRO facilities, airlines take their leased aircraft to the Middle East or southeast Asia for maintenance or repairs. Airlines will also be encouraged to park their planes in Chennai and start morning services thanks to this facility. At present, foreign airlines are looking at Bengaluru as a hub and not Chennai because of inadequate space or parking bays here. AAI is trying to open MRO facilities at Bhopal, Chandigarh, Hyderabad and Juhu as the ministry of civil aviation is looking at developing more such facilities to bring business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-airport-to-soon-get-an-exclusive-facility-to-maintain-repair-planes/articleshow/87147940.cms||---

He also sought inquiry by a retired SC judge into an unnamed NCB officer’s role in the case while alleging that he has been taking malafide action against actors since Sushant Singh Rajput’s death to wreak vengeance over denial of role to his Marathi actress wife in Hindi films. Though his letter petition says he was moving the SC under Article 32, he also requests CJI to take suo motu cognisance of “vendetta inquiry” under NDPS resorted to by NCB without any evidence against Aryan. “If they want to give him bail, it can be done right away, even on public holidays, but there’s miscarriage of justice as such an important case is pending since last 12 days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/its-vendetta-sena-neta-in-sc-on-aryan-khan/articleshow/87147950.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Residents of Ullagaram Puzhudhivakkam, Velachery, Madipakkam, Sholinganallur, Alandur, St Thomas Mount and Pallavaram will be supplied with water from the new plant coming up at Nemmeli next to the existing desalination plant. Those living along the IT corridor will also get piped water supply, said a Metrowater official. Chief minister M K Stalin on Tuesday inspected the new plant which has capacity to supply 150 million litres of treated water. The CM inspected work on intake sump, product water tank, product water pumping station, clarified water tank, dissolved air flotation, ultra-filter, reverse osmosis process, sludge thickener and Lamella clarifier. Metrowater has already begun laying pipelines from this plant to the Pallavaram area. The city depends mainly on the northeast monsoon and when it fails, it faces water shortage. To overcome this problem, the two desalination plants at Minjur and Nemmeli were set up with a capacity to treat 100 million litres of sea water a day. These plants fulfill the water needs of several localities in north and south Chennai. The first plant was inaugurated by then chief minister M Karunanidhi. The foundation stone for the one at Nemmeli was laid by present chief minister, M K Stalin when he was deputy chief minister in 2010. Treated water from the Nemmeli desalination plant is being supplied to residents in Velachery, Pallippattu, Adyar, Besant Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur, Kottivakkam, Palavakkam, Neelangarai, Sholinganallur, besides IT companies in south Chennai. As on Tuesday, Metrowater draws 55 million litres of treated water from its desalination plant and 88 million litres of treated water from the Minjur desalination plant. The capacity of each of these plants is 100 million litres a day. With the six reservoirs including Veeranam brimming with water, Metrowater reduced the quantity of water it draws from these two plants, said a Metrowater official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-9-lakh-more-homes-to-get-desal-water/articleshow/87147975.cms||P Oppili
---||Kochi||Kerala: Study had warned against mining in Kootickal hills||KOTTAYAM: A study by the state biodiversity board conducted in 2013 had strongly recommended the state government to stop mining and quarrying activities in Koottickal panchayat, where a landslide on Saturday claimed 10 lives. The board had also suggested that the entire Vagamon hill ranges, including the areas under the Koottickal panchayat, be declared as a protected area, considering its ecological, biodiversity and natural heritage values. The report was based on a study conducted by Unnikrishnan N and Punnen Kurian, conservation experts. The study was conducted after high court issued a directive to the state government to file a report on the Vagamon hill ranges after M P Chandradas, a resident in Koottickal panchayat, approached the court pointing out that the functioning of a quarry in Koottickal has caused threat to life and property personally and also to large-scale environmental degradation. The report clearly said that the hills, where quarrying was going on, were environmentally sensitive. Based on the report, the bio diversity board had cautioned the government against allowing quarrying activity till a comprehensive environmental impact assessment study is conducted to prevent further serious ecological degradation. It was also suggested that the state should develop a zone-mapping for rock mining. Punnen Kurian said the mining sites were near to a stream originated and that it will drain a watershed area. “The Kottamala hill ranges which is part of Vagamon, extends from Ramapuram to Thidanad. Even in such an extensive hill range the quarry mafia has bought almost all hill tops for quarrying,” he said. He also alleged that the mafia is pressing for a hill highway project for linking the quarries, adding that already the region has come under extensive damage. He also said that illegal rock breaking is rampant in Amruthamedu hill ranges in Idukki from where tributaries of several major rivers originate. Besides, local bodies have been turning many areas into dumping yards. Chandradas who approached the court said successive governments have been constantly ignoring the study reports. He also said that a quarry was functioning in the region even on Saturday when the landslides struck the place. “We had sought information under the right to information (RTI) Act to know about the latest study done by the government two years ago. But we were told that the report is not yet ready,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-study-had-warned-against-mining-in-kootickal-hills/articleshow/87147990.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

The teams, which comprise sanitary inspectors and assistant sanitary inspectors, are part of the corporation’s efforts to improve the city’s ranking in Swachh Survekshan 2022. An MCG official said the teams will ensure that waste dumping takes place only at identified secondary collection points and only segregated waste reaches authorised collection points. “Those found violating the norms will be penalised with challans of Rs 5,000 for the first instance. The penalty will be increased if there is a repeat offence and the vehicle will also be impounded,” the official added. The directions came during a meeting held by MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja on Tuesday to review the preparations for the upcoming cleanliness survey. Ahuja also directed officials to set up a sanitation control room in Sector 39 by October 23 to monitor the movement of all waste collection vehicles. The teams will also ensure that public places, market areas and dustbins are regularly cleaned and will also create awareness against the use of polythene bags. Senior sanitation inspector Rishi Malik will be the overall in-charge of these teams and will ensure strict compliance on the ground level. Moreover, the MCG enforcement team has been directed to lift waste from all garbage vulnerable points in the city within three days and ensure cleaning of all public places and back lanes of commercial areas. Officials have also been instructed to shut down illegal meat shops and conduct time-bound lifting and disposal of horticultural waste. In addition to this, the civic body will also stress upon in-situ composting among the bulk waste generators (BWGs) in the city. If any BWG doesn’t process their waste, a penalty of Rs 25,000 will be imposed on them under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. “Also, banquet halls and hotels located within MCG limits will have to ensure compliance of waste management rules and manage waste at their own level. Action will be taken against the establishment concerned for violating the rules. Along with heavy fines, the violating establishments can also be sealed,” an MCG official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/swachh-survey-9-teams-formed-for-waste-mgmt/articleshow/87145217.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to sources, the party has given Amritsar Central ticket to Dalbir Kaur, mother of a man with a criminal track record, even as the constituency is currently represented by senior Congress leader and deputy chief minister O P Soni. “We are of the view that instead of winning Amritsar Central seat, party high command has buckled under the pressure of their alliance partner SAD on whose recommendation Amritsar Central seat has been given to a BSP candidate, who will eventually be helping Akali’s candidate in the neighboring Amritsar South assembly constituency from where Akali’s Talbir Singh Gill is contesting,” said a BSP member on condition of anonymity. When contacted, party general secretary Er Gurbax Singh Shergill confirmed that the seat had been given to Dalbir Kaur, who had also begun the election campaigning. Shergill, however, refused to comment on the opposition of seat to Dalbir by many BSP leaders. Meanwhile, the party in its core committee meeting held on October 16 at Jalandhar has given nod to appoint Bhagwant Singh Chohan as in charge, political affairs, Majha, which has also evoked sharp criticism. “There are already four general secretaries in Amritsar and Tarn Taran then why did party seniors feel a need to bring in a person from Hoshiarpur and appoint him in charge Majha?” questioned Shergill. Sources added that local leadership had sought an appointment with party high command to bring the issues to their knowledge before they could cause any serious damage to the party’s winning prospects in Punjab. After entering into an alliance with the SAD, both parties had agreed to jointly contest the ensuing 2022 elections. According to the seat-sharing formula, the Akalis would be contesting on 97 seats while the BSP would field its candidates on 20 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/resentment-among-bsp-cadre-over-ticket-distribution/articleshow/87145228.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chandigarh||Malerkotla district 5 months old, but administration yet to to get permanent office||Malerkotla: Malerkotla was declared a district about five months ago, but it is yet to get the the necessary infrastructure and staff. On May 14, to mark Eid-ul-Fitr, the state government had announced Malerkotla as the 23rd district of Punjab. An official said the district administration had been working from a building of Punjab State Tubewell Corporation. The official added that after some days, the office will be shifted to a block of the local government college. Deputy commissioner Amrit Kaur Gill told The Times of India that even as they were operating from a temporary office, they had selected a piece of land for district administrative complex (DAC) in Tubewell Colony, opposite government college, where 5-6 acres of land was available. She added they expected construction to start by year-end. DC added public dealing was going on and there had been much progress in a short time. The officer said they had sent a proposal to financial commissioner (revenue) for the development of DAC at the same place after getting land transferred for the purpose. She added the SDM office of Malerkotla will operate from the same centre. She said as far as other two sub-divisions were concerned, they had got land transferred for construction of SDM office in Amargarh sub-division and PWD had invited tenders for the same and work was expected to begin by November. She added that they were looking for land at Ahmedgarh sub-division, even as the SDM office was operating out of a building given by a private organisation. The officer said the demarcation of boundaries had been done. She added not all posts had been sanctioned, even as the cabinet had decided to create 12 posts. District officials said of the 12 posts, two, including deputy commissioner and SSP, have been posted whereas most of the remaining posts were held by officers as additional charge. They added the posts of civil surgeon, district social security officer, district revenue officer, district agriculture officer, district development and panchayat officer (DDPO), were in such category. Officials said IDs had been created for online services including marriage certificates (registration post one year of marriage) and arms licences, but services would be provided within a week, as per information from governance reforms department, since software for the same is being updated. They added administration was unable to provide such services even as they need such services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/malerkotla-district-5-months-old-but-administration-yet-to-to-get-permanent-office/articleshow/87145242.cms||Shariq Majeed

The accused, police said, had recently done some repair work at the woman’s house. On Monday, he went there again on the pretext of checking the work done and allegedly molested her. “He was a familiar face, therefore, I allowed him inside the house,” the complainant said, adding that the accused first looked around to ensure her husband was away. “He then grabbed my hand. I resisted and snapped at him but he continued to hold my hand and tried to pull me towards him. I kept shouting at him and cried for help. Fearing that he may be caught, the man left the house after issuing threats to me,” she said. Based on her complaint a case was registered at Sector 50 police station under sections 354A (sexual harassment) and 506 (criminal intimation) of IPC.
