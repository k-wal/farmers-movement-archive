The number of eligible persons for Covid-19 vaccine in the state is 15.04 crore. As per data from the Cowin portal, 3.01 crore persons in UP have taken both the doses of the vaccine. Data also indicated that in Maharashtra 2.99 crore persons had taken both the doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. Maharashtra, however, is ahead of UP when it comes to the overall share of fully vaccinated persons vis-à-vis totally vaccinated persons. In UP every fifth eligible person in the state has taken both the doses of the vaccine whereas in Maharashtra, 45% of the vaccinated persons have taken both the doses. Health officials pointed out that the hard work put in by field workers, sustained availability of vaccines and accurate strategy was responsible for the achievement. They also said that people of the state also owe a share in the success by taking their due dose. They also reiterated that it was important for everyone to take their due vaccine as both the doses together provide 96.5% defence against complications that land a person to hospital in case they take ill with Covid-19. Among UP districts, Lucknow has the maximum number of fully immunized persons. Here 13.95 lakh persons have taken both the doses. Ghaziabad (10.14 lakh), Gautam Budh Nagar (9.39 lakh), Gorakhpur (8.34 lakh) and Kanpur (8.07 lakh) follow next. Meanwhile, health officials urged people of the state to adhere to the Covid-19 prevention norm whether they have taken the vaccine to keep any kind of trouble away. They also informed that two cases and four recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours while the state was left with just 97 active cases. The official Covid-19 bulletin indicated that the active cases were present in 33 districts only. Of the total, 56% active cases were concentrated in five districts with Lucknow (23) and Gautam Budh Nagar (16) accounting for the maximum load.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-first-state-to-have-over-3-crore-fully-vaccinated-people/articleshow/87265214.cms||Shailvee Sharda

After meeting Valmiki's family at their residence on Monday, Tikait said that “there is no difference between a sanitation worker and a farmer”, and therefore, Valmiki’s family should get similar compensation as was paid to families of farmers killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Talking to media persons, Tikait said that if the government has announced to provide a compensation amount of Rs 40 lakh to Lakhimpur farmers, then the same amount should also be given to the sanitation worker’s kin. “If the right to vote is the same for all, then the compensation amount should also be the same,” he said. He also demanded a judicial inquiry into Valmiki's death. “The government must provide a permanent job in the municipal corporation to Arun Valmiki’s wife. The compensation amount of Rs 10 lakh is insufficient as there are three minor children in the family, and their entire life lies ahead of them. We will stage a protest, if the family is not taken care of properly.” On being asked about social activist Yogendra Yadav, who was suspended from the farmers’ body by Samyukt Kisan Morcha after he met the family members of a BJP worker who was killed during the Kheri violence, Tikait said that he has gone on leave. “He had to write a book and prepare some papers, so he has gone on leave for a few days and will come back on November 21,” he said. Meanwhile, four CCTV cameras were installed in and around Valmiki’s house by Azad Samaj party workers to monitor the movement of persons around their house. This was done after the family expressed fear of harassment by the police to the party’s president Chandrashekhar Azad, who had met them recently.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/up-rakesh-tikait-demands-rs-40l-compensation-for-dalit-sanitation-workers-family/articleshow/87265308.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Mohammad Naeem, the Taliban's spokesperson for the political office, said in a series of tweets that the meeting focused on the current situation in Afghanistan, according to Ariana News. Naeem also said that during the meeting some other issues were also discussed such as the deteriorating economic situation in the country and the treatment of drug addicts. Expressing his gratitude to UNDP for its help, Mullah Baradar called on the UNDP to increase their assistance to the people in various fields. In response, Steiner also pledged continued support to Afghans. Earlier on Saturday, Swedish Development Minister Per Olsson Fridh warned that Afghanistan would collapse into chaos unless the international community acted rapidly. "The country is on the brink of collapse and that collapse is coming faster than we thought," Fridh said. Emphasising that economic freefall could provide an environment for terrorist groups to thrive, Fridh stressed that Sweden would not channel money through the Taliban. Instead, it will boost humanitarian contributions through Afghan civil society groups, according to Dawn.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/taliban-deputy-pm-baradar-meets-undp-director-in-doha-seeks-help/articleshow/87265509.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: MSRTC bus fares hiked by 17%; Pune Shivneri bus ticket up by Rs 75||MUMBAI : The MSRTC has hiked its bus fares on all routes across Maharashtra by an average 17% and this will come into effect from Tuesday morning. The fare of popular Shivneri AC buses from Mumbai to Pune has been hiked by Rs 75 per ticket -- from Rs 450 to Rs 525 per seat. The main reasons for the hike is the huge increase in fuel (diesel) costs which has gone up by 57% past 18 months. A majority of state buses run on diesel although there is plan to convert 1000 into CNG and over 2,000 into electric buses in near future. The MSRTC has a total fleet of 18,000 buses across the state. The only relief given is for those travelling by overnight ordinary buses. The fares for night trips were 18% more than daytime journeys. "Now we have removed the 18% extra fare and night trip charges will be same as those during daytime travel," a MSRTC spokesperson said, adding that all fares have been made multiples of Rs 5. So, a fare of Rs 113 will now be charged as Rs 115. While the fare hike will pinch commuters, especially during Covid pandemic, MSRTC managing director Shekhar Channe said that it was "much needed" as there were huge hikes in fuel costs and also increase in operational and maintenance costs. The cost of diesel was around Rs 66 per litre in Mumbai metropolitan region and this has increased to over Rs 104 per litre -- a jump of 57% in just one and a half years. The MMR includes Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar and parts of Raigad district including Alibagh which has a high demand for state buses. The MSRTC's diesel expenses per day is around Rs 8.8 crore daily -- which comprises 38% of the total expenditure for running the fleet, sources said. The income on the other hand is 12.9 crore on an average daily in October while the total expenditure has been around Rs 21 crore -- resulting in average daily losses of around Rs 8 crore, the sources added. "The ridership is 27 lakh commuters across the state daily -- which is just 41% of pre-Covid times. Our total fleet is 18,000 buses of which 12,500 are plying daily now. During the pandemic, we have witnessed a huge dip in ridership over the past one and half years and incurred tremendous losses," said an official. During pre-Covid times, the daily ridership was over 65 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/maharashtra-msrtc-bus-fares-hiked-by-17-pune-shivneri-bus-ticket-up-by-rs-75/articleshow/87265554.cms||Somit Sen

It has also proposed that the driver must ensure that child pillion passengers aged between nine months and four years must wear crash helmets and safety harnesses. The ministry has issued the draft notification to amend the Central Motor Vehicle Rules to comply with the latest change in the Central Motor Vehicle Act. Violation of these norms attract a fine of Rs 1,000 and suspension of driving licence for three months. According to the draft notification, the driver of a motorcycle in which there is a pillion rider below four years, safety harness has to be used for attaching the child to the driver. Safety harness has been defined as an adjustable vest to be worn by the child with a pair of straps attached to the vest and forming shoulder loops to be worn by the driver. “This way, the upper torso of the child is securely attached to the driver. A feature by which this is achieved is by attaching the straps to the back of the vest and crossing the straps over the vest so that two large crossing-over loops are formed that pass between the legs of the passenger,” the draft notification said. The protective gear including safety harness has to be lightweight, adjustable, waterproof and durable. This must be made of heavy nylon or multifilament nylon material with high density foam and shall be designed to hold weight upto 30 kg. The ministry said once the final notification is issued after consultation with stakeholders, there will be a one year period to start the enforcement of the rule. The proposed rules gain importance considering that two-wheelers remain the most unsafe mode of transport in India and across the developing countries. “We can see on our roads how people carry their children in a very unsafe manner. In case of a crash, children are most vulnerable as they don’t have helmets and are loosely held by their parents or the pillion riders. Currently, we have no regulation. The proposed norm will fill that existing gap in the law and will pave the way for its enforcement,” said Deepanshu Gupta of India Road Safety Campaign and a youth road safety ambassador for the European Commission. Currently, there is no specific data on how many children below four years died in road crashes in India. The government collates data from all states and puts all children in one age group below 18 years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/speeding-two-wheelers-beyond-40-kmph-with-kids-below-4-yrs-to-attract-fine-suspension-of-dl/articleshow/87265589.cms||Dipak K Dash

At present, the BMTC is operating 5,100 buses — 5,000 non-AC diesel and 100 Volvo buses. “We are planning to operate all 5,400 non-AC buses. We will also operate around 30 additional Volvo buses based on demand. The total number of buses will cross 5,500 in the next few days,” said a senior BMTC official. BMTC managing director V Anbukumar said the transport authority was planning to operate 5,500 buses since schools and colleges have resumed. He also wrote to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to release the BMTC staff deployed for Covid-19 duty. “Many of our staff were with BBMP for Covid-19-related work, so we want them to return to BMTC to run our buses,” said a BMTC official. Asked about the condition of the Volvo buses lying in depots for nearly two years, Anbukumar said: “The possible issues are battery, oil and tyres but fortunately there were no major issues since we were running these buses within the depots for a few hours every day. We are mainly doing oil change in these buses, which cost around Rs 40,000 per bus.” He said the daily ridership has now crossed 20 lakh. “The daily passenger revenue has increased from Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2.9 crore now. But it was Rs 5 crore a day before Covid-19. Our daily operational cost is around Rs 4 crore now mainly due to increasing diesel prices,” Anbukumar said. BMTC’s daily ridership recently touched 23 lakh. “I have asked our officials to operate maximum buses even if it is not making profit. We cannot keep our buses in depots for a long time citing less demand,” he added. However, he said the demand for Vajra AC service is less due to work-from-home arrangements.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-heeding-demand-bmtc-to-run-all-non-ac-buses/articleshow/87265666.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Afghanistan beat Scotland in a match played in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates - the first major victory for the team since the Taliban takeover of the country. While the Taliban frown on many forms of public entertainment, cricket has always been an exception, a game fighters followed closely E01D even during the war whenever the national team was playing. "Congratulations to the team and wish them more success in the future," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter. A spokesman for the Taliban's Qatar office also joined in the praise, adding: "We hope for similar and even higher achievements in other fields, especially in the political, economic and scientific fields." The highest profile message came from Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of Afghanistan's current acting Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani - the head of the Haqqani Network. "Afghanistan won," the younger Haqqani said. The Taliban's representative-designate to the United Nations Suhail Shaheen tweeted: "Well done boys!" However, there was relative silence across Kabul, where such victories were previously met with jubilation in the streets, fireworks and celebratory gunfire. There were only a few, small fireworks seen in the Kabul sky. The streets were mostly empty or silent. The Taliban's foes also saw the victory as significant for the country. Amrullah Saleh, the ex-vice president who became one of the leaders of the anti-Taliban forces after the fall of Kabul, pointed out on Twitter that the cricket team had sung a national anthem and raised a flag which are not recongnised by the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani, who fled the country in August, said the victory had "installed new hopes in the hearts of all that this nation is alive and no one can hold it hostage!" Despite years of violence and upheaval, Afghanistan has an enthusiastic and widespread following of cricket and residents of Kabul were eagerly anticipating the cricket world cup matches. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) will meet next month to determine the game's future in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-officials-celebrate-cricket-win-but-kabul-streets-subdued/articleshow/87265707.cms||---

It also reveals the enormous differences between states with Kerala having an IMR equal to the US and Madhya Pradesh faring worse than even Yemen or Sudan. Worryingly, it is the worst-off states in which the slowdown in improvement is most marked, Bihar being an exception. India's IMR - defined as the number of babies less than a year old who die for every thousand live births - improved in the decade between 2009 and 2019 from 50 to 30, but is still worse than Bangladesh's and Nepal's, both at 26, though better than Pakistan's (56). All states have shown improvement in IMR from the year before. However, after showing remarkable improvement of 11 points from 50 to 39 from 2009 till 2014, it has slowed down in the last five years. Among larger states showing accelerating improvement are Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and West Bengal. In the case of Kerala, after stagnating at an IMR of 12 from 2011 till 2015, it improved to 6 in the last five years, a level that matches that of the US. States that saw the greatest slowing down in improvement of their IMR are Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. From double digit improvement between 2009 to 2014, the pace of improvement in these states slowed down to single digit. The improvement in IMR does tend to slow down as it gets lower, but most of these states are at a level where this would not apply. After Kerala, Delhi has the lowest IMR of 11 followed by Tamil Nadu (15) among the larger states. Globally, the lowest IMR of 2 has been recorded in Finland, Norway, Iceland, Singapore and Japan. India's IMR for 2019 is about a quarter of what it was in 1971 (129). IMR is widely accepted as a crude indicator of the overall health scenario of a country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-improves-infant-mortality-rate-but-gains-slowing-down/articleshow/87266537.cms||Rema Nagarajan

While protocols and guidelines filed by the authorities appear nice on paper, those need to be strictly enforced on the ground, the court said. "We expect from the respondents (Centre, Delhi government and Delhi Police) that these guidelines, standard operating procedures, Covid-appropriate behaviour and controlling of the crowd at marketplaces will be executed by them scrupulously this festive season," a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said, adding that "strict compliance is required". The court's direction came after the authorities claimed they were taking all necessary steps to prevent the spread of Covid. It sought another report on the enforcement of protocols and said the situation should be reviewed on November 30. The court was hearing a matter on its own following violation of Covid protocols in various markets in Delhi. During the hearing, the bench made it clear that it was not interested in seeing penalties being collected from people for violation of Covid norms, only that it wanted better crowd control and management efforts by the authorities. It noted that in the status reports the authorities had cited the steps taken for implementing Covid-appropriate behaviour, including how to control the crowd at marketplaces and also outlined ways to engage volunteers for the implementation of guidelines and sanitisation of public utilities. On its part, Delhi government said it had time and again issued appropriate guidelines and also shut down markets where the protocols weren't being followed. Earlier this year, the high court had initiated a PIL after taking note of certain photographs, sent to one of its judges on WhatsApp by an AIIMS doctor, showing scant regard for Covid protocols by street vendors in markets. The court had observed that such breaches would only hasten the third wave of coronavirus infection, which couldn't be allowed to happen. It also cautioned that if this behaviour of flouting Covid norms continued, the city would be in great trouble. "We have paid a huge price in the second wave. We don't know if there is any household that has not suffered in the second wave, closely or remotely," the bench had observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/strictly-follow-covid-norms-in-city-markets-delhi-hc/articleshow/87266704.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||India||Strike balance: HC to review vendors Act||NEW DELHI: Underlining the need to balance various rights, Delhi High Court on Monday decided to put to legal examination the validity of Street Vendors Act that it found to be "tilted" in favour of vendors. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked all stakeholders to remain prepared to begin arguments in connection with various facets of the Act and the rules that flow from it. The court pointed out that often it was said that Delhi must become like London but without focusing on planning, it couldn't be achieved. The bench also acknowledged that in a mega city such as Delhi, street vending gave employment to several from the poorest strata of society, but reiterated that even those who went to markets or rent shops had rights that can't be ignored. "You can't even walk in places like Connaught Place and Nehru Place, where vendors have occupied spaces and set up permanent business...we had to take suo motu cognisance of the fire incident at Nehru Place because the condition is like a slum. There is a need to decide on how many vendors can be permitted in such markets," the bench orally observed, listing the batch of petitions challenging and supporting the Act for hearing on October 30. The court also clarified that it wasn't against street vendors but wanted to ensure everyone's rights were respected and there was no overcrowding due to them. It had earlier flagged certain provisions of the law governing street vendors, saying they "tilt the balance" in favour of vendors at the expense of planned development of cities and indicated it would seriously consider the issue. The court had said the Act needed to be examined in light of "possible infringement of fundamental rights of the citizens who live in any city, or town, particularly, under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, while hearing petitions on squatting rights and setting up a town vending committee (TVC) in various places in the capital. It also highlighted how the "representation of the various authorities tasked with the task of local administration, including the municipal administration, police administration, public works department, etc, all put together is less than 50%" in the TVCs. In a sense, the street vending committees appear to be heavily loaded in favour of the street vendors, the court had observed giving its prima facie view that "the scheme of Street Vendors Act and the rules framed thereunder greatly tilts the balance to encourage street vending".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/strike-balance-hc-to-review-vendors-act/articleshow/87266758.cms||---

Addressing the personnel of various security forces, including the J&K police, paramilitary forces and the Army, at the CRPF camp in Lethpora, Pulwama, where he was making a night-halt to interact with the jawans and get a sense of their hardships and experiences, Shah appreciated the forces for their alertness in the wake of nullification of Article 370 and Article 35A, saying that it ensured that not a single life was lost and all speculations of a violent reaction and bloodshed were proved wrong. In Lethpora, 40 CRPF jawans were killed in February 2019 when a Jaish terrorist rammed an explosive-laden car into their convoy. The Pulwama attack was followed by the air strikes by IAF jets on terror facilities in Balakot deep inside Pakistan.

He added that stone-pelting incidents too had reduced conspicuously. "It is because of alertness of our forces that elements who wanted to disrupt peace could not succeed," Shah said and expressed gratitude and appreciation to the Central forces for facilitating a peaceful transition to post-370 era. Stating that Modi government's policy was focused on zero-tolerance to terrorism, Shah said even 30 civilians deaths per year should be prevented. "Those who are indulging in terrorism are committing a horrific act against humanity. It should be our priority to secure J&K against this," he stated.  Shah said the government would rather hold talks with the youth and "brothers and sisters" of the Valley than Pakistan as suggested by NC chief Farooq Abdullah, reported PTI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-pulwama-camp-shah-says-jk-law-order-on-the-mend/articleshow/87266848.cms||---

The 67th National Film awards for 2019 were announced in March this year, and were delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Addressing the function finally held in a physical format after a two-year delay, Naidu said he was happy that regional films had dominated the list of award winners. He also urged filmmakers and actors to use cinema to generate "positivity and happiness". "Films should be vehicles with a higher purpose... We should focus on creating cinema which is entertaining, gives us solace, some message, reduces our tension and makes us think positively. Don't be obstructive, be constructive," he said, asking film makers to shun violence, vulgarity and obscenity. Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur, on the other hand, praised the Indian film industry's continuous efforts to keep the people entertained amid the pandemic. "If vaccines can be made available to the rich and poor, entertainment too should reach the rich and poor equally," he said. He also emphasised last-mile connectivity of entertainment products for the masses in far flung areas and said the film fraternity should consider "simpler" methods of reaching audiences for whom high-end theatres and multiplexes are beyond reach. In his acceptance speech, Rajinikanth thanked his mentor, late filmmaker K Balachander, his brother Sathyanarayana Rao, and his "friend, driver and transport colleague Raj Bahadur", who spotted his acting talent when he was a bus conductor. Actors Pallavi Joshi and Vijay Sethupathi were given the best supporting actress and best supporting actor awards for their performances in films 'The Tashkent Files' and 'Super Deluxe', respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajinikanth-honoured-with-phalke-award/articleshow/87266891.cms||---

In her twitter profile, Khera has introduced herself as Congress's national media coordinator. She tweeted the mocking text soon after India lost to Pakistan on Sunday night. In her next tweet, Khera wrote 'stupid Bhakts' and "Malviya's 2 rupees trolls". She was presumably referring to Amit Malviya, the IT cell head of the BJP. As her tweet was one of the leading trends with some netizens taking strong exception to it, she attributed it to trolling encouraged by the BJP IT cell. She also threatened to take legal action against those who reported her tweet. Some of the twitterati also mocked her claiming she had drawn more attention than the votes she had polled in the 2020 Delhi state assembly polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-netas-sarcastic-tweet-after-indias-loss-to-pakistan-draws-bjp-flak/articleshow/87266933.cms||---

Net new deal wins in the quarter was $750 million.The company’s attrition was up at 21%, from 17% in the previous quarter. “Anything above 18% is concerning. We will look to increase our supply base, we will look at alternative strategies for retention by focusing on tier-2 towns, Nagpur Bhubaneswar and Coimbatore. Two-three quarters from now, as my tier-2 and hiring strategies work out, our attrition will come down,” Gurnani said. The company added 14,930 people in the quarter.Net profit was up 26% to $181 million. Operating margin was almost flat at 15.2%. “When fixed price engagements come for renewal, we are trying to raise the price bar. There are cost pressures and price increases follow later. That’s why margins have remained flat in the current quarter,” said chief financial officer Milind Kulkarni.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/tech-mahindra-2nd-qtr-revenue-up-16-4-to-1-5bn/articleshow/87266935.cms||---

GMV in e-commerce means the value of total goods sold on a platform, including discounts but excluding returns.The consolidated GMV covers the company’s beauty, personal care business and fashion vertical. “We quickly pivoted during the pandemic with the help of smart and agile tech and AI-led curated content and filtered as per customer needs and which zone they were coming from,” CEO Nayar said.A significant portion of the company’s sales are from tier-2 and -3 towns. While 95% of the total sales are online, the rest is from the 80 stores across the country. That is expected to go up to 15% as its stores and footfalls go up along with the pandemic receding. It had 7.1 million transacting customers till August this fiscal, up from 5.6 million in the whole of last year.Nykaa, one of the few profitable new age companies to get listed, is looking to raise about Rs 630 crore by issuing fresh shares and the rest through an offer for sale.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/nykaas-sales-value-trebles-to-199mn-in-q1-on-e-shift/articleshow/87266937.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Howrah train departs 26 minutes late to help child with brain tumour||BENGALURU: The Howrah Duronto special train on Sunday departed 26 minutes late from its originating station, Yeshwantpur, to ensure that a six-year-old girl who had made a recovery from brain tumour faced no difficulty during travel as she was on a breathing support machine. South Western Railway officials said train no. 02246 to Howrah, which was supposed to leave at 11am from Yeshwantpur on Sunday, departed at 11.26am. Jainab Mondal, the patient, had come to Bengaluru in mid-August and was on treatment at St Philomena’s Hospital for over two-and-a-half months. The girl had undergone surgery and also suffered from respiratory paralysis. During her recovery, she was on tracheostomy and a BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) machine, a respiratory assistive device that also travelled along with her to Howrah. “With the BiPAP machine the child was stable. As a precautionary measure, the child was also given oxygen cylinders and an oxygen concentrator. As such the girl didn’t require it, but it was kept as a stand-by. The railway authorities wanted to crosscheck if it works given the voltage fluctuation on the train,” said Dr Rajeev V, head of department, pediatrics, St Philomena’s Hospital, Bengaluru. The parents were trained in what needed to be done in case of an emergency, Dr Rajeev said. The train covered a distance of 1,953km and reached Howrah at 3.56pm on Monday, ahead of its scheduled arrival time of 4.45pm. SWR chief public relations officer Aneesh Hegde said: “The patient required an oxygen concentrator for the journey. But due to power issues inside the coach, the oxygen concentrator did not function so the kid required oxygen cylinder back-up, which was arranged for at Bangarpet with help from the railways.” Humayun Mallik, the girl’s uncle, said: “Jainab is stable. She didn’t have any issues throughout the journey.” The incident came to light after Kedarnath Reddy, who was at Yeshwantpur station, wrote about it on Twitter. He tweeted: “Hats off to the team SWR Bangalore division staff, heights of handling a 6 year-aged kid difficulty in breathing.. detaining the train for more than 20m to provide necessary assistance to ailing kid..Hope the kid is taken care enroute (sic)“. In the video he posted on Twitter, the child was taken inside the coach on a stretcher, accompanied by four people. Later, Reddy told TOI: “The child was in a lying position. It was impressive to see railway officials swing into action quickly.” The girl was operated upon by team head Dr Sujay Rao, paediatric neurosurgeon and pediatric intensivist Dr Swarnika Mishra.

However, Soundarya Jagadish brushed away the allegations, saying the complaint was false and made with mala fide intention.

Soundarya Jagadish has produced a couple of movies, including Ramleela and Appu-Pappu. Snehit had played the main role in Appu-Pappu. The complainant said the fight began at 5.45pm on Saturday when she was sweeping outside her house opposite to Jagadish’s residence. The woman and her 55-year-old mother live in the outhouse of their employer, a neighbour of Jagadish. “Snehit and his friend Rakshit were standing outside the house, staring at me. I requested them to move, saying dust will fall on them. But they abused me. When I told my mother, she questioned them and they abused her too. Five minutes later, others barged into our house and attacked us,” the woman stated in her complaint. “At one stage, they tried to strip me,” she alleged. Soundarya Jagadish told TOI that the fight broke out between their domestic help and the complainant, and his wife and son intervened to pacify them. “The complainant has been fighting with our family for two years over petty issues. On Saturday evening, our maid and the complainant were fighting over some matter. My wife and son tried to pacify them but the complainant would not just relent,” he said. Asked why their house has been locked since the incident, Jagadish said: “We have come out for a ritual now.

The operation, which began on October 11, was into its 15th consecutive day on Monday with fresh firing erupting between the heavily armed terrorists and security forces.

Nine Army personnel, including two JCOs, have been killed since the operation commenced. A day earlier, two police personnel and one Army jawan were injured, while one jailed terrorist, who had been taken to the encounter site to identify the hideout, had been killed in firing. The arrested terrorist, Pakistani citizen Zia Mustafa, had been in jail for the past 14 years. In contrast, the security forces said they had killed four terrorists in nine days.

Director Joel Souza, who was standing behind Hutchins when the gun fired, said he heard what "sounded like a whip and then loud pop", according to the affidavit released to US media on Sunday. Souza said Baldwin was "sitting in a pew in a church building setting, and he was practicing a cross draw. Joel said he was looking over the shoulder of Halayna when he heard the gun fire," NBC News reported the affidavit as saying. It quotes Souza as saying he remembered Hutchins "complaining about her stomach and grabbing her midsection". "Joel also said Halayna began to stumble backwards and she was assisted to the ground," the affidavit said, according to NBC. "Joel explained that he was bleeding from his shoulder and he could see blood on Halayna." Hutchins, 42, was struck in the chest when Baldwin fired the prop gun he had been told was safe on the set of low-budget western "Rust" in New Mexico on Thursday.

"Of late, several instances of related party transactions without following 'arms-length' principle and established transfer pricing mechanism have been observed. There have been instances of diversion of funds and transfer of profits to connected parties through various means - intra-group loans on favourable terms, over- or under-invoicing of transactions, asset transfers without fair valuation," said Das. Delivering an in-person address at the National Academy of Audit & Accounts in Shimla, Das chose to speak on the role of audit in the modern financial system. The governor's speech comes a few days after the central bank decided to suspend auditors of SREI for lapses in their audit. "Without generalising, it may be said that problems usually arise when the independence of auditors itself is compromised or the auditors lack competence in performing their role," said Das. Earlier this year, the RBI had tightened norms for statutory auditors for financial firms, requiring banks to change auditors more frequently. Das said that with the introduction of Ind-AS for all listed companies, including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) having net worth of Rs 250 crore, managements had got additional discretion on providing for expected credit losses. "Such flexibility and forward-looking nature of assessment, however, poses the 'model risk', that is, the model may rely on incorrect assumptions and may be far away from representing real-life scenarios. This has been observed in several cases," said Das. He added that auditors are expected to test the models used by the entities, challenge the management and validate the model outputs. Explaining the RBI's role, Das said that the statutory auditor has a duty to report directly to the supervisor (the RBI) on matters of material significance arising from the audit of banks and other regulated entities. "For these reasons, the RBI, as the supervisor of banks and NBFCs, has a keen interest in the manner with which statutory auditors perform audits in the regulated entities," Das said. Das called upon auditors to develop capabilities in terms of information technology as IT black boxes are often used to hide transactions. "We have also seen cases of manipulation and misstatement of true nature of financial statements by employing opaque technological means. Real transactions are camouflaged beneath various layers of IT solutions by a few entities. As such, auditors need to be technologically savvy and be able to 'see through' the layers of information technology to detect the real nature of hidden transactions." In the case of two lenders, PMC Bank and DHFL, the management had managed to camouflage irregular loans by creating fake loan accounts in the IT system.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fill-gaps-rbi-governor-asks-auditors/articleshow/87267055.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||TDP youth leader gets bail; HC flays ‘stereotyped’ remand report||Vijayawada: The high court on Monday granted bail to TDP youth wing leader Nadendla Brahmam who was arrested on charges of attacking a police inspector on the day the TDP central office was vandalised. Apart from submission of securities in the lower court, the court also imposed a condition that he should not come to Tadepalli and Mangalagiri areas for three weeks. Arguing on behalf of Brahmam, senior counsel Dammalapati Srinivas said the complaint given by the complainant and the contents of the remand report were in contradiction with each other. Alleging that a false case has been booked against Brahmam by the police, he said Brahmam was taken to Medikonduru after he was arrested at Undavalli. The Medikonduru inspector beat him in custody, and he was sent on remand instead of being sent for medical examination by the magistrate even after recording that he was beaten up by cops, said Srinivas. He further said police did not follow the Supreme Court’s guidelines while arresting Brahmam, as none of the sections contemplate a crime liable for more than seven years jail term, in which case the police should have issued 41A CrPC notice instead of arresting his client. Arguing on behalf of the police, additional public prosecutor S Dushyant Reddy told the court that police followed norms and produced Brahmam before the court concerned. He justified the arrest stating it is the discretion of the investigating officer whether to go for arrest or issue 41A CrPC. As Brahmam has a history of being involved in similar cases, cops decided to arrest him instead of issuing notice. After hearing the arguments, Justice Lalitha Kanneganti asked why the magistrate did not send the accused for medical examination. The court further observed that the reasons mentioned in the remand report for dispensing with 41A CrPC notice are stereotyped. While granting bail to Brahmam, the court directed the lower court magistrate to file a report explaining why the accused was not sent for medical examination.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/tdp-youth-leader-gets-bail-hc-flays-stereotyped-remand-report/articleshow/87265075.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Some shops have come up with exciting offers and discounts to woo the customers. A branded jewellery showroom on Boring Road has been providing 30% discount on making of gold ornaments. It has also offered a 30% discount on maximum retail price of diamond jewellery. Showroom manager Neeraj Kumar said customers prefer gold jewellery in comparison to diamond. “Sales of gold coin are also low. People are buying lightweight and simple design gold jewellery as the gold rate is Rs 4,570 per gram. Kolkata’s machine-made and traditional jewellery are in high demand. Customer’s response is overwhelming. We are getting fresh orders every day,” he said. Another jewellery shop at Dak Bungalow crossing has been offering 50% discount on making of gold jewellery and 25% on diamond jewellery. Saurav Kumar, executive of another jewellery showroom, said they are giving discount on making of jewellery depending on the weight of gold. “On some selected diamond jewellery, there is up to 100% discount on making. Antique jewellery, pendant and necklace are finding many takers. People are also placing orders for gold coin,” he said. As per Hindu mythology, buying gold or silver ornaments on Dhanteras is auspicious. Many people also prefer utensils and automobiles as well. Dharmendra Kumar, manager of an SUV showroom on Bailey Road, said they are getting good response from customers. “The company has come up with several offers and discounts. The sales, however, are not likely to be any better than the previous year due to shortage of microchips,” he said. Intekhab Alam, executive of another automobile showroom on Exhibition Road, said they have already closed four-wheeler bookings due to huge rush. “Around 300 vehicles have been booked. They will be delivered to customers on Dhanteras. The response this year has been quite good and we are still getting 70-80 enquiries for cars per day. However, we can’t take large bookings due to shortage of microchips,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/vehicle-jewellery-sales-pick-up-in-patna-ahead-of-dhanteras/articleshow/87265095.cms||Faryal Rumi

The idea of celebrating an International Day of Diplomats was conceived by Indian diplomat Abhay K, who first hosted hosted it in Brasilia on October 24, 2017. The celebration aims to raise awareness about the vital work diplomats and their families do to keep the world going. Speaking on the occasion at Antananarivo in Madagascar, Abhay said: “The greatest achievement of the mankind in the past 10,000 years is coming out of the caves and founding the #United Nations. That’s why I thought the day United Nations was founded is the perfect day for celebrating International Day of Diplomats.” Foreign minister of Madagascar, Patrick Rajoelina, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri, MPs Shashi Tharoor and Achyuta Samanta, former foreign secretary and national security adviser Shivshankar Menon, ambassadors Navdeep Suri, Kishan Rana, Gurjit Singh, Mohan Kumar, Houda Nonoo of Bahrain, High Commissioner Shumona Iqbal of Bangladesh, UN resident coordinator Issa Sanogo, ambassador David Ashley of the UK, special representative Madame Hawa of African Union, ambassadors Sanjay Panda, Namrata Kumar, Prasant Pise and several other diplomats from Israel, Ireland, the USA and celebrities Medha Koirala from Nepal and Raine Chawla actively took part in the celebrations.

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Months of Covid curbs take toll on tourism in Tirumala||TIRUPATI: The continuing Covid-19 curbs on pilgrim influx into Tirumala has, among other things, hit the region’s tourism sector hard. During pre-Covid days, the hill town used to witness annual pilgrim footfall of around 3.5 crore and a daily turnout of close to one lakh. It has now come down to 30,000 visitors a day. Due to restrictions on Tirumala ghat road operations, APSRTC is also staring at a revenue loss of Rs 290 crore. In 2019-20, the carrier ferried 3.07 crore passengers in 10.5 lakh trips between Tirumala and Tirupati, which fetched it a revenue of Rs 242 crore. Its earnings dropped to Rs 67.52 crore in 2020-21 as only 69 lakh devotees travelled between the two places.  Between April 2020 and September 2021, APSRTC suffered a revenue loss of Rs 290 crore as passenger numbers depleted by 3.6 crore. The overall loss could run into hundreds of crores if Tirumala-linked travel from across the state and other states in APSRTC buses is taken into account. Same is the case with railways. An average of 70,000 passengers used to arrive and depart from Tirupati railway station daily during pre-Covid times. Now, the average passenger footfall has dropped to 30,000 a day. The average per day earnings at the railway station, which used to be around Rs 31-35 lakh, has dropped to Rs 5-7 lakh a day.  Between August 2019 to September 2020, 16.65 lakh tickets were sold at Tirupati railway station, fetching railways an income of Rs 199 crore. In August-September this year, only 1.47 lakh tickets were sold, with the income dropping to Rs 38 crore. The passenger footfall at Tirupati airport too has come down in the last two years. Between April 2019 and March 2020, the passenger footfall at the airport was 8.34 lakh from 9,587 scheduled flights during the year. Between April 2020 and March 2021, the number of flights to Tirupati dropped to 4,440 and passenger footfall to 3.49 lakh. From April to September this year, only 2.13 lakh passengers travelled in about 2,850 flights to and from Tirupati airport. The hospitality sector seems to be the worst affected. “There are 500-odd hotels and restaurants in Tirupati whose aggregate average monthly revenues used to be Rs 75-80 crore a month. Today, only 40% of hotels are operating due to low pilgrim footfall. The losses would be over Rs 500 crore,” said Balakrishna Reddy, president, AP state hoteliers association. Tirupati MP M Gurumoorthy told TOI that measures are being initiated by the government and the TTD to get pilgrim footfall in Tirumala to pre-Covid levels without compromising on the safety of devotees.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/months-of-covid-curbs-take-toll-on-tourism-in-tirumala/articleshow/87264903.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Business||RBI guv asks auditors to step up after gaps seen in reports||Mumbai: Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday said that statutory auditors need to improve quality and depth of audit and listed a number of irregularities detected by the central bank. “Of late, several instances of related party transactions without following ‘arms-length’ principle and established transfer pricing mechanism have been observed. There have been instances of diversion of funds and transfer of profits to connected parties through various means — intra-group loans on favourable terms, over- or under-invoicing of transactions, asset transfers without fair valuation,” said Das. Delivering an in-person address at the National Academy of Audit & Accounts in Shimla, Das chose to speak on the role of audit in the modern financial system. The governor’s speech comes a few days after the central bank decided to suspend auditors of SREI for lapses in their audit. “Without generalising, it may be said that problems usually arise when the independence of auditors itself is compromised or the auditors lack competence in performing their role,” said Das. Earlier this year, the RBI had tightened norms for statutory auditors for financial firms, requiring banks to change auditors more frequently. Das said that with the introduction of Ind-AS for all listed companies, including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) having net worth of Rs 250 crore, managements had got additional discretion on providing for expected credit losses. “Such flexibility and forward-looking nature of assessment, however, poses the ‘model risk’, that is, the model may rely on incorrect assumptions and may be far away from representing real-life scenarios. This has been observed in several cases,” said Das. He added that auditors are expected to test the models used by the entities, challenge the management and validate the model outputs.

He said devotees should not be allowed to cross the barricades to perform Chhath rituals from a safety point of view. A team of officials led by Agarwal inspected several Ganga ghats between Digha and Collectorate in Patna as part of preparations for the Chhath festival. Agarwal asked Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh to identify dangerous ghats and prepare a list. He instructed the officials to install signage at the dangerous ghats and publicise the same through various mediums to stop devotees from taking dip in the Ganga and offering ‘arghya’. The traffic SP was asked to prepare a plan for smooth operation of vehicles on roads leading to the ghats. “Parking space should be for the convenience of people,” Agarwal said. The divisional commissioner asked the officials concerned to make arrangements for cleanliness, electricity, drinking water, urinals, changing room, watch tower and public address system at the ghats. “Control rooms should be set up at district and sub-division levels to provide all the necessary information to people,” he said. Agarwal said arrangements should also be made for face mask and sanitiser at the ghats. “All the devotees and others, including officers, should wear mask at the ghats during the celebration,” he said. The divisional commissioner said detailed guidelines on Covid would be issued in the next few days. He asked the officials to remain vigilant as large number of people from outside Bihar will come home for the celebrations. Patna Municipal Corporation commissioner Himanshu Sharma, deputy development commissioner Richie Pandey, traffic SP D Amarkesh, additional collector (revenue) Rajiv Srivastava and additional collector (disaster management) Santosh Kumar Jha were also present during the inspection.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/chhath-patna-dm-asked-to-identify-dangerous-ghats/articleshow/87263817.cms||Faryal Rumi

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation had planned to complete the work by Monday and start water supply on Tuesday. However, the water level at the barrage did not go down and the lower plates could not be replaced. Meanwhile, over 27 localities from Kolhapur city faced severe water cuts, most of these are slum pockets and residential societies from the fringe areas. The KMC deployed water tankers to these localities to quench the thirst of the residents. “The water cuts will be severe on Tuesday. Entire city will face water cuts and we are ready with additional tankers. On Wednesday, the supply will be resumed at low pressure. It takes six to eight hours to attain water level at the barrage so as to ensure pumping at full capacity,” said Ajay Salokhe, chief hydraulic engineer of KMC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/water-cuts-in-kolhapur-city-till-wednesday/articleshow/87263482.cms||---

Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy announced the proposal during his review meeting with officials of the education department at his Tadepalli camp office. The chief minister wanted officials to ensure that one degree college is established in every assembly constituency. He also suggested they take over aided colleges wherever it is possible. However, he told officials to not make it compulsory for aided institutions to surrender to the government. “It is not compulsory that aided institutions be transferred to the government as we have changed the aided policy. It is a voluntary decision and is left to the managements of the institutions,” the chief minister said. The chief minister directed the Higher Education Council to have regular interactions with vice-chancellors of the universities. He told them to meet one vice-chancellor every week and review the academic and infrastructure facilities. He also instructed them to focus on securing better NAAC ratings for every university and said universities should be integrated with skill development colleges and the industry. On fee reimbursement, the chief minister told officials to ensure that payments are made once every three months. He wanted officials to ensure that money under the fee reimbursement scheme is paid into the bank accounts of the mothers, who in turn would make payments to the colleges. The chief minister asked officials to fill all vacancies in the universities and improve teaching quality. He wanted officials to ensure transparency and quality in recruitments in order to ensure quality teaching. The chief minister further instructed officials to ensure quality teaching in all institutions from the pre-primary to the university level. He also wanted them to provide the link between educational institutions and the industry to guarantee employment for every student. Officials informed the chief minister that 1,10,779 students have opted for laptops under Jagananna Vasati Deevena scheme. The officials said they would procure the laptops and distribute them to the students at the earliest. Minister for education, Adimulapu Suresh, special chief secretary, Satish Chandra, higher education council chairman K Hemachandra Reddy, college education commissioner Pola Bhaskar, vice-chancellors of various universities and other officials were present at the review.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/ap-plans-expansion-of-govt-degree-colleges/articleshow/87264994.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Patna||Congress-RJD rift may weaken anti-NDA forces in byelection||PATNA: As the widening rift between the Congress and the RJD has further been accentuated by the unbecoming dismissal of AICC Bihar incharge Bhakta Charan Das as ‘Bhakchonhar Das’ by RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Sunday, a feeling has been gaining ground in political circles that the anti-BJP front has been weakened in the state. However, from the Congress point of view, the shock from Lalu appears to have come at the right moment. For, indications are that its Bihar unit is set to follow the UP-line to build the party as a credible force against the BJP government and also expand the mass base under the leadership of Priyanka Gandhi to go solo in the coming assembly elections there next year. Like in UP, with regard to the likely post-poll alliance with the Samajwadi Party, Congress might align with the anti-BJP formation in Bihar after the 2025 assembly elections, but not before that, observers feel. The thrust is on rebuilding the party in Bihar. Amid the two wildfire polarities of Mandal (backward caste reservation) and Kamandal (Hindutva) politics since 1990, the state has had eight assembly elections. After the bifurcation of Jharkhand from Bihar in 2000, its vote share fell consistently – 11% in 2000, 5% in 2005 February, 6.09% in 2005 November, 8.4% in 2010, 6.7% in 2015 and 9.48% in 2020. The Congress contested the assembly elections alone in 2000, 2005 February and also in 2010. It won 23 seats in 2000, 10 in February 2000, nine in November 2005, three in 2010, 27 in 2015 as part of the grand alliance and 19 in 2020 with the same combine. Incidentally, as for Bihar, the parliamentary elections are three years away and the state’s assembly elections four years far, giving ample time to Congress to rebuild itself. The present reality of Bihar Congress, in terms of public perception, is that stray Congressmen and women might be in each of the 48,000 villages in the state, but the party does not have organizational force, nor the leadership that can move the masses. Therefore, it has been condemned to remain in an ICU and can feign to stand and be visible only in alliance with any major anti-BJP party or political combine in the state. Accordingly, when Lalu told the media that the Congress could not have been given one of the two byelection seats only to lose and forfeit the surety, he was only echoing what is in the public perception. Lalu’s statement on Das referring to his poor understanding of things is an indication that despite the present rift, the future RJD-Congress alliance in 2025 could not be ruled out. In the meantime, the Congress will set itself to making it organizationally strong in the state. In tune with this understanding at the level of its national brass, the recently inducted Kanhaiya Kumar has been sent to campaign for the party’s two candidates in the fray. Kumar was also accompanied by two other young faces – Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mewani. How much they contribute to the strengthening of the stakes of the Congress candidates in the byelection is any body’s guess, but Kanhaiya will be duty-bound to also lend himself rebuilding the party’s Bihar unit, later. BJP dares Cong to break alliance with RJD: BJP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi on Monday dared Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi to break their party’s alliance with the RJD. “If the Congress has courage, (its president) Sonia Gandhi should break the party’s alliance with the RJD after Lalu’s remark made against Bhakta Charan Das,” he tweeted. “It is an insult to the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. The Congress should fix the limit as to how much insult it can take,” Modi added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/cong-rjd-rift-may-weaken-anti-nda-forces-in-byelection/articleshow/87264117.cms||Abhay Singh

Announcing the surrender, IG Ashok Yadav said in Kalpetta on Tuesday that Lijesh surrendered before Wayanad police chief Aravind Sukumar at 10pm on Monday. Yadav said that as per the rehab scheme, a screening committee comprising the collector, district police chief and representative of ADGP (intelligence) will screen details before recommending a rehab package for Lijesh within two months. Yadav said police will ensure the security of the surrendered person and his family. He added that cases were registered against Lijesh for associating with CPI (Maoist). Yadav said police were confident that more will follow suit and return to mainstream society after realizing that the violent ideology has no future. Lijesh, who hails from Amarakuni, said that he was associated with CPI (Maoist) for seven years and had operated in the forests of Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. He claimed that he was the deputy commander of Kabini dalam of the banned organization. His family had moved to Karnataka while he was a child to take up work in ginger fields. Lijesh said he surrendered following a realization that there was no point in continuing with the militant group and seeing that many youths are being misled by the organisation. He is married and his wife is still a member of the organization. As per the rehab policy, the district-level committee will sanction a package according to the category of the surrendered candidate and they will be paid money ranging from Rs Three lakh to Rs Five lakh depending on the category. Also there is provision for allotment of houses under housing policy of the government and payment of a fixed sum for pursuing studies. As per the surrender policy, while heinous crimes committed by the surrendered will continue in courts, the government may consider withdrawing cases related to minor offences. It may also provide free legal services and fast track courts may be constituted for speedy trial of cases against the surrendered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/rehab-scheme-1st-maoist-leader-surrenders/articleshow/87289038.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dispute over jurisdiction of villages in the Kotia region flared up after AP held gram panchayat elections earlier this year. The state also conducted MPTC and ZPTC elections in the region in 2021. The sarpanches and other local leaders met Vizianagaram district collector A Surya Kumari on Monday, seeking her intervention to protect them from “threats” posed by officials and police from Odisha. In a letter, they alleged that Odisha police and officials have restricted the entry of Vizianagaram district officials and Parvathipuram ITDA officials into their panchayats, thus preventing them from access to government services. The representatives of the panchayats also alleged that Odisha police have prevented medical and health staff from visiting their villages, thus hindering the delivery of medical care in the region. The district collector welcomed the representatives and assured them of all help from the state government. Responding to the appeal, Salur MLA P Rajanna Dora directed Vizianagaram district officials to swing into action to protect the tribals of the Kotia region.

Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari said the health department has identified 76 localities as dengue hotspots in the district and subsequently started fogging in the radius of 500 metres to check the spread of the disease. It’s in addition to the fogging being done by the Patna Municipal Corporation. She said some dengue patients were also undergoing treatment at private hospitals but the exact number was not known. The hotspots identified by the civil surgeon’s office include Bankipur, Bakarganj, Kankarbagh, Punaichak, Kurji and Patna City. “Six e-rickshaws with banners and posters are being used for awareness drive against dengue and chikungunya. We have been closely monitoring the situation and getting updates from all hospitals,” she added. There were two active dengue patients at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital on Monday, the hospital’s superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said. Dr Ravi Kirti, head of the medicine department at AIIMS-P, said the number of admitted dengue patients at the hospital rose to four on Monday. Acting president of the Indian Medical Association’s Bihar unit, Dr Ajay Kumar, said many private clinics have reported dengue cases in both urban and rural areas. “Though we do not have exact number of patients, there are reports that dozens of dengue-hit people are undergoing treatment at private health facilities in Kankarbagh, Danapur, Maner and Bihta,” he said, adding cleanliness in residential and commercial areas as well as fogging might help check the spread of dengue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/number-of-dengue-cases-mount-to-104-in-patna/articleshow/87263941.cms||VK Tripathi

Lalu on Sunday said Bhakta Charan is “Bhakchonhar” (imprudent person). Nitish was responding to media queries outside the city airport after his return from campaigning in favour of the NDA supported JD(U) candidates in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly bypolls to be held on October 30. “People used to talk even while remaining inside the jail. They also made tall claims after coming outside the jail. I hardly take notice of such people. I do not want to make any comment on these people,” Nitish said while reacting over a question on Lalu. “Did he serve the public when he was in power in the state?” Nitish asked, adding the opposition leaders have no interest in serving people. Rubbishing the claim of Lalu’s younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav that RJD is winning both Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan seats, Nitish said ‘janata malik hai’ (people are the masters) and it is up to them to take a decision on the date of polling. On being asked that Tejashwi was making a claim of forming the next government in Bihar after winning both the seats, Nitish said, “Chaliye na. Public will decide. Whatever is the result will be known to all (on the counting day).” On being questioned whether he was confident of the NDA’s victory in the bypolls, Nitish said he always remained engaged in serving the public. “I have nothing to say on these things. Whatever decision the public takes ….. I do not make comments on the future poll results. Other people are free to make whatever comments they want to make,” he said. “Our duty is to go to the public, explain our works and make a request for votes. It is up to them to take a call. What is the mood of the public only the media can say,” the CM said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/nitish-takes-a-dig-at-lalu-rubbishes-tejashwis-victory-claim/articleshow/87265077.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||ED attaches Rs 6 crore assets of Srijan scam accused||PATNA: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday provisionally attached property worth Rs 6.85 crore of dismissed additional district magistrate (ADM) of Bhagalpur, Jayshree Thakur, and her family members. Action against Thakur was taken under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. Thakur’s name had earlier figured in the multi-crore Srijan scam, which led to her dismissal from service in August 2017. In a statement, the central investigating agency said the attached assets were in the form of balance in 42 bank accounts, 15 plots of land, one flat and maturity value of 15 insurance policies. The 15 plots of land and the flat have the total consideration value of Rs 1.54 crore, while the surrender value of 15 insurance policies is Rs 26 lakh. The rest amount of Rs 5.05 crore was in the 42 bank accounts. The ED initiated a probe against Thakur following a disproportionate assets case lodged by the Bihar police’s Economic Offences Unit (EOU) in 2013. The EOU had accused the then ADM of Bhagalpur and land acquisition officer of Banka district of accumulating disproportionate assets worth Rs 13.98 crore between January 1987 and June 2013. Thakur, who was holding the charge of land acquisition officer of neighbouring Banka district, had a unique modus operandi. She helped her acquaintances purchase land at a low price in a particular area. The same land was later acquired by the government at much higher rate in the name of development projects. Thus, she earned ill wealth by abusing her official position and corrupt practices. The state government acted tough when her name cropped up in the Srijan scam. She had deposited a huge amount in the cooperative bank run by an NGO, Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti, at Bhagalpur. Initially, she was put under suspension. But later the government dismissed her from service after searches were carried out on her residential premises. She had amassed wealth in her name and that of her husband Rajesh Choudhary, son Rishikesh Choudhary and daughter Rajshree.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/ed-attaches-rs6-cr-assets-of-srijan-scam-accused/articleshow/87264959.cms||Ramashankar

After RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Sunday called Congress Bihar in-charge Bhakta Charan Das a “bhakchonhar” (imprudent person), RJD Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha said Das was away from the ground realities while sitting in the drawing room. Das had said there was no more alliance between RJD and Congress and his party would contest all the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar in the next election. Former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar, who has recently joined Congress, referred to Jha as a ‘lathait’ and advised him to ask his boss as to who Das was? Talking to media as well as in the poll campaigns, Kanhaiya is not only criticizing Nitish Kumar’s regime, but has also been critical of the 15 years of Lalu-Rabri rule. Even former Lok Sabha Speaker and Congress leader Meira Kumar on Monday criticized Lalu for humiliating the Dalit community with his comments on Das. Meanwhile, Lalu’s elder son Tej Pratap on Monday tweeted against Kanhaiya as well as the Congress. Tej stated that those who raised the slogan of “Bharat tere tukde honge” are now teaching patriotism. “All those whose posters get viral with the BJP are made to join Congress. Those deceiving in the name of Gandhi are teaching Gandhism. Either you improve yourself, or people will improve you through their votes,” read his tweet. Even RJD has been softly targeting Congress. It retweeted several tweets posted by individuals against the Congress and how the party was both at the Centre as well as in the state when riots broke out. However, Lalu’s younger son Tejashwi, in his poll campaign, targets only Nitish and the NDA. It is yet to be seen who Lalu targets in his campaign on Wednesday as the RJD’s rivals are increasing in Bihar. Political expert Nawal Choudhary said most of the relations, even in real life, are largely based on interest. Talking about the Congress and RJD, he cited the lyrics of film ‘Kaagaz ke Phool’ and said, “Dekhi humne zamane ki yaari, bichde sabhi bari bari.” He said after poor results in the assembly election, Congress has taken a tough stand, otherwise it would have been sidelined by the RJD. “Congress feels it can revive. Remember how Lalu told that Kusheshwar Asthan was not given to Congress as it would have lost. Differences between the two parties are widening, but when the two will join hands again once they realize the benefit of coming together,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/rjd-cong-relationship-gets-bitter-in-assembly-byelection/articleshow/87264088.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Data compiled by JATO Dynamics, a supplier of auto business intelligence, showed that the average discount level has shrunk more than 50% since 2019 with SUV discounts dropping from Rs 47,000 to Rs 15,000, while small car discounts are down from Rs 43,600 to Rs 13,000 as supply problems plague the market due to semiconductor shortage. This has resulted in customers not getting the cars they want, and not wanting the cars they get. JATO president Ravi Bhatia said, “Navratri retails are not according to expectations. Entry-level cars, despite some schemes, are not selling with customers staying away due to economic reasons. In the higher segments, there is demand but also shortage of vehicles. New launches have a long queue and excitement, but shortage of supplies means there is low conversion of sales.” Part of the problem is of course the already happening shift towards SUVs. Icra group head & VP (corporate ratings) Shamsher Dewan said, “Inventory levels are thin due to chip shortage and there is shift towards mid-sized hatchbacks and compact SUVs.” Car dealers say, like two-wheelers, entry-level cars have also seen demand dip as discounts are cut and prices go up. M&M dealer Nikunj Sanghi, who is managing director of JS4Wheel Motor, said “Entry-level car demand in some markets is down by 30% compared to 2019.” Car prices have increased with companies taking multiple markups citing increase in input costs, including steel. And with discounts down, the tags are not attractive for the two-wheeler upgraders. Toyota dealership Anaamalais Toyota deputy MD C S Vigneshwar said, “There are profitability issues due to raw material prices for manufacturers and, coupled with low production numbers, there is no need for discounts. But lack of discounts is impacting the trigger to get the customers into the showroom, therefore impacting retails too. So, more customers are probably jumping straight into cars above the entry-level Alto or WagonR — into SUVs and premium hatchbacks.” Car dealers say high fuel prices are also playing spoilsport, particularly with the segment that’s just entering the car market and is most sensitive to discounts. “The entry-level car market is behaving like two-wheelers where demand is down 30% compared to 2019 and inventories are at a high of 12-16 weeks,” said Sanghi, who also has Hero MotoCorp dealership in Delhi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/car-discounts-skid-to-a-3-yr-low-on-supply-woes/articleshow/87265676.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Addressing bankers he assured support for participation in the district-wise loan campaigns conducted by banks – especially for loan advances given for women’s self-help groups and education loans. Speaking on the important role of women-run self-help groups (SHGs) in Tamil Nadu, he said the DMK rule has been the golden age for inception and establishments of SHGs. He asked banks to meet the target of Rs 20,000 crore bank credit set aside for SHGs. So far, Rs 4,951 crore has been disbursed so far, and asked them to provide the required advice and guidance to SHGs. For the revival of MSMEs impacted in the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, Stalin said the state government will set up a credit guarantee fund so that banks and other financial institutions can lend to MSME units. The CM also requested the bankers to issue Kisan credit cards to 7.16 lakh farmers. The state has 31.09 lakh credit card holders. With regard to agricultural loans, he said not just co-operative and merchant banks, all categories of banks have the responsibility to lend to farmers, who are the backbone to the economy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cm-mk-stalin-give-loan-advances-for-msmes-shgs-education-loans/articleshow/87265587.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat plans elevated railway lines in Gir Wildlife Sanctuary||AHMEDABAD: The state forest department is looking at the option to set up elevated railway lines passing through Gir Wildlife Sanctuary that is home to the last surviving population of Asiatic Lions. The proposal comes after the Indian Railways submitted in the Gujarat high court recently that it has shelved plans to upgrade the existing railway tracks in the sanctuary. The proposed project is on the lines of Pench Tiger Reserve running between Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra where an elevated stretch helps protect animals around National Highway 44, said a senior forest department official. Last counted, Gujarat has 674 lions in 2020. The project to elevate the 14-km long railway line from Sasan to Kachiya cutting through the heart of the Gir sanctuary is at a nascent stage. The state forest department has held initial level talks with the Indian Railways, the official said. Presently, the railways has been asked to work out the financial aspects of the project. It will be then taken at the Gujarat government level for further discussion before taking a final call, the official added. “If building elevated tracks in Gir sanctuary proves cost effective, we may also consider elevating all existing railway lines running through periphery and eco-sensitive zones of the lion habitat that are in need of upgradation,” said another senior forest department official. At the 19th Gujarat State Board for Wild Life meeting held on September 29, 2020, a proposal was submitted by Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd for upgrading the current meter gauge line to broad gauge with electrification. Gir Sanctuary has been declared as an eco-sensitive zone, and there is restriction on such construction activity within a radius of 10 kilometers from the sanctuary. The Railways authority and state government filed affidavits in response to the Gujarat high court’s query about a report submitted by amicus curiae Hemang Shah, taking exception to the track upgrade and laying of oil and gas pipelines through Gir sanctuary and its eco-sensitive zone. The lawyer presented his report and demanded cancellation of development projects in the protected areas in proceedings of a PIL, which the high court had filed suo motu for conservation of Asiatic lions. The state government has submitted before the court that it has returned the Railways’ proposal to the deputy conservator of forests and has not forwarded it to National Board for Wild Life (NBWL) for final approval.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/guj-plans-elevated-railway-lines-in-gir/articleshow/87265282.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The workshop on ‘Success, potential and sustainable operation of Mathematical Modelling Centre (MMC)’ was joined by experts from Bangladesh, United Kingdom and Bihar. They said the flood-related data should be made more democratic and handed over to the field engineers to empower them for flood management. Inaugurating the session, Rabindra Kumar Shankar, engineer-in-chief, WRD headquarters, said, “CM Nitish Kumar has been working relentlessly on finding a permanent solution to flood woes in Bihar. Under the leadership of WRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, we are working actively to mitigate the impact of flood. Effective use of water-level and discharge data of rivers produced by MMC at ground level will help us accomplish this goal.” Saroj Kumar Verma, director, MMC, detailed the upcoming visions of the centre. Highlighting the role of flood forecast system in flood mitigation, Yusuf Mamun, an expert from Institute of Water Modelling, Bangladesh, said, “Understanding data of water-level forecast, river discharge, rainfall and leveraging them for flood management could be a gamechanger in Bihar.” Expert from UK, Iqbal Hassan of CEGIS, Ashok Kumar Chaudhary (engineer-in-chief, irrigation creation, WRD), Anil Kumar (joint director, FMISC, WRD), Saroj Kumar Verma (director, MMC) and around 100 engineers from WRD participated in the event.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/field-engineers-should-be-given-access-to-flood-related-data-experts/articleshow/87264060.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Univs struggle to pay staff appointed without approval||Coimbatore: Many universities in the state are in a fix as they are struggling to pay teaching and non-teaching staff members who were appointed in the past 20 years without getting approval from the finance committee. These universities depend on block grants from the state government to disburse salary to staff. However, the state government has been refusing to give block grants for unapproved posts. Many universities started courses across disciplines in the past 20 years, but failed to get prior approval from the state government and the finance committee before making appointments to teaching and non-teaching posts. While some managed to get approval retrospectively, a majority of the posts awaits the government’s clearance. Higher education secretary D Karthikeyan, in a letter to all universities in June this year, said categorically that the universities should get approval from the finance committee to get block grants for unapproved posts “Former vice-chancellors of these universities had violated norms to create posts. Such violations cannot clear the scrutiny of the finance committee. This has been the reason why many universities haven’t responded to the letter from the higher education department,” said K Pandiyan, a former president of the Association of University Teachers (AUT). A senior official from Bharathidasan University said they will approach the department for an amicable solution as they are not in a position to give salary to these staff on their own considering their poor financial condition. Vice-chancellor of Bharathiar University P Kaliraj said universities should make appointments based on their financial condition. While our staff are getting their salaries regularly, we are also trying to generate funds by various means to become self-sufficient, he added. The state government stopped giving block grants to universities from 1999. Most of the universities were self-sufficient at that time. However, the government brought back block grants in 2018, following financial crises in most of the state-run universities as revenue from distance education programmes fell.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/univs-struggle-to-pay-staff-appointed-without-approval/articleshow/87266054.cms||Sampath Kumar

In its eight-page submission to Sebi, FHRAI has accused Oravel Stays, the parent of the lodging chain unicorn (valued at over $1 billion), for “anti-competitive business practices”, “inadequate disclosures of critical court cases” and “valuations that appear impossibly stretched when corroborated with other numbers disclosed in the draft prospectus”. Oyo is looking to raise $1.2 billion through the IPO. FHRAI’s statement comes after Zostel Hospitality (operator of Zo Rooms) asked Sebi to suspend Oyo’s proposed IPO as the draft prospectus is “replete with material omissions and blatant misstatements”. FHRAI stated that Oravel has failed to adequately disclose the consequences of an unfavourable verdict by India’s Competition Commission of India (CCI). The industry association had moved the CCI against Oyo for engaging in anti-competitive practices. The investigation, said FHRAI, is in advanced stages. “They (Oravel) have disclosed the consequences of a possible penalty imposed by the CCI, but haven’t disclosed that the CCI also has the power to direct behavioural changes to be undertaken by Oravel, which may completely upset the anticompetitive business practices engaged by them. Without this advantage, their revenues will be seriously impacted,” said FHRAI vice-president Gurbaxish Singh Kohli.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/suspend-oyo-ipo-hotel-body-fhrai/articleshow/87266430.cms||---

The deceased was identified as P Nookaratnam (67). The recent explosion has once again exposed the functioning of illegal firecracker units in Visakhapatnam district. Police said the family was making firecrackers at their house without a licence from the fire and police departments. The blast led to the collapse of a wall, which in turn resulted in injuries to another woman. Police said Nookaratnam’s son had bought over 10 kilos of explosive materials for manufacturing firecrackers. Around 50 people have been killed in explosions in licenced and unlicenced fire-cracker units in the state in the past few years. Experts said the owners of the licensed and unlicensed firecrackers units hire people without experience by offering them low wages. The practice of hiring workers with no experience in handling hazardous and inflammable chemicals has led to many accidents. Assistant district fire officer, Visakhapatnam, Martin Luther King, said though the district has a number of licensed firecracker units, “we will raid illegal firecrackers unit in the coming days,” he said. Residents, however, said firecrackers manufactured locally are better than the ones made in Sivakasi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/one-dies-as-explosion-rocks-illegal-firecracker-mfg-unit/articleshow/87264954.cms||Nalla.Babu

The ruling YSRC is focusing on pulling greater number of voters to the polling booths and increasing its majority to 1 lakh votes. In the 2019 general elections, the voter turnout was 1.50 lakh, out of which YSRC candidate G Venkata Subbaiah polled 95,482 votes to secure a majority of 44,734 votes. As his death caused the by-election, the YSRC wants to retain the seat with a greater majority, and is targeting 1 lakh votes. The ruling party has deployed its ministers and senior leaders to campaign, and leaders are asking voters to turn up in large numbers at the polling booths on October 30. The leaders are apprising the voters about the number of welfare schemes the government rolled out in the last two-and-a-half years. On its part, the BJP is working hard to make its presence felt in the constituency. While the party’s AP unit president Somu Veerraju has been camping in the constituency from day one, several top leaders have visited and campaigned for the party’s candidate. Former minister C Adinarayana Reddy, who joined the BJP after the 2019 general elections, is playing a key role in the campaign. BJP general secretary and Andhra Pradesh in-charge Sunil Deodhar has issued a warning to those who joined the party in recent months. Deodhar said BJP is not a parking place for leaders to come and relax, and has asked them to work to help the party expand its base. While Adinarayana Reddy is making an all-out effort to woo voters, his brother Narayana Reddy and son Bhupesh Reddy, who are in the TDP, are not active in the campaign. The Congress, which is fielding former MLA PM Kamalamma, is pinning its hopes on the support from the TDP. As the TDP is not in the race, the BJP on one side and the Congress on the other are working hard to woo voters. Meanwhile, BJP functionaries led by Veerraju met central election observer Bheeshma Kumar in Kadapa on Monday and submitted a representation seeking paramilitary forces on polling day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/campaigning-intensifies-as-poll-day-nears/articleshow/87265049.cms||Gopi Dara

Anil Kumar Singhal, principal secretary (health), told reporters on Monday that the earlier estimation was 3.47 crore people. “Accordingly, the health department has planned a house-to-house survey to identify all eligible beneficiaries. The survey is likely to be completed by Friday. While 3.17 crore people have received at least one vaccine dose in the state, 1.85 crore have been fully immunised against the pandemic,” he said. Singhal said AP has so far administered over five crore vaccine doses. “The coordinated efforts of all the departments, including field-level staff like Asha workers, ANMS, ward/village volunteers, has led to achieving this feat. Some districts like Nellore and Visakhapatnam have already inoculated more than 85% people with at least one dose. The 104 call centre, which was revived during the second wave on April 16, has so far received 6.05 lakh inbound calls. At the same time, nearly 5,500 doctors, hired to offer tele-consultation services, have made about 12 lakh calls. Despite the steady drop in daily cases, the state is preparing for the third wave,” he added. AP reported 295 Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the cumulative caseload to 20,63,872. This is the lowest one-day case total in about 210 days after the state recorded 380 infections on March 20. The toll increased to 14,350 as seven more people succumbed to the pandemic.

ICICI added over Rs 56,000 crore to its market cap during the day to end at over Rs 5.8 lakh crore, contributing the most to the sensex’s 145-point gain. “Be it margins, asset quality, current accounts & savings accounts, balance sheet growth, earnings growth and, finally, return on assets (RoA) — ICICI has done a brilliant job under Sandeep Bakhshi,” said Macquarie Capital research analyst Suresh Ganapathy. The private lender’s retail loans haves grown nearly three times faster than the industry at 19%. Its bad loans have been at the lowest level since 2014. “What is encouraging is that ICICI continues to scale new heights of profitability every quarter. Margins at 4% were the highest seen in the history. Improvement quarter-on-quarter was driven by falling cost of deposits and lower interest reversals. Consequently, RoA (annualised) for the quarter stood at 1.8%,” said Ganapathy in a note. An analyst report by Emkay Global Financial Services said, “Corporate growth should revive soon too. ICICI Bank, armed with its strong product offerings, franchise network and superior digi-banking platform, should deliver better credit growth and thus core profitability as well.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-stock-gains-nearly-11-on-results/articleshow/87266440.cms||---

The company had opted for shifting to a lower tax rate from FY 2021-22 during the current quarter. This led to a write back of the excess deferred tax provision of Rs 306 crore from deferred tax liability to P&L. While, there will be no impact on profit before tax, the profit after tax will be higher by Rs 306 crore for the current quarter, said a company statement. Despite cement demand getting affected in eastern markets due to heavy monsoon and demand dampened in Kerala due to weekend lockdowns and heavy monsoon during the current quarter, its strategy of right cement for right applications yielded positive results. During Q2 of CY, its cement sales grew by 23% to 2.71 million tonne, as compared to a year ago. It also said that the average increase in diesel prices by 20% during the current quarter has resulted in an increase of in-bound or out-bound logistics cost. The power and fuel cost per ton of cement for Q2 has increased to Rs 1057 from Rs 823 a year ago.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ramco-cements-q2-net-doubles-at-rs-517-crore/articleshow/87265611.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi schools make case for full reopening, say no evidence of Covid threat to kids||NEW DELHI: When children have been visiting malls and going on vacations, what’s the harm in letting them go back to school, ask city educators. The private school associations have also met the Directorate of Education officials, but are yet to receive a concrete response except being told of a possible review after Diwali. In many states, even primary school classes have restarted. On Monday, the West Bengal government announced the reopening of schools from Class IX upwards from November 15. In Delhi, students of classes IX-XII have been going to schools since September 1, but in private schools, the attendance has been poor. Sudha Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka, who is also chairperson of National Progressive School’s Conference (NPSC), an association of private schools, was convinced that all physical classes should begin now. “We showcased our students’ start-up projects physically. We also held parent-teacher meetings, in which many parents requested us to reopen the school,” claimed Acharya. “A doctor parent shared with us the fact that for the last four months, there have been no cases of children being infected with Covid-19. There is now a huge learning gap, and as much as we are trying, that gap exists and nobody can deny it.” NPSC had submitted requests on full school resumption to Delhi government on several occasions. “They are saying after Diwali, but till date we haven’t heard anything,” said Acharya. Another schools association, the Action Committee, met with Himanshu Gupta, the new director of education, on Monday. An organisation office bearer said, “There is nothing certain about the matter. The director only said that Delhi Disaster Management Authority would have to review the situation and take a decision.” An education department official, however, said DoE was in favour of fully reopening educational institutions. “The decision ultimately lies in the hands of DDMA,” he shrugged. Some of the bigger private schools are facing resistance to resumption of classes from the parents. Tania Joshi, principal, The Indian School, said, “When there are just a few classes going on, 35-40% for the students are attending school. However, when exams are held, the attendance is almost 100%. So long as the option of hybrid learning remains, physical attendance will not go up.” Attendance, however, hasn’t been a setback at the government schools since students started going to classes in person. On many occasions, the parents of the lower classes have also gone to the schools to inquire about the full reopening. AK Jha, principal, Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini, said, “We have good attendance in the senior classes in our school. I have heard there is a meeting of DDMA on October 28. Hopefully, it will decide to resume schools after Diwali.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/schools-make-case-for-full-reopening-say-no-evidence-of-covid-threat-to-kids/articleshow/87266065.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Visakhapatnam||Prison writings centre on quest for different freedoms: Andhra University scholar||VISAKHAPATNAM: Research conducted by an Andhra University (AU) scholar, Dr Nemalapuri Satyanarayana, has explored the writings of political prisoners of India during the Emergency (1975-77), including Prison Diary (1978) by Jayaprakash Narayan, popularly referred to as JP and Lok Nayak, and A Prisoner’s Scrap-Book (1978) by BJP stalwart Lal Krishna Advani. The research looks at the influence of prison on the writings and how imprisonments provide space and time to write such works. The thesis presents a kaleidoscopic overview of prison writing during the Emergency as it comes out of intensely personal experiences and individual impressions. Underlying this there is the quest for political as well as personal freedom. Dr Satyanarayana was recently conferred a doctorate by Andhra University for this research under the guidance of Prof CLL Jayaprada of the department of English. Principal, AU College of Arts and Commerce, Prof Rajendra Karmakar was co-guide of the project. Speaking to TOI, N Satyanarayana, who is now assistant professor at Anil Neerukonda Institute of Technology and Science, said prison writing is regarded as a powerful means of self-expression. “The majority of the writings originated in jail are mature, both intellectually and spiritually. Prison writing also enables the writer to resist the trauma of his imprisonment and retain his cognitive abilities,” said Satyanarayana. The assistant professor said JP’s diary, rich in its fiery tone, points to the lacunae in the then contemporary democratic system. “It stresses the need to restore the receding values in the minds of the law enforcing authority and calls for total revolution. The diary of Advani chronicles the journey of a great leader of inspiring idealism, of unflinching dedication towards achieving the goals of the nation and his passionate effort to restore democracy in India through his writing,” he added. “Jayaprakash Narayan and Advani, even during their confinement, were determined to write against all odds. Unlike other prisoners, who wrote about their physical sufferings, these two authors chose to describe the degrading social and oppressive political conditions of those times. So the diaries are a powerful medium of expression not only of the then contemporary conditions, but also points to the possible consequences of the misuse of authority,” said Dr Satyanarayana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/prison-writings-centre-on-quest-for-different-freedoms/articleshow/87265198.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Farmers from the capital region of Amaravati had moved the high court challenging the inaction of the police in granting permission to their padayatra. Arguing on their behalf, Posani Venkateswarlu said the representation was sent to the authorities concerned well in advance, but no decision has been taken yet. As the farmers intend to start their padayatra on November 1, he sought directions to the police to take a decision soon. The government pleader for home told the court that the representation sent by the farmers is in consideration by the DGP and a decision will be taken very soon. Considering the arguments from both sides, Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy directed the DGP to take a decision on the farmers’ representation within three days. Farmers who gave their lands for the capital Amaravati have been opposing the YSRC government’s decision to trifurcate the capital. They have been protesting the decision since December 2019 and have now announced a ‘mahapadyatra’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/take-a-decision-on-farmers-padayatra-in-3-days-says-hc/articleshow/87265097.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Goa||92% of Covid victims in second wave were unvaccinated: Goa epidemiologist||PANAJI: Ninety-two per cent of people who succumbed to Covid-19 during the second wave were unvaccinated, state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told reporters on Monday. He said that of the 2,563 coronavirus deaths from March 1, a total of 2,359 (92%) hadn’t even taken a single dose of the vaccine. Another 185 (7%) had taken one shot. Only a very small number — 19 victims (0.7 %) — had taken both doses of the vaccine, of which 17 had major comorbid conditions, he said. “Going by this data, it is clear that vaccination definitely helps. If you take the vaccine, you definitely will not get complications and will not reach a critical stage. There are fewer chances of being admitted and your infection will not progress,” he said while appealing to people who are due for their second dose of the vaccine to take it as soon as possible. Betodkar reasoned that as fewer daily Covid-19 cases are being reported, it was the right time for people to get their shots. “We don’t know how the virus will react in the days to come,” he said. State immunologist Dr Rajendra Borkar said 2.2 lakh people are due for their second dose of the vaccine but haven’t come forward to take it yet. As immunity sets in only after 14 days, he said it was advisable to get fully vaccinated as early as possible. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had earlier said that charter tourism can only restart once the whole state is fully vaccinated. Charter flights are expected to begin landing in the state from next week||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/92-of-covid-victims-in-2nd-wave-were-unvaccinated-data/articleshow/87266026.cms||---

Vegetable and fruit vendors say the spurt in prices is the result of surging fuel prices, crop damages due to heavy rain, as well as the festive season. They anticipate consumable items to get dearer in the coming weeks, if a similar situation continues. Tomato is being sold at Rs65-70/kg, onion Rs45-50/kg, saag (spinach) Rs 60-70/kg and lady finger Rs40-50/kg in wholesale markets of Patna. Capsicum, which was available for Rs60/kg a few weeks back, is now being sold at Rs100/kg. Similarly, the rates of nenua (sponge gourd), kaddu (bottle gourd), beans, carrot, cauliflower, potato, cucumber and green chilli also increased in the last couple of weeks. Lakhan Paswan, a vendor at Rajendra Nagar sabzi mandi, said most of the vegetable prices have gone up by 10-25%, compared to last month. “Prices are likely to stay on the higher side for the next couple of weeks in the wake of Diwali and Chhath, as the demand increases but the supply is hit due to crop damage. Increased fuel prices have also attributed to the rise in the veggie prices,” he said. Sikander at Anta Ghat said the prices are bound to increase further with the festive season ahead. “Cauliflower, which was at Rs16-20 per piece in September, is now sold at Rs60 in a pair while a bottle gourd costs Rs40. The price of lady finger and potato has increased from Rs30 to Rs50/kg and from Rs20 to Rs32/kg, respectively. Garlic is being sold at Rs120/kg, ginger at Rs80/kg and chilli Rs60-80/kg,” he said. Prices of seasonal fruits like orange, apple, banana and papaya have also shot up. Orange is being sold at Rs60/kg, apple at Rs120/kg and papaya at Rs40/kg in the wholesale market at Bazaar Samiti. The retail prices of veggies and fruits are almost 5-10% higher than the wholesale rates. Kishan Prasad, a fruit-seller at Bazaar Samiti, said the transportation cost of fruits has gone up with the rise in fuel prices. “All the fruits are imported from Maharashtra and the transportation cost has been increasing. Banana (chinia) is sold at Rs40 per dozen while Singapuri banana costs Rs60 per dozen. Orange is available at Rs250/5kg. We sell fruits in bulk,” he said. Pakhuri Sinha, a resident of West Boring Canal Road, said she bought tomato at Rs80/kg about a couple of days back in retail. “Earlier, onion prices derailed our budget. Now, its tomato and other vegetables. If the prices keep on increasing, then we have to rearrange the household budget for the upcoming festival,” she said. Anant Singh, a bank employee and a resident of Bikhnapahadi, said, “I am buying vegetables at higher prices in the wholesale markets at Machhua Toli and Mussallahpur Hatt. Prices of all household commodities are increasing every month. It is indeed getting difficult to manage the household budget. Half of my saving exhausts to meet the daily needs and medical expenses,” he said. “Pieces of vegetables and fruits will play a spoilsport in Diwali and Chhath. We have decided not to spend money on unnecessary things like clothes and accessories during festive time,” said Lata Devi, a resident of Jakkanpur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/soaring-veggie-fruit-prices-dampen-festive-spirit-in-patna/articleshow/87263993.cms||Faryal Rumi

In December that year, it was found that NSEL had violated regulatory directions that did not allow any short-selling on its platform. It was also found that NSEL was offering brokers to trade in contracts that were for durations of more than 11 days — another violation of rules. Sebi cancelled PEC’s registration even after it, in reply to a show-cause notice, said that it was not party to the alleged fraud on NSEL but a victim of it. About Rs 120 crore was still due from its counterparties on the exchange. Also, its trade data between 2010 and 2014 showed that of its total trading volume in commodities across various commodities exchanges and physical markets, including overseas trade, only about 4% was on NSEL.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-cancels-licence-of-govts-pec/articleshow/87266382.cms||---

He submitted a representation to the President, seeking dismissal of the state government under Article 356 of the Constitution and recall of DGP Gautam Sawang. Naidu also sought “comprehensive investigation against series of incidents that occurred across Andhra Pradesh against TDP offices and leaders on October 19,” through CBI. He also requested the President to order investigation into criminal networks linked to the “extensive drug hub” operating in the state. Naidu said ganja and drugs are illegally supplied to various places in the country from AP and feared that “the future generations if addicted to this drug menace, will not only be a huge loss to nation building but also become a threat to law and order.” He alleged that the persons involved have links to the ruling party. Naidu said that when the TDP as the opposition questioned these activities, the ruling party encouraged the attack on TDP offices and the houses of its leaders. He added that false cases are being filed against TDP leaders and those who criticise the government. He further alleged that the present government and the ruling party “morphed into predatory machinery in collusion with the police. It has been targeting people, opposition parties, legislators and public institutions, state infrastructure and bureaucracy, and exploiting natural resources.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/false-cases-foisted-on-tdp-leaders-naidu/articleshow/87265171.cms||Gopi Dara

What made the announcement interesting is that it came on a day when the Yogi government launched nine medical college projects across the state to keep its one-district-one-medical college promise. Earlier, the Congress had promised to reserve 40% of its tickets for women candidates. Thereafter, the party made six other promises, including electric scooter and smartphones to Class 12 passout girls. Party national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra made the announcement on social media: “Everyone saw the dilapidated state of the health system in UP during the Covid-19 pandemic, which is a result of the apathy and neglect of the current government. With the consent of the manifesto committee, the UP Congress has decided that when it forms the government in UP, any disease will be treated free of cost. The government will bear expenses up to Rs 10 lakh.” Priyanka promised a separate manifesto for women in a week and stressed that their participation in politics is necessary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/now-congress-promises-free-med-treatment-up-to-rs-10-lakh/articleshow/87266511.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Referring to the assurance of the chief minister Pramod Sawant that land allotted to IIT-Goa will be reverted back, Guleli panch Shashikant Sanvordekar said, “Till date, the land is not reverted legally.” “We have given letters to the CM and other authorities to withdraw the attempt to murder cases and revert the land to original position. If the state government does not act on our demands, then once again, the people will start an agitation.” Sanvordekar said. Locals said that police had booked 40 people in an attempt to murder case and despite representations to different authorities, there is no response. As cases have also been booked against students, many locals are worried about the future of these children. Sanvordekar said that local MLA Vishwajit Rane has not met the people of Melauli since the government announced to get IIT-Goa at Melauli. “Should the MLA meet the people only during election time?” Sanvordekar said. The locals said that they will not go to Rane to discuss the issues and rather the MLA should come if he requires us. In January 2021, Sawant acceded to the demand of the people of Melauli locals to shift the project from their village. “The decision to shift the project was taken keeping in mind people’s sentiments and the request of health minister Vishwajit Rane, who is also the local MLA, and local representatives,” Sawant had said. The government’s move to cancel the project at Melauli was the culmination of a six-month-long agitation by the residents. To avoid any controversy ahead of the upcoming assembly elections, the state government is unlikely to take any decision on finalising land for the IIT campus in Goa. The institute is currently functioning from Farmagudi in Ponda taluka. As cases have also been booked against students, many locals are worried about the future of these children.

---||Delhi||Strictly follow Covid norms in Delhi markets: HC||NEW DELHI: In view of the Diwali season, Delhi High Court asked the Aam Aadmi Party government and police on Monday to “scrupulously” enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour and crowd control, especially in market places. While protocols and guidelines filed by the authorities appear nice on paper, those need to be strictly enforced on the ground, the court said. TimesViewThere are early signs that Covid-19 is rising. There’s no substitute for wearing masks and vaccination to control it. Authorities must also ensure that crowd management regulations are not flouted.“We expect from the respondents (Centre, Delhi government and Delhi Police) that these guidelines, standard operating procedures, Covid-appropriate behaviour and controlling of the crowd at marketplaces will be executed by them scrupulously this festive season,” a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said, adding that “strict compliance is required”. The court’s direction came after the authorities claimed they were taking all necessary steps to prevent the spread of Covid. It sought another report on the enforcement of protocols and said the situation should be reviewed on November 30. The court was hearing a matter on its own following violation of Covid protocols in various markets in Delhi. During the hearing, the bench made it clear that it was not interested in seeing penalties being collected from people for violation of Covid norms, only that it wanted better crowd control and management efforts by the authorities. It noted that in the status reports the authorities had cited the steps taken for implementing Covid-appropriate behaviour, including how to control the crowd at marketplaces and also outlined ways to engage volunteers for the implementation of guidelines and sanitisation of public utilities. On its part, Delhi government said it had time and again issued appropriate guidelines and also shut down markets where the protocols weren’t being followed. Earlier this year, the high court had initiated a PIL after taking note of certain photographs, sent to one of its judges on WhatsApp by an AIIMS doctor, showing scant regard for Covid protocols by street vendors in markets. The court had observed that such breaches would only hasten the third wave of coronavirus infection, which couldn’t be allowed to happen. It also cautioned that if this behaviour of flouting Covid norms continued, the city would be in great trouble. “We have paid a huge price in the second wave. We don’t know if there is any household that has not suffered in the second wave, closely or remotely,” the bench had observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-leeway-on-covid-compliance-says-hc/articleshow/87266062.cms||Abhinav Garg

The gang of three women and the man was active in Punjab and Haryana. Gold jewellery and a white Maruti Suzuki Swift car have been recovered from them.Commissioner of police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said, “Jeeto is the kingpin of the gang. She is facing four criminal cases in various police stations and is a proclaimed offender. Goga has six cases against her. There are three and one case against Sukhchain and Rajji, respectively.” About their modus operandi, he said, “Jeeto, along with Goga and Rajji, used to target elderly women by offering them lift in their car or engaging them in friendly conversations. They would claim to be their acquaintances or relatives.”The gang has committed more than 100 snatchings in Ludhiana, Jalandhar rural, Amritsar, Kartarpur, Moga, Khanna, Jagraon, Hoshiarpur and Haryana. Bhullar said, “The Crime Investigation Agency (CIA)-1 was entrusted with the task of nabbing the accused. On a tip-off, a trap was laid at Goanspur village in Malerkotla district and the gang was caught.”The police have seized eight gold bangles, two gold bracelets, one gold chain, the car used in crimes, fake registration certificates of vehicles and registration plates, among others. “The gang was involved in 11 such incidents in the jurisdiction of the city police,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/white-car-women-gang-busted/articleshow/87264361.cms||---

On Monday, various students’ bodies began a 48-hour hunger strike at Delhi University’s (DU) North Campus for reopening its colleges without any further delay. “This systematic exclusion must end. DU must open its door to the thousands of students who are seeking education,” protesters said. Several of these organisations, including Delhi Union Students’ Union, have in the past submitted memorandums to the university administration with the same demand, said DUSU president Akshit Dahiya. All India Students’ Association had also launched a campaign to reopen campuses while stating that the imposition of digital learning was exclusionary for the marginalised sections of the society. While phase-wise resumption of offline practical classes for terminal-year students has taken place at many universities, there is no word yet on other batches across courses. DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh said the university administration would wait for the festival season to get over before taking a call. On the organisations’ demand, Singh said, “We do understand their concerns and anxiety, but we will wait for now.” The VC added, “As of now, no decision has been taken. Once the festival season is over, we will consider this issue seriously. If everything related to the Covid-19 situation stays under control, we can certainly consider resuming offline classes.” Senior officials at Jawaharlal Nehru University said, “Students are coming phase-wise to the campus.” At Jamia Millia Islamia, which has also reopened laboratories and libraries for final-year students, officials said no decision on further reopening had been taken. “Currently final-year students are coming to the campus for practical classes and libraries.

TOI had reported on October 18 that the expert committee in its 35-page report, a copy of which is with TOI but was never put in the public domain, had absolved the state administration and squarely blamed the Goa Medical College (GMC) and the directorate of health services (DHS) for the crisis. “Whatever needed was done,” Rane said when asked about the committee’s report. Further, stating that nobody ever expected that the pandemic would lead to this type of oxygen demand per person, he said that they “learnt about the extent of oxygen requirement during the second wave”. “Whatever is written (in the committee’s report), there is no harm. Nobody has been blamed. What has appeared in newspapers about (the report placing) blame, there is nothing like that. As and when infrastructure was needed to be ramped up, it was done,” he said. The health minister said that even before the first wave they had already put up a proposal for the setting up of a 20,000kl oxygen plant at the new super-speciality hospital at GMC and a 5,000kl oxygen plant at the South Goa district hospital, which was not commissioned. The three-member committee headed by IIT-Goa director B K Mishra said GMC had a severe oxygen shortage, but failed to respond in time to avert the crisis. The panel, comprising former GMC dean V N Jindal and revenue secretary Sanjay Kumar besides Mishra, also exposed the oxygen supply mismanagement by the government and the “monopolistic” 10-year contract awarded by the DHS to Scoop Industries. “Experts have given the report and I don’t want to get into it. Whatever suggestions they have made, accordingly most of the things are on track and whatever suggestion we need to further incorporate we will do so,” Rane said. After attending the virtual launch of Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said that all states would be given a health infrastructure fund to take up work at the district level, including setting up of virology and pathology laboratories among others. Sawant said that Rs 65,000 crore would be allotted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/will-work-as-per-inputs-of-o2-shortage-probe-report-rane/articleshow/87266066.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Goa||Fish mkts to see ‘surprise’ govt visits to check scales||Panaji: After receiving complaints of weight discrepancies at fish markets, the department of legal metrology has decided to conduct surprise visits at all fish markets to check scales. “We will carry out surprise drives throughout Goa. All fish vendors and distributors should take note of the same,” said the department’s assistant controller, Nitin Purushan. He also directed all fish vendors to display the verification certificate or invoice of the weighing instrument at the place of selling fish, failing which necessary action as per law would be taken. Purushan said that a massive drive was carried out by the department for the inspection of weight and measures, including weighing instruments, in the Margao wholesale market and the SGPDA market. “Twenty-five fish vendors were inspected at the wholesale market, out of which five weighing instruments were detained by the inspector for investigation,” he said. He also said that an on-site facility for verification and stamping of weights and measures was provided at the wholesale and SGPDA markets, but that vendors “fail to take the benefit of the services” provided by the department. “Strict compliance of the provisions of the Legal Metrology Act and Rules are being informed to fish vendors at both markets, failing which necessary action as per law shall be taken,” Purushan said. He also said that the department’s inspector booked one packaged drinking water unit for bottling water without a packer registration certificate under rule 27 of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/fish-mkts-to-see-surprise-govt-visits-to-check-scales/articleshow/87266070.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Another pot-jacking incident in Vadodara||VADODARA: It seems that the pot-jacking driver isn’t the only one in Vadodara who has the strange habit of stealing potted plants. Three days after the said incident, another businessman has revealed being at the receiving end of a similar theft. On Monday, the owner of a restaurant located on Waghodia Road said that an unidentified woman had stolen a potted plant from his premises a month ago. In fact, the same woman stole potted plants twice from outside his restaurant in the last four months. “The first incident happened around four months ago. CCTV footage outside my restaurant showed that a woman arrived on a scooter and stopped the vehicle at some distance at about 5.30 am. She walked up to the entrance of the restaurant, picked up a potted bonsai plant and left,” said Falgun Patel, owner of an eatery located near Uma Crossroads. “About a month ago, the same woman arrived outside my restaurant early in the morning when it was closed. She picked up another potted plant, kept it on her two-wheeler and left. The number of her vehicle’s license plate wasn’t visible in the CCTV footage. It is strange as to why she is stealing potted plants from our eatery,” Patel told TOI. He said that he didn’t file any police complaint. When asked if he continues to keep potted plants outside his restaurant, Patel said that plants add to the beauty of the place so he has kept some of them at the entrance. Three days ago, a video of a man stealing a potted plant from a café on Old Padra Road had gone viral. The man, who was driving a SUV, stopped his vehicle outside the café for some time. He first talked on his phone and then walked towards the plants. He picked up one of the potted champa plants, kept it in his SUV and drove off. After the video of the theft went viral, the man approached the café owner and apologized to him for the theft. The café owner didn’t just accept his apology but also invited him for a cup of coffee and champa plant as the return gift.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/another-pot-jacking-incident-in-vadodara/articleshow/87265290.cms||---

We have recovered two country-made pistols. One was found at the crime scene, while the other was recovered by the crime branch.” Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Namrata Patil refused to reveal details on the progress in investigations because the arrested duo were involved in a serious crime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/arrested-duo-remanded-in-police-custody-till-nov-22/articleshow/87265284.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh first to have over 3 crore fully jabbed people||LUCKNOW: Listing a new milestone in the Covid-19 vaccination programme, Uttar Pradesh pipped Maharashtra to become the first Indian state with over 3 crore fully vaccinated people. The number of eligible persons for Covid-19 vaccine in the state is 15.04 crore. As per data from the Cowin portal, 3.01 crore persons in UP have taken both the doses of the vaccine. Data also indicated that in Maharashtra 2.99 crore persons had taken both the doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. Maharashtra, however, is ahead of UP when it comes to the overall share of fully vaccinated persons vis-à-vis totally vaccinated persons. In UP every fifth eligible person in the state has taken both the doses of the vaccine whereas in Maharashtra, 45% of the vaccinated persons have taken both the doses. Health officials pointed out that the hard work put in by field workers, sustained availability of vaccines and accurate strategy was responsible for the achievement. They also said that people of the state also owe a share in the success by taking their due dose. They also reiterated that it was important for everyone to take their due vaccine as both the doses together provide 96.5% defence against complications that land a person to hospital in case they take ill with Covid-19. Among UP districts, Lucknow has the maximum number of fully immunized persons. Here 13.95 lakh persons have taken both the doses. Ghaziabad (10.14 lakh), Gautam Budh Nagar (9.39 lakh), Gorakhpur (8.34 lakh) and Kanpur (8.07 lakh) follow next. Meanwhile, health officials urged people of the state to adhere to the Covid-19 prevention norm whether they have taken the vaccine to keep any kind of trouble away. They also informed that two cases and four recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours while the state was left with just 97 active cases. The official Covid-19 bulletin indicated that the active cases were present in 33 districts only. Of the total, 56% active cases were concentrated in five districts with Lucknow (23) and Gautam Budh Nagar (16) accounting for the maximum load.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-1st-to-have-over-3cr-fully-jabbed-people/articleshow/87266513.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Goa||No plans to increase renewal period of health cards: Govt||Panaji: The government has said it has no plans to permit auto-renewal of Deen Dayal Swasthya Seva Yojana (DDSSY) cards, following suggestions that they be auto-renewed for at least five years straight to avoid inconveniencing citizens. Presently, membership of the government’s flagship health insurance scheme is subject to an annual renewal schedule. A health department official confirmed that auto-renewal is not under consideration at the moment. All DDSSY cards have currently been auto-renewed only for one year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Annual registration and renewal charges for insurance cover are Rs 200 for a family of three or less, and Rs 300 for a family of four or more. A 50% concession is available for OBCs and the non-creamy layer subject to submission of relevant documents. The official, however, agreed that renewing DDSSY cards every three to five years would be ideal as an annual renewal schedule only inconveniences citizens and increases costs to the government. The DDSSY scheme was introduced in 2016-17 and the state has collected Rs 28.3 crore towards registration and annual renewals since then. Over the past three years, an average of over Rs 5 crore was collected annually towards renewal fees. But the official said such a yearly collection is negligible when costs to the government are considered and reiterated that it would be prudent to have the cards renewed every three to five years instead. Citizens had to face several problems during the first two years of the scheme being introduced, as it meant standing in a queue for hours to get their cards renewed, among other issues. “We had received a lot of complaints and renewal counters had few staff, too,” the health official said. “Most of the problems were resolved after we took up the matter with Goa Electronics Ltd.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/no-plans-to-increase-renewal-period-of-health-cards-govt/articleshow/87266078.cms||---

She again returned to her home alleging she was harassed to bring more dowry but was again called by her in-laws on October 17 after relatives held discussions. On October 23, Hans along with his son and daughter-in- law had gone to Suman’s in-laws’ house and had given gifts for her first Karwa Chauth. A day later on Sunday evening, Hans received a call from Vikas telling him that Suman’s health was not good and he should visit General Hospital, Sector 6.

---||Goa||In future, bars may have to appoint drivers to drop drunk customers home: Goa transport minister||PANAJI: About 5,000 accidents that take place in Goa each year, in which roughly 4,500 people get injured and approximately 300-350 people lose their lives. Therefore, on an average, one person dies every day in Goa in road accidents, revealed data shared by the directorate of transport at the launch of the 10th Goa Road Safety Week on Monday. Speaking at the occasion, transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that there will be an initiative to station designated drivers near bars to drop inebriated people home and thus avoid potential accidents. “In the long term, we will bring about a legislation where it will be compulsory for all places near watering holes to have a driver stationed who can drop those that are drunk. We want tourists here and we want them to enjoy but they will have to follow traffic rules while they are here,” he said. Appealing to the public to come forward to keep Goa safe from accidents, he urged them to follow safe driving techniques. While he acknowledged that potholes also contribute to accidents, he blamed the delayed monsoon withdrawal as a reason for not filling them up. For the Road Safety Week, a special vehicle has been designed by the transport department to create awareness which will continue operating till October 31. This vehicle was launched from the Kadamba bus terminus in Panaji, which is in a dilapidated condition. “We have set aside Rs 1.7 crore to be tendered for the repair works which will take off in December,” he said. Awareness will be spread across the state through street plays, film on screens and other means. Special chariots have been set up to convey the message that helmet, and head gears are utmost needed while riding two-wheelers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-future-bars-may-have-to-appoint-drivers-to-drop-drunk-customers-home-transport-minister/articleshow/87266085.cms||---

Parents have complained of students being denied access to online and offline classes, and even exams, for non-payment of fees. The GR was issued on August 12 to help parents tide over the financial difficulties caused by the lockdown. Parents and educationists had termed the GR a toothless tiger in the absence of a fee reduction ordinance.

---||Chandigarh||Mohali petrol pumps to operate from 7am-5 pm from Nov 1: Dealers||Mohali: Punjab Petrol Pump Dealers Association has declared to close down petrol pumps by 5 pm daily in Mohali and Punjab. The announcement was made in the wake of a statewide protest demanding VAT parity with neighboring states and revision of dealer margins. The dealers threatened that they will close down the petrol pumps on November 22 if their demands were not met with. They said that petrol pumps will now be operate from 7 am to 5 pm daily from November 1. The association said it is high time for the Punjab government to take measures to check the losses and harassment being faced by Punjab’s petrol station dealers for a long time due to faulty and unjustified fuel policies. Paramjeet Singh Doaba, president, Punjab Petroleum Dealers Association, said Punjab petrol pump dealers were facing losses due to higher VAT on petrol and diesel compared to the neighbouring states and UT. He said, “The non-revision of dealer margins from the last four years and state-owned oil marketing companies offloading their expenses on to dealers and locking supplies is hitting the dealers badly. We also demand VAT parity with neighbouring states and UT. This is encouraging diesel smuggling into the state from UT and Himachal Pradesh. Now when our repeated pleas to look into our demands have failed to find any solutions, we are left with no other option than to put the Punjab government, oil marketing companies and ministry of petroleum and natural gas on notice.” Dr Manjit Singh, general secretary of the association, said, “Nearly 800 dealers of the eight border districts in Punjab are in extreme losses due to a drop of 70% in sales, whereas the whole dealers’ fraternity is facing volume loss due to high fuel prices & non increase of margins since last revision in August 2017.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mohali-petrol-pumps-to-operate-from-7am-5-pm-from-nov-1-dealers/articleshow/87265298.cms||---
---||Lucknow||PM Narendra Modi tears into SP with ‘cycle of corruption’ taunt||LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday renewed his attack on Samajwadi Party, clearly identifying it as BJP's main opponent, playing on the party's symbol, saying that the "cycle of corruption" had ground down the poor and middle classes. The sharp comments, months ahead of the UP assembly elections, saw the Prime Minister targeting SP rather than Mayawati's BSP, the other big regional outfit that used to compete with SP for office in UP, and Congress that is seen as lagging the others. SP's loyal Yadav base, likely Muslim support and useful alliances with parties like RLD in west UP, where a section of farmers has mobilised against the Centre's farm laws, is seen to make it a more potent rival. "Bhrashtachar ki cycle to khoob chali...aur us mein gareeb aur madhyam varg pista chala gaya (the cycle of corruption operated fast, crushing poor and the middle class)." Modi’s fresh barb at SP came less than a week after he accused the previous Akhilesh Yadav government of deviating from the pro-poor principles of socialist stalwarts like Ram Manohar Lohia. "Earlier, there was corruption all around...corruption in medicine supply, corruption in ambulance procurement, corruption in appointment of doctors and their transfer and posting," he said, adding that "few parivarwadis' "benefited a lot" in this entire game of corruption. His speech could be seen as taking a few digs at other rivals but the focus was on SP as he sought to remind voters of the previous SP government and the ‘contrast’ BJP offers. He also accused SP of “playing politics” to stop the BJP government at the Centre from improving health facilities in the state. The previous government, he said, opened small dispensaries which, "most of the time", did not have basic infrastructure and medical staff. “As a result, poor people in small towns and villages had no options but to rush their ailing children and old aged relatives to bigger towns in search of medical facilities,” he said. The PM made a reference to Purvanchal saying that the east UP region was left to be infested with dreaded diseases like Japanese encephalitis over a period of time. He recalled how during his tenure as a Gorakhpur MP, CM Yogi Adityanath told Parliament about the poor health facilities of UP and especially in the eastern part of the state. The same Purvanchal, he said, was poised to become a "medical hub" of eastern India by providing a large number of medical professions to the country as he launched nine medical colleges. Lauding Yogi for working overtime as CM to save the lives of thousands of children who used to die of Japanese encephalitis, Modi said the steps taken by the BJP government projected its “strong political will and clear political priority”. “This happens only when the government is sensitive and understands the pain of the poor," he said. The PM said the "double engine" government of BJP has “honestly attempted” to remove difficulties faced by the poor. He specifically mentioned how 90 lakh people in UP have been benefited by the Ayushman Bharat scheme. "The health projects are also delivered on a timely basis," he said, insisting that the new health policy was aimed to help the poor and save them from a host of diseases. Drawing yet another contrast between the previous SP government and the incumbent Yogi government in UP, Modi said that only six medical colleges opened between 2012-17, while the Yogi government in the last four-and-a-half years of rule has already made 16 medical colleges operational and another 30 are in the pipeline. Modi termed the upcoming AIIMS in Rae Bareli and Gorakhpur as a "bonus" for the state. He also said that the BJP government at the Centre will ensure that the number of doctors passing out of medical colleges in the next 10 to 12 years is more than the numbers in the last 70 years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/pm-modi-tears-into-sp-with-cycle-of-corruption-jibe/articleshow/87266514.cms||Pankaj Shah

The dean in his police complaint had claimed that he was attacked after he refused to pass one of the three students who had failed an examination. A botched up investigation or failure on part of police in gathering evidence wasn’t the reason for the acquittal though. Interestingly, the then dean Bonipailo Beekepailo Christian, who had lodged the case at Sayajigunj police station, and the three students Lakulish alias Lalo Purohit, Vanrajsinh Raj and Vishal Parikh did not appear during the trial. Only one eye-witness, who was a clerk in the faculty, turned up for his testimony, but he too could not remember the names of the students who had attacked the dean. As per the details of complaint registered by Christian, on August 20 in 1998 when Christian was present in his office, Parikh, Raj and Purohit stormed into his office and asked Christian to pass Parikh in an examination which he had failed. When Christian said that he cannot pass Parikh illegally, the trio abused him and attacked him with a chair. As he moved aside, Christian did not suffer any injuries. Later, Christian lodged an offence of trespassing, assault and insult at Sayajigunj police station against the trio. When the case came up for trial after the police filed chargesheet, neither of the accused remained present despite summons being issued. The court then decided to continue the trial in their absence. During the trial, the testimony of just one eye-witness Kirit Patel was recorded. Patel stated that Christian had left Gujarat to settle at his native place long ago. While one witness, who was a senior clerk, passed away and another witness had since changed his home and his new address was not available. Patel said that the alleged incident did take place inside the dean’s office and some students had abused him and also he had fallen off his chair. However, he failed to recognize any of the students involved in the attack or recollect their names. The court of additional chief judicial magistrate J A Baxi considered Patel’s statement and also noted that no concrete evidence was presented against the accused to prove them guilty. The court passed the order of their acquittal in their absence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/attack-on-msu-dean-court-acquits-three-students-after-23-years/articleshow/87265305.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Delhi Police on Monday said they had registered a case in this regard. Police were informed about the clash by the hospital where the injured — Pinku (24), Sunny (32) and Sunil Sehrawat (32), all lodged in jail number one of Tihar — were receiving treatment. During investigation, cops found that sharp objects were used by four inmates to carry out the attacks. Later, Sehrawat and Pinku were referred to another hospital for treatment. The four attackers were identified as Rohit Kapoor, Rajesh, Sandeep Dalal and Sehrawat. Sources said recently, during checking by jail staff, a phone was seized from the cell of the attackers. “The exact reason behind the incident is being probed. We came to know that they (attackers) suspected the victims to have told the jail authorities about the phone,” said a jail source, adding that the four men belong to a notorious gang. In his statement, Sunny claimed he was attacked by the other inmates with a sharp object. Police have received the medico-legal case reports and have also taken samples from the spot for further probe. After a complaint was received from the deputy superintendent of Tihar, a case under IPC sections 307 (murder attempt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 34 (common intention) were registered against all accused. In the last six months, Tihar has been in the dock for jailed gangsters ordering hits outside, brawls, officers assaulting or killing an inmate and providing undue favours to convicts, like in the Unitech case, for pecuniary gains. From brazen murders to massive mobile phone usage by inmates, Delhi’s jails have been courting multiple controversies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/three-inmates-injured-in-clash-between-two-groups-at-tihar/articleshow/87266087.cms||---
---||Mumbai||ED investigates Rs 50 crore scam in bank under Eknath Khadse’s daughter||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has initiated an investigation into the misappropriation of Rs 50 crore in the Jalgaon District Co-operative Central Bank during the tenure of former revenue minister Eknath Khadse’s daughter, Rohini Khadse-Khewalkar, as its chairperson. The ED will soon summon Rohini to record her statement. The bank fraud came to the ED’s attention during the investigation of the money laundering case against Khadse and others in the Pune MIDC land purchase case. Officials said that during the investigation the ED came to know that Rohini had helped her family identify the MIDC land plot for purchase and claim compensation from the government. So, the ED decided to take a closer look at the institute Rohini was associated with, leading to the discovery of misappropriation of funds in the bank. It was stated that she, as a chairperson of the bank, sanctioned unsecured loans of around Rs 50 crore to companies controlled by her. Afterwards, the funds where siphoned off through fictitious transactions. The companies defaulted on the loans, resulting in NPAs and losses to the bank. Rohini refused to comment on the matter. Rohini had unsuccessfully contested 2019 assembly election on a BJP ticket as the party decided to field her in place of her father in Jalgaon district. Khadse was at loggerheads with BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis. Last October, Khadse and Rohini left the party to join the NCP. In the money laundering case thatv the ED is investigating against Khadse and his family, it is alleged that in 2016, when Khadse was state revenue minister, he misused his official position to help his wife, Mandakini, and son-in-law, Girish Chaudhari, enter into a sale deed for an MIDC land plot in Pune. They paid Rs 3.75 crore to the descendant of the original owner of the plot and Khadse’s kin spent Rs 1.37 crore for registration and stamp duty. The stamp duty was paid on Rs 22.83 crore, which was the actual government price of the land in the record, to avoid any legal issues, but on the record the price of the plot of land was undervalued. It was revealed that sub-registrar Ravindra Muley had allegedly helped Khadse and his family manipulate the government records. The government had purchased the plot of land from its original owner in 1981 and owned the plot, according to government records.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-investigates-rs-50cr-scam-in-bank-under-khadse-daughter/articleshow/87266816.cms||Vijay V Singh

The move is to decongest Howrah station, and for which these eight trains are going to have a new terminal point at Shalimar which is close to the Vidyasagar Setu, an official said and added that for it Shalimar is going to gain added attention and the station complex is going to get a new look. From next week some trains are going to be relocated to Shalimar. Howrah- Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) Special will terminate at Shalimar from November 2 and the same train will go to LTT on November 4 from Shalimar. Howrah-Vasco Da Gama Special will also originate from Shalimar from January 1, 2022, and end there. Even Howrah Porbandar Special and Howrah-Okha Special will have their terminal point at Shalimar from mid-January. Similarly, Howrah-Puri Special, Howrah-Chennai Special, Howrah Hyderabad Special will all start from Shalimar and terminate at Shalimar from January, thus the station will be having added importance soon, an official said. But with increased passenger traffic to Shalimar station, the civic administration in Howrah had been asked to arrange for proper infrastructure for the movement of passengers. Arrangements are on so that the rail passengers going to Shalimar or coming to Shalimar can also use river transport. Even the Howrah Municipal Corporation had been asked to maintain the approach road to Shalimar sans potholes. Moreover, the PWD officials had been asked to improve the road signage from Vidyasagar Setu so that passengers travelling to the station do not get confused in the loops of the Vidyasagar Setu. Even the officials are looking for a bigger taxi stand as there is no bus stand close to the Shalimar station and passengers have to get off the bus at Duke Road to reach Shalimar station. However, there are some e-rickshaws (Totos) available at the station complex.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/konar-railways/articleshow/87265339.cms||Debashis Konar

High drama unfolded at the university head office as mudslinging between the two warring saffron camps reached new heights. The day started with three syndicate members — Dr Dilip Kataria, Chetan Somani and Hasmukh Waghela —submitting a memorandum to MSU registrar demanding that the business of the syndicate meeting should be recorded, and it should be streamed online like the proceedings of Parliament and state assembly. During the meeting there were heated arguments between members of the two saffron camps over the alleged recruitment scam. The group of syndics that enjoys majority in the body refused to provide the expert assessment reports of candidates which were sought by the rival faction. “As per ordinance 33, the university cannot provide expert assessment report. We have provided four out of five set of documents that they had sought,” said syndicate member Jigar Inamdar. Inamdar and other members of the majority camp have also threatened of legal action against their rivals for “tarnishing” university’s image by alleging recruitment scam. “We have decided to take legal opinion of the three senior counsels of Gujarat High Court and as per their advice, we will initiate action against all those who have made baseless allegations,” said Inamdar, adding that the syndicate members will now have to take RTI route if they need any other documents. Accusing Inamdar and other members of the majority camp of suppressing their voice, Waghela said that they are ready to face any legal action. “We had sought complete set of documents. But we have been provided only computerized summary sheet and application forms of the candidates. We have not been provided the bio-data of the candidates,” said Waghela. “If they are so confident that there is no irregularity in the recruitments, why aren’t they being transparent,” he questioned. Action will be taken if there is a wrongdoing: C R Paatil Vadodara: The recruitment row at M S University has reached to the top brass of both Gujarat government and state BJP. When questioned about allegations of recruitment scam made by three syndicate members and BJP Savli MLA Ketan Inamdar, state BJP chief C R Paatil said that there should be complete transparency in the process. “If there is any wrongdoing, we will take action against anyone responsible,” Paatil told media persons on sidelines of a function organized by Patidar community in Vadodara. Sources said that late evening, Paatil called the three syndicate members and other members of the sankalan samiti who have alleged recruitment scam to discuss the matter. Earlier, in the day, the majority group of syndics also welcomed Paatil’s statement. “We all agree with his statement. We are of the same opinion that action should be taken against anybody responsible for any wrongdoing,” said Jigar Inamdar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/high-drama-unfolds-at-msu-syndicate-meeting/articleshow/87265259.cms||---

As per our estimate, we need to rehabilitate over 700 families. We will submit a memorandum to the district collector and government for a special package,” said Panicker.

According to Panicker, 1,569 people are still in 10 relief camps. “As per the estimate, 550 homes were destroyed in the panchayat, 164 homes totally and 191 homes partially destroyed. In addition, 195 homes facing serious threats and are not possible for further habitation,” said Panicker, continuing, “In Kokkayar, Vembli, Enthayar and Pappani areas, four major bridges and culverts were totally destroyed in the landslides. Yesterday night, two landslides were reported in Urumbikkara and Meloram.” Krishnankutty, a Kokkayar resident, said they have been living in the area for the last 60 years and never faced such incidents. “After the extremely heavy rainfall, a landslide washed away my home which was constructed with my life savings. I don’t know how to survive the situation,” he said. According to officials, most of the areas under the panchayat are above 45-degree curve areas. Vembli ward member Sajith K Sasi said that after the landslides, people in the area have begun moving to safer places. “The reality is that many areas of the panchayat are still facing a serious landslide threat,” he said. Idukki district panchayat president Giji K Philp told TOI that post floods, over 80% of the Kokkayar panchayat area has become unhabitable. “We will submit the panchayat's special land package recommendation to the government soon.

The court granted Khadse’s plea for interim relief from arrest while citing the Bombay high court order that had granted him the relief till Thursday. “Pursuant to the protection granted by the Bombay high court, we appeared before special court and interim bail has been granted,” Khadse’s advocate Mohan Tekavde said. Tekavde said that Khadse was still unwell. Khadse also sought bail, for which the plea will be heard on Friday. The special court directed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to file its reply. Tekavde said that among the grounds cited in the bail plea was that Khadse had cooperated with the ED several times and the chargesheet had been filed. “On issuance of summons he appeared before the court,” he said. Last week, the high court directed the ED not to arrest Khadse for a week, by when he was to seek bail from the special PMLA court. Khadse had moved the high court with an anticipatory bail plea. The high court directed him to approach the special trial court for relief, and directed the subordinate court to hear and decide Khadse’s application. A special court had last month initiated a process against Khadse and four others, including his wife and son-in-law, observing that a prima facie case had been made out against them following the ED chargesheet. His wife, Mandakini, appeared before the special PMLA court on Thursday. Khadse’s defence made an exemption plea, which was allowed after the trial court was informed that the high court had given him time to appear. The special court said it was granting exemption only for the day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-khadse-goes-to-court-at-last-gets-interim-bail-in-land-case/articleshow/87266834.cms||---

On October 15, the UP Jal Nigam shut down the Ganga jal supply to Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad for the annual desilting work. While residents in several sectors reported low water pressure, others complained of no supply over the past few days. Those residing in sectors 19, 20, 25, 141 and 51, for instance, told TOI that supply had been reduced from three hours to one hour a day while others said they were unable to get water on the first and second floors of their homes due to low pressure. While the Noida Authority has deployed tankers on request, residents living above groundfloors find it difficult to lug water buckets and demand a permanent solution to the annual problem. Laxmi Narain, RWA president of Sector 19, said, “Water supply has been erratic for the past 10 days. Sometimes, the water is dirty. Other times, the supply comes with very low pressure. Even the timings of the supply are not being maintained as specified earlier i.e., for three hours in the morning from 6-9 am and again in the evening from 6-9 pm.” “Water tanks in the houses usually remain empty. Residents living on the first and second floors are facing a lot of problems because of this, as they are unable to pump up water due to this low pressure,” he added. Sharad Jain, a resident of Kendriya Vihar in Sector 51, claimed the housing society had been facing an acute water crisis since the weekend. “Only 40% of the 1,200 flats in the society are getting water. Most other sectors are also facing this problem,” he said. Alok Nagar, RWA general secretary of Sector Delta 2 in Greater Noida, also complained of reduced water supply, from three to an hour. “There is not enough water to even carry out the basic household chores.” Meanwhile, the less inhabited, remote sectors are still facing civic infrastructure issues. “Water line has not been laid in this sector yet. While the sewer line is blocked, there are no streetlights on the poles and it remains dark in the sector,” said Latsahab Lohia, RWA president of Sector 141. “Every year, the supply shutdown occurs post-monsoon and we have been raising the issue of arranging adequate supply through treated groundwater and renny wells. But the Authority has not paid due attention to the matter yet,” said a resident of Sector 77.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/getting-just-1-hour-of-water-supply-in-a-day/articleshow/87266525.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The corporators said this move would curb illegal constructions in the civic limits and reduce slum dwellings. Many small property and plot owners will benefit from this scheme; along with existing properties, even those in the recently merged 23 villages should be allowed to be regularised in this scheme, they said. The state cabinet in January had extended the deadline for regularisation of constructions on Gunthewari land till December 31, 2021. The previous cut-off was January 1, 2001. They said other municipal corporations in the state have implemented such schemes. Beneficiaries should be given benefit of the extended deadline, they said. Gunthewari development refers to plots formed by unofficially divvying up privately owned land. The land includes excess vacant land under Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, not vested in the state government but excluding land under encroachment. Such land is governed by Maharashtra Gunthewari Development (Regularisation, Upgradation and Control) Act, 2001. “We approached the state government for finalising the compounding under Gunthewari. They will be declared soon, and a notification will be issued accordingly,” said Yuvraj Deshmukh, an official with PMC’s building permissions department. The PMC GB also discussed other issues, like repairs to Ambil Odha, drainage issues and pending works.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/corporators-for-gunthewari-schemes-in-civic-areas/articleshow/87265346.cms||---

Twelve workers each have been deployed on this job by the commissioner to ensure that other works are not affected, said an officer.Tea stalls, which were the major encroachments in most roads and hindering traffic movement were removed, said a corporation employee. Some of the encroachers were warned and slapped with fines. About Rs 10,500 was collected as fine during the eviction drives in Yannaikkal, East Masi Street and Vakkil New Street. “It is not that we want to penalise them but we want to make sure they do not do it again,” said an officer in-charge.Residents of Kamarajar Salai and Munichalai where several encroachments were removed on Monday, welcomed the move. “Pedestrians do not have place to walk, especially during the Diwali season, with all these vendors and shops occupying the space illegally beyond the permitted limit,” said S Kathiravan of Kamarajar Salai, who said that even reaching his house on this road was a problem during the shopping season.“Small vendors, who sell their produce in baskets could be spared because they can always keep moving and not create nuisance,” said Saranya of Chinthamani. The eviction drives would continue in all four zones of the corporation till the roads are cleared, said a source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/corpn-intensifies-eviction-of-encroachments-in-madurai/articleshow/87265345.cms||---

The RTI Act was the outcome of an intensive financial lobby, people’s lobby and social lobby, she added. The Act has helped to curtail bureaucratic corruption to some level and about 80 lakh people use it in a year, she said. Swaraj has to survive to enable people below the poverty line to access their privileges without bribes or corruption, she said.Padmashri Chinnapillai, leader of the Kalanjiyam Movement recalled how the movement had helped eradicate usury, violence against women and alcohol addition to a large extent in villages.P Vasimalai, executive director, Dhan Foundation stressed the importance of community swaraj for eradicating poverty and said that over five lakh families at the national level, with whom they worked while coordinating with different stakeholders, had overcome poverty.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/knowledge-building-can-help-eradicate-poverty/articleshow/87265348.cms||---
---||Madurai||AIADMK office-bearers will decide on Sasi reinduction: OPS||Madurai/Chennai: Amid attempts by V K Sasikala to wrest control of the AIADMK, party coordinator O Panneerselvam, who rebelled against her in 2017, on Monday said senior office-bearers would decide on her reinduction into the party. OPS was responding to queries from reporters in Madurai on whether the AIADMK would consider taking Sasikala back. Panneerselvam’s response evoked sharp reactions from loyalists of AIADMK joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami. Former minister D Jayakumar recalled that OPS himself had waged a ‘dharamyudh’ against Sasikala and laid a pre-condition for the merger with the EPS faction that the party should have nothing to do with her. In Madurai, Panneerselvam said politics provided space for anyone, but public acceptance mattered. Former chief minister M G Ramachandran founded the AIADMK as a movement for cadres and it remained thus. To a specific question on whether the AIADMK would provide space for Sasikala, OPS said, “Today the AIADMK functions under a coordinator and joint coordinator. Inducting her (Sasikala) into the party should be decided by the party headquarters office-bearers.” This is his first reaction after Sasikala recently unveiled a plaque at MGR memorial in Chennai that declared her the AIADMK general secretary.OPS and Sasikala belong to the thevar community, influential in the southern districts. A few days ahead of the April 6 assembly election, OPS, in an interview to a Tamil news channel, had stated that the AIADMK could consider taking her back on humanitarian basis, if she accepted the present party set-up. With his support base spread across the thevar-dominant constituencies, it is crucial for OPS to be seen humouring Sasikala and their community, point out observers.On Monday, flanked by former ministers and thevar leaders, OPS presented the gold armour (weighing 13kg donated by former AIADMK general secretary J Jayalalithaa) to the trustees of Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar memorial in Pasumpon to decorate the statue during Guru Puja.Panneerselvam had a word of advice to party leaders -- to behave responsibly and follow what C N Annadurai had advocated -- duty, dignity and discipline. “Cadres and leaders alike should maintain dignity in their speeches,” he said. This is perceived as a rebuke to Jayakumar, who had called Sasikala "a mosquito" recently, and to EPS, who made a veiled attack against her.For his part, Jayakumar told reporters in Chennai, “The AIADMK expelled cadres who had spoken to Sasikala. It passed a resolution, warning disciplinary action against partymen if they interacted with her. The AIADMK coordinator and joint coordinator are signatories to the resolution.” In Krishnagiri, AIADMK deputy coordinator K P Munusamy said the question of reinducting Sasikala did not arise as the party had passed a resolution against her.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/aiadmk-office-bearers-will-decide-on-sasi-reinduction-ops/articleshow/87265382.cms||---

Nearly 100 items, which include furniture, bedsheets, garments, leather products, fabrication products, and others, have been put on display at the Diwali exhibition-cum-sale at the prison store in Yerawada. “We have decided to give a modern touch to our furniture and other articles, and we are working on it. Articles produced by the prison industry must look contemporary and should draw the attention of the new generation,” said additional director general of police (prisons) Atulchandra Kulkarni on Monday after inaugurating the exhibition-cum-sale at Yerawada store. The Diwali exhibition-cum-sale was not organised in 2020 owing to the Covid situation. Convicts lodged in prisons across the state work in different industries, such as handloom, power loom, fabrication, carpentry, bakery, leather, agriculture, and others. “Owing to the Covid situation, many convicts were released on emergency parole and furlough. There was a shortage of manpower in the prisons and production in the prison industry was halted,” Kulkarni said. “However, as the situation is returning to normalcy. Industrial units have started production again,” he said. Deputy inspector general of police (prisons) Yogesh Desai said, “We will request the state government to exempt prison products from GST so that the customers can get good and quality products at cheaper rates,” he said. Yerawada prison superintendent Rani Bhosale said, “The inmates are working round the clock and over 100 products are on display. These are quality products and people should buy these products to support he inmates.” “Every year during Diwali, the prison sells products worth Rs15lakh to Rs16lakh and all the earned money goes to the state treasury,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/prison-industry-starts-partial-ops-100-items-on-festive-sale/articleshow/87265390.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Delhi||Unitech case: Delhi Police search 37 locations in three states||NEW DELHI: Search and seizure operations were conducted at 37 locations in Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan by Delhi Police’s Crime Branch on Monday as a part of the probe in the Unitech case. The premises included residences of Unitech Ltd owners Ramesh Chandra, Ajay Chandra, Sanjay Chandra and their employees. An FIR under Prevention of Corruption Act, etc was filed against the Chandra brothers and others on October 12 after which a team under the supervision of Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana conducted a preliminary investigation and submitted its report to Supreme Court. On October 25, search and seizure operations were conducted at the residences of the Chandra family, apart from former superintendent, ex-deputy superintendent, assistant superintendents, head warders, warders and contractual staff of Tihar Jail number 7. Special commissioner (crime) Devesh Srivastava confirmed the developments. Evidence in the form of mobile phones, documents, etc were seized, he added. Earlier, Crime Branch had found 32 officials of Tihar Jail complicit with Ajay and Sanjay Chandra in this matter. Asthana had written to the Union ministry of home affairs and director general of Delhi prisons for taking action. Supreme Court had asked Asthana to probe the nexus after taking note of a status report filed by Enforcement Directorate, which highlighted certain disturbing facts relating to the manner in which the premises of Central Jail at Tihar had been misused by the Chandras. The ED’s report elaborated on how the Chandra brothers threatened witnesses, apart from operating a free communications network and sending instructions from inside the jail. The accused engaged in illegal activities by flouting the jail manual and also transferred assets and dissipating the proceeds of crime from their secret office. The apex court had transferred both the brothers from Tihar Jail to Arthur Road and Taloja Central jails in Mumbai. The police chief had submitted a report in this regard on September 28 after visiting Mumbai and Tihar jails as a part of the investigation. On October 6, Supreme Court granted permission to conduct a full-fledged criminal investigation in the matter based on the inquiry conducted by Delhi Police. The court also directed the Tihar administration to suspend the officials complicit in the crime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/unitech-case-police-search-37-locations-in-three-states/articleshow/87266130.cms||---

---||Kochi||Did not receive any extreme rainfall warning, say residents||Kokkayar (Idukki): Natives in Kokkayar panchayat of Idukki claimed that they did not receive any early or timely warning for the extreme rainfall that occurred last Saturday. The serial landslides and flash floods claimed large-scale life and property damage in Kokkayar. According to natives, they moved to safe places after getting the warning from other local residents and relatives. Madhu, a Mukkulam resident, told TOI that they moved to a safer area from their homes after getting calls from relatives. “Our relatives informed us that a landslide occurred in Elamkadu Top and there are chances of flooding in the area. That is when we moved from our home to a safe area. If our relatives did not give us the warning, we would have been washed away by the flash flood,” he said. Salim, another resident in Kokkayar, said that they moved to a safe place when the water level in the river rose alarmingly. “Even during the 2018 floods, the water did not reach such an alarming level. If we received early warnings, we could have taken our belongings before evicting our home,” he said. Sajin Kumar K S, assistant professor, department of geology at the University of Kerala, said, “It is a pressing requirement to have an early warning system in landslide susceptible zones. It is disheartening to see that lessons have not been learnt from the previous incidents.” “There are many influencing factors of landslides. The two main factors are dynamic and static factors. The static factors are the curve and stone of the hills, and the dynamic factors are extremely heavy rainfall. Sporadic high intensive rainfall caused landslides in the area. These areas are landslide-prone,” said Kumar. Climatologist Gopakumar Cholayil said that on October 16, Kokkayar panchayat, including Peermade taluk, experienced 305mm extremely heavy rainfall. “At present, we have no proper early warning system or heavy rainfall prediction in single areas. The recent incidents show that the implementation of early warning system is necessary," he said. “When getting an early warning about extremely heavy rainfall, people can move to safe places, and it will reduce human loss,” said Cholayil. As per the primary estimate by the revenue department, nine died in the landslide and rain-related incidents in Idukki on October 16.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/did-not-receive-any-extreme-rainfall-warning-say-residents/articleshow/87265410.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Authorities said that two different teams raided two private premises and nabbed a total of 34 suspects red-handed from these two gambling dens. A total of 21 mobile phones, four bikes and some cash, having a total valuation of Rs 5.74 lakh were seized from the spot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/2-constables-suspended-in-hingoli-dist/articleshow/87263633.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court dismisses NCB plea to ignore affidavit on payoff to its zonal chief||MUMBAI: A special NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act court on Monday said it cannot pass a blanket order to not take cognisance of an affidavit by a witness in the cruise liner drug bust case alleging payoff to a Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) official. The court disposed of an application which was backed by strongly worded appeals from NCB and its zonal director Sameer Wankhede. Prabhakar Sail, private bodyguard to a witness K P Gosavi, had filed the affidavit levelling allegations pertaining to the October 2 raid leading to the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan. NCB had sought to ensure no interference in its probe into the case in the light of the affidavit. Under threat of arrest from vested interest to stop drug probe: OfficerHearing a petition by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to stop the contents of witness Prabhakar Sail’s affidavit from being taken cognisance of, an NDPS court said it was for the concerned court or authority to pass appropriate orders. “Considering the nature of the relief claimed in the application, no such blanket orders can be passed…Moreover, the matter is sub-judice before the honourable high court in bail applications in the same FIR. Therefore, no such orders can be passed by the court as prayed,” special judge VV Patil said. In the affidavit dated October 23, not made before any court, Sail mentioned a payment of Rs 8 crore allegedly to be made to Wankhede. Wankhede told the court the allegations “were not only false, but misleading, mischievous and maligning”. “I further state and submit that, I am under a lurking threat of arrest as it does not suit some vested interest just for conducting an honest and impartial investigation,” he said in his application. “Why are there allegations against my family members? Is it because of my supervisory position? Is it only to divert me and make me fail in court,” he asked. Wankhede also submitted that nobody should be allowed to influence the witnesses and the investigation. “I am open to any kind of investigation or inquiry. I have 15 years of record. But such allegations only to target my personal life and work are not done,” he said. His plea said the cruise drugs case involves rich and influential persons from higher echelons of society and threats including of arrest are being made against him. “…. this hon’ble court may take serious cognisance of such pressures exerted on officers like us in a sub-judice matter with a mala fide intent to demoralise them so that the truth does not come to light,” he said in his application. Wankhede said he was constrained to submit that he has been personally targeted, especially by a political figure. He said the only justification he can fathom is that one Sameer Khan, a relative of this “political honcho” (NCP leader Nawab Malik) was arrested in a drug case under the NDPS Act and later granted bail. He did not name Malik in the plea. He said he would place on record material to show he was threatened with arrest and dismissal from his job. The NCB backed Wankhede by disputing Sail’s affidavit as “false” and “mischievous”. Its application said, “…the Zonal Director, who has an impeccable service record, replete with honesty and integrity has no interest whatsoever as falsely alleged in such purported affidavit. The NCB headed by its Zonal Director and its team were working tirelessly, with the sole objective to eradicate the drug menace in the city of Mumbai...” The plea was filed by superintendent V V Singh. “…as such purported affidavit specifically maligns the Zonal Director, NCB, Mumbai, he has written to the Commissioner of Police, Mumbai with a copy to the DGP of Police, Maharashtra and DG of Anti - Corruption Bureau, Maharashtra for information and necessary action...” it said. The NCB pointed out that the affidavit was filed barely a couple of days prior to the bail hearing of the accused before the Bombay high court and when the bail pleas of all other accused were being heard by the special NDPS court. Aryan Khan’s bail plea will come up for hearing before the high court on Tuesday. The NCB said the fact that it was filed several days after the commencement of the probe is unexplained and speaks volumes of it being non-credible. At this stage, Sail’s affidavit is an attempt to “undermine” the probe, it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/under-threat-of-arrest-from-vested-interest-to-stop-drug-probe-in-mumbai-officer/articleshow/87266568.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Till Thursday, police had received 976 applications which are under the review. Senior officers said the licenses would be issued only after the physical verification of the sites. TOI on Thursday spoke to police authorities and those who were applying for firecracker licenses. Applicants were happy that the government lifted the ban with some restrictions, but are jittery on how customers would respond this Diwali. “Firecracker sale would be on after 2019. I am applying for license and will stock less quantity,” said Abdul Majjid who came to the commissionerate to apply for license. Haider Ali Zaidi, the additional commissioner of police (law and order) said, “We have started the process of applications for firecracker license. Till Thursday evening, we got nearly 976 applications. Usually during this time, at least 1,500 people apply for license. After getting the report of the physical verification, we will issue the licenses to them.” Applicants complained they do not have much time in hand to buy firecrackers after getting the license. “I think firecracker sale this year would be confined to a few days only. May be a week’s time, we will get license and then order for firecrackers. This time it won’t be as good as it used to be,” said Radheyshyam Khuntenta, another applicant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/nearly-1k-apply-for-firecracker-licence/articleshow/87265362.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Why you must brace for peak of farm fire impact||NEW DELHI: An analysis of data from the Union earth science’s forecasting body System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) determined that the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 is highest between October 29 and November 15. The data shows that the highest proportion of farm-fire emissions in Delhi’s PM2.5 level on a single day was 58% in 2018, 44% in 2019 and 42% in 2020. During the peak season, the single-day contribution varies between 20% and 30%. This year, the highest single-day share of stubble burning has been 15%, said SAFAR. It has mostly remained below 5% due to rain. Track the pollution level in your city Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) on Tuesday was 139 in the ‘moderate’ category and the contribution of stubble burning was measured at 8%. SAFAR started calculating the share of stubble burning in the PM2.5 pollutants in 2018 using indigenous technology. Its data shows the maximum effect of stubble burning is a single-day share of 58%, but the marks above 30% isn’t too consistent in a season. There were two days in 2020 when the contribution of smoke to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration touched 40% or above.  In 2019 and 2018, there were just one day each. Last year, the maximum share of farm fire emission in the city air was 40% and 42% in the 62 days of the harvesting season. Similarly, 2020 saw five days when the 24-hour share of stubble burning was between 31% and 39%, but only two such days each in 2019 and 2018. SAFAR’s founder project director Gufran Beig said, “The contribution of stubble burning to PM2.5 pollution fluctuates. The higher number of farm fires does not necessarily mean a more severe impact.” He explained that factors determining the adverse effect of farm fires to the city’s poor air quality included speed of transport wind and wind direction. The transport height had to be above surface level and wind should be blowing from the burning sites towards Delhi. Besides, calm local conditions also play an important role because they cause accumulation of pollutants released from stubble burning. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “The ground report from Punjab and Haryana suggests that farmers couldn’t burn the harvest remnants earlier due to rain and they are likely to incinerate the stubble in the first week of November. Strong preventive action to check such burning is required from authorities concerned.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-you-must-brace-for-peak-of-farm-fire-impact/articleshow/87290363.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Madurai||CBSE Class X, XII students gear up for exams in new system||Madurai: Class X and XII students and teachers in Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools have started preparing for the first term exams, which will be held in a new format in November. The CBSE has decided to conduct the first term exam only in multiple choice questions (MCQ) format this year, which many students and teachers term as a challenge.The new system divided the academic year into two terms, with two term exams to be held for 50 marks each. The first term exam is set to be held in November and December, which will only have MCQs. “The new system is in accordance with the National Education Policy (NEP). Also, the portion for the first term will not be repeated for the second term. It will be difficult to score high marks unlike how it was for the descriptive type questions. But, students are slowly adapting and we have been conducting online practice tests,” said Subha Manikandan, principal, Mahatma Montessori CBSE School, Madurai. Students are feeling a bit of pressure as schools have also been closed for more than one-and-a-half years and they have only been relying on online classes.L Krishnaleela, a Class XII Physics teacher, noted that in math and science subjects, students still have to work out problems and derivations and that they are not sure whether online classes have been enough to help students keep up. “Students have to understand the question and work out the answer by practically applying the formulas and methods they learnt. Even in competitive exams, sums are the most difficult part for students as even if they get one step wrong, the answer will be wrong,” she added.Aruna M Visvessvar, senior principal and correspondent, Adhyapana School, said that students need to know the concepts very well to score high. “It took a few practice tests for students to understand the difficulty of MCQs but they are adapting. Another issue is that for answering MCQs, students also need to understand the English language well since the same question can be twisted and asked differently. Students have to adapt. We are also getting them prepared for practical exams,” she added.Practical exams are also to be held in different methods for two terms with one being with internal examiners and the other with external examiners.“I feel that they could have waited another year before introducing this pattern or at least announced about it last year itself. The sudden change in the pattern is stressful. Though competitive exams are like this, at least we know what to expect. But now it is completely new for us. We are anxious and hope the questions are not too tough,” said K Archana Devi, a Class XII student.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/cbse-class-x-xii-students-gear-up-for-exams-in-new-system/articleshow/87265397.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Police want Goondas Act against Yati, cite FIRs||GHAZIABAD: Police have recommended charging Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, head priest of the Dasna Devi temple who recently got a senior position in the Juna akahara as a ‘mahamandaleshwar’, under the Goondas Act and sent his file to the Ghaziabad administration to initiate proceedings. A senior police officer said on Monday the decision was taken because 10 cases are registered against Yati at different police stations in the district, besides one in Delhi, and controversies around him and the temple premises had become frequent. As a result, the officer said, police have had to deploy personnel near the temple round the clock to maintain law and order. In March this year, a 10-year-old boy from a minority community was thrashed by an aide of Yati for entering the temple compound, which bars entry of Muslims. Earlier this month, another boy, also from the minority community, was likened to a “trained killer” and accused of entering the temple compound “for a recce” by Yati. Police had clarified that the boy’s destination was the adjoining health centre but he had got confused and taken the wrong gate. In the report sent to the administration, police have described Yati as “dangerous to society” and also referred to his use of “derogatory language” against women in politics. On August 31, three FIRs were filed against him at Masuri police station for his comments on women – two of those on complaints by sub-inspectors Logesh Kumar and Anil Kumar and the third after National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma wrote to DGP Mukul Goel about two videos on Yati’s comments that had been shared on social media platforms. The first video surfaced on August 7 and the other on August 29. ASP Akash Patel told TOI, “Yati has also tried to disturb peace on a regular basis. Yati alleged (on October 11) a 10-year-old boy had entered the temple to kill him, but police probe showed that the boy had entered mistakenly as he wanted to go to the government hospital to see his relative. We have also mentioned other cases in the report. The file was sent to the administration five days ago and we are now waiting for permission from the district magistrate (to file the charges).” A case under Goondas Act is filed after proceedings in which the administration conducts a hearing in which a person facing the charges can argue against them. In Ghaziabad, the additional district magistrate is likely to preside over the process. Once the hearing is over, the file goes to the DM for a final decision. A person slapped with Goondas Act case must leave the district for a period that can’t exceed six months. The first FIR in Ghaziabad against Yati was filed in 2005 at Kavi Nagar police station for allegedly threatening a government employee. The second was in 2010 at Masuri police station on charges of abetment. A man who Yati had accused of stealing from the temple had died by suicide. Other cases were filed against him in 2014 (Niwari PS), 2016 and 2017 (Kotwali PS), 2019 (Masuri PS, after a panchayat meeting called by Yati to settle a road rage dispute turned violent) and earlier this year (at Masuri PS) for allegedly making communal remarks. In April 2021, Delhi Police filed a case against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through his remarks made at the Press Club of India. The FIR was lodged at Parliament Street police station. The Dasna temple priest said on Monday he will meet the Ghaziabad DM to present his side. “If the administration imposes Goondas Act on me, I will go on an indefinite hunger strike outside the CM’s house,” Yati said. Police, after the 2019 violence, tried to invoke Goondas Act against him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/police-want-goondas-act-against-yati-cite-firs/articleshow/87266566.cms||---

A gaushala (cowshed), operated by the Varanasi Municipal Corporation with a capacity of 300 cows is located in Shahanshapur village, Raja Talab Tehsil. It has about 30,000 cattle in the radius of 20 km with an average emission of 5 to 10 kg of cow dung. Traditionally, cow dung goes to waste due to non-use by the residents. Biomass generates greenhouse gases in the atmosphere through natural decay whereas Biogas is a green fuel and as a replacement for diesel, petrol, wood, it makes a net reduction in greenhouse gas. A fund of Rs 23 crore was invested to solve this problem and with the intention of increasing the income of the villagers, Bio-CNG plant has been constructed, which is located in Shahanshapur Gaushala premises. The plant will purchase cow dung from Shahanshapur Gaushala as well as nearby villages for it’s consumption. The production capacity of the plant is 2.5-3.0 tonnes of CNG, 25-30 tonnes of manure and 40,000 liters of liquid fertilizer per day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/pm-modi-inaugurates-smart-city-projects-of-over-rs-50crore/articleshow/87265395.cms||---
---||Delhi||Air panel project looks to tackle pollution caused by garbage dumps, waste burning||New Delhi: The Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) will start a project to control air pollution from ‘non-point dispersed sources’ in north, east and New Delhi areas from Wednesday. An official explained that while point sources of pollution were stationary sites such as power plants, non-point sources comprised diversely distributed locations like garbage dumps and waste burning. With the help of NGO Air Pollution Action Group (A-PAG), CAQM had carried out a pilot project to curb air pollution from non-point dispersed sources in South Delhi Municipal Corporation areas last December. The pilot project successfully identified 17,290 points in SDMC’s 104 wards, of which 10,900 (63%) related to the civic body and the remaining 6,400 (37%) to other agencies. SDMC was able to resolve 95% of the issues pertaining to its jurisdiction. Among the pollution sources addressed under the pilot project were garbage dump sites, overflowing dhalaos, burning of garbage, construction & demolition sites, debris dumped on public land, road dust from unpaved roads, barren lands, industrial emissions and vehicular pollution. In a statement, CAQM said, “The project envisages easy identification, allocation and resolution of air pollution-related issues arising out of a large number of non-point dispersed sources. Based on the learning from the pilot project, it is now being upscaled and replicated in North DMC, East DMC and New Delhi Municipal Council areas.” It added that after a meeting with Delhi government and municipal officials on October 21, it was decided that the project would go live from Wednesday with improved inter-agency coordination among Delhi Pollution Control Committee, nodal officers and support of other agencies concerned. A standard operating procedure has also been formulated for this purpose. CAQM said that the pilot project had focused on sanitisation exercises to help ground-level officials understand the linkages between their daily tasks and the quality of air, third party survey to identify reasons for spike in air pollution levels, ground-level reporting of resolution of such issues, and improving of review process of on-ground survey procedures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/air-panel-project-looks-to-tackle-pollution-caused-by-garbage-dumps-waste-burning/articleshow/87290370.cms||---

The inscription is in Tamil in four lines. The first line got erased and not easy to read.The inscription reads: ‘In Sathurvedhi Mangalam ruled by Sundarapandia Chakkaravarthy (the king), a person who had donated money to a Vaishnavite temple’. There is a word ‘brahmatheyam’, which means land given to brahmins, and it refers to one such land or money that was given to a Vishnu temple, he said. There are two temples in the village, a Shiva temple - Vickrama Pandeeswaramudaiya Sivankoil and Vishnu temple - Uthama Chola Vinnagalvarana Sri Vengachalapathi Perumal temple. Similar stone inscriptions are found in both the temples.From the stone inscription it is understood that Cholapuram was earlier known as Uthama Chola Sathurvedhi Mangalam. The Shiva temple was constructed during the rule of Maravarman Vikrama Pandyan (AD 1250 to AD 1278). One of the stone inscriptions at the Vishnu temple speaks of donations made for burning two types of lamps, ‘Nandha vilakku’ and ‘Sandya Vilakku’ by a man named Nallur Narayana Battar from Sathurvethi Mangalam.The villagers have decided to protect the recently-found stone inscription on the premises of the Vishnu temple, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/13th-century-stone-inscription-found-near-rajapalayam/articleshow/87265393.cms||---

They were part of a conspiracy hatched by the truck’s owner to evade repayment of his bank loan by claiming the truck was stolen, and instead sell the vehicle in the grey market. The arrested accused have been identified as Narayan Gavdekar (29), of Marsawali in Phulambri, Anil Jonwal (31), of Khandipimpalgaon in Khultabad, and Sanjay Jangale (34), of Dongargaon Shiv in Phulambri. LCB inspector Santosh Khetmalas said the preliminary probe has revealed that 29-year old Gajanan Singhal, the truck’s owner, did not intend to repay the bank loan and came up with the idea of selling the truck in the grey market. Accordingly, he hatched a conspiracy with his accomplices and moved the truck from the place it was parked. Two days later, he lodged a complaint of theft. Based on the complaint, a theft case was registered. During the course of the investigation, LCB team received a tip-off that Singhal has sent his confidante to Amravati to sell off the vehicle. Swinging into action, LCB team laid a trap and intercepted the truck.

---||Hyderabad||Huzurabad bypoll: Vote splits families as TRS, Eatala in dead heat||HUZURABAD: It’s a neck-and-neck race between veteran Eatala Rajender (BJP) and first-timer Gellu Srinivas Yadav (TRS) in Huzurabad. The contest has split voters within families right down the middle, as they weigh in on the bond with the six-term MLA vs welfare schemes of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. While in 2018 assembly polls voters picked Eatala to hand victory to TRS, now both want the same voters to dump the other. The former minister had joined BJP after being dropped from the state cabinet on allegations of land grabbing by the TRS. Voters said that though Eatala appeared to have the edge over the TRS initially, finance minister T Harish Rao, who is spearheading the campaign for the ruling party, has turned tables to bring pink party on level. As the political temperature went up, villagers point out work done in the last two months by Harish Rao: dark streets were now illuminated with streetlights, roads laid and other projects sanctioned. “Harish Rao is not only making promises, but fulfilling them. The Saidapur road was neglected for the last 15 years. Within three days of his promise, Harish Rao got a new road laid,” said Ch Navya who runs a supermarket in Jammikunta.  Those supporting Eatala are not necessarily BJP backers and those leaning towards KCR-led TRS are not that impressed with Gellu Srinivas. Congress also is trying hard to make it a triangular contest with its candidate Balmoor Venkat reaching out to almost every voter through road shows and padayatra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/vote-splits-families-as-trs-eatala-in-dead-heat/articleshow/87265402.cms||Roushan Ali

While addressing a public meeting at Mehdiganj along ring-road phase-2 package-1, after dedicating it to the nation, Modi greeted the crowd in Bhojpuri and wished the people for the forthcoming festivals, including Diwali, Bhaidooj, Dala Chhath and Dev Deepawali. He said, "Today it is 'Vikas Parva' (festival of development) as Varanasi and east UP is getting world class road infrastructure, beautified ghats, cleaner rivers Ganga and Varuna, bridges, parking site and also many facilities at Banaras Hindu University. It will generate new energy and confidence to the entire nation." "Kashi had been left in a pathetic condition and was struggling with traffic jams, pollution in river Ganga, maze of overhead wires and other problems for the past 70 years even after independence," said Modi adding, "But in the past seven years, the city witnessed a high number of development work. In absence of a ring-road the city's traffic struggled and waiting for the end of no-entry hours had become a habit for a big section. But, now the city has such a ring-road which will give direct connectivity to Prayagraj, Lucknow, Gorakhpur and many other highways. It will end problems inside the city and make commuting easy, accelerate the pace of trade and minimise the cost of transportation." "Development always remains incomplete in the lack of better infrastructure," said the PM, adding that to build world-class infrastructure, bridges are constructed on river Varuna, which will benefit the people of the district and also the carpet city of Bhadohi. The executive lounge created at Varanasi Junction will cater better facilities to passengers. "People are now experiencing the result of the work done for making river Ganga free from pollution after the modern sewage treatment plants have become operational," said the PM adding that along with the Ganga, efforts of making Varuna free from pollution by intercepting sewage discharge points and ensuring flow of clean water following it channelization have also started yielding positive results. "To boost the rural economy the produce of farmers of east UP region are being exported to different parts of the country and abroad. Facilities like cargo, packaging centres and modernisation of fruit and vegetable depots have been ensured. The bio-gas plant established here will not only generate natural gas for fuel but also produce organic fertilizers in huge quantities," said the PM. About the development projects to increase facilities for studies and research at Banaras Hindu University, Modi said that BHU has once again moved towards supremacy in the world by becoming one of the major hubs of technology and innovation. "All the development projects will help us build the Aatmanirbhar Bharat of our dreams," he said, praising the growth in production and sale in Khadi and other cottage industry products in the past seven years in Varanasi. Appealing to people once again to promote local products and get vocal for local, the PM said, "In coming Diwali everyone should prefer locally made fabrics, earthen decorative materials and other products. Local doesn't mean just a few products like 'diyas' (earthen lamps) but any product that is the result of the hard work of artisans needs the promotion of all the countrymen during the festival period." He also asked to buy locally made products from Dhanteras to Diwali to add celebrations in the life of all. "All the countrymen will have to develop the habit of buying indigenous products to boost the earning of poor artisans," he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/pm-narendra-modi-gifts-kashi-28-projects-before-diwali-says-it-is-vikas-parva/articleshow/87265404.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Goa||From a college team three years ago to now in I-League, Rajasthan United brace for fresh challenge||Panaji: Rajasthan United FC have overcome several hurdles in their short but eventful journey. In 2018, when they were still JECRC FC – a college team at Jaipur Engineering College and Research Centre – they were asked to make up the numbers at the Rajasthan state league. There were just seven teams and eight were a must to fulfil the criteria. JECRC FC reluctantly took the field, and, much to the surprise of everyone, a team that comprised of teachers and students, emerged champions. This year in the local league, Rajasthan were forced to play seven matches in eight days, sometimes with early morning or afternoon kick-offs. They finished second behind Zinc Football Academy and were fortunate to make it to the I-League qualifiers. Last Saturday, Rajasthan did the improbable by qualifying for the I-League, Indian football’s second division, ahead of more fancied names. “I have played (in the top-tier) and know that the standard of the I-League is much, much higher than second division I-League,” said coach Vikrant Sharma, formerly a goalkeeper with top teams like Dempo SC and Churchill Brothers. “I am confident that we can have more than just a decent team. Even before the qualifiers, I had spoken with the management and made it clear that we have to look beyond the qualifiers. It doesn’t make sense to be there just to make up the numbers.” In times of Covid-19 pandemic where the qualifiers and main tournament are being held, for the first time, with just a two-month gap – and no new transfer window to sign players – Rajasthan will find the I-League an entirely different ball game. Rajasthan, though, are used to such challenges, said Sharma. “We got our confirmation of a place in qualifiers just a day before the (transfer) deadline. It was tough for us to convince players that Rajasthan United have a bright chance of qualifying. “Every player wants to play in a team which has a structure, a base. But in Rajasthan, everyone knows there is no football. It was difficult to convince the players that we have a chance as good as anyone else,” said Sharma. Building a team at short notice wasn’t easy. Sharma first convinced players who were with him at Hindustan Club to join and then used contacts in Punjab to bring in eager youngsters, telling all of them, “if you want to make a future for yourself, fight and take it.” In the I-League, mere words of encouragement may not be enough. They will need financial backing too, particularly since the club does not have the luxury of choosing players from their home state. Rajasthan has no football culture. Rajasthan Armed Constabulary – their most popular club – was dominant back in the sixties and seventies, and the state hasn’t produced anyone of note since the Rajvi brothers, Magan and Chain, won plenty of hearts with RAC. “We are already in talks with some of the sponsors and looking forward not just to participate in the I-League, but develop the state players as well,” said club director Rajat Mishra. “We are looking forward to the competition. We will have a better team (than the qualifiers) and aim for a top-four spot. "Frankly speaking, I knew we would give our best in the qualifiers, but wasn’t expecting these results. We did not have a star player, no sponsors, and no support from the state association. This journey is complicated, but we are hopeful of doing well in the I-League."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/from-a-college-team-three-years-ago-to-now-in-i-league-rajasthan-united-brace-for-fresh-challenge/articleshow/87289257.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCB initiates vigilance probe into allegations of payoff to Sameer Wankhede||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has initiated a vigilance probe against its zonal director (western region) Sameer Wankhede after the personal bodyguard of a witness in the Aryan Khan drug case accused him of demanding a bribe. An affidavit by Prabhakar Sail, assigned to protect the witness K P Gosavi, cited an alleged meeting in which a payoff to Wankhede was discussed. NCB deputy director general (DDG) for the north, Gyaneshwar Singh, told TOI he was “supervising the inquiry into allegations (against Wankhede). We have taken note of the affidavit and have initiated the inquiry. It will be transparent and fair.” Singh told PTI a report was also received from NCB’s DDG for the north-west region and that it was marked to the vigilance section of the bureau. We are a professional organisation and we are open for an inquiry into any allegation against our staffers.” Wankhede refused to comment on the inquiry. Aryan Khan Case: All you need to know about allegations against NCB's Sameer Wankhede and Prabhakar Sail's claims Singh said it was too early to say if Wankhede will continue in his current post while the probe is on. Sources said the probe will involve recording statements of all witnesses in the Aryan Khan drug case, including the two produced by the NCB, K P Gosavi who claims to be a private investigator, and Manish Bhanushali, who is said to be a BJP worker. Wankhede's statements and those of his team members may also be recorded. The inquiry will also look into allegations of political interference levelled by NCP leader Nawab Malik. Sail, who made the allegation against Wankhede, has claimed he faces a threat to his life from Wankhede. He said he was made to sign blank papers by the NCB. He said his boss K P Gosavi had a meeting with Shah Rukh Khan's manager Pooja Dadlani and a man named Sam D’Souza at Lower Parel. Sail claims he overheard Gosavi discussing with D’Souza a demand for a Rs 25-crore bribe and finally settling for a payment of Rs 8 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-initiates-vigilance-probe-into-allegations-of-payoff-to-wankhede/articleshow/87266579.cms||Ahmed Ali

Video and audio clips are being shared on social media platforms as tools to hit rival candidates and influence voters. Campaigning in the two constituencies would come to an end on Tuesday evening, 72 hours before polls this time instead of the usual 48 hours because of the pandemic. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot would go on a whirlwind campaigning on Tuesday, addressing rallies at Lasadia, Jhalara and Mungana in Dhariawad and Kurabad in Vallabhnagar. The social media campaigning is expected to intensify in the last 72 hours. Polling is on October 30. In Dhariawad, an old video attributed to BJP candidate Khet Singh Meena is being widely shared to claim corruption and infighting in the party over the ticket distribution. Congressmen are claiming that the man giving interview in the short video clip is Meena, who alleged that ex-MLA Gautam Lal got the BJP nomination from Dhariawad in the 2018 election apparently in exchange for money. The late MLA’s son Kanhaiya Lal was denied BJP ticket in the bypoll. Even as Khet Singh Meena questioned the video’s authenticity, Congress bypoll manager Dharmendra Rathore has demanded clarification from the BJP leadership. “It’s the BJP candidate, not the Congress, that has levelled the charge. It, therefore, becomes even more important for the BJP to clarify its position vis-à-vis its candidate’s allegation. BJP claims to be a disciplined and clean party but its own leaders are pointing out widespread corruption in its functioning,” said Rathore. BJP candidate Meena told TOI, “I have seen the video that the Congressmen are circulating. It’s a conspiracy against me because the Congress is losing the Dhariawad bypoll. The man in the video clip is not me; I never made any charges against my party.” Similarly, in Vallabhnagar bypoll, an audio attributed to leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria wherein he is expressing exasperation over BJP not nominating a candidate of his choice—Udai Lal Dangi—in the constituency is being shared. Dangi is now RLP candidate and seeking sympathy votes for being ‘dumped’ by BJP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/parties-use-social-media-to-attack-rivals-as-campaigning-nears-end/articleshow/87265413.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It is his vision to make a medical college in every district. Earlier, UP used to have only nine medical colleges, but now PM Modi is inaugurating nine medical colleges at a time which will not only ensure best medical treatment but also give an opportunity to the youth to become doctors in huge numbers. With the construction of medical colleges, an ecosystem will also get ready,” said Mandaviya. “Lord Buddha had said that your work affects many generations and these medical colleges will become a medium of service for the coming generations,” he said. “The PM has given special focus on medical education and constituted a national medical commission. 157 medical colleges are being opened in the country,” the Union health minister said. While comparing the situation before 2014 with the present time, he said, “In 2013-14, there were only 51,000 medical UG seats but during the past seven years, 32,000 seats have increased. Similarly, there were only 31,000 PG medical seats which have now increased to 55,000.” “In Uttar Pradesh, the number of medical colleges increased to sixty six and UG seats have doubled while at the same time, PG seats have registered an 18-fold increase,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/health-budget-increased-8-folds-in-past-7-years-union-min/articleshow/87265411.cms||---

We have to simultaneously take organised measures to increase the income of farmers,” he said while addressing the 23rd convocation ceremony of Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University (VNMAU), Parbhani. Bhuse said ‘Vikel Te Pikel’ (sow that sells), an initiative started by the state government, was one of the measures aimed at improving the financial condition of farmers. “As a part of the initiative, basic infrastructure is being created for the direct sale of agricultural produce of farmers. It also aims to protect the interest of farmers from the fluctuation of market prices of agricultural yield,” he said. Hailing the farming community for ensuring uninterrupted production even during the pandemic, he underlined the need for mechanised agriculture. “The dearth of farm workers has emerged as a major issue before many farmers. In such a scenario, agricultural universities should devise handy tools and machines that can benefit farmers in accomplishing different agricultural tasks,” he said. In his convocation address, C D Mayee, the former chairman of the Agricultural Scientists Recruitment Board said climate change is a reality and it is already predicted that the worst sufferer will be the crop, animal and fish productivity. “As the climate is ever-changing, one-time adaptation response is not enough. Continuous efforts would be needed. Genetic improvements, agronomic manipulations, integrated farming approach, use of balanced natural resources and timely intervention can be helpful,” he said. Mayee also pitched for adopting new breeding technologies for development of new cultivars that could adapt to changing climate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/focus-also-on-increasing-income-of-farmers-bhuse/articleshow/87263652.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It was the TRS which sent letters to the ECI seeking postponement of the election citing surge in Covid-19 cases.” Sanjay pointed out that due to the ECI’s strict guidelines, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting was cancelled during West Bengal elections. “The BJP cancelled Modi and Amit Shah’s campaign meetings in West Bengal. How could the CM expect ECI to act as per his convenience,” he wondered. Accusing the TRS of staging a political farce at Monday’s plenary, he said the BJP will wage an all-out war against the ruling party from Huzurabad itself. “KCR had promised three acres of land for each Dalit household but went back on his promise. He also pledged to make a Dalit chief minister of the state but even that did not happen.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC reserves judgment in Dalit Bandhu case||HYDERABAD: The Telangana HC on Monday reserved its judgment in two petitions seeking continuation of Dalit Bandhu scheme regardless of the ongoing Huzurabad by-election and one petition seeking its deferment till the completion of the polls. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy, who heard the pleas, said they would pronounce their order on the issue soon. Arguing for Congress leader Bakka Judson, one of the petitioners, his counsel Sharat Kumar said it was unfair to stop an ongoing scheme in the name of bypoll and model code of conduct. “The scheme was launched much before the poll notification was issued,” he said. Putting forward the case of social activist Mallepalli Lakshmaiah, his counsel V Raghunath said the Election Commission was applying different yardsticks for different parties. He was citing the case of the Poshan Abhiyan scheme meant for women and children that was allowed by the EC in poll-bound northern states. Avinash Desai, standing counsel for the EC, said that Article 324 of the Constitution entrusted them with the task of ensuring a free and fair poll and that they were duty-bound to keep the voters away from ‘undue influences’. Speaking for the state, additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao said the government launched the scheme from Yadadri district and had been implementing it in several districts. He refuted the charge of the scheme commencing from Huzurabad as a pilot project. He replied in the affirmative to a query if the government began transferring money to the beneficiaries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-reserves-judgment-in-dalit-bandhu-case/articleshow/87265419.cms||M Sagar Kumar

The projects for Kondhwe, Dhavde and New Kopre areas are being executed by the state government’s Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP). The standing committee is considering allotment of Rs14crore for these schemes and takeover of the projects as these villages are now part of the PMC. A similar scheme is being executed for Wagholi and is likely to receive funds in the next few months. Sachin Dodake, a corporator from Warje, said, “Faster execution of water supply schemes and construction of overhead water tanks are among the various projects that should be taken up on priority,” he added. A standing committee member said, “We decided to allocate funds for Phursungi water supply scheme. Similar funds may be given for other schemes in a phased manner,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-to-allocate-funds-for-water-supply-in-merged-areas/articleshow/87265436.cms||---
---||Noida||IKEA may set up site office in Noida before Diwali||NOIDA: IKEA, the world’s largest furniture retailer headquartered in The Netherlands, is likely to set up its site office in Noida Sector 51 before Diwali. Officials in the Noida Authority informed about the company’s plans to chairperson Sanjeev Mittal, who on Monday held a review meeting about the progress of 20 big ticket projects in the city. IKEA has taken 12.3 acres from the Noida Authority to set up its first “meeting place” venture in the country. Apart from the company’s flagship store, the land would be used for commercial mixed use development — with shopping and business centres. The deal struck with IKEA was one of the costliest for the Noida Authority in its category and fetched Rs 850 crore. Mittal, also the infrastructure and industrial development commissioner of Uttar Pradesh, was told that the company had started fencing the area and would soon begin work on the site office. “Several discussions have taken place with the IKEA team over the past four months. The company is finalising its building plan and drawings for the mixed-use development,” said an official in the commercial division of the Authority. Mittal, who sought the progress reports of 20 industrial allotments, reviewed 13 of them closely. Similarly, the progress of top three institutional and commercial allotments was also presented at the meeting, which stretched well into the evening from 11am. Among other agendas taken up at the meeting, the issue of income tax and a detailed analysis of the financial plan of the heliport project in Sector 151A were also examined. The timeline of completing civil and other works in some of the industrial sectors was also discussed. Vipin Malhan, president of the Noida Entrepreneurs Association, said, “Review of big ticket investments is a good idea. But the issues and problems of existing industrial allottees who are giving employment and adding to the state’s income should be also considered. We have been highlighting the arbitrary manner under which CIC (change in constitution) charges have been introduced in Noida and Greater Noida. No other government agency is charging it.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/ikea-may-set-up-site-office-in-sector-51-before-diwali/articleshow/87266575.cms||Shalabh

Rajendra Singh Bhati, president of Rajasthan VAT steering committee of Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers Association, said due to the strike on Monday, the state government lost about Rs 32 crore revenue. The dealers have raised nine demands, including ban on illegal diesel sale, base oil or paraffin coming in form of bio diesel in the division, ban on smuggled diesel coming from Punjab and Haryana, reduction of VAT rate. Bhati said there was no price fixed by the government on bio-diesel and the fuel was sold without mixing with diesel. He said the state government increased VAT by 8% in the name of pandemic. “Since the pandemic is over and businesses have returned to almost normal level, the government should reduce rates now,” added Bhati.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/pump-dealers-on-indefinite-strike-in-8-districts/articleshow/87265422.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Allahabad||Govt defends anti-conversion law in HC, says it seeks to defend public interest||Prayagraj: The Uttar Pradesh government has vehemently defended the anti-conversion law in its affidavit before the Allahabad high court, stating that “since marriage is being used as an instrument to convert an individual’s religion against his/her will, the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021 seeks to remedy the malady”. Following a direction of the high court, the affidavit of the UP government was filed in response to the bunch of public interest litigations (PILs) challenging the said Act. Significantly, while stressing that the community interest will always prevail over the individual interest, the UP government has added that the law in challenge seeks to protect public interest and maintain public order, and safeguards the interest of the community. “When there is fear psychosis in the community at large and the community itself is endangered and succumbs to the pressure resulting in forceful conversion, it becomes necessary that the interest of the community as a whole requires protection and no microanalysis of individual interest can be looked into,” the affidavit further added before the court. It has been asserted in the affidavit that the law is identical in nature to the laws that are already in existence at least in eight states of the country. Besides Uttar Pradesh, such a law is prevalent in neighbouring countries like Nepal, Myanmar, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan also. Further, the affidavit stated that there is ample data in public record which shows that forcible conversions have in fact created a fear psycho across the entire state, which in turn has warranted the need for such legislation. Referring to the cases of a Hindu woman or a man wishing to marry a Muslim man or woman, the affidavit stated: “Even though Hindu woman wishes not to give up her faith, she will have to give up her faith in order to enter into a valid marriage and accept Islam as her faith. This will amount to forceful conversion. The position remains the same if a Hindu boy wants to marry a Muslim girl. Hindu boy will have to accept Islam.” Calling this exercise a loss of dignity, the affidavit claimed that the conversion in such cases is not exercised as a choice but on account of compulsion due to personal law intervening. Against this backdrop, the affidavit submitted that the Act just gives the relatives the power to file an FIR in cases of forceful conversion and that the Act goes on to ensure that every individual is granted an equal moral membership in the society. Lastly, the government in its reply also stressed that the petitioners are motivated by social media propagandas of ‘ghar wapasi’ and have not focussed on the legal issues. Therefore, they are misusing the process of law by filing the instant PIL and using the same as a tool for publicity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/govt-defends-anti-conversion-law-in-hc-says-it-seeks-to-defend-public-interest/articleshow/87265424.cms||---

---||Madurai||Test only in Hindi, English: Madras HC suspends central science scholarship exam||Madurai: Madras high court has suspended an aptitude test for a centrally-sponsored scholarship programme -- Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) – slated for November 7 as the examination was to be held only in English and Hindi.The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice M Duraiswamy ordered the postponement of the test while hearing a plea which sought the exam in all regional languages. The court also sought a response from the Centre on the steps taken to conduct the exam in multiple Indian languages.Rejecting the Centre’s submission that it does not have adequate personnel to assess answers given in various languages and that it may be difficult to find an equivalent term in local languages for scientific words and terminologies, the judges said: “it would not do for the Centre to say that it does not have qualified assessors to appreciate the material put up by non-Hindi and English-speaking aspirants. If at all, it is the deficiency with the Centre and young aspirants from non-Hindi and non-English speaking belts in the country should not suffer on such grounds.”KVPY is a National Program of Fellowship in Basic Sciences funded by the department of Science and Technology, government of India. The main objective of the exam is to identify students with talent and aptitude for research, to help them realize their academic potential and to encourage them to take up research careers in science by providing fellowships.Even if it is a token scholarship of Rs5,000, it amounts to recognition of a young mind and every Indian of such age should be entitled to equally participate in the process and exhibit their talent, said the court while hearing a PIL filed by G Thirumurugan of Ramanathapuram.It is possible for a bright young mind groomed in Assamese vernacular or another young prospect from deep in rural Odisha to be able to come up with brilliant ideas that the KVPY project aspires to tap into. Merely because the aspirant may not be adept at Hindi or English languages may not amount to the aspirant being disqualified, observed the judges. The PIL-petitioner stated that conducting the exam only in English and Hindi would do injustice for the students studying in the other mediums of instructions. Hence, the petitioner sought to conduct the KVPY exam in all the regional languages, including Tamil. The case was adjourned by a fortnight and it was posted before the principal bench at Chennai for further hearing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/test-only-in-hindi-english-madras-hc-suspends-central-science-scholarship-exam/articleshow/87265417.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Aurangabad||MVA govt failed to pay its share towards crop insurance: Devendra Fadnavis||AURANGABAD: Devendra Fadnavis, the leader of the opposition, on Monday alleged that the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has not yet paid its share of Rs 1,600 crore towards the disbursement of crop insurance in Maharashtra. “The Union minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad recently held a meeting with crop insurance firms amid massive crop damage in Marathwada and other parts of the state. During the meeting, the insurance firms told that the state government still has not paid its share of the money,” he said. Fadnavis said the alleged apathy by the state government during the time of natural calamity has deprived scores of farmers of availing the help amounting to Rs 4,000 crore through crop insurance. Addressing an election rally at Kundalwadi in poll-bound Deglur assembly constituency in Nanded district, Fadnavis also levelled corruption charges against the state government. “The ruling party functionaries focus on gathering money and have no time to pay any heed to the woes of public. The only achievement of the MVA government in the past two years is that it has stayed a range of schemes and programmes of public welfare initiated during our rule,” he said. Meanwhile, Public Works Department minister of Maharshtra and Congress functionary Ashok Chavan has criticised the BJP for fielding the candidate for the October 30 election. “BJP should have realise that it is not any usual election, but the one which is taking place after the death of a public leader,” he said while addressing an election rally in Deglur assembly seat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/mva-govt-failed-to-pay-its-share-towards-crop-insurance-fadnavis/articleshow/87263660.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Will back BJP in UP, Uttarakhand: New Akhara Parishad chief Mahant Ravindra Puri||PRAYAGRAJ: Soon after being elected as the new president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), Mahant Ravindra Puri of Niranjani Akhara made it clear that “ABAP would put all its weight behind the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in ensuring that Yogi Adityanath is the next chief minister of the state and that BJP wins the next general elections also”. “Jo (political party) Ram ke sath hai, akhara parishad uske sath hai (Those who are with Ram, Akhara Parishad is with them),” said Puri. He added, “Agar sanatan dharm ko bachana hai, to Yogi ko dobara lana hai (If Sanatan dharm is to be saved, then Yogi has to be brought back again).” Speaking about the executive body constituted by an ABAP faction in a meeting at Haridwar, he said, “A ‘farzi’ (fake) executive body has been made at Haridwar because when the general secretary had already scheduled a meeting of ABAP for October 25 at Prayagraj, why was another meeting held? It is a common practice in parishad that in case of the untimely death of the president, the members of the same akhara becomes president.” “I have become the president with the support of all the akharas. We also have a majority on the basis of numbers. Other than this, no election is valid. I will complete the unfinished work of Mahant Narendra Giri,” Ravindra Puri said. “We want to make UP an Uttar Pradesh and we will ensure that BJP wins elections in UP, Uttarakhand and at the Centre,” he said. Mahant Hari Giri, said, “The new president has been elected according to the rules, law and tradition of the ABAP and those who did not come due to any reason, it is expected that they will attend the next meeting scheduled for November 25.” Mahant Resham Singh of Nirmal Akhara said, “The court has recognized me as the president of Nirmal Akhara and apart from me, those who have gone to any meeting from Nirmal Akhara do not have any validity and if necessary, legal action will be taken against such people.” Incidentally, representatives of Nirmal Akhara supported the second faction of ABAP, which held a meeting at Haridwar early this month. Shrimant Someshvaranand of Agni Akhara said, “The election conducted in Haridwar is arbitrary and against tradition. We reject that choice. If necessary, legal action will be taken against them.” However, general secretary of the second faction of the ABAP, Shri Mahant Rajendra Das, said: “The election of the Akhara Parishad was held on October 21. The seers of all the akharas have got representation in the meeting and the election conducted in Shree Niranjani Akhara, Prayagraj (on Monday) is illegal and has no recognition.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/will-ensure-bjp-win-in-next-polls-says-new-abap-chief/articleshow/87265438.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Drugs case: 'Elusive' NCB witness surfaces, denies extortion charges||MUMBAI: Prabhakar Sail, bodyguard to witness in the drug bust case K P Gosavi, was given police protection by the MVA government a day after he filed an affidavit levelling serious allegations, including a payoff to NCB zonal chief Sameer Wankhede, in the cruise liner drug raid that led to the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan. In another development, Gosavi, who had gone into hiding since NCP minister Nawab Malik said he had criminal cases registered against him, surfaced on Monday and denied all allegations, including those of extortion. Gosavi was quoted by ANI as saying he would surrender "in half an hour outside Maharashtra". He also denied meeting Shah Rukh's manager Pooja Dadlani-one of the claims made by Sail. ‘Selfie with Aryan taken at terminal, not NCB office’Sources said he was asked to approach Sahar police station, under whose jurisdiction he stays. Sahar police said they are looking into the complaint.On Monday, Sail visited the Mumbai police headquarters to lodge a complaint. Sources said he was asked to approach Sahar police station, under whose jurisdiction he stays. Sahar police said they are looking into the complaint. Gosavi, for his part, clarified that the selfie with Aryan Khan that had gone viral after the October 2 raid was taken on the cruise terminal and not at the NCB office. He said he had received information about the drugs racket from a source and had informed the NCB. He said there was a threat to his life. Gosavi, who claims to run a private detective agency, is one of nine independent witnesses in the case. There are offences of cheating registered against him in Thane and Pune. Pune police had recently issued a lookout circular against him in connection with a 2018 cheating case. Aryan Khan Case: All you need to know about allegations against NCB's Sameer Wankhede and Prabhakar Sail's claimsIn an interview to electronic media, Gosavi said he was very much available in Mumbai till October 6, but as he started getting threat calls from unknown numbers, he had to go into hiding. Recalling the sequence of events of the NCB raid, he said that as he got information on the drugs, he passed it on to NCB officials, and when he went to the cruise, he first met NCB superintendent VV Singh and later met Wankhede. Until then he did not know about Wankhede, he said. In the early hours of October 3, Sail claimed that while escorting Gosavi, he overheard him discussing a demand of Rs 25 crore and his willingness to “settle” at Rs 18 crore, of which Rs 8 crore was to be allegedly paid to Wankhede. Meanwhile, TOI visited Adarsh building in Waghbil area of Thane, where Gosavi used to live. A security guard there said, “Gosavi was living as a tenant on the second floor for a couple of months. He used to come with a woman and a bodyguard in an SUV, which had a metal plate with ‘police’ written on it. He mostly used to come late in the night and kept changing vehicles, but with the ‘police’ plate inside.” TOI visited another flat at Channel Apartment in Sector 28, Vashi, which was locked. A security guard said, “Gosavi came to stay with his wife in the flat at Block 1 in September. Since the time Gosavi’s name flashed on news channels, he stopped visiting the flat. A bodyguard used to accompany him.” - With inputs from Nishikant Karlikar and George Mendonca||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-selfie-with-aryan-taken-at-terminal-not-ncb-office/articleshow/87266599.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Allahabad||Mahant Ravindra Puri of Niranjani Akhara elected new chief of ABAP||Prayagraj: Secretary of Shri Panchayati Akhara Niranjani, Mahant Ravindra Puri has been elected as the new president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), the apex decision-making body of the 13 Hindu monastic orders of the country. The election was necessitated after the death of Mahant Narendra Giri, whose body was found hanging in a room of the Baghambari Math in the city on September 20. Puri was elected as the new president of ABAP in a meeting of the seers, called by general secretary of ABAP, Hari Giri, who is also the chief patron of the Juna Akhara, here on Monday. Of the 13 akharas (Hindu religious orders) of the country, representatives of seven akharas had come for the meeting. With the absence of six akharas, it is evident that ABAP now stands divided into two groups. Besides the seven akharas that attended the meet, Puri also claimed to have a written support of another akhara, Shri Panch Nirmohi Ani Akhara. Ravindra Puri was elected as the president of ABAP till 2025 when the tenure of late Narendra Giri’s tenure would have been over. Puri has the support of seven akharas whose representatives attended the meeting. As per the practice, two members from each 13 akharas are members of ABAP. Earlier, owing to rifts within ABAP, seers of seven Akharas had held a meeting at Haridwar on October 21 and elected Mahant Ravindra Puri of Mahanirvani Akhara as the president of ABAP. Akharas including Mahanirvani, Atal, Nirmohi Ani, Nirvani Ani, Digambar Ani, Bada Akhara Udasin and Nirmal Akhara attended the meeting. A new executive committee was formed in the meeting held at the premises of Shri Mahanirvani Akhara, Kankhal, Haridwar. Besides Ravindra Puri, the president of Nirmohi Ani Akhara, Shri Mahant Rajendra Das was elected general secretary. Along with them, Damodar Das Maharaj was appointed as vice-president, Jaswinder Singh Shastri as treasurer, Ram Kishore Das Maharaj as secretary, Gaurishankar Das maharaj as spokesperson and Dharamdas Maharaj and Maheshwar Das as patron in the new executive. However, ABAP general secretary, Hari Giri of Juna Akhara, has termed the said election as “a malicious attempt to divide the ABAP” and had not recognized the same. “I had already called for a meeting of ABAP for October 25. If these akharas had any intention to prove their majority, they should have attended the meeting and elected their leader. After all, ABAP elects its office-bearers in a democratic manner. Why shy away from contesting the elections as every member of ABAP has the right to stand for president of any other post?” said Hari Giri. It has been in practice at ABAP that the meeting of the parishad is held only when summoned by the general secretary. Monday’s meeting was held with a single point agenda, i.e., electing the new president. A meeting of the Akhara Parishad will be called again after three months to select the rest of the executive members. “I am happy that the seers have given me the responsibility of leading them and I will not disappoint them. There were representatives from seven akharas who have voted for me and I also have the support letter from one more akhara as such I have support of eight akharas and there will be efforts from my side to bring the others back to the Akhara Parishad,” said Ravindra Puri. President of Shankracharya Parishad, Varanasi, Mahant Anand Swaroop, while welcoming the decision of the Akhara Parishad said, “I am confident that under Ravindra Puri, ABAP will serve the cause of the seers in the country and he would bring all the 13 akharas under one umbrella.” Important box item The newly elected ABAP president Ravindra Puri of the Niranjani Akhara has the support of eight akharas of the country that follow the ‘Shaiva’ (sannyasin) tradition. These akharas are: Juna Akhara (the largest in terms of number of seers as members), Niranjani, Nirmal, Agni, Avahan, Anand and Naya Udasin. Besides, Puri also has the written support of Shri Panch Nirmohi Ani Akhara.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/mahant-ravindra-puri-of-niranjani-akhara-elected-new-chief-of-abap/articleshow/87265451.cms||---

Liquor is banned in Bihar. The police recovered the bodies on Monday morning when the family members were preparing for their cremation. Later, the bodies were handed over to the families after postmortem. An investigating officer said the body of one of the victims was seized from the pyre at Mairitand Ghat. The deceased, Dukhharan Ram (60), Manoj Ram (30) and Anwar Miyan (50) belonged to Belauri village while Shivaji Yadav (45) was from the neighbouring Belour. The relatives of Dukhharan and Anwar told the police officials that they complained of pain in abdomen, vomiting and nausea soon after reaching home late Sunday evening. “The four were in an inebriated condition and rushed to a nearby private nursing home where they died,” family members of the deceased claimed. The local residents said the police recovered the bodies after someone informed them about their death due to hooch. Siwan DM Amit Kumar Pandey and SP Abhinav Kumar visited the villages on Monday. The DM told the media that the postmortem report was awaited. “Further action will be initiated on the basis of the autopsy report. The SP has been asked to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter,” he told this newspaper over phone. SP Kumar said the statements of the victims’ kin have been recorded. “They say the victims had consumed liquor,” Kumar added. A medical team also visited the villages and examined the health of the residents on Monday. “Medical screening is being done on the DM’s directive,” a senior police officer said. Some residents accused Garhani police station SHO Rajesh Kumar of being hand in glove with the liquor smugglers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/spurious-liquor-claims-4-lives-in-2-siwan-villages/articleshow/87264542.cms||Ramashankar

The staff at the shelters needs to continue following the Covid protocol irrespective of the decrease in the number of cases,” said an official. According to guidelines issued by state child commission earlier this year after several children tested positive, apart from setting up of separate ward for Covid-infected children, the district administration needs to ensure all children hospitals/wards have adequate facilities like ventilators, oxygen cylinders and medical staff. The districts had complied with the guidelines. Recently, the child panel had written to the district administrations and health officials to ensure that there are adequate arrangements for children to deal with dengue cases which are being reported across the state.

The idea of moving away from the main body was simmering since the Haridwar Kumbh early this year when three akharas boycotted the ABAP on the issue of land allotment. These three ‘Ani’ akhara’s had not attended the ‘shodashi’ of Mahant Narendra Giri on October 5. The three akharas were of the ‘Bairagi sect’, namely Nirvani, Digambhar and Nirmohi. Later, on October 15, general secretary of the ABAP, Hari Giri announced that a meeting of ABAP would be held on October 25 at Prayagraj to elect the new president in place of Narendra Giri. However, another meeting was held at Haridwar on October 20, which was attended by seven akharas — Nirmohi, Nirvani, Digamber, Mahanirvani, Atal, Bada Udasin and Nirmal. The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad was formed in 1954. “This is not for the first time that there has been a rift between the ABAP as the same as in 1974, 1984, 1998 and 2010. We had differences of opinion, but we again stood united and the same would be in 2021,” said general secretary of the ABAP, Hari Giri.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/split-in-abap-evident-as-6-akharas-skip-meet/articleshow/87265447.cms||---

The family of the farmer, Raees Khan, said that he was shocked when he saw the paddy crop that he had planted in his 10 bigha land completely submerged. He suffered a heart attack and fell down. His family later found his body in the field. Khan’s cousin said that he was a heart patient and was suffering from severe stress during the paddy season. Incessant rainfall has affected paddy crops of many farmers in the region. The cumulative loss suffered by the farmers is still being tabulated, officials said. Meanwhile, speaking to TOI on Monday, Shahbad station house officer Sanjay Tomar, under whose jurisdiction the area where the incident took place falls, said, “The family did not inform us about his death. If they approach us, we will take appropriate steps to assist them. We came to know about the incident from the local villagers.” On whether the farmer was under pressure to repay any loan, Shahbad tehsildar Dinesh Kumar said, “We are trying to ascertain this fact. As of now, we are not aware if he had taken a loan. If his family follows the autopsy procedure and other formalities, then they may get some financial support under the relevant government scheme.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/up-farmer-60-faints-dies-of-heart-attack-after-seeing-paddy-crop-destroyed-by-rain/articleshow/87263695.cms||Maria Khan

---||India||Doctors wary of case spike overwhelming medical infra||NEW DELHI: Low incidence of Covid-19 has made people more confident. They are going out, meeting people and shopping. It's good. What is bad is the lack of adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour. Public health experts are alarmed at the level of complacency being seen in the public, most of whom are venturing out with little or no concern about maintaining social distance and often without wearing masks properly. "Our fever OPD is running full. Over the past two weeks, we have been getting 200-250 cases of febrile illness daily. Most of them are caused by vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria. If the Covid-19 cases also start to surge, the situation would become unmanageable," said Dr Suresh Kumar, director of Lok Nayak Hospital. He stressed on the need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and full vaccination against the viral infection. Dr HS Chhabra, medical director of Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, said with the festive season beginning last month, there had been a relative increase in the number of people showing Covid-19 symptoms. "This is an additional cause for concern since dengue cases are also on rise. Covid-19 cases are on the rise in China, Russia and the UK. This is no time to let our guard down. We urge people to continue to remain vigilant and follow all Covid protocols," he added. The founder of Genestrings Diagnostic, Dr Gauri Agarwal, said the virus would continue to mutate and survive. "With vaccines, we have a means to prevent the infection. It's very positive that we recently completed the vaccination of 100 crore people. But a lot of people are just vaccinated with only one dose and unvaccinated elderly and children are still at risk," she added. Dr Shashank Joshi, endocrinologist and member, Maharashtra Covid-19 Task Force, also warned against any complacency. "It is still mandatory to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour with double masking, very strong surveillance, including self-testing and prompt isolation and contact tracing. Particularly with the return-to-the-workplace trend and more so the upcoming festive season, it is essential to stay vigilant and get ahead of worrying Covid-19 trends. Central to this are vaccination, timely disease detection, and sustained Covid-appropriate behaviour and precautions," he added. Highlighting the identification of delta strain derivatives worldwide, including a new mutation called AY4.2 in the UK, Joshi said it had been seen in India too. Delhi witnessed a massive surge in Covid-19 cases in April and May, which led to the loss of more than 13,000 lives. On May 3, 448 fatalities were recorded, the highest in a single day since the outbreak. "The second wave sent shudders down everyone's spine. If we really don't want to see a repeat of that nightmare, then the least we can do is wear a mask properly," said Gaurav Thukral, COO of Healthcare at Home.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doctors-wary-of-case-spike-overwhelming-medical-infra/articleshow/87267122.cms||---

In the audio, the cop can be heard offering 3kg of the illegal substance to the woman with a condition that she would not sell it within the police station limits, but in Baghpat city. Singh can also be heard saying, "There is strict checking and your name has already cropped up as one of the peddlers so don't sell in this region. Take it in the evening. I also need money." The cop was posted at Singhawali Aheer police station in Baghpat. When contacted, Baghpat SP, Neeraj Jadaun, said, "We are aware of the viral audio. It came to our notice on Friday itself and we are taking swift action. The accused constable has been suspended and a departmental inquiry has been set up against him." A search is also on for the woman who has been called as 'Arshi' in the audio. Notably, Baghpat is a border district with Haryana and seizure of narcotics is common in the region. According to police sources, the substance in question is very much part of the confiscated material which was being released by the cop in the open market. The sources further said that an audit will now take place of the substance kept in store rooms of various police stations in the district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/viral-audio-exposes-drug-nexus-in-baghpat-constable-suspended/articleshow/87264561.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Mumbai||Sameer Wankhede forged caste cert for job: Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik on Monday made fresh allegations against NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, saying he had submitted forged documents to secure his present job. Malik claimed Wankhede got a job in the IRS as an SC candidate by forging and tampering with documents to get a caste certficate. Malik shared two things on his Twitter handle: an old picture of Wankhede’s saying ‘Pahchan Kaun’ and a birth certificate issued by the BMC. About the certificate, he wrote, “Yahase Shuru Hota Hai Farjiwada (Fraudulent activities begin from securing a birth certificate).” On the purported certificate, Wankhede’s name has been mentioned as Sameer Dawood Wankhede, while on the NCB’s official website, Malik said, it has been mentioned as Sameer Dhyandev Wankhede. In a related development, home minister Dilip Walse Patil said the Mumbai police have given full protection to witness Prabhakar Sail, who made allegations against Wankhede on Sunday. NCP president and water resources minister Jayant Patil said the state government will take appropriate steps in view of the information disclosed by Malik. Wankhede denied all the charges, saying that the publishing of his personal documents on Twitter was defamatory in nature and was an unnecessary invasion of his family’s privacy. Wankhede’s father also spoke to the media on Monday, saying his name is Dyaneshwar Wankhede, and Sameer is his son and he never used Dawood as his name. “Whoever is claiming that a false certificate has been submitted is false,” he said. Malik said, “We are sure the competent authority, the caste scrutiny panel, will verify documents and take appropriate action.” Malik was the first to raise questions over the credibility of independent witness KP Gosavi and Manish Bhunushali. He said Gosavi was wanted in four cases, while Bhanushali was a BJP activist. Further, Malik had said Wankhede’s family friend Fletcher Patel was a witness in four cases. Reacting to Malik’s statements on Twitter, Wankhede said his father Dnyandev Wankhede retired as senior inspector from the state excise department on June 30, 2007. “My father is a Hindu and my mother late Zaheeda was a Muslim. I belong to a composite, multi-religious and secular family in (the) true Indian tradition and I am proud of my heritage. I married Shabana Qureshi in 2006 and divorced mutually in 2016. Later, I married Kranti Dinanath Redkar in 2017,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maliks-latest-wankhede-forged-caste-cert-for-job-in-mumbai/articleshow/87266606.cms||---

The panchayat will be educating around 4,500 people from fifteen wards. The target age group is from 14 to 65. The campaign aims at teaching the basic usage of smartphones and its applications, including WhatsApp, Google Pay, Phone Pay and Google Meet. The brand ambassador of the programme is film actor Suraj Venjaramoodu. A few people above 65 years of age will also be participating in the training programme considering their interest. The Kerala Technical University (KTU) will provide the technical support. They have also helped in designing the evaluation modules and tools. The panchayat has selected two wards Vellumannadi and Koonanvenga for the pilot training programme. The training has been completed in the two wards. Other wards will also begin the campaign soon. The evaluation methods will be finalized after discussing with the KTU. The training is divided into three modules: Basic phone training, training on WhatsApp, Google Meet, Phone Pe and Google Pay. Sajna Sathar, Sanoop, Dinesh Pappan form the core team which is being running the campaign. They have also contributed in making the modules. Local volunteers and NSS volunteers from various engineering colleges have joined together for the campaign. The volunteers will be visiting the target audience, who are divided into clusters, at their houses and educate them to use smartphones and its applications. Prior to the campaign, a survey was conducted to determine how many people are digitally literate and illiterate. MLA D K Murali has officially launched the survey. “We saw people coming to the only bank of the panchayat merely to check their bank balance. In this digital world where everything is available at their fingertips, people wasting their money on auto to come to the bank make us think of something innovative. They didn’t get an opportunity to learn it. So, we have decided to give them digital literacy. We were surprised with the number of participants who came forward, which exceeded our expectations,” said P V Rajesh, Pullampara panchayat president. “We have got so many positive comments and people were supportive. Most of the elderly people came to us seeking for the tutorial,” said Shamnad Pullampara, programme coordinator.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/panchayat-launches-drive-to-ensure-digital-literacy/articleshow/87264574.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa will achieve 100% household electrification by year-end: Power minister Nilesh Cabral||PANAJI: Power minister Nilesh Cabral said on Wednesday that Goa would achieve 100% household electrification by the end of this year. “My concern has been households in certain villages that were without power supply for very long,” he told TOI. “Initially, 250 households in Goa did not have electricity. So far, we have given connections to 150, and 100 will be given soon.” The proposal will be put before the cabinet shortly, and after the cabinet approval, a contractor will start the work, the power minister said. “The houses that are without electricity are located all over the hinterlands,” he said. The problem arose due to the houses’ inaccessibility from the grid. “In such cases, the process of giving electricity connections is a lengthy process. Those houses are in the remotest parts of the state, mostly in forested areas,” he said. The electricity department has provided such houses with basic plug points through renewable energy sources. “That’s how we are dealing with the problem,” he said. Another area his ministry has been working on, he said, is solar energy projects. Starting from zero, he said they installed 20 solar rooftops within two years. More plans are in the offing. “We are looking at the renewable energy sector,” he said. “We will shortly come out with an open access policy, and after cabinet approval, an expression of interest will be floated,” he said. Under the open access policy, he said, an entity or an individual will be allowed to sell solar energy generated by him to whoever he wants, but will be required to provide the government an equal quantum of usage during peak time. “Anybody will be able to have a solar installation and invest in battery storage,” he said. “During the day, a generator of solar energy will be able to use the electricity department’s grid for free and supply to any consumer, but (will have to) supply 50% to the government between 6pm and 11pm. They will be acting on our terms and conditions.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-will-achieve-100-household-electrification-by-year-end-cabral/articleshow/87266169.cms||Bindiya Chari

---||Kochi||‘No lapses in reconstruction of airport road’||Thiruvananthapuram: Public works department (PWD) minister P A Mohamed Riyas ruled out lapses in the reconstruction of Shangumugham-Airport Road, while answering a query in the assembly here on Monday. The minister said that the work was being done on an emergency basis braving adverse weather conditions and was expected to be completed by April 2022. The agreement for the construction of a diaphragm wall measuring 245m was signed in August 2020. However, the work could begin only in October 2020. Owing to the cyclone, the guide walls were washed away and the earth accumulated on the shore was taken in by the sea. The minister said that unlike in the past, Shangumugham experiences frequent sea erosion. When the sea turned calm, the work resumed by September-end. However, smooth progress of work has been impeded by constant erosion. The diaphragm wall is being constructed as per the design of the central road research institute. Earlier in September, minister for transport Antony Raju had directed the officials to complete the work within four months. The minister said this during his visit to the site to assess the progress of the construction. The government had allotted Rs 6.39 crore under the Rebuild Kerala initiative for the project. Raju had even directed the officials to prepare an estimate for extending the length of the diaphragm wall from 245m to 330m. The work has been delayed for months as the earth brought for transportation got swept away in the strong waves. Passengers arriving at the airport have been bearing the brunt of the delay in completion of the work. They are being forced to walk with heavy baggage for a fairly good distance till they are able to get a taxi or auto to take them to their destination. The coastal residents are also having their share of concerns as this stretch was their main link between the coastal villages and city markets. As the road has been blocked for months owing to the damaged condition, residents have been on a protest mode.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/no-lapses-in-reconstruction-of-airport-road/articleshow/87264580.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They said it will help them prioritise areas which would require immediate attention for reopening and apportioning resources. It will also help them plan for internal and semester-end examinations scheduled in November and December. “We welcome the decision of the government to reopen campuses. We are waiting for the government notification and the standard operating procedure on how the reopening will happen,” said Swami Ekachittananda, principal of Ramakrishna MissionVidyamandira. Many principals said they were already carrying out sanitisation and cleaning of the campuses as the offices are open and many staff members attend on rotation basis. “We are ready and can reopen the campus in a few days’ notice. But we need to know how the government wants us to resume on campus activities. Our infrastructure is ready, and sanitisation is taking place on a regular basis since many of us come to college every day. We are waiting for government’s instructions on which departments will be reopened first and how many students can attend on-campus classes among other things,” said Swami Kamalasthananda, principal of Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara. Subhasis Dutta, principal of Maulana Azad College said that it was the need of the hour to reopen campuses, but everybody needs to safeguard against the virus. “We are relieved that finally a decision has been taken to reopen colleges. It has come at the right time and in the interest of the students. All of us must be cautious and safeguard against the virus and the colleges can be opened in phases with those with laboratory work and exams in near future getting priority,” said Dutta. Schools and colleges had shut down in March 2020 owing to the pandemic. Earlier this year the government allowed reopening of educational institutes in a phased manner, but second wave struck and all schools and colleges had to be shut down. In October the state government arranged for vaccination of college and university students. Principal of another college said the government must also issue clear instructions if vaccination was mandatory for attending on-campus classes. “This will give students time to get the vaccination before colleges reopen next month,” said a principal of a north Kolkata college. Many principals, however, raised the issue of local suburban trains in absence of which students from the districts won’t be able to travel to the city to attend classes. “Large number of students in Kolkata colleges come from the suburbs but if local trains are not allowed to run how will they attend classes? The issue must be addressed before campuses reopen next month to prevent confusion,” said principal of a south Kolkata College.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/students-raring-to-return-to-campus-after-20-month-break-varsities-wait-for-sop/articleshow/87265468.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Deokar said, “We shall expand the campaign to other colleges. If the colleges where the drive was held earlier want further extension, it would be done. For Tuesday, we have around 8-10 colleges lined up for the vaccination drive.” He said Covaxin was being preferred for the beneficiaries getting the first dose because of its earlier second dose deadline. Experts recommended giving more attention to the completion of the second dose with the vaccination reaching almost the peak point for the first dose beneficiaries.

The course will start before November 14. The college will be admitting 30 eligible students above 18 years old. They should have a medical certificate proving their disability. The classes will be from 10am to 3pm. The programme includes both practical as well as theoretical topics. The theoretical syllabus includes how to grow and protect plants. Yoga, exercises, watering plants, hug the tree, and indoor activities like craft and flower arrangement are part of the practical curriculum. One hour will be set aside daily for students to grow a plant that has been given to them. “We have received applications from different categories of disabled people. The course will assist students in raising their living standards. It will have a therapeutic effect on them. We will not compel any of the students to participate in outdoor activities. Instead, we will provide extra indoor activities for those who are not yet ready to touch the soil,” said Beela G K, the course coordinator. “The limitations of the students can be a challenge; for example, a visually disabled person cannot readily care for a plant. Similarly, intellectually challenged students are unable to understand information about plants and how to care for them. However, we have experienced faculties to deal with them,” said Beela. The activities can also have a therapeutic influence on each person’s mental and physical health. They will learn how to develop vegetables and fruit gardens, as well as how to save and grow seeds and saplings. They will also be studying flower arrangement and plant-based crafts. They will engage in therapeutic activities like meditation, hug the tree and watering the plant.  The course can be customized for each individual.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/college-to-train-disabled-students-in-horticulture/articleshow/87264595.cms||---

---||Pune||Closure of road & re-routing to prevent traffic snarls in Wagholi||Pune: The city traffic police department has proposed vehicular restrictions on the Wagholi stretch of the Pune-Ahmednagar highway and intensified action against illegal parking to prevent frequent traffic snarls in the area. The traffic police have closed the road stretch from Avhalwadi chowk to Lohegaon on an experimental basis and invited suggestions and objections on the initiative. The road closure is unlikely to hamper vehicular movement as alternative roads are available for commuters, said officials. Regular travellers and local residents have been complaining about traffic mess on the Ahmednagar highway in Wagholi area. They said that travelling during rush hours has become an ordeal because of the unregulated traffic. Vishwas Raskar, a regular traveller, said that the entire road stretch has openings at many places through which riders take turns from anywhere they want. “The road has become free for turning or crossing. This slows down the traffic flow. Those who do not want to halt at Wagholi or in nearby areas face a lot of delays,” Raskar said. Local activists and representatives of political parties recently held meetings with the civic authorities and traffic department to work out possible solutions. Jayvant Patil, assistant police inspector, Lokikand traffic division, said, “A road has been closed for vehicles at Avhalwadi chowk. The closure has reduced traffic-related issues to some extent. We are discussing the issue with local stakeholders. Suggestion / objections have been invited. A final decision on re-routing traffic will be taken after taking all aspects into consideration.” Local shopkeepers from Avhalwadi chowk-Lohegaon road have raised objection to the road closure, claiming that it could hamper their business. The traders have said that road closure cannot be a permanent solution.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/closure-of-road-re-routing-to-prevent-traffic-snarls-in-wagholi/articleshow/87265500.cms||---
---||Noida||This year too, only green crackers allowed for Diwali in Noida||NOIDA: In a meeting with development authorities and the forest and pollution departments on Monday ahead of the festival season that is accompanied by a spike in pollution levels, GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY DM issued instructions to ensure that all construction sites are taking dust-control measures. The traffic police and RTO were also directed to keep vehicular pollution in check. “With the festivals coming and the air quality remaining poor due to the weather changes, we hope that local sources don’t add to the pollution levels in Noida. The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) and the forest department will keep a close watch and monitor everything,” said the DM. According to SC orders, only green crackers, bought from authorised vendors, can be used in the region for two hours. However, if the AQI remains ‘poor’ or worse, bursting of any kind of crackers will be prohibited. UPPCB officials said vendors can apply to police for licences for green crackers, which are expected to be issued soon. A place for sale and number of licensees will be fixed by police two or three days before Diwali after monitoring AQI levels. Officials said licences are usually given at the last moment to discourage people from bursting crackers. Meanwhile, Sunday’s showers improved the air quality index in both Noida and Greater Noida, from 174 and 164, respectively, to 150 (moderate) and 90 (satisfactory) on Monday. “According to the weather forecast, the wind speed is expected to be good till Wednesday, which will help in dispersal of pollutants. We have to be cautious after that. With the festivals starting, people need to ensure that norms are followed. We have had a good October for a change,” said Utsav Sharma, the regional officer, UPPCB. AQI levels in October usually dip to ‘poor’. However, they have remained low this year due to an extended monsoon, which has also delayed stubble burning.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/this-yr-too-only-green-crackers-allowed-for-diwali-in-noida/articleshow/87266621.cms||---
---||Pune||Pilonidal cyst cases surge in students during pandemic||PUNE: Long sitting hours have led to a significant rise of pilonidal sinus disease among students, primarily adolescents, during the Covid-19 pandemic, doctors from Pune, Mumbai and Surat have confirmed. A pilonidal sinus/cyst is a type of abscess appearing near the top of the buttocks. It occurs when hair is forced into the skin, leading to the infection in the area. Pain over the tailbone, blood or pus discharge and swelling over the tailbone are the common symptoms. Pune-based colorectal surgeon Ashwin Porwal said, “Almost 56% of the 203 patients that we treated during the pandemic (from April 2020 to September 2021) were students. This indicates a sharp rise in the incidence of pilonidal sinus among students, mainly adolescents and those pursuing higher education, in the last 18 months.” The ideal treatment for a pilonidal sinus varies according to the clinical presentation of the disease. “For acute pilonidal abscess, we focus more on conservative management, while surgical management is required in chronic and complex or recurring disease,” Porwal said. Surat-based proctologist Gaurang Desai said, “We are seeing a rising trend of pilonidal sinus cases in last one year. It can be attributed to work from home or online teaching that adds to the screen time.” “Recently, I operated few students with recurrent disease,” said senior surgeon Girish Hatalkar who practices in South Mumbai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pilonidal-cyst-cases-surge-in-students-during-pandemic/articleshow/87265493.cms||Umesh Isalkar

I want to inform the Enforcement Directorate and BJP leaders, who are playing the game of ED…that Sam D’Souza is the biggest money-laundering player of Mumbai and country. It is said that he launders money for political leaders and IAS and IPS officers. It’s a big game which has just started. Under deshbhakti pretext, some people are extorting money, filing fake cases,” claimed Sena MP Sanjay Raut. He added that a short video was circulating on social media of D’Souza at the time of the raid. Hinting that more details would tumble out, he tweeted, “Wait and watch...So far, Malik has told the story of a cinema till interval. I will tell the story after the interval.” Calling Sail a deshbhakt, Raut added: “....He has exposed everyone in the NCB and officials involved in it. He is a deshbhakt who has exposed some who are carrying out extortion under the guise of deshbhakti.” On the denial of allegations of payoffs by NCB’s Sameer Wankhede, Raut said “a thief never calls himself a thief”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sena-targets-ncb-alleges-extortion-money-laundering-in-cruise-drug-case/articleshow/87266631.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Kolkata||Pricey fuel keeps majority of private buses off Kolkata roads||KOLKATA: Costlier diesel elbowed out ‘60% of private buses’ from roads, crippling the public transport in the city and other parts of the state. The number of cabs has also dropped significantly, forcing people to opt for auto or bike-cabs, which in turn pushed up the commuting expense four to five times the bus fares. Diesel price in Kolkata is all set to cross a century mark. When the government announced lockdown in March 2020, the diesel price was Rs 64.65 a litre. Lower frequency of buses is leaving commuters in the lurch in the city even when the offices are opening on Monday. Buses have limited their trips to barely two in a day with owners saying that the sales of tickets remain below Rs 5,000 (one km now costs Rs 52 as compared to Rs 39 in 2018 when the fare was last revised), lower than the operating cost. Several bus operators want to transfer to profitable routes. On Monday, commuters had to wait for long to get buses on their routes and they found it difficult to travel in overcrowded buses. “We went back to the days of the late 70s and 80s when buses were so jam-packed that people used to jostle to manage a toe-hold inside. But now it is dangerous because of the pandemic,” said Rabin Ghosh, an accountant with a trading firm. Those, who dared not to jostle in crowded buses, paid through their noses. “For the last few days, I have been going to the office by bike-taxi and spending almost five to six times the bus fare,” said Upal Sen, a private insurance firm employee. The operators of 12C that has four different routes ran only 86 out of 188 buses. Thirty-eight buses out of 130 plied on the route 18. SD-8 that has 55 buses in its fleet operated just four. The bus operators of the routes 007, 75, 83 and 17B plied five buses each. “We kept meeting the senior transport department officials and transport minister for the past one year but of no use,” said Tapan Banerjee, secretary joint council of bus syndicates. “The skyrocketing diesel price has hit the public transport as the bus operators are not interested in investing on compliance to BS-VI emission norms, which would cost an operator Rs 20 lakh (basic model) compared to Rs 13 lakh for BS-IV buses. Not a single bus operator has bought a new bus since March in 2020. The crisis will intensify once a major chunk of buses becoming 15 years old will be scrapped,” said Titu Saha, general secretary, City Suburban Bus Services. The state government is thinking of alternative fuel like CNG and electric vehicles. “But none of the operators can invest Rs 6 lakh for the conversion of a bus’s engine from the diesel to CNG. Moreover, the CNG refuelling infrastructure is in a nascent stage here,” said Banerjee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pricey-fuel-keeps-majority-of-pvt-buses-off-city-roads/articleshow/87265522.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Right time to resume classes with all safety protocols in place: Experts||Kolkata: It is the right time to reopen schools and colleges, though steps should be taken to ensure social distancing and hours should be shorter to restrict the possibility of transmission since Covid cases are on the rise, said experts. Schools need to be more flexible than colleges about attendance and strictly follow the Covid protocol since their students are aged below 18 years and remain unvaccinated, they pointed out. Children have been less vulnerable to Covid and need to return to a normal study routine, according to Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. “Covid mortality has been very low among children and there could soon be a vaccine for them. Most schools and colleges have got their teachers and staff vaccinated, so the chances of an infection are much lower now,” said Sarkar. Sarkar, however, added that since numbers were rising fast across the state, the next two weeks could be crucial. “If the numbers spiral beyond control, the decision to resume classes should be reversed immediately,” Sarkar said. Schools should have been reopened earlier with an SOP that restricts the number of students in each class, said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. “Adolescents need to attend school but they have been confined at home for nearly two years, which has led to psychological issues. Their intellectual growth is being hampered, communication skills are getting retarded and many have developed behavioural issues. Both school and college students need to interact with their peer groups, which has not been happening,” said Panja. He added that online teaching or communication can never be a long-term replacement for physical classes. “But school and college authorities should realize that Covid is still active and norms need to be changed. For instance, it is advisable not to have the entire strength of a class attend together. They could be attending classes physically and online on alternate days. This will reduce the number of students in a class and lower the chances of transmission,” Panja advised. He added that students of junior classes should not be asked to attend physically. Since children are being allowed everywhere, there’s no reason why they should not be attending school, said paediatrician Santanu Ray. “The entry of children at restaurants, malls or puja pandals has not been barred. Children need to return to schools and colleges but the institutions must stick to a strict Covid protocol. I am in favour of a hybrid system, combining physical and online classes on alternate days. It would be better to start with Classes IX to XII as they realize the importance of following Covid-appropriate behavior,” said Ray.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/right-time-to-resume-classes-with-all-safety-protocols-in-place-experts/articleshow/87265510.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Model predicts hazard hotspots||AHMEDABAD: Inaccessibility of roads, primarily in hilly regions after fresh floods, can cause a major hazard for lives and infrastructure. A model proposed by a team from IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) seeks to assess the vulnerable patches by using the data available. Functionality losses can be reduced by using the information. The team comprised Uday Bhatia, assistant professor in the civil engineering discipline, and students including Raviraj Dave and Srikrishnan Siva Subramanian. A paper based on their research was published recently in the Environmental Research Letters journal. “The first step in the direction of enhancing resilience is to understand the risk well for pre-disaster preparedness and post-disaster recovery,” said Prof Bhatia. “The results of our modelling framework show that we could underestimate the functionality losses by 70% if we do not take into account the concurrence of extreme events, which in turn, can undermine our disaster preparedness.” Prof Bhatia added: “Our patented complex network framework in combination with our recently developed hazard model used in this study helps us identify the hotspots.” These hotspots should be reinforced and protected to minimize the societal and economic disruptions, he said. The research team uses satellite imagery, ingeniously developed landslide and debris flow models, and state-of-the-art flood prediction models. These tools predict the occurrence time and geographical locations that have a high susceptibility to the simultaneous occurrence of flooding, landslides, and debris flow events after heavy rainfall. The model also predicts the magnitude of infrastructure disruptions that may happen due to landslides, debris flows, and floods. As a part of their study, the researchers reconstructed the sequence of events that unfolded in the Periyar river basin in Kerala in 2018. They quantified the exact magnitude of connectivity losses as a consequence of events triggered by a once-in-a-century rainfall. The proposed framework can be applied to any region across the globe wherever necessary observations are available for model calibration and validation, said researchers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/model-predicts-hazard-hotspots/articleshow/87265559.cms||---
---||Meerut||Gone in 3 hours: Stolen in Delhi, scrapped in Meerut||MEERUT: A sedan was stolen from a parking lot in Chandni Chowk in May last year and reached Meerut’s infamous Sotiganj automobile scrap market in about three hours. In just 15 minutes after that, the car was ripped out, its good parts kept aside to be sold at the shops and some “transplanted” into another sedan at the market. For decades, one family was leading the highly profitable car breaking business in Meerut, with vehicles mostly stolen from Delhi-NCR. But in October, 70-year-old Galla and his four sons surrendered after days of raids and surveillance by UP police. His properties worth Rs 10 crore have been seized, but security agencies feel it’s just the tip of the iceberg. “We cannot give a figure at this point as to how much Galla is worth, but there are still a number of properties like shops in Sotiganj Market and a 1,200 sq yard land in Cantt area which are not under his name, but we believe belong to him. We are looking at his benami properties as well,” said additional superintendent of police Suraj Rai, who is spearheading the investigation. Rai said Galla has more than 30 cases filed against him including murder. “This is not the first time he is behind bars, but this time we are on an all-out war against this illegal business. He and his four sons were booked under section 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property, 414 (voluntarily assisting concealing or disposing of stolen property), 420 (cheating) apart from the Gangster Act in September,” said Rai. Galla was also slapped with the NSA Act and the Gunda Act earlier. According to those who know Haji Galla — whose actual name is Haji Naeem —it was post liberalisation in the mid-90s when the auto market began to open up that the ambitious Galla sniffed the opportunity to make a fortune in the stolen vehicle business. Galla started his life as a small-time motor mechanic and went on to lead a well-oiled syndicate comprising auto-lifters, vehicle scrappers and mechanics capable of dismantling a car within minutes. “He entered the illegal business in the late 90s and came to own it. Several vehicles that disappeared from Delhi and NCR every year ended up in Sotiganj. At least 40% of the 300 shops in the Sotiganj market are said to be under his control,” said a police source. The notorious market lies on the National Highway 58 that connects the national capital to Meerut. According to a junk dealer who did not wish to be named, "It is difficult to assess the worth of this market, but a rough estimate suggests it has an annual turnover of at least Rs 500 crore." Of the 300 shops in the market, only 47 are registered under Goods and Services Tax (GST). There were few who wanted to cross Galla, including policemen, said a source. “Police teams from Haryana, Delhi or Rajasthan often raided the market to recover stolen vehicles, but would return empty-handed. There have been instances when they had to run for their lives in front of angry mobs,” said the source, citing an incident that happened in 2015. “That year, sleuths of Delhi police in plain clothes raided the market to arrest the owner of a two-wheeler service centre allegedly involved in the illegal trade. However, the moment the team arrested him, a mob surrounded the team. Their jeep was stuck and the mob began pelting stones. The team somehow managed to escape.” Police said Gangster Act has been slapped against many others involved in the illegal business, including Haji Iqbal, Mannu Ahmad, Mohd Zeeshan, Rahul Kala and Tufail Ahmad. “As of now Gangster Act has been slapped against 32, Gunda Act against 17, nine have been externed while history sheet has been opened of yet another 17,” said police. Over a 100 engines, allegedly from stolen vehicles, have been seized from godowns and shops. Ranvijay Singh, former SP City in Meerut, told TOI that auto-lifters have a strong nexus with the mechanics in the market and are adept at stealing even vehicles with high-end coded security. “They get special classes for it. They can crack security codes of cars digitally, opening them within seconds. They drive them here and the mechanics dismantle it," he said. One of Galla’s relatives, meanwhile, claimed he was “an elderly man being harassed by police”. “Police have been harassing him since 2005 when we had purchased a car from an IAS officer and police framed us in a case of theft,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/kingpin-of-ups-automobile-scrap-mkt-that-dealt-in-stolen-cars-from-delhi/ncr-4-sons-held/articleshow/87264645.cms||Sandeep Rai

He warned that those trying to create unnecessary fear will be dealt with legally. Replying to a question by MLA M M Mani in the assembly on Monday, Vijayan said that those creating unnecessary fear will have to face legal action. “Since social media can be used for many purposes, a section is engaged in spreading misleading campaigns through it. This is part of trying to create panic in the state. Such activities will not do any good to the state and will have to be dealt with legally,” he said. He said that such a campaign has no factual basis. The state has taken a stand for a new dam and the state is firm on it, even though some, including the Centre, are not in agreement with the state, he said. He further said that Tamil Nadu is cooperating with Kerala in all aspects but any differing stand would be resolved through discussions. Earlier in the day, opposition leader V D Satheesan said in the assembly that the government should intervene in allaying people’s fears regarding Mullaperiyar dam, as a widespread campaign is doing the rounds on social media. He said that the government should also formulate long- and short-term programmes for controlling the water level, safety and security of the dam. An active campaign #decommissionMullaperiyarDam on social media has the support of many, including actors Prithviraj and Unni Mukundan. “Regardless of what the facts and findings are or will be, there is no reason or excuse for this 125-year-old dam to exist as a functioning structure! It’s time we put politics and economics aside and do what is right. We can only trust the system, and let’s pray that the system makes the right decision!,” said Prithviraj’s Facebook post. Dam panel should decide on water level: SCMeanwhile, in the wake of concerns of the state’s flood situation, the Supreme Court bench of justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar on Monday sought the response of Mullaperiyar’s supervisory committee on the immediate need to specify the water level. The court sought a decision by the committee on the appropriate water level by Wednesday. The bench said that the issue of water level can be decided after receiving the opinion of the committee. “We direct all authorities concerned to interact urgently and the committee to take a decision as to water level to be maintained,” the bench ordered. “Instead of debating here, do something constructive there. Everyone has to work seriously and sincerely. This isn’t a political arena where you’ll debate, it’s about people’s lives. It’s due to inaction of one party or other that we have to interfere,” observed justice Khanwilkar, after dictating the order. One of the petitioners had brought on record before the court the study report of “United Nations University-Institute for Water, Environment and Health”, raising concerns about the situation of Mullaperiyar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/mullaperiyar-dams-safety-situation-not-alarming-cm/articleshow/87265533.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Rashmi Shukla not accused, but there is material against her: Maharashtra govt||MUMBAI: Stating that its FIR into a “leak” of a report by former intelligence chief Rashmi Shukla did not name her as an accused, the state government informed the Bombay high court that it had moved the Esplanade court for orders to the union home ministry to hand over a pen drive that it believes contains her phone tap report on the alleged corruption in police poings. The state’s special counsel Darius Khambata said the state government wanted to verify if the pen drive with the ministry of home affairs (MHA) matched with two others in its possession. “We have statements that she [Shukla] asked for three pen drives to be made,” he said. “Two of those we located. They contain 6.3gb of data. If we find the third pen drive and if it matches with what we have, it will be apparent who had leaked it.” The high court had last week asked the state to inform it whether Shukla was being named an accused or not. In response, Khambata on Monday said that though she was not named in the FIR “we can equally say there is material against her, this investigation should continue”. “The probe is only into leak of report [and] not its content, but it is a serious matter,” he said. “A leak itself is a serious matter.” He said that leader of the opposition in the assembly Devendra Fadnavis had also said that he had a pen drive of 6.3gb data. “We believe that her pen drive was handed over by the leader of opposition to MHA,” Khambata said in his submissions to seek the dismissal of a quashing petition filed by Shukla. He submitted that there was no response from Fadnavis.“We have also asked the leader of opposition, but didn’t get any response. With all this, how can I make a statement that she is not an accused? How can there be a quashing of FIR at this stage?’’ Shukla, represented by senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani and advocate Gunjan Mangla, who earlier this year petitioned the high court to quash the FIR in April against unknown persons for alleged offences under the Official Secrets Act, the Indian Telegraph Act and the Information Technology Act for cyber offences, later sought orders to have only the probe against her quashed. Jethmalani had argued that she was being made a scapegoat and a victim of vendetta when her actions were in public interest and the intercepts were authorised by the then additional chief secretary (home) Sitaram Kunte. Jethmalani had said the FIR was filed a day after Kunte’s report against her, which had baseless contentions. She said she had been asked by and submitted her report to the then director general of police Subodh Jaiswal on August 25, 2020, before being “unceremoniously transferred” by the state on September 2. The state counsel said he was willing to continue the state’s statement not to arrest and not to take coercive steps against Shukla till her petition was pending.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/shukla-not-accused-but-there-is-material-against-her-maharashtra-state/articleshow/87266212.cms||Swati Deshpande

Expressing relief that chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced campus reopening, principals said they could not return to campuses without a formal government nod and that going back to school before the CISCE and CBSE first semester board exams in November-end boards was necessary for all the arrangements required. Last time schools had reopened amid pandemic, which was in February, the government had allowed only 50% physical attendance in a class . Several schools have convened meeting on Tuesday to discuss the various options, while some plan to seek parents’ feedback. Some principals have pointed out their priority is the first-semester board exam rather than physical classes for other students. Mahadevi Birla World Academy principal Anjana Saha said, “Five-hundred-and-fifty students in our school are going to take offline board exams and we are preparing for that now. We plan the blended mode of teaching.” The Heritage School principal Seema Sapru said, “Based on government instructions, we may divide students of classes IX to XII into small groups who can attend in-person classes twice or thrice a week. We are waiting for the detailed notification.” St Xavier’s Collegiate School principal Father M Thamacin Arulappan has called a meeting on Tuesday. “We will finalize the procedure of conducting physical classes. Moreover, we need to know the details on classes and seating arrangements, which I’m sure the government will send shortly.” Modern High School director Devi Kar said, “We are waiting for the final government instructions. Once we get it, we can plan the modalities in detail.” DPS Ruby Park principal Joyoti Chaudhuri said, “We look forward to welcoming students back to campus. The sanitization guidelines will be implemented strictly.” Krishna Damani, South Point High School trustee, said, “We have started sanitizing the premises. We are waiting for more clarity from the government on the Covid-safety protocol to conduct physical classes.” He pointed out they took health declarations from students when schools had reopened briefly in February. “We may ask for it this time, too,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/schools-look-at-hybrid-mode-for-reopening/articleshow/87265553.cms||---

---||Agra||Tikait demands Rs 40L compensation for Dalit sanitation worker’s family||Agra: Bhartiya Kisan Union national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait has demanded compensation of Rs 40 lakh for the kin of Dalit sanitation worker Arun Valmiki, who allegedly died in police custody recently. After meeting Valmiki's family at their residence on Monday, Tikait said that “there is no difference between a sanitation worker and a farmer”, and therefore, Valmiki’s family should get similar compensation as was paid to families of farmers killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Talking to media persons, Tikait said that if the government has announced to provide a compensation amount of Rs 40 lakh to Lakhimpur farmers, then the same amount should also be given to the sanitation worker’s kin. “If the right to vote is the same for all, then the compensation amount should also be the same,” he said. He also demanded a judicial inquiry into Valmiki's death. “The government must provide a permanent job in the municipal corporation to Arun Valmiki’s wife. The compensation amount of Rs 10 lakh is insufficient as there are three minor children in the family, and their entire life lies ahead of them. We will stage a protest, if the family is not taken care of properly.” On being asked about social activist Yogendra Yadav, who was suspended from the farmers’ body by Samyukt Kisan Morcha after he met the family members of a BJP worker who was killed during the Kheri violence, Tikait said that he has gone on leave. “He had to write a book and prepare some papers, so he has gone on leave for a few days and will come back on November 21,” he said. Meanwhile, four CCTV cameras were installed in and around Valmiki’s house by Azad Samaj party workers to monitor the movement of persons around their house. This was done after the family expressed fear of harassment by the police to the party’s president Chandrashekhar Azad, who had met them recently.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/tikait-demands-rs-40l-compensation-for-dalit-sanitation-workers-family/articleshow/87264656.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Dehradun||Boats damaged in rain, may have to give up trade: Nainital boatmen||NAINITAL: Torrential rains in Nainital, the worst-affected district in Uttarakhand in the last few days, have caused irreversible damage to the wooden boats on Naini Lake. Operators who are now repairing their boats say nearly half of the boats in the lake have been ruined. An initial assessment has revealed that over 40% of boats that operate in the lake – including 222 wooden and 60 pedal ones – have suffered damages. This has come at a time when boat operators were hoping to recover losses they suffered for about a year-and-a-half due to the lockdown.A boat operator told TOI, “Before the rains, we had started making about Rs 5,000 per day as tourist footfall had picked up. Now, our earnings have dropped by about 80-90%. On top of this, we are forced to spend more money to get our boats repaired. Some of us are even thinking of giving up this trade.”Another boat operator said, “Around 300 boatmen operate at the lake and all have suffered losses . It would be a big help if the state government announces some financial aid for us just as it provides compensation to the farmers when their standing crops suffer damage.” Narendra Singh Chauhan, secretary, Boat Owners’ Association of Nainital meanwhile expressed hope that things will improve in the next few days. “We are keeping fingers crossed and hoping that tourists will again start coming to the lake town around Diwali.” As reported by TOI, Nainital has suffered maximum damage in the recent rains with the district recording the highest death tally of 35. The lake town was also cut off from the rest of the state for almost two days last week||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/boats-on-naini-lake-ruined-due-to-torrential-rains-boatmen-already-reeling-from-covid-losses-say-may-give-up-trade/articleshow/87264651.cms||---

Pratap Singh lodged a police complaint on Sunday but no FIR has not been registered so far. Superintendent of police (SP), city, MP Singh told TOI that during investigation, police found a Delhi-based firm is registered against Pratap Singh's PAN number. Further investigation is on and an FIR will be registered on the basis of evidence gathered during investigation, the SP said. In his police complaint, Pratap Singh stated that someone might have stolen his identity as he doesn’t have even a fraction of such a huge turnover. “I have been driving an e-rickshaw for the past four years and earn Rs 400-500 a day, which is barely sufficient to feed five family members, including our three children. I can’t even think of such a huge amount in my wildest of dreams,” said a shocked Singh to TOI. Singh said he had received a call from the income tax department on October 19 asking him to appear in their office. “When I reached there, they served me the tax notice of Rs 3.47 crore,” he stated in the complaint. When he told the I-T department officials about his work profile, they advised him to lodge a police complaint into the matter, as someone had taken a GST number on his name to run a business. The annual turnover of the business was Rs 43.44 crore in 2018-19, and on the basis of it, the tax amount of Rs 3.47 crore was initiated against the given PAN number, which was registered in Pratap Singh’s name. Pratap, a resident of Bakalpur village, said he needed a PAN card for banking purposes and hence went to a Jan Suvidha Kendra in March 2018 to get a PAN card made. He was told that he would get the card after a month. When he did not receive it, he again contacted the centre. Later, he received a coloured photocopy of the PAN card from a man named Sanjay Singh. “I could not differentiate between the actual PAN card and the photocopy because I am illiterate,” Pratap stated in his complaint. According to the assessment order issued by the income tax department, “Information was received on INSIGHT portal under high risk no-filer case wherein it has been shown that the assessee reported a turnover of Rs 43.44 crore in GSTR-1. However, the assessed tax was not filed in his ITR within the due date of filing of ITR.” Accordingly, a notice under section 142 (1), dated February 25, 2020, requiring filing the ITR for the assessment year 2019-20 was issued and served on the assessee. Therefore, scrutiny proceedings under section 144 of the Income tax Act were initiated against assessee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/mathura-e-rickshaw-driver-gets-rs-3-47-cr-tax-notice/articleshow/87264676.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Dehradun||Instead of heli tourism during disaster, BJP should pay timely compensation to families: Harish Rawat||Dehradun: In a sharp attack on the incumbent government, senior Congress leader Harish Rawat on Monday said that “they (BJP leaders) need to give up the concept of heli tourism during natural calamities and take steps to help people." The former CM added, "Even days after the disaster, carcasses of cows, dogs and goats are lying scattered. Fearing a large-scale outbreak of dengue and water-borne diseases, I have urged district officials to clean the low-lying areas.” Rawat said that rather than announcing a relief package for the people of Uttarakhand, Union home minister Amit Shah just patted CM Pushkar Singh Dhami’s back during his recent visit. “Videos of people questioning BJP ministers and MLAs have surfaced online. The affected families are yet to receive compensation. After the Kedarnath floods, we had immediately issued an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh. Given the inflation today, it should be Rs 10 lakh,” he claimed. On the issue of compensation, he said that the losses, which were not covered in the norms, should also be provided by the state. “In this case, the state should not look towards the Centre for any kind of financial assistance, but hand over the relief to affected people and their families. It is a matter of shame that after six days, the authorities are yet to recover the bodies. If the government was aware of such a possibility 36 hours in advance, what was it doing during this period?” he said. Rawat along with several other Congress members visited the disaster-hit areas and provided food to people. “It is surprising that no 'langar' (community kitchen) was organised,” he added. Meanwhile, Congress state chief Ganesh Godiyal has announced state wide protests, if the government failed to provide the required assistance and financial aid to those affected. “We had given a five-day ultimatum to the BJP government and three days have already gone by. If no action is taken, we will launch a protest from October 28,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/instead-of-heli-tourism-during-disaster-bjp-should-pay-timely-compensation-to-families-harish-rawat/articleshow/87264665.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Jaipur||‘If you can’t appreciate other cultures, crafting ethnic jewellery is not possible’||From Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, Angelina Jolie, Penelope Cruz to Sonam Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, Lara Dutta, Dimple Kapadia, Reena Roy, Shabana Azmi and several others, all have a common Jaipur connection – Amrapali jewellery. Founder of the ethnic silver jewellery group Rajiv Arora attributes a long list of reasons to this celebrity craze but then nails it with one uniqueness. “The pieces they wear are one of a kind. You won’t find a second one. That’s what these high-street celebrities want.” And that pretty much explains why Arora’s archive boasts of over 10,000 designs, some of which have also found their way to movies like Jism, Rog, Ramleela, Bahubali-II and most recently Manikarnika. Enamored of Arora’s design language, Hollywood producers too have sought his help for period jewelleries for flicks like Troy and Valley of Flowers. Arora’s entrepreneurial journey along with his co-founder Rajesh Ajmera is redolent of any contemporary startup folklore. When they began in 1978 in Arora’s living rooms, it was not technology, rather the heritage enthusiasts’ love for traditional, tribal and royal jewellery. After post-graduation in history, Arora did an MBA degree. But his learnings were at the opposite of what the MBA courses offered. Maybe that’s one of the reasons why Amrapali, even after 40 years, still thrives despite a slow revenue growth. “I don’t sell the same piece to another celebrity. Whereas, with one successful design I can sell thousands of pieces. Maybe that is the reason why Melania Trump chose our earrings for her India visit or gifts made to former US presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama during their visits to the country were made by us,” said Arora. Amrapali Jewels counts on a clientele spanning royalty, corporate honchos and celebrities globally and has created a fan club of famous families like Hermes, Corum, Porche, and Barbie-Muller. Arora said, “Amrapali group’s annual revenues of Rs 200 crore can grow 10-fold in quick time if we automate the production and sacrifice the craftsmanship and exclusiveness.” From a modest start in Jaipur’s Chameliwala market in 1981, Amrapali stepped out of Jaipur by opening a shop in Mumbai’s Oberoi hotel in 1991. As ethnic jewellery started influencing fashion trends in the world, Amrapali rode the wave supplying to popular overseas departmental stores like Berty in London, Galleries Lafayette Haussmann and Le Bon Marche in Paris. Today, Amrapali has three manufacturing units in Jaipur employing over 2,000 craftsmen, and has expanded its footprint to over 33 outlets, including major cities of the world and most busy airports in the country. Arora said the secret behind the brand’s success is his penchant for ancient India’s cultural history. In the early days of his entrepreneurial journey, Arora scoured remote regions in the country in search of unique tribal jewellery designs. “I toured all over India to understand and learn about various tribal jewellery made in villages. That took me as far as Jagdalpur and Bastar in Chhattisgarh, Koraput in Odisha, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh and districts in Rajasthan like Rattangargh, Churu, Ramgarh, Shekhawati,” said Arora. In rural India whenever people need money during hard times like a drought, calamity or for family obligations like weddings of their children, they tend to sell their old jewellery or remake. Arora would not miss an opportunity like this if he came across one. He collected as many pieces as he could for their designing value. “Numerous pieces, which were works of art at that time, were lost. I started collecting the pieces. My tribal jewellery museum in Jaipur is a treasure trove of that. It’s an inspiration for the young budding designers,” said Arora. “Also I believe,” he said, “If you cannot appreciate other cultures, you cannot deal with ethnic jewellery.” Reviving dying arts of filigree and enameling was another way of recreating the old world design aesthetic that he undertook to enrich his collections. India is a living culture with ancient and eternal designs still in use. Besides tribal design, royalty has a bigger aesthetic influence. “I experiment with designs with contemporary and futuristic trends in mind. The pieces I make are bold and bigger so that when an actor or celebrity wears it, it is visible on the screen,” said Arora. Now Arora’s son Tarang has joined the family business. Like his father, he is also passionate about cultural and designing traditions. He went to London to study gemmology and designings to hone his skills and sharpen his insights. Currently, Tarang is diversifying the business with forays into online and e-commerce and created a couple of brands. Arora said the fashion jewellery they make are versatile in nature. “They can be paired with Jeans, T-Shirts, lehenga, salwar suit or a Western outfit. Our pieces range from Rs 500 and Rs 5 lakh. We also do gold, kundan meena and polka jewelleries but only masterpieces,” added Arora. With regard to Amrapali’s future growth strategy, Arora said “I want Amrapali to become a household jewellery brand to suit every pocket. When you wear Amrapali, you should feel like a princess. There is a princess in every woman and Amrapali makes them feel so.” For Arora, the word tribe does not mean various Indian cultures alone. “It also means there is a tribe or a large group or community in the world who loves the designs and understands and appreciates other cultures and ways of life. I want my jewellery to play a role in creating a world where people find beauty in diversity,” he explained. Quotes: “Fashion jewellery has huge scope for growth and has been growing at a faster clip due to multiple reasons. The versatility of fashion jewellery that can fit into multiple occasions coupled with lower cost is drawing many to this kind of ornament. The rising prices of gold and the security risks involved with it is also fuelling demand for fashion jewellery” —Nawal Agarwal | Prominent jeweler in Jaipur “Today, the majority of costume and fashion jewellery is imported from China. They are not only cheaper but trendy as well. But in the past couple of years, the import volume has started declining. Jewellers in India and in Jaipur are also experimenting with new design themes. We have talent but not enough volume to cater to big buyers in exporting countries” —Ajay Kala | Spokesperson, Jaipur Jewellery Show “Women were never part of the core gem and jewellery manufacturing. We are trying to change that by training them. Since the demand is growing for costume and fashion jewellery, we need more skilled craftspersons. That’s why we started a training initiative. Close to 250 women have been trained and we have a target to skill 2000 in various crafts of fashion jewellery” —Gaurav Jain | President, Sitapura Gems and Jewellery Association||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/if-you-cant-appreciate-other-cultures-crafting-ethnic-jewellery-is-not-possible/articleshow/87266228.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The jawan, identified as Sajjad Imtiaz, is a native of Rajouri in Jammu & Kashmir. He had joined the BSF in 2012 and was posted with the A Company of BSF Battalion-74, said ATS officers. The officers said that Imtiaz had shared crucial information with some unknown persons in Pakistan for which he was paid. “ATS officers got inputs about Imtiaz and his cellphone numbers were put under scrutiny,” said a statement issued by the ATS. When ATS officers checked his cellphone details, they found that he had got one number using an Aadhaar card on which his date of birth was mentioned as January 1, 1992. On the other hand, his passport issued in Jammu mentioned his birth date as January 30, 1985. Imtiaz had travelled to Pakistan on Samjhauta Express on December 1, 2011, from Attari and had stayed there for 46 days. Afterwards, he joined the BSF and was posted in several regions including some forward areas in Jammu. Later, he acquired another number using the fake ID of a person based in Tripura. He gave that number to his Pakistani handlers to communicate over WhatsApp, said the ATS statement. According to the ATS, he leaked strategic information. The ATS officers said that Imtiaz used to deposit the money he received from Pakistan into the accounts of his brother and a colleague. Acting on specific inputs, ATS officers went to the Bhuj BSF station headquarters and caught him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ats-nabs-bsf-man-in-bhuj-for-spying-for-pak/articleshow/87265689.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Jaipur owes its jewellery legacy to city’s founder||Silver and fashion jewellery is an innovation from Jaipur’s rich tradition. Besides Amrapali Jewels, which is the earliest venture in the segment, Derewala, Vaibhav Global and others have made their name globally. Today, majority of the silver and fashion jewellery is exported from Jaipur, Delhi and Agra. Recently, exporters from Surat are using diamonds in manufacturing of silver jewellery. Jaipur owes its jewellery tradition to Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh-II. When he was planning to establish the city in 1727, he created areas or mohallas dedicated for certain occupations, including jewellers. He invited jewellers from the entire Indian sub-continent including Lahore, Benaras, Delhi and Kolkata, and patronized their art by helping them in establishing their business in Johari Bazaar of the city. Similarly, the gold and silver foil makers were also invited from Afghanistan who settled in Jaipur. Today, the city is known for the foils. Gradually, Jaipur became the hub for coloured gemstone manufacturing. Even kundan meena jewellery found its way to Jaipur. The rough gemstones are being imported from various countries while cutting and polishing is done by skilled artisans. In 1950s, many Exports Promotion Councils were established by the Centre to promote exports. When the then commerce minister Manubhai Shah promoted the idea for a Gem and Jewellery Exports Promotion Council, he relied on Khel Shankar Durlabh Ji, a renowned jeweller of Jaipur whom he knew personally. Durlabhji along with other jewellers established the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council in 1966 and its inaugural function was held in Johari Bazaar. However, it was decided to keep the headquarters in Mumbai given the size of the diamond trade there. Today, the Council has 6,500 exporters out of which about 1,000 are from Jaipur. But there are many jewellers who cater to the domestic market, and they also supply to the exporters.

Maj Gen Dr Vibha Dutta, director and CEO of AIIMS Nagpur, told TOI that advanced MRI facilities are available at AIIMS. “Patients can reach AIIMS and avail the benefit of MRI as well as advanced treatment facilities. They can save the expenses of conducting MRI in a private setup,” said Dr Dutta. She also said that PG students of the GMCH radiology department may come to AIIMS for hands-on training that they are missing due to non-availability of the machine. “The radiology department of AIIMS has limited manpower. PG students from GMCH may add to it. This will benefit both the students as well as patients,” said Dr Dutta. AIIMS is ready to cooperate with GMCH on an academic level. This is very much possible as AIIMS and GMCH have long academic associations. In 2018, AIIMS had started from the premises of GMCH before it shifted to its state-of-art premises at Mihan. Now, AIIMS has its full-fledged OPD, IPD and many departments are functioning here. The daily footfall of patients is more than 1,500 and the those from the periphery as well as adjacent states are coming on a daily basis to AIIMS. AIIMS also has the most advanced cath lab of central India for cardiovascular processes. The construction and addition on new facilities is underway after which the hospital will have more than 750 beds equipped with all necessary facilities. At present, the beds in general wards of AIIMS have ICU-like surveillance and call system installed. As home isolation is not allowed in Nagpur city, all Covid-19 patients in the NMC region are admitted in the Covid-19 ward of AIIMS only. With Metro and city buses, its quite easy to reach AIIMS from any part of the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/aiims-has-mri-patients-and-residents-most-welcome-director/articleshow/87264222.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Petrol, diesel rates up 19% in 6 months||AHMEDABAD: Your income may not have increased over the past six months, but your expenditure sure has! Petrol and diesel prices have shot up by a whopping 19% over the past six months. On April 15, petrol price stood at Rs 87.57 per litre in Ahmedabad which has surged to Rs 104.24 per litre. Diesel price rose from Rs 86.96 to Rs 103.81 per litre as on Monday. “Fuel prices went up as a function of the rise in crude oil prices. There is barely any difference in sales and consumption is increasing with increased movement in the run-up to the festive season,” said a city-based petroleum dealer. “However, customers are upset with the constant rise in prices. Even though the dealers have no role in controlling the prices, customers tend to vent their frustrations on us.”  Even Adani Total Gas Limited (ATGL) has again raised piped natural gas (PNG) price for residential consumers. The company has increased domestic PNG price in Ahmedabad to Rs 1,089.20 per MMBtu (metric million British thermal unit) for the bi-monthly consumption up to 1.60 MMBtu from Rs 1,061.20 per MMBtu on October 11. For consumption above 1.60 MMBtu, the tariff has been revised to Rs 1,307.04 per MMBtu from Rs 1,273.44. For Vadodara, the company has increased domestic PNG prices to Rs 1,009.12 per MMBtu from Rs 981.12 per MMBtu. The rates, exclusive of taxes, have been revised with effect from October 24. Following the increase in fuel prices, the cost of transport, private cabs, and buses has also increased. “With the increase in petrol and diesel prices, we have revised our per kilometre tariffs by some 20%,” said Chandresh Patel, president, Gujarat Luxury Cab Owners’ Association (GLCOA). Patel added: “However, our margins continue to remain eroded because the petrol price has witnessed a similar increase over the past six months. This is impacting our revenues directly.” Transporters are also facing the heat of surging fuel costs. “The daily revision of fuel prices is no longer viable because we have to bear incremental losses over and above the pre-negotiated rates for transporting goods,” said Mukesh Dave, president. Akhil Gujarat Truck Transporters’ Association. Dave added: “Since fuel prices are frequently increasing, we have added a clause in our transport contract. If price increases beyond a certain threshold during the validity of the contract, we increase the transport charges applicable.” However, he said, transporters are forced to absorb the remaining hike in price.” “Fuel accounts for 50% of our input cost component thus resulting in the erosion of our profit margins or at times even losses,” he said. “A series of representations have been made to bring petrol and diesel under the ambit of Goods and Services Tax (GST).” Industry players are feeling the heat of the surge in prices as their input costs go up with the rise in transport costs and even that of natural gas and coal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/petrol-diesel-rates-up-19-in-6-months/articleshow/87265602.cms||Niyati Parikh

The state government has reserved 6,000 mcft of water for the NMC from the water bodies, but the demand actual placed and reserved depends on the current population and floating population and other needs presented by the municipal corporation. Last year, the NMC had received 5,500 mcft of water. Of that, 3,800 mcft was available from the Gangapur dam complex, and 1,700 mcft was available from the Darna dam complex. “This year, an additional 100 mcft of water has been reserved as per the demand. The NMC will get 1,600 mcft from the Darna dam complex, and 4,000 mcft from the Gangapur dam complex,” NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav said. It may be noted that since 2017, the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) has been reserving and allocating water for drinking, agriculture and industrial purpose. This is done after the district-level bodies finalise their water reservation plans by October. The district bodies take into account the reservation for drinking purposes for various local self-governing bodies, industries and agriculture. The district body then sends the finalised plan to the MWRRA for its final approval. The Gangapur dam complex now has 9,273 million cubic feet (mcft) of water, which is 99% of its capacity. Similarly, the Darna complex has 17,149 mcft of water, which was 89% of its capacity. Bhujbal also announced the reservation of drinking water for some villages under the contingency plan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/5600-mcft-water-reserved-for-nashik-civic-body-till-july-22/articleshow/87263013.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The court-appointed receiver R Venkatarmani said these flats are in addition to 2,300 flats which would be handed over to buyers in Noida as promised by NBCC. Appearing before a bench of Justices U U Lalit and Ajay Rastogi, the senior advocate pleaded that a "little nudge" from the court is needed to expedite the process as six banks agreed in principle but things did not move forward in the last one and half months. The receiver had on September 3 informed the bench that he had extensive meetings with officials of a consortium of six banks namely -- Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Bank of India, State Bank of India, UCO Bank and Punjab & Sindh Bank. He submitted the consortium has agreed to extend funding and that documentation on that behalf will be executed during the month thereafter the loans were expected to be disbursed. Except SBI and UCO Banks, none of the remaining four banks came out with any concrete proposal on funding and contended that the proposal has not been finalised, the bench asked them to decide within two weeks and file the proposal before it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/finalise-amrapali-funding-in-2-weeks-sc-directs-banks/articleshow/87267166.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Illegal alterations found in highrise flat gutted in fire’||Mumbai: Fire brigade investigation into last week’s blaze at One Avighna Park at Curry Road, which left one dead, has reportedly found illegal additions and alterations done in the gutted 19th floor flat in B Wing. A senior fire official who is part of the investigating team said they found the servant quarters had been turned into the kitchen while the kitchen space had been extended into the dining room. “The sprinkler system, when moved from the existing kitchen space to the servant quarters, is likely to have not been fixed appropriately, due to which it may have not been triggered despite the fact that the heat in the room reached a certain degree during the blaze,” said an official, adding extensive wood-panelling work on the walls aggravated the blaze. Later on Monday, in a statement, Nishant Agarwal, managing director, Avighna Group, said their facility team had received several emails from the owner of the flat where the fire had erupted seeking approval for various changes, which were not sanctioned. “The flat owner had specifically asked us for approval to relocate the sprinklers. This being a gross violation, we have not permitted the same. However, during site review on 24 October, prima facie it appears to us that the flat owner has gone ahead and done these changes regardless. It is evident that the location of the sprinklers has been changed. It seems that he has used a third-party contractor to do this work without our knowledge. In order to carry out this work, he seems to have shut the water supply to the sprinklers on his own, and could possibly be the reason why the automatic response sprinklers did not activate when the fire broke out, as claimed by the owner,” said the statement.  When contacted, Rohit Rathod, owner of the flat where the fire erupted, said he would get his legal team to reach out. A comment was still awaited till late on Monday. The BMC in a meeting on Monday instructed fire brigade teams to do random inspections of highrises to check if their basic fire-fighting systems are operational.

---||Mumbai||Not one tree will be axed for Powai cycle track: Aaditya Thackeray||MUMBAI: Amid protests against BMC’s Powai lake cycle track project from green activists who have alleged that trees will be hacked and green space lost, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray has asked BMC not to cut a single tree for the project. Speaking to TOI about the project, he clarified that no green space would be lost. “The real green activists and scientists have seen the project and discussed it thoroughly with the BMC,” Aaditya said. “From the beginning itself, I have asked the BMC to not cut a single tree or change any natural surroundings... The trees have been marked so that they can be protected, and not cut. The idea is to actually triple the number of trees and have an open urban green space for Mumbaikars,” Aaditya said. On allegations that sewage still flows into the lake and that the lake has shrunk by 20%, Aaditya said all sewage lines will be stopped. “Currently, discharge from surrounding areas is polluting the lake. We’ve been receiving complaints about various institutions around there and some buildings discharging their sewage into the lake. We will be stopping it and also investigating the source. Powai lake faces siltation which is a natural process. However, the cycle track is not a construction that is going to take up any additional footprint. It is exactly how Hyde Park’s serpentine walkway is. It’s actually a place for citizens to take a stroll, sit and paint/ ideate, cycle on in the current land space surrounding the lake,” Aaditya said. He added that BMC will install non-invasive water aerators that will improve water quality. “Sadly, most fears are causing more panic and aren’t backed by science. Without aeration of the fountains, the lake’s aquatic ecosystem will die. The fountains are needed, unless we want it to be a dead lake. In any water body rejuvenation program, science demands that aeration as a primary method to increase oxygen content. The green space belongs to the city and will be absolutely free. This waterfront is four times the size of Marine Drive. Powai needs the lake to be an urban open green space for citizens of Powai to enjoy. All residents who have asked for a presentation have loved it and asked for it,” Aaditya said. BMC recently formed a panel of state environmental experts to discuss the lake’s development. However, activists said that the committee is only for name sake and BMC is still going ahead with its works, without taking any approvals from it. “It’ll be a joke to doubt the committee of experts and their scope of work. The committee is in place to guide the work to make this place a sustainable urban open green space. However, reiterating that when not a single tree will be cut, or no ingress is made into the lake, with sewage being stopped, the citizens need not worry,” Aaditya said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/not-one-tree-will-be-axed-for-powai-cycle-track-aaditya-in-mumbai/articleshow/87266654.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The ACP also defended police firing and said it was in self-defence. On the fourth day of his deposition, the ACP was asked to explain why he had not mentioned the accused throwing mud in cops’ eyes, who snatched the weapons and injuries to two cops in his initial complaint. The ACP attributed the slip to his emotional state on December 6 following the alleged encounter, adding that all the details were recorded by him a day later in his case diary. Explaining the sequence of events, the ACP said that all four accused attacked together, and he saw Md Arif throw sand and snatch the weapon from CI K Narasimha Reddy even as SI Venkateshwarulu shouted “Sir, Chennakeshavulu naa weapon gunjukunnadu (Chennakeshavulu has snatched my weapon)”. During his deposition when the ACP said that he was confused and under pressure, commission member Rekha Baldota said, “This is a fact-finding inquiry. Why are you taking so much pressure?” The ACP responded that it was because he was giving evidence before judges. The ACP said that once Arif started running and other cops also complained of soil in eyes, he cautioned the accused after he heard shots. “I warned them thrice by shouting “longipondi, longipondi, paaro pokandi” (surrender, surrender, don’t run). But when firing did not stop, I ordered Lal Madhar to fire in the air. When the accused continued firing, I ordered the police team to fire in the direction of the sound to scare them into stopping,” the ACP said. Commission chairman V S Sirpurkar then asked, “Is it not a fact that police were at a lower level and accused at a higher level. Wouldn’t firing blindly towards the sound of firing have endangered lives of the accused?” The ACP, however, defended firing and said: “They were already accused in rape and murder case. In order to re-arrest them by any means and at the same time to protect panchas and cops from indiscriminate firing, we had to fire.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/acp-cites-mental-state-for-missingdetails-in-complaint-defends-firing/articleshow/87265600.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Vaghani made the announcement at the inaugural ceremony of the defence design and technology incubator of India (DDTII) at Karnavati University in Uvarsad, Gandhinagar on Monday. Delivering his keynote address, Vaghani said, “The startup policy was launched in 2017. We will be coming up with an entirely new policy for startups in 2022, which will be designed based on learnings from the current one and national and international exposure. We will support startups as well as student-led startups.” “As part of the policy, we will support all forms of student innovations under the Mind to Market initiative. That apart, we will also increase the grant extended to universities to support student innovation under the Student Startup and Innovation Policy (SSIP),” he further added. The incubator which was inaugurated at the varsity will be the second one in Gujarat dedicated to defence-sector startups. “Some four startups will be incubated at DDTII in the coming week. These include two at MVP (minimum viable product) stage, namely Nhance Dynamics – a robotics firm and Vartronics Techlabs – which designs extended reality-based platforms for training pilots of defence aircraft,” Dr Nishith Pandya, director, DDTII, told TOI. The other two startups are operating in drone swarming and biomedical defence application segments and are at prototyping stage. Stephen Serrao, founder, Vatronics Techlabs, which is set to be incubated at DDTII, said, “We are working on a product which will help us set up.” Estimates provided by varsity officials suggest that Gujarat is already home to at least 45 startups in defence sector. Gujarat has already attracted some investments in defence manufacturing sector, especially at the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR). The varsity has already received a grant of Rs 20 lakh under SSIP from the state government and is also the nodal agency for distributing grant from the State Industries Commissionerate to startups. Pandya said the incubator aims at increasing the number of incubated startups to 200 by the end of 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/2nd-edition-of-startup-policy-to-be-launched-in-2022/articleshow/87265639.cms||---

At the meeting of the university’s Need committee held on Monday, it was decided to approve new classes in the existing colleges rather than having more colleges. The university has decided to first fill up the vacant seats in BCom and BA courses the admission for which is going on. “If students couldn’t get admission, then only the university will think about approving additional classes in the existing colleges,” said an official. The GU officials said that the meeting of the Need committee is held if a proposal to approve new colleges is moved by the management. The committee takes the decision after evaluating the prevailing situation. A proposal to convert Gujarati-medium colleges to English-medium was also moved which was kept in abeyance after the committee members opined that they need to discuss the proposal in detail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/no-new-self-financed-colleges-for-now-gu/articleshow/87265638.cms||---

The bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy heard senior counsel K Vivek Reddy on the apprehensions expressed by petitioners DSP Vasam Surender and circle inspector Konda Narasimha Reddy, and advocate general BS Prasad before reserving its order. “The commission has the power to devise its own way of inquiry, but we are aggrieved with its ways because it erodes our entitlement to statutory protections. Particularly when we are called as witnesses under section 8-B of the Commissions of Inquiries Act. The normal procedure is to take up the chief examination first and allow the other party to cross-examine. But the commission is first cross-examining us before recording our depositions,” Vivek said. Another counsel appeared for one of the police officials and expressed apprehensions about their defense being disclosed if they are examined first. “We are seeking directions to keep our examination at the end so that others will not fill the gaps in their case using the information from the depositions of the police officers,” he said. Vivek Reddy also said that if the commission gives any adverse findings it will ruin the careers of the officers. “Our Parliament has amended the Commissions of Inquiries Act and brought in some protection to the investigators,” he explained. “I am an 8-B witness. Evidence against me must be put to me and I have a right to cross-examine such witnesses and I should be able to produce evidence that supports my case,” he said. When asked about the stand of the state in this matter, advocate general BS Prasad said that the investigators may be accorded the statutory protection they are entitled to. “They should not be made to produce self-incriminating material before the commission,” the AG said, supporting the case of the police. The bench reserved its order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-reserves-order-on-2-cops-pleas-against-panel-method/articleshow/87265606.cms||---

At present, AMC pays Rs 2,500 per animal to the agency that transports such animals to stray animal shelters located outside the city. “Mumbai Jivdaya Mandali, the only organisation that is engaged in this work, has requested the civic body to raise this amount to Rs 4,000 per animal. The AMC standing committee will resolve to allot full powers to the AMC commissioner for this in its meeting scheduled on October 28, Thursday,” an AMC official said. The official said that most of the animals caught by CNCD are abandoned animals and their owners do not claim them back. “These unclaimed animals become AMC’s liability and are kept in two AMC-run animal shelters.  However, when these facilities run full, these animals have to be transferred to other animal shelters located outside the city. The civic body makes one-time payments to such agencies that relocate these animals as lifetime maintenance,” the official said. The official said that so far this month AMC caught a total of 1,400 stray cattle from various areas, and collected a total of Rs 11.50 lakh in fines. The official said that owners of only 202 cattle have come to claim their animals. The department had caught 17,752 stray cattle in 2019, 10,064 cattle were caught in 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/unclaimed-stray-cattle-amc-may-hike-maintenance-cost/articleshow/87265630.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Don’t give over the counter medicines to toddlers: Doctors||HYDERABAD: The prevalence of fever, cough and cold during this time of the year has led to increase in the use of over the counter (OTC) medicines. However, the use of OTC medicines which are unsuitable for kids has also seen parents rushing their toddlers to emergency wards. In one instance, a five-month-old had to be taken to hospital after turning blue a day after being given an OTC cough syrup. The baby had choked on milk after becoming drowsy due to the cough syrup. A resuscitation was required to save the baby. In a similar incident, an eight-month-old fell off the bed and received serious injuries after becoming drowsy due to a cough syrup. “While it is not very common, we do need to be aware this is a possibility and that cough syrups, paracetamol and antibiotics are not harmless. Cough syrups contain dextromethorphan which has a potential for addiction and lot of teenagers are getting hooked on to these. In case of infants, they can even become unconscious, land in a coma and have a stroke as cough syrups have a vasoconstriction effect,” said Dr Sudhir Kumar, consultant neurologist at Apollo Hospital. Experts said it was also alarming that kids may be unknowingly developing antibiotic resistance. “In rare cases, it can lead to liver failure, unconsciousness, drowsiness and reduced attention. This can happen with overuse of cough syrups, paracetamol syrups and drops. Although very few kids land in emergency, some may experience unpleasant side-effects and develop antibiotic resistance early on in life,” said consultant for paediatrics and pulmonology at Ankura Hospitals, Dr Srinivas Jakka. In case of cough and cold, some OTC medicines suppress secretions but can have a much severe rebound. “There will be a reboundwith copious flow of secretions from the nose when you stop these medicines. Prolonged usage can result in something called rhinitis medicamentosa wherein the medicines themselves cause persistent cold. These medicines are definitely not recommended for toddlers,” explained Dr Shivranjani Santosh, chief paediatrician at Magna Centres.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dont-give-otc-meds-to-toddlers-docs/articleshow/87265616.cms||Amrita Didyala

On Saturday, additional director general of police (law and order) Narsimha Komar had issued a circular prohibiting any adverse social media post on the matter. Using a black ribbon and “Police Maha Andolan” on their WhatsApp status, several cops of constable, assistant sub-inspector, and sub-inspector levels from Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar demanded a hike in grade pay from the existing Rs 1,800. The cops have been demanding a grade pay of Rs 2,800 for constables, Rs 3,600 for head constables, and Rs 4,400 for assistant sub-inspectors. Cops have also been demanding weekly offs, paid leaves according to the Seventh Pay Commission, fixed job time of about eight hours, and the permission to form a union. At present, the state has a union of IPS officers but not of other cops including assistant commissioners. On Saturday, Komar had issued the circular to all SP offices and commissionerates to prohibit the use of social media for showing protest. But many cops ignored the circular and continued to e-protest. A constable from Bapunagar, Hardik Pandya, went a step farther. He tried to actually sit on protest at the secretariat in Gandhinagar, where he was detained by the local crime branch. A constable from Kanbha, who posted about the protest, said that the cops do not have the luxury to do dharna and stay away from work. Minister of state for home Harsh Sanghavi told reporters that the issue was being discussed and no decision had been taken yet. He was speaking at the launch of the city cybercrime police website.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/defiant-cops-continue-e-protest-over-pay/articleshow/87265643.cms||---

Around 6,000 students who scored A+ in all subjects in Class 10 are yet to get Plus One admission, he said. The minister said that 50 taluks in the state do not have enough Plus One seats for local students. “The government will increase the number of Plus One seats wherever necessary. New batches will also be sanctioned. Of the 1,25,509 candidates who got A+ in all subjects, 5,812 are yet to get admission. Hence, the government will shift excess batches in some districts to where there is acute shortage for seats. In districts where 20% additional seats are already sanctioned, steps will be taken to sanction 10% more, if necessary. If need be, temporary batches would be sanctioned for science streams,” Sivankutty said. The additional seats would be sanctioned once the supplementary allotment is completed, he said. It’s the first time that the government admitted to seat shortage. Opposition leader VD Satheesan welcomed the government assurance but said it should take steps to complete the admission process in a time-bound manner and without hassles. Meanwhile, the higher secondary directorate has opened the admission portal for submitting options for supplementary allotment. Options can be submitted from 10am on October 26 to 5pm on October 28.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/will-increase-seats-wherever-needed/articleshow/87265621.cms||---

The consultant agency will chart out a strategy to effectively utilise the Union grants given to the civic body for improvement of Ahmedabad’s air quality. The state government had finalized an air action plan for the city In June 2019. In August 2021, the municipal corporation had invited proposals from consultants to suggest ways to achieve the targets. “We received four bids for the consultancy of which the bid of ICLEI South Asia Local Governments for Sustainability has been selected. The consultant will help AMC to chart out a detailed plan for implementation of APCAPA,” said an AMC official. He said that the bid will be put for clearance at the Health and Solid Waste committee meeting on Wednesday. The civic body will pay Rs 1.22 crore to the agency for this consultancy service. “Under National Clean Air Programme the Union government has granted Ahmedabad Rs 182 crore for improving the city’s air quality. The consultant will prepare a plan for AMC to utilise this grant in the most effective manner,” the official said. APCAPA was prepared with the participation of multiple agencies. They included the district collectorate, the municipal corporation, GPCB, RTO, civil supplies and other government departments. The plan was in draft form since June 2017 and was readied in February 2018. Among the various tasks prescribed in the APCAPA plan, include making Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar kerosene-free, increasing the number of public transport buses and ensuring that all buses run on CNG, cancel the registrations of commercial vehicles older than 15 years and provide financial assistance for the purchase of commercial vehicles that run on electricity or CNG.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/amc-to-appoint-iclei-as-consultant/articleshow/87265637.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Amidst internal rifts, akhara apex body holds meet, elects new prez||Haridwar: In a meeting held in Prayagraj on Monday, Niranjani akhara secretary Swami Ravindra Puri was elected as the president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), the apex body of seers. The meeting was attended by the representatives of seven of the 13 akhadas whereas the remaining six akharas gave it a miss, making the friction in the ABAP evident. After the election, Puri, who is also the president of Haridwar’s Mansa Devi temple, told TOI over the phone from Prayagraj that eight out of the 13 akharas supported his election to the post. While seven of them — Niranjani, Juna, Anand, Avahan, Agni, Nirmal and Naya akhara — were present at the election meeting, Mahant Madan Mohan Das of Nirmohi akhara communicated his support through telephone, Puri added. However, the breakaway faction has contested the claim of the new ABAP president that he has the support of eight akharas. Nirmal akhara secretary Devendra Singh Shastri told TOI, “The other group has made a false claim that they have our support. Mahant Gyandev Singh is our elected president and he doesn’t support them. They have the support of Resham Singh, who holds no office in our akhara.” Echoing a similar sentiment, Rajendra Das, the elected general secretary of the breakaway faction, said, “There is no ABAP without the Bairagi akharas (Nirvani, Digambhar and Nirmohi). They are, at best, Akhil Bharatiya Sanyasi Parishad. Besides, they have claimed a majority by including seers who have been expelled not only from the ABAP but from their respective akharas as well.” The Prayagraj meeting comes just a few days after seven of the 13 akharas elected the president, general secretary and other office bearers of the ABAP on their own. In the meeting of the breakaway faction, Mahant Ravindra Puri of Mahanirvani akhara was elected the president and Mahant Rajendra Das of Nirmohi akhara was elected the general secretary of the ABAP.

Over the past week, the civic administration has disconnected water supply of 25 consumers who owe more than Rs 25,000 in water tax. Civic officials said the drive will continue and pick up pace during Diwali. Further, Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has directed officials to speed up tax recovery. “The total water tax dues are estimated to be around Rs 97 crore. Over 4,000 water tax defaulters owe the civic body over Rs 25,000 each; this comes up to around Rs 27 crore,” said the NMC officials. NMC has set a water tax collection target of Rs 160 crore for the financial year, including current demand of Rs 60 crore, but has been able to collect only Rs 25 crore so far. NMC gets its revenue through taxes on property, water, and other sources through its town planning department. The revenue of the civic body has been affected due to the Covid pandemic. The civic body had expected Rs 1,050 crore in revenue from April to September this year, but was able to collect only Rs 750 crore. As per officials in the know, Rs 300 crore in other tax arrears too were pending.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nmc-starts-snapping-water-connections-of-big-defaulters/articleshow/87263023.cms||Tushar Pawar

The high court also made it clear that the father and the mother have equal right over the son, and the woman cannot express resistance over a meeting between the father and son. The man lives in Vadodara and the woman has re-married and settled in Sikkim. While granting divorce, the family court granted visitation rights to the man, who can meet his child once a month for two hours. Since the woman lives with her son and new husband in Sikkim, she insisted that her ex-husband should come to Bagdogra if he wanted to meet the son. As the man challenged the lower court’s orders, the hearing took place before the high court, which last week criticized him for filing a complaint before Vadodara police, who allegedly pressured the woman to bring the eight-year-old son to Vadodara. The man apologised before court for his mistakes and said that he had done so in the desperation to meet his child. He also complained that whenever he talks to the child on video call, the child’s mother and stepfather pressures the child not to interact much. The judges assured the man that the court would see to it that he gets meaningful visitation with his son. They asked the woman’s lawyer to ask her to allow the child meet his biological father in Bagdogra and to keep the stepfather away during the meeting. The court also said that if the man can travel all the way to Bagdogra, the woman should also bring the child to Vadodara. The step father could accompany them, but he should not remain present when the father meets his son.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/high-court-rebukes-man-for-harassing-ex-wife/articleshow/87265635.cms||---

Announcing the dates of the event, the president of welcome committee of the festival, state civil supplies and consumer protection minister Chhagan Bhujbal said that the literary festival was first scheduled in March 2020, but had to be deferred. “As the number of active Covid cases is now coming down and the overall situation is improving, we held a discussion with the president of the literary festival and finalised the dates for organising the three-day event from December 3,” Bhujbal added. Eminent astrophysicist Jayant Narlikar will be presiding over the annual literary festival that will be hosted by Lokhitwadi Mandal, Nashik, this time. Convener and chief executive Jaiprakash Jategaonkar said the decision to shift venue from Gokhale Education Society to Bhujbal Knowledge City was taken after considering the government’s decision against organising programmes in the open, restarting of educational institutions and the convenience for the guests coming to Nashik. “At the new venue, we have a large number of halls and amphitheatres that will enable us to the conduct the three-day literary festival safely and comfortably. The well-constructed building would also facilitate accommodation of guests and exhibition of books, various art, conduct of seminars,” Jategaonkar added. Jategaonkar added that hosting the event on the outskirts of the city would also benefit in traffic management. “The people coming from outside the city can directly reach the institution, which is close to the highway. Besides, buses would be arranged for free travel from various parts of the city to the venue and back,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/3-day-94th-marathi-literary-festival-to-start-on-dec-3/articleshow/87263033.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||2021 records 5th most delayed withdrawal||Panaji: In view of significant reduction in rainfall activity over most parts of the country, the India meteorological department (IMD) on Monday announced that the southwest monsoon has withdrawn from the entire country. The complete withdrawal of monsoon over India usually takes place by October 15. The IMD’s data for the monsoon in 2021 reveals that the date of withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from the entire country is the fifth most delayed monsoon withdrawal so far. This is based on data recorded (on or after October 26) during 1975-2021. Of the five year bands, during the recent years of 2010-2021, for four years – 2010, 2016, 2020 and 2021 – late withdrawal of the monsoon was recorded. TOI had earlier reported that the southwest monsoon had withdrawn from Goa on Saturday. The normal date for the monsoon to withdraw over Goa is October 14 but it was delayed this year. The IMD attributed the delay in 2021 to the formation of a low-pressure area that recently formed along the coast of Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha. Simultaneously, with the setting in of northeasterly winds in the lower tropospheric levels, the northeast monsoon rain has commenced over extreme south peninsular India from October 25 onwards. A cyclonic circulation is likely to develop over southeast Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood on Monday. It is likely to move westwards. Under its influence, a low pressure area is likely to form over central parts of south Bay of Bengal during next 48 hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/2021-records-5th-most-delayed-withdrawal/articleshow/87265628.cms||---

Keesara police said 48-year-old government teacher Shankaramma, who was the wife of Hyderabad assistant commissioner of police (Cyber Crime) KVM Prasad, his nephew Bala Krishna Murthy,48, and his wife Renuka,42, died in the mishap. Krishna Murthy and Renuka’s son K Bhaskar, 21, a student, escaped with minor injuries. Shankaramma and Renuka died on the spot, while Krishna Murthy succumbed to injuries at a local hospital. Four members — Shankaramma, Krishna Murthy, Renuka and Bhaskar — went to Chirala in Andhra Pradesh to attend a relative’s marriage. At 10.30 pm on Sunday, the four started their return journey in Krishna Murthy’s car. Around 4.30am, when the car was on ORR at Yadgarpally, an unknown vehicle suddenly switched lanes. Krishna Murthy, who was at the wheel, to avoid hitting the vehicle veered the car to the right and crashed into the median. Shankaramma and Renuka, who were on the rear passenger seat, died on the spot, police said. On getting information about the mishap, local patrolling vehicle reached the spot and shifted the injured to hospital.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Rain havoc: Opposition slams Kerala govt, minister blames IMD||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The opposition slammed the government on Monday by citing serious lapses in issuing a timely warning to people when landslides struck Idukki and Kottayam last week and claimed 55 lives. Government countered the charges by alleging that it had acted on IMD’s inputs and no warning about a calamity was provided by the agency in the areas the disaster happened. Opposition said that government should do an analysis on the information given by IMD without just passing it to field authorities. “Government’s duty is not to merely undertake rescue operations after a disaster. The very first page of IMD’s forecast on Oct 12 had predicted heavy rain on Oct 14, 15 and 16. This should have been analysed by the government to make appropriate forecasts. The state is yet to do flood zone mapping even after the 2018 floods,” said opposition leader VD Satheesan. He said government failed to learn from its mistakes after 2018 floods and the report of the expert committee (S&T department) wasn’t implemented. If government has no intention of implementing recommendations, why it is entrusting tasks to a committee, he asked. Satheesan said 233 quarries were given permits after the 2018 floods. “There are at least 6,000 quarries functioning in state and only one fourth of them have valid permits,” he said, adding that government must take immediate steps to control such quarries. He said no rescue operation was undertaken on day one when landslides hit Kokkayar and Kerala lacks rescue operations guidelines. Stating that the very idea of disaster management is decentralization of activities to suit the conditions of each district, Satheesan said that the lone scientific expert in disaster management department was absent at a critical time. Sekhar L Kuriakose, member secretary of state disaster management authority, was abroad on a three-month sabbatical from Oct 10. Revenue minister K Rajan said that though help was taken from agencies like IBM, Earth Networks and Skymet, IMD forecast is the only dependable one when it comes to Kerala. Red alert with the possibility of heavy rain is serious. Orange alert is also treated with equal care and when orange/red alerts are issued for a district, people are relocated to safer places and central forces are put on alert. He said that people are to be forcefully evacuated in districts where a red alert was issued. No red alert was issued on Oct 16, Rajan said. Seeking leave for adjournment motion, Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan had raised this matter saying that the people will not forgive the government for playing with their lives. The government had more than eight hours to evacuate people in places hit by landslides and it did not act, he added. Later, opposition staged a walkout after speaker MB Rajesh denied permission for the motion based on the minister’s explanation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/rain-havoc-oppn-slams-govt-min-blames-imd/articleshow/87265672.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot nod to prepare draft to bring down regularisation rates||JAIPUR: At a review meeting of the state government’s ambitious campaign ‘Shahar-2021’, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday gave nod to provide additional financial relief to small plot owners in urban areas who were willing to procure lease deeds. Urban development and housing (UDH) minster Shanti Dhariwal has been asked to fix the revise rates. For plots measuring less than 300 sqm, the state government is contemplating to reduce charges imposed during regularisation by 30% to 50%. A source said, “A meeting of the officials to examine the rates will be organised at UDH minister’s residence on Tuesday. Once the draft is finalised, nod of the CM will be sought.” Plot owners have to pay charges under eight heads to procure lease deeds. These include regularisation fee, one-time lease money, development charges, layout plan approval fee, site plan charges, basic services to urban poor charge, survey charges and others. As the six month campaign, which started on October 2, has failed to yield desired results till date, shortcomings were reviewed in the meeting chaired by the CM , UDH minister and top officials. Recently, a report was compiled after a survey by the district administration. The district collectors have highlighted that in the urban local bodies, people’s livelihood have been affected during the pandemic. This is the reason many are helpless to take lease deeds. Following this, the UDH has planning to provide more relief in rates. Source said, “This is second time in a week that CM has held a review meeting of the campaign. The focus is to provide relief to large number of people in the state living in urban areas.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cm-nod-to-prepare-draft-to-bring-down-regularisation-rates/articleshow/87265634.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand sends team to retrace 1200-km-long ‘lost’ Char Dham yatra route||DEHRADUN: A 25-member expedition team was flagged off by Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Monday to retrace a 1,200-km-long ‘walking route’ to the Char Dham shrines in the Himalayas which according to local folklore is 3,000 years old and was taken by the Pandavas. The team comprising trekking experts, personnel from the State Disaster Response Force and the forest department have started their journey from Rishikesh and are expected to return in 50 days after covering the 1,200-km distance. While the majority of the expedition would be covered on foot, the team will also use vehicles wherever the ancient route has been replaced by motorable roads. Prior to the 1940s, devotees on the annual pilgrimage to Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri used the old route to start their journey from Haridwar with a yatra guide. It would take 14 days to complete the yatra. The traditional route fell into disuse once motorable roads to the shrines were built. The path passes through forests and isn’t marked out properly, but it is dotted with 'chattis' (places where travellers took rest). According to local folklore, the trail is at least 3,000-year-old and was also taken by the Pandavas to reach the Char Dham shrines. The CM said the rediscovery of the route would give a boost to trekking and adventure sports in the state. “The team will rediscover the traditional route and then we will improve the infrastructure, such as repairing small bridges. We will also encourage homestays on this route,” Dhami said, adding it was a moment of great pride that "adventurous youngsters were going on a search to find out Uttarakhand’s old heritage.” There are various theories on which places were covered by this route. It is believed that sages took the Rishikesh-Bamori-Kathgodam-Bhimtal route while others took a diversion from Nainital and went towards Bageshwar-Adi Badri-Simli-Karnaprayag and Chamoli-Badrinath. Some historians have also written about a route from Triyuginarayan for Kedarnath. “Till at least the 1940s, pilgrims were using the old route. People used to come to Haridwar and take a bath at Har-ki-Pauri at the start of their yatra. The priests of Haridwar used to provide a gumasta (guide) to the pilgrims who would show them the way to the dhams. It took around 15 days of walking to complete the yatra of Badrinath and Kedarnath,” said anthropologist and historian Lokesh Ohri. Ohri said that half of the traditional walking route from Rishikesh to Agastyamuni is still visible. “Due to construction of roads and national highways, the other part of the route has disappeared. There are 49 stops, including chattis and villages, on the old Kedarnath route,” said Ohri. Congress MLA from Kedarnath Manoj Rawat added that chattis were situated every 5 miles (8km). “The route passed through forests and was a tough one. The places were used as night shelters or even to cook,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhand-sends-team-to-retrace-1200-km-long-lost-char-dham-yatra-route/articleshow/87264728.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan forest department eyes new safari zones to boost tourism in Sariska Tiger Reserve||JAIPUR: The state forest department is exploring possibilities to develop more zones for tourism at Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR). The famed reserve now gives access to only 5% of the area for safaris. Many stakeholders have pointed out that there are no safari zones in STR where big cats inhabit. As part of it, the department has already started work on a 17km protection route for effective monitoring. STR chief conservator of forests (CCF) R N Meena said, “Soon, proposals to develop new routes will be tabled before the local advisory committee (LAC). During a recent visit, a National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) official has also given in-principle approval to open new routes. We have developed monitoring routes before we open safari routes.” As per NTCA norms, a maximum 20% of the core/critical tiger habitat can be used for regulated tourism. In Sariska, there are many tigers in Talvriksha range, but there are no safari and monitoring zones. “The park is in close proximity of the NCR and more zones should be opened to reap the benefits,” said another forest official. Last year, on December 27, the then chief wildlife warden M L Meena had also inspected Devra, Veenuk and Siliserh forest areas and the buffer zone of Banaquilla where new tourist zones are proposed to be opened. However, the work was stalled after the code of conduct for elections came into force..LAC member Dinesh Durnai said, “The request from the forest department is to incorporate Panidhal, Raika, Loj forest regions in the tourism plan as the movement of many big cats is often recorded in these areas. At present, tigress ST-10 and tiger ST-13 are living in the same area. Similarly, ST-12 is living with three cubs,” The reserve is spread across an area of 1,281 sq km and is divided into six ranges. Though the tiger population has increased to 23, sightings are considerably poor. A source in the forest department said, “At present, there are only three zones at STR. There are times when tigers are not sighted for a week.” STR, once infamous for poaching, has scripted a remarkable success story in tiger conservation with five cubs born in the park this year. Experts believe that regulated tourism will not only improve tourism prospects, but also help in effective monitoring and tiger conservation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/forest-dept-eyes-new-safari-zones-to-boost-tourism-in-sariska-reserve/articleshow/87266267.cms||---

VHA counsels Tushar Mandlekar and Rohan Malviya pointed out to the court that as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016, the agency is mandated to lift entire biomedical waste within 48 hours. Mandlekar pleaded that for the last two months, Superb Hygienic Disposals (SHD) has not been collecting entire biomedical waste from hospitals, resulting in piling up of hazardous materials beyond the maximum permissible limit of 48 hours. The VHA stated that all hospitals are bound to pay as per norms and they are abiding by the tripartite agreement of 2004. The tripartite MoU dated September 10, 2004, signed between Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), Indian Medical Association (IMA Nagpur) and SHD is applicable for 30 years. The association pointed out that the MoU mentions that rates will be revised by 10% every year, which the hospitals have been paying regularly till now. The VHA said that as per clause 14 of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines 2016, only state advisory committee has powers to decide and revise the rates. The petitioner said that NMC’s directives, which stipulate 300gm per patient per day as the limit, needs to be looked at again and pointed out that a wet adult diaper itself weighs around 1.5kg. The so-called excess waste is well within the prescribed limit as specified in the authorization issued by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to the respective hospitals, the VHA added. The association has conveyed that the service provider having total monopoly is duty-bound and cannot stop or slow down, in line with the Biomedical Waste Management Rules 2016, thereby putting larger public interest at harm. The bench, headed by Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Pansare issued notices to all respondents — Central Pollution Control Board, MPCB, NMC, IMA and SHD. Ketki Joshi, government pleader, waived notice for the state, while Ravi Sanyal and Jemini Kasat argued for MPCB and NMC, respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/vha-moves-hc-over-biomedical-waste-cap/articleshow/87265652.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Many app-based platforms offering food, cab, parcel, grocery and other services have now become more expensive with companies revising their rate cards and increasing delivery charges. Following the petrol price hike, a bike taxi app increased the rate card by 15 per cent. “Considering the continuous increase in petrol prices, we are changing the rate card for you! Now, increase your earnings by 15 per cent and earn Rs 11 per kilometre from October 20,” read a notification from a bike taxi app to all its drivers. Consumers, predictably, have started to feel the heat. “Earlier, on a food delivery app, I used to pay Rs 20 for delivery within a 1.5 kilometre distance. Now, the delivery charges have increased to Rs 25 for the same distance, hinting at an effect of rising fuel prices,” said M Pradeep, a resident of Langar Houz. Concerned over the hike in fuel prices, many consumers have even given up on their plans of buying a pet-rol or diesel vehicle. Many are instead contemplating investing in an electric automobile now.

We are likely to complete all the studies (at the) end of November, which is when we are expecting licence. The licence for children should follow one month later… the children’s study is underway as well,” the managing director said. “We’ve already begun at-risk manufacturing for Corbevax so even as we speak we are submitting doses to Kasauli (CDL) for release. So, it is my hope that we will, at the day of launch…supply close to 10 crore doses,” she said on the sidelines of the agreement signing with the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). Biological E has received a funding of $50 million from United States government body to help it scale up capacities to manufacture over 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by 2022 end as part of the Quad initiative. Datla said that while the Phase-3 trial for adults is being conducted as a comparator study with Covishield, Bio E has also applied to the drug regulator for permission to carry out trials to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Corbevax as a booster shot to be administered to those who have already received doses of either Covishield or Covaxin. On Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing capacities, Datla said it can make about a billion doses of Corbevax per annum and about 600 million doses for Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose Covid-19 vaccine. “We can look to scale this but we’ll have to see the market dynamics next year. But we’re happy to scale it to over 2 billion doses if necessary,” she added. Corbevax has been developed by Biological E in collaboration with Houston-based Baylor College of Medicine (BCM). DFC’s partnership with Biological E will support capacity for production of more than one billion vaccine doses by the end of 2022 for India and for developing countries around the world||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bio-e-hopes-to-roll-out-corbevax-by-nov-end-with-10-crore-doses/articleshow/87265869.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Of close to 4.6 lakh candidates who had registered, 4,29,177 appeared for the examination. As per data released by Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE), no cases of malpractice were booked on the first day. The examination was conducted smoothly and peacefully without any untoward incidents, the board said. TSBIE secretary Syed Omer Jaleel said it is unclear as to why some students did not appear for the exam. “Overall, the attendance percentage was not bad as 93.5 per cent candidates appeared for the exam,” he added. In Hyderabad district, of the total 71, 562 candidates registered, 67,890 appeared while 3,672 candidates were absent for the test. The board, which had earlier promoted students of intermediate first-year to second year without conducting public examinations due to the pandemic, is now conducting first-year exams for the promoted students.

Due to certain issues between the company and the workers, no vehicles came to the city for garbage collection. Although the strike was called off in the afternoon, but piles of garbage was seen lying on the roads in Chaura Rasta, Johari Bazaar, Kishapole and many areas of Ghat Gate. Vikas Kothari, former councillor from Johari Bazaar said, “The entire market looked like garbage dumping yard on Monday. Such a sight and situation just a few days before Diwali is bad. We expect corporation to take care of this issue.” Another councillor of Ward 9, Rajat Bishnoi, said that no vehicle arrived in the city making it difficult for residents. JMC, Heritage’s health deputy commissioner, Ashish Verma said, “There was some internal dispute between the workers and the company. We talked to them about it and sorted it out. There is no problem from our side.” Company official Ummed Singh Dheerawat said that some workers started agitation, but they were convinced to return to work.

The governor also attended a special prayer led by the chief monk, T Okonoki, who presented him a memento. Monks of Nichidatsu Fujii and others also carried out an elaborate prayer on the occasion. Speaking on the occasion, the governor reminded people of the relevance of peace, non-violence, brotherhood and fraternity preached by Gautam Buddha. He said the teachings of Lord Buddha are relevant even today, especially when people are struck by different calamities, including Covid. Rajgir Buddha Vihar Society’s secretary Mahashweta Maharathi, who conducted the programme, highlighted the work and sacrifices of Lord Buddha and also the importance of the construction of Vishwa Shanti Stupa as a sign of global peace. She also read out messages of monks from Japan and other places who couldn’t visit due to Covid restrictions. She also read out a message from CM Nitish Kumar. The then Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind, who is now the President of the country, had inaugurated the function organised to mark the 50th anniversary of the construction of World Peace Pagoda in 2019. Constructed by philanthropist Nichidatsu Fujii, President V V Giri had inaugurated it on October 25, 1969 while its foundation stone was laid by the then president, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, in 1965. Governor Phagu Chauhan later visited Saddharma Vihar Temple, eco-friendly Ghora Katora lake, Nature Safari and glass bridge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/buddhas-teachings-still-relevant-bihar-governor/articleshow/87263972.cms||Farrukh Nadim

---||Hyderabad||Central govt schemes only on paper in Secunderabad Cantt||SECUNDERABAD: Several central government schemes are not being utilised by residents of Secunderabad Cantonment area, primarily because of a lack of awareness. On its official portal, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) has displayed 15 central government schemes, but only two — ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ and ‘PM Svanidhi Yojana (Street vendors Atma Nirbahar Nidhi)’ — are in operation. The dearth of publicity for the schemes and apathy of SCB officials, residents say, is to blame for the situation. Ironically, officials in the SCB said they did not know the status of a majority of the schemes or whether they were being utilised at all. Even students did not know about centrally-sponsored schemes for them. For instance, many were not aware of post-matric and pre-matric scholarships for minorities, merit-cum-means scholarship for professional and technical courses and national fellowship. “The Union defence minister Rajnath Singh said, Cantonment residents should not be deprived of welfare schemes. But here, implementation of welfare schemes remains a daydream,” said K Soujanya, a retired bank employee, and resident of Diamond Point, Bowenpally. Speaking about the importance of publicising schemes, A V Karthik, a private school teacher, said, “the SCB can organise special camps to educate people.” Social worker, T Madhusudhan, said, “If you visit the SCB office, you can’t find even one poster of a central scheme.” Agreeing to the need for more action, a former SCB board member, admitted that implementation of schemes had been poor. Key schemes such as the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) — which aims to provide basic amenities like water and sanitation — are a distant dream. The Ministry of Defence had extended this scheme to all 62 Cantonments. A marathon exercise to implement PM Svanidhi Yojana has been on for the past year, but is yet to take shape. About 1,000 street vendors have been identified, but benefits are yet to reach them. An SCB official said, “Shortage of staff and pandemic are reasons for the delay”. All welfare schemes are on the official portal and they can be availed by following due procedure, SCB officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/central-govt-schemes-only-on-paper-in-cantt/articleshow/87265812.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Veggies & meat get dearer as fuel prices continue to spiral||HYDERABAD: The impact of rising fuel prices in the city is now being felt in every household, with monthly grocery bills shooting through the roof. In the last few weeks alone, the cost of essentials like vegetables, eggs, meat and edible oil have increased substantially, rue residents. On Monday, the price of petrol in the city stood at Rs 111.91 per litre and diesel at Rs 105.7 per litre. This, with LPG cylinder price crossing the Rs 900-mark a while ago. Now, a 14.2 kg cylinder, post the latest revision, costs Rs 952 in Hyderabad — has had a domino effect on the transportation sector, which in turn has led to this massive rise in price of basic commodities. Essential vegetables such as onions, okra, tomatoes and brinjal are not available for anything less than Rs 60 to Rs 80 per kg. There has also been a marginal rise in rate of pulses. “On every commodity, there is a price rise between 50 paise and Rs 1.5 per kil0. Truck owners have increased freight charges between 10 and 15 per cent on every load of goods following hike in fuel prices,” said Hyderabad Kirana Merchants Association joint secretary, Avinash Devda. The soaring prices are not limited to vegetables alone. It is also being felt on the poultry sector where the price of chicken is skyrocketing. The cost of skinless chicken, for instance, has increased to Rs 250 per kg from less than Rs 200 in the last few weeks. The cost of egg too is now Rs 6 per piece. “The poultry sector is severely affected by the fuel price hike as we have to bear the burden of rise in prices of protein feed (soya and maize) which is transported from different states such as Madhya Pradesh. While a part of it we have passed on to consumers, we are unable to keep the cost remunerative,” said KG Anand, general manager of Venkateshwara Hatcheries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/veggies-meat-get-dearer-asfuel-prices-continue-to-spiral/articleshow/87265776.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Goa||GCCI seeks govt nod for industry to use very low sulphur fuel oil by Nov 30||Panaji: Pointing out that the deadline for industrial units to transition from furnace oil to cleaner fuels is looming, Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) urged the state government to make up its mind and notify the use of Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) by November 30. The use of furnace oil will be banned in Goa from December 31, but despite the industry asking the government to notify the alternatives, the government has kept mum. “GCCI had represented to use alternative fuel VLSFO and the same was accepted by Goa Pollution Control Board but no official notification has been released by the directorate of environment. Industries need time to make technical arrangements to change over the fuel. We have now written to the environment department to expedite the notification by November 30,” GCCI director Sanjay Amonkar said. With the government directing industries to stop the use of furnace oil and petcoke, Goa’s industrial units had requested the department of environment to permit the use of very low sulphur furnace oil (VLSFO). The state government discontinued the use of furnace oil and petcoke from July 1 but the deadline was extended to December 31. Many industrial units use furnace oil as fuel to generate captive power of 1MW to 6MW to ensure uninterrupted power supply. These firms include Mandovi Pellets, Zuari Agro Chemicals Ltd, Binani Fibre Glass and MRF. With furnace oil and petcoke being discontinued, these industrial units will have to introduce new power machinery or look at different fuels such as natural gas. Industry heads said that natural gas is not an economically viable option for furnace oil-based engines above 1MW capacity and that the time required to change the boilers, engines and other equipment would be close to two years. The sulphur content in VLSFO is 0.5% by weight as against 1% and 1.5% in the case of low-sulphur heavy stock and light diesel oil, respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/gcci-seeks-govt-nod-for-industry-to-use-very-low-sulphur-fuel-oil-by-nov-30/articleshow/87265706.cms||---

The centre has now reached a big milestone: 1 million dialysis (between 2009 and 2021). The trust, which has tied up with multiple hospitals and has set up 8 dialysis centres with 189 machines, now plans to increase its reach. About 600-800 patients benefit each day at the centres run by the trust. Despite the complexities during the pandemic peak, the trust continued its services with special permission from the government. “The centre was a lifesaver during the pandemic peak as the private hospital where I used to go in Banjara Hills had discontinued dialysis,” said a 56-year-old patient, who is now back at his regular centre. Beyond the Covid-19 logistical and medical complications, the biggest hurdle for dialysis patients has always been financing their treatment. “Kidney disease patients require dialysis weekly and for a lifetime. Many families exhaust their finances within a year of beginning dialysis. Through our outreach with doctors and hospitals, such patients are redirected to us,” said trustee Sunil Jain Pahade. To extend its reach, the trust is now planning to tie up with corporates and organisations under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) umbrella. “This will help us help many more patients,” added Jain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trust-turns-lifesaver-for-dialysis-patients-under-covid-cloud/articleshow/87265880.cms||Amrita Didyala

During the nine days of Navratri this year, Mumbai airport handled a total of 6.6 lakh passengers, which was only 20% lower than the 2019 festive traffic when the airport handled 8 lakh, shows data released by Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL). When compared to Navratri 2020, the jump in passenger traffic this year during those nine days was 134%— last year only 2.8 lakh passengers boarded departure and arrival flights during those nine days, that is. As is the trend during festivals, the number of passengers leaving the city is higher than those flying into Mumbai. “From October 7 to 15, Mumbai airport played host to over a total of 6,65,985 passengers (domestic plus international), of whom over 3,17,240 were on arrival flights and 3,48,740 on departure flights from the airport,” said MIAL.

Delhi, Bengaluru, and Goa were the top three destinations that witnessed the highest number of passenger arrivals and departures with 1.1 lakh, 55,939 and 56,983, respectively. Moreover, weekdays catered to 2.8 lakh passengers while weekends catered to 3.9 lakh, the airport said. On October 17, Mumbai airport had handled a record volume of passengers. After nearly a year and a half since the pandemic struck in 2020, Mumbai airport witnessed a record 91,904 passengers, the highest since March 23, 2020. “The Directorate General of Civil Aviation recently said there has been a 450% rise in advance bookings for Diwali week compared to the last year. With the ministry allowing airlines to operate 100% of their scheduled capacity and Diwali and Christmas season lined up in the coming months, the passenger traffic is inching towards pre-Covid days,” said MIAL.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/now-mumbai-city-airport-traffic-just-20-short-of-pre-covid-level/articleshow/87266674.cms||---

Responding to a calling attention by MLA K K Rema demanding that the government should immediately put an end to the sand mining and sea washing by Kerala Minerals and Metals Ltd and Indian Rare Earths Ltd (IREL) at Thottappally, the minister said that the demand being made is to stop an activity that have saved lakhs of lives. Even the Swaminathan commission had recommended that the width of the spillway should be increased so as to save Kuttanad. He said that the activity is being undertaken on the basis of the existing laws in the country and also keeping in mind the public interest and also added that dredging and desilting does not need prior environmental clearance. However, the reasons cited by Rama in demanding the activity should be immediately stopped, was in total contradiction to the minister’s explanation. She said that as much as 2,769-hectare land has been lost due to the dredging activities. She said that as many as 456 families have lost their houses and properties and approximately 1,600 families are on the verge of losing their residences.

---||Agra||Dengue, malaria cases up, platelets black marketed in Agra, admin orders probe||AGRA: With a rise in cases of dengue, malaria and other vector-borne disease in Agra and neighbouring districts, platelets in the area are being blackmarketed, with private hospitals and touts allegedly charging thrice the price — Rs 25,000, instead of Rs 8,000, for each dose — prompting the district administration to order a probe into the matter. Platelets can be purchased at licensed private blood banks by patients or their families while government blood banks mainly supply platelets to government hospitals. But a rise in cases of vector-borne diseases has led to waiting time of 48 hours in most of the 21 private blood banks in Agra — which also cater to neighbouring districts — forcing patients to rely on private hospitals and touts to procure platelets. Each pack of 'Single Donor Apheresis Platelets' can provide up to 60,000 platelets and is sold for between Rs 7,500 and Rs 8,000 at private blood banks. Patients, however, have alleged that hospitals are charging up to Rs 25,000 per pack. A smaller pack of 'Random Donor Platelets' which pushes up the number of platelets by 10,000 is being sold at Rs 5,000 against its cost of Rs 900, patients have alleged. Taking cognisance of the complaints, Agra district administration has now directed the health department to ensure blood, platelets and plasma is not provided to anyone without a valid lab report mentioning the low platelet count of the patient. The health department and drug administration have also been ordered to check records of hospitals and blood banks and take action in cases where black marketing is suspected. Drug inspector R K Sharma told TOI that blood banks have been asked to paste platelet charges and helpline numbers following complaints of black marketing. “Their records have also been sought. All complaints are being investigated," Sharma said. Chief medical officer of Agra district, A K Srivastava, added that special teams have been constituted to check records of private hospitals. “Officials will also conduct inspections at private hospitals.” According to the health department officials, over 6,000 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Agra division in two months. Of these, 49,00 were in Firozabad district, 690 in Mathura, 460 in Agra and 210 in Mainpuri. A few cases of malaria and scrub typhus have also been reported. Braj Mohan Agarwal, director of a blood bank, alleged that touts and private hospitals were taking advantage of the situation. Akhilesh Agarwal, director of another blood bank, said increase in demand had led to the cases of black marketing. “The demand for platelets has increased by 10 times in the last two weeks. Besides Agra, there is a surge in demand for platelets from neighbouring districts. We are operating at full capacity but not able to fulfil the demand. We urge people to come and donate blood so that patients can get the required treatment,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/dengue-malaria-cases-up-platelets-black-marketed-in-agra-admin-orders-probe/articleshow/87264792.cms||Deepak Lavania

The scheme has been reintroduced since several family members who could not claim any benefits then due to lack of documents will get a chance to apply for the same. “The revival of the scheme would help those who went missing and seven years have passed to the incident,” said a source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/state-govt-reintroduces-2013-ukhand-tragedy-aid/articleshow/87265701.cms||---

Paritosh Verma, sub-divisional magistrate of Kapkot (Bageshwar), confirmed to TOI that the rescue team of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) has found five bodies near Devikund, but they could not be retrieved due to bad weather. On Friday as well, an aerial survey had detected five bodies in the region believed to belong to the missing trekkers. While five trekkers were from West Bengal, a tourist guide, Khilaf Singh, accompanying them was a resident of Kapkot tehsil. On Monday, Singh’s brother, Anand, met Bageshwar district magistrate Vineet Kumar. “The DM said rescue operations will continue and we will be updated soon," he said. Former MLA from Kapkot, Lalit Farswan, meanwhile, expressed anger at what he said was a “slow pace of search operations”. On Saturday, Farswan had formed his own search team, roping in 40 local residents and sending them off to retrieve the bodies on the glacier route at over 4,000 metres. The district administration, however, intercepted them on their journey and sent the team back. “They were stopped at Jatoli and only five people were allowed to join the SDRF team and aid in rescue efforts. If the authorities had allowed the team to proceed, they would have found the trekkers by now,” Farswan told TOI. Farswan added that he had set up his own team due to “negligence” of the district administration in conducting the rescue efforts. The search operations for the trekkers were started after a porter, Harak Singh, accompanying the team had returned from the trek and informed the administration that the team members had been caught in a snowstorm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/search-op-fails-to-find-6-missing-trekkers-ex-mla-forms-own-team-for-rescue-sent-back/articleshow/87264811.cms||---

The government has sought legal opinion on this and also informed the Intelligence Bureau that it has not been able to trace him. “The government is building a case in order to declare Singh an absconder,” sources said. Earlier, Chandiwal Commission had issued bailable warrants twice to secure his presence. The state CID was entrusted with executing the warrant but could not trace him. The commission is probing Singh’s letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in which he had levelled corruption allegations at former home minister Anil Deshmukh. Two days ago, Singh had informed the commission through a person holding his power of attorney that it would not be possible for him to attend the hearings because of limited mobility and health issues. The state CID had issued a lookout notice against Singh. State home minister Dilip Walse Patil had said the government had launched a search for Singh and had sought the help of the Centre. Singh faces five FIRs in the state, mainly on extortion charges. Two open inquiries have also been initiated against him by the anti-corruption bureau pertaining to corruption allegations made against him by two serving police inspectors. A few days ago, Thackeray made a dig at Singh’s missing status by saying, “Justice DY Chandrachud pointed out that a case is pending in Maharashtra since 1958 as the accused is absconding.

The train took three rounds on the 650-metre-long test-track and thus ran 3,900 metres. Its testing is being done ahead of its RDSO trial on the main track scheduled to be held in mid-November. Once the trial is successful, the dream of Kanpur to have Metro train service will come true. Kanpur Metro train is likely to start commercial operation either in the end of December or early January. The testing of the train was also successful on Tuesday. Scores of Metro staff were present to witness the train chugging. They said the dream has become a reality because of their hard work done in the last two years. Managing director, UPMRC, Kumar Keshav said, "Kanpur Metro ran on the test track in the depot on Monday evening. It is extremely satisfying and fulfils the achievement of the UPMRC team." There is no substitute for hard work, he said and added "We will be achieving bigger goals in the next few months". The three-coach Metro train looked exceptionally beautiful when it started moving on the test-trial after the driver buzzed its horn and switched on its headlight. The Metro staff clicked photos and even made videos of the moment. Each Metro train will have a capacity of 974 passengers. As many as eight Metro trains will run on the priority corridor after the Metro services are launched officially. These trains will run on the 9-km-long priority corridor between IIT and Motijheel.

So far, only Uttar Pradesh has imposed a stock limit while Haryana, Gujarat and Rajasthan are in the final stages of fixing the limit. Another nine states have already initiated the process, which is aimed at putting a check on hoarding and artificially jacking up prices of the edible oil. The food ministry on Monday held review meeting on the stock limit issue with states and Union territories representatives. The data collated by the consumer affairs ministry shows that groundnut, soya and sunflower oils were selling at Rs 182, Rs 155 and Rs 169 a litre respectively on Monday. The prices were the same a month back, prior to the major reduction in import duty. The average price of mustard oil has increased to Rs 185 a litre compared to Rs 183 a month back. Similarly, palm oil was selling at Rs 133 a kg on Monday, an increase of Rs 2 over last month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/edible-oil-prices-head-north-only-up-has-enforced-limit-on-stocks/articleshow/87267188.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Goa||Residents object to additional construction on Vainguinim beach||Panaji: Vainguinim locals have now objected to the permission given by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) to the starred hotel to restore an old mini-deck and pathway enabling it to start watersports activities at the beach. They said that a hotel cannot be allowed to construct such structures on a public beach. The nod for the new structures was given while a dispute is still ongoing between the locals and the starred hotel over construction of an alleged illegal wall on the public beach at Vainguinim. The residents said that the starred hotel, through the wall on the beach and the structures for watersports activities, is trying to usurp the public beach. Vainguinim Valley Residents Association (VVRA) president Collin Curry said that the hotel has already begun constructing the mini-deck and other structures to start watersports activities, even before they could obtain permissions from the GCZMA. The VVRA had written to the GCZMA in June this year, attaching photographic evidence of the CRZ violation by the starred hotel. The residents said that while the old mini-deck was made of wood, the new structure uses concrete and metal in violation of CRZ norms. “The swimming pool deck is a permanent structure constructed using cement, concrete and metal and is overhanging on the beach to an extent of four meters or thereabout, and as such is an encroachment over a public space,” Curry said. The residents said that an inspection carried out for the GCZMA by a member of the authority has led to submission of a report, where facts are very different from those on the ground. “Considering the nature of Vainguinim beach, anchoring arrangements and installation of floating pontoons and related activities will cause immense damage and degradation of the beach,” Curry said. He also said that installing such structures on a public beach will affect the rights of the public to access the beach.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/residents-object-to-additional-construction-on-vainguinim-beach/articleshow/87265764.cms||---

While 30-year-old Lavlesh Dharmraj Pal died on Sunday around 1 pm, 40-year-old Sanjay Maurya succumbed at 11.15 am on Monday. Six construction site workers — originally from Uttar Pradesh, but staying in Nashik for the past six years — were residing at a rented house in Kumavat Nagar. All six had suffered burns in the explosion on Friday morning. On Thursday night, one of them had forgotten to switch off the gas stove properly. On Friday morning, when one of them lit a matchstick, the explosion occurred. The workers were rushed to the Nashik civil hospital by the residents of the area. Medical officials in the burns ward said four of the surviving patients are still hospitalised. While two are stable, the condition of the remaining two is critical.

---||Nagpur||China coal shortage: Weed killers, pesticides costlier||Nagpur: Shortage of coal leading to power cuts in China and stricter monitoring of environment there has made glyphosate — the controversial chemical used to make herbicides of different brands seen as quick remedy by farmers in India — costly. Acephate, a pesticide used by cotton growers, has also become costlier due to similar reasons. Glyphosate is reported to be widely used by farmers growing unauthorized herbicide-tolerant cotton. Roundup as it is known in the common terms, glyphosate is used to clear weeds from the farms. The increase in prices of glyphosate coincides with the farm workers also demanding higher wages this year. Despite the controversies over alleged cancer risks due to the chemical, glyphosate is seen as a cheaper alternative to manual removing of weeds by engaging labourers. Market sources said a bottle of glyphosate is now costing over Rs425 as against Rs300 to Rs340 earlier. Fresh stock has been priced at Rs435. Farmers end up spending Rs4,000-odd on glyphosate on an average. The cost increases with the land holdings. A bottle of Acephate now costs Rs950 as against Rs650 earlier. The reasons are the same. Pankaj Bothra of M/s Bothra Agro in Yavatmal said by the time rates actually shot up, farmers had finished spraying. However, it may have impact in the input cost next season. Higher rainfall this year has led to major overgrowth in the fields. Farmers also have to clear the fields of cotton and soyabean plants to clear the land for rabi cultivation. For this, glyphosate will be needed in a substantial quantity. Sources say the industry depends on Chinese imports for making both herbicides and pesticides. Yellow phosphorus is a major raw material going into glyphosate. Shortage of coal has hit the manufacturing of yellow phosphorus, in turn, increasing the cost for Indian manufacturers. An industry veteran shared a note which says Chinese government has increased inspections for environment protection there. This has also affected the production of yellow phosphorus, apart from power cuts. Supply bottlenecks in China has also led to increase in the cost of raw materials of pesticides across the board. A note shared by an official of a leading domestic manufacturer shows an average price increase of 50% in the ingredients used in making almost 18 types of pesticide molecules. The impact has not been passed on to the farmers in most of the products yet. However, there are chances that the MRP may be hiked by 20% in the coming days. Once the MRP is revised, there is little chance for the rates to be brought down even after the situation normalizes, said the source. Harish Mehta, a senior advisor of Crop Care Federation of India (CCFI), said prices of only those molecules that have limited or no production in India have surged. Major MNCs have their units in China and see it as an opportune moment to build up the inventory and exploit the situation. “The situation again highlights the need to focus on make in India and also include agrochemicals in the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme delinking the product from petrochemicals. This will encourage indigenous manufacturing,” said Mehta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/china-coal-shortage-weed-killers-pesticides-costlier/articleshow/87265757.cms||Shishir Arya

Eighteen schools including primary, middle, high and higher secondary require classrooms, benches and desks, toilets, laboratory, compound wall, kitchen, toilets and a fresh coat of paint. Thirty-two urban primary health centres require toilets, flooring, mosquito nets, new doors, medical equipment, operation theatres and stretchers. Public contribution is also sought to repair 46 traffic islands and medians. A PowerPoint presentation was given to activists and representatives of the business community recently and many of them evinced interest to take up projects using their corporate social responsibility fund, a corporation official said. “Residents can also chip in by contributing to the development of a public amenity in their locality. Under the scheme, one has to spend one-third of the project, while the rest will be contributed by the government and the civic body. If residents come forward to contribute around 50% of the project cost, they can carry out the project,” he said. Another official said that works such as renovation of water bodies, formation of parks, playgrounds, traffic islands, fountains and street lights, installation of CCTV cameras in public places, installation of energy-efficient street lights and solar lights, construction of libraries and knowledge centres are also allowed under the scheme. For renovation of water bodies and strengthening of bunds, at least half of the fund should be public contribution. “Construction of bridges, culverts, stormwater drains, tree planting and installation of tree guards, and construction of crematoria are also allowed under the scheme,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/help-sought-to-create-community-infra/articleshow/87265761.cms||---

The vehicle owner has to apply by filling up Form 60 and furnish valid employment ID/proof online. The state authorities will verify the proof and assign the ‘BH’ registration. The registration number will be randomly generated by the computer, officials said. Registration will be a digital process. “Until now, according to the Motor Vehicle Act 1988, a vehicle registered in a state, when kept in another state for a period of more than 12 months, is subject to assignment of new registration,” Patil said. He added that the registration process, which was tedious, has now been done away with after the launch of BH-series The format of the registration number, and on the plate would feature the year of registration, the BH code, followed by an alphanumeric suffix with four numbers and two letters. So for a vehicle registered in 2021, it would read “21 BH 0000 AA”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bh-number-plate-for-vehicles-moving-in-and-out-of-state/articleshow/87265770.cms||Somit Sen
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Sting operation intensified to check dengue cases in Mansarovar||JAIPUR: Anti-larvae activities in Mansarovar, which is the worst-affected dengue area in urban Jaipur because of a large number of breeding spots, has been intensified. Teams conducting surveys in houses have found dengue larvae in vases, plates placed under flower pots and tanks. Officials said dengue is preventable as the Aedes mosquito does not breed in polluted water and drains but in clean water. It takes 7-8 days for the eggs to become a mosquito. The health department is conducting door-to-door surveys in the houses. The surveys will be intensified as the health department is roping nursing students for conducting surveys in the area. Officials are also appealing to people to conduct anti-larvae activities in their houses as an adult Aedes mosquito can fly 300 metres and the only option for preventing dengue is to stop breeding. Even Jaipur Municipal Corporation teams are conducting fogging in several areas to kill mosquitoes. Amid rising cases of dengue in Mansarovar, residents of the area are reaching clinics and diagnostic centres for diagnosis. Health department teams are also reaching houses in the areas to make people aware on preventing dengue. “Breeding ground for Aedes mosquito is clean water in houses. If we do not allow breeding of Aedes in our houses, we will be able to prevent dengue transmission. It is quite simple. We have to remove water from utensils, buckets, flower vases and pots. We need to dry them once a weekand refill it again. This is how we can prevent breeding in our houses,” said Dr Hansraj Bhadaliya, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-II). Dr Bhadaliya said an Aedes mosquito cannot transmit dengue until it bites an infected dengue patient. For transmitting dengue, Aedes mosquito first bites a dengue patient and then it bites a healthy person.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/sting-op-intensified-to-check-dengue-cases-in-mansarovar/articleshow/87265763.cms||---

A gang decamped with 50 sovereigns of gold ornaments and Rs 2 lakh from a retired government employee’s house on Kannan Nagar at K Vadamadurai in Thudiyalur on Sunday night. Houseowner T Karikalan, 59, a retired public works department official, had left for Salem with his family on Saturday to attend a function. The family returned around 11pm on Sunday to find the front door lock broken and the valuables missing. A team from the Thudiyalur police station inspected the house. Fingerprint bureau sub-inspectors lifted some prints from the crime scene. A sniffer dog was also pressed into service. On Saturday, four diamond necklaces worth Rs 1.30 crore and gold jewellery worth Rs 30 lakh were stolen from a villa at Gounder Mills.

---||Ahmedabad||Cheers! Ahmedabad’s IPL dry spell ends||AHMEDABAD: Ashish Umraniya, a city-based labour contractor, was following news of the IPL auction closely. “As a cricket fan, I was hoping a franchise would come to Aapnu Amdavad. While the buzz was strong, the Pakistan match showed that anything can happen. The news finally gave us something to cheer about after a sour Sunday,” said Umraniya, who has seldom missed matches at Motera Stadium – now the Narendra Modi Stadium – and has even travelled with friends to Rajkot and Vadodara for international matches. He echoed the sentiments of many in our cricket-crazy city as the BCCI on Monday formalized the addition of two new IPL teams, from Ahmedabad and Lucknow. Aficionados used to travel as far as Mumbai to catch T20 action over the years and had cheered for the Gujarat Lions, when the team was introduced earlier. “We boast of the biggest cricket stadium of the world. It was natural that the action would come here – otherwise the cricketing world would be missing something. I had been to the stadium earlier and the thunderous cheers can give anyone goosebumps. I will surely be part of the action from the first game itself,” said Samir Sikligar, a professional associated with a private university. The stadium at Motera has witnessed many cricket landmarks including Sunil Gavaskar’s 10,000th run, Kapil Dev’s 9/83 against the West Indies, India’s breathtaking game against Australia in the 2011 World Cup which knocked Australia out, and the first pink ball Test to name a few. The venue is also going to host India’s 1,000th ODI this year, which is the highest for any cricket-playing nation. The glitzy tourney is also great news for budding players, say cricket coaches in the city. Deval Lathigara, a coach, said he’s happy about the game coming home. “This will only yield results if it gives a platform to local talent, helps groom them by having them rub shoulders with the greats and play against them in the nets,” he said, adding that it will also draw spectators from across the country. Old-timers also have a word of caution. M S Qureshi, the pioneer of cricket coaching in the city who began his journey in 1977, said that the craze should be balanced with equal emphasis on other formats. “The fast game may excite viewers, but it changes the techniques of players who concentrate on short-term gains. While the move will is surely make the game more popular, it’s also an opportunity to carve out well-rounded players,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/citys-ipl-dry-spell-ends/articleshow/87265773.cms||---

Some of the farmers even blocked the highway. The agitated farmers are seen indulging in various kinds of unruly behaviour with police and administration. On Monday hundreds of farmers tried to stop a truck load of manure heading to some other destination and tried to download the truck at the spot. Police swung into action along with some of the administrative officers who were present there and somehow calmed the farmers and persuaded them to let the truck go. On Sunday in a video that went viral, an elderly farmer Narhat was seen slapping a police inspector during an agitation of hundreds of farmers. The matter was later on calmed down after the intervention of senior officials. Likewise in Madawra, police had to resort to mild lathi charge on a group of agitating farmers in, which few sustained injuries. After this the situation was brought into control. For over a week, thousands of farmers in various parts of Bundelkhand are running from pillar to post waiting for hours to get DAP and urea for sowing. On Friday, a 52-year-old farmer of village Nayagaon had died of heart attack while standing in front of various shops for obtaining manure. The sudden escalation in the demand has shot up because of good rains a week ago in the region which has preponed the sowing activity in farms for which DAP and urea is essential. The farmers are mainly in haste so that they can sow the seeds before the land gets dry. This will prevent them in spending money in pre sowing irrigation of the farms. As per DM Lalitpur, Unnavi Dinesh Kumar, more racks of manure are expected to arrive in next couple of days which will help in normalising the situation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/manure-shortage-crisis-continues-in-lalitpur/articleshow/87264853.cms||---

They underwent rigorous training to clock up to 180km/day. Although they could not finish the trip in 15 days due to bad weather, they are hopeful of entering the Asian Book of Records and Limca Book of Records.“We initially wanted to visit Khardung La, but decided on the war memorial after watching Shershaah. We dedicated the trip to Vikram Batra, who captured point 5140 during the Kargil war,” Surender told TOI.They reached Khardung La in a vehicle and from there, pedalled to Leh. “We had carried 5,000 seed balls and dispersed them on the way.

---||Mumbai||Classification of AY.4.2 forces Indian scientists into a huddle, to meet today||MUMBAI: Indian scientists working on the INSACOG project sequencing the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus are likely to meet on Tuesday to discuss the “confusion” over classification of Delta’s various derivatives, especially AY.4.2 that is feared to be causing the current surge in Europe. “There are technical issues involved that need to be discussed so that everyone working in INSACOG are on the same page,” said National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) director Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh. After the discussion, scientists working on the genome sequencing will be able to gauge the spread of AY.4.2 in India, he added. Information on the international data-sharing platform GISAID ahows 17 AY.4.2 cases have been reportedly found in India, including one in Maharashtra. But Dr Vinod Scaria of the Insititute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB, which is a part of INSACOG), said on social media that “manual check of the sequences in GISAID suggests none of the sequences meet the PHE UK criteria for AY.4.2. Conclusion: the 17 sequences are unlikely to be AY.4.2 and possibly a misclassification”. In TOI’s October 24 edition, IGIB director Dr Anurag Agrawal had said AY.4.2 has been detected in India as per the new definition drawn up by the UK health authorities. However, it accounts for less than 0.1% of samples surveyed, he added. The Delta variant that sparked the second wave in India has developed 55 lineages over the past few months. “The UK health authorities changed the definition of AY.4.2 last week and now INSACOG scientists have to either agree or disagree on it,” Dr Singh told TOI on Monday. AY.4.2 has caused global panic as its growth rate is 10%-17% faster than Delta; AY.4.2 has been identified in several countries, including the UK, the US, Israel and Russia. “Whether we have AY.4.2 or not, we have to remain vigilant. Most waves that begin globally reach India about 45 to 60 days later,” said Dr Singh. “And while we bore the brunt of the Delta variant earlier and have been comfortable for the last four months due to the immunity we have since developed, we have the Diwali festival and the winter ahead of us,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-classification-of-ay-4-2-forces-indian-scientists-into-a-huddle-to-meet-today/articleshow/87266695.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: 100% 1st-dose vaccination in 45+ group||KOLHAPUR: In a significant achievement, Kolhapur’s health administration has administered at least one dose of the Covid vaccine to all the beneficiaries aged 45 years or more. The authorities claim the second dose vaccination of the 45+ population too is going on at full speed and by end of next month, all eligible beneficiaries in that category will be fully vaccinated. The achievement came in the past two days. So far, no other district in south Maharashtra has touched 100% first dose vaccination for the above 45 years category. As per the 2011 Census, the district has 6.8 lakh beneficiaries in the 45-59 segment, and 4.8 lakh who are aged 60 years or more. Around 6.9 lakh citizens in the 45-59 years age group, and 5.3 lakh elderly people have received the first dose. The administration claims that the figures are high because the population have been increased in the past 10 years. The targets were fixed based on the 2011 Census data. Also, many people from other districts too have got the jabs in Kolhapur in the initial days when the district had adequate number of doses. Yogesh Sale, the district health officer said, “We have administered both doses to 61% of the population in the 45-59 years group and 78% of those above 60 years. We had gathered the details of the beneficiaries according to their age through ASHA workers. As per the stats provided by them, all beneficiaries above the age of 45 years in the district have received at least the first jab.” The authorities claim they have started second dose vaccination of the vulnerable population (those with comorbidities). Such beneficiaries are now called first to get their second jabs. The healthcare workers and frontline workers are already fully vaccinated. “The vaccine hesitancy in the 18-44 years group is a cause of worry. Around 61% of 18-44 beneficiaries have got the first dose, but only 6% of them have been fully vaccinated. These are students or workers. They have to step outside for their routine work and therefore we are organising camps to get them fully vaccinated as soon as possible,” said Sale.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/kolhapur-100-1st-dose-vaccination-in-45-group/articleshow/87263176.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Banning idol immersion helps retain quality of water bodies||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) decision of barricading major city lakes to stop people from immersions during ganpati and devi festivities seems to have paid off. In a rarity, the water quality of Futala, Gandhisagar and Sonegaon lakes remained unchanged even after the visarjans. This fact came to the fore in the water monitoring campaign jointly carried out by city-based NGO Green Vigil Foundation and Washington DC-based organization EarthEcho International. Conducted annually, the campaign focuses on monitoring the condition of lakes in the city and analyzing the impact of immersions on the water bodies. Monitoring is done thrice a year — from February and until post immersions. This year’s data showed a significant positive change. The dissolved oxygen level of Futala Lake, which would usually drop drastically after immersions, remained totally unchanged at 4.5 milligrams per litre (mg/l). Dissolved oxygen, which refers to microscopic bubbles of gaseous oxygen mixed in water, is an important indicator about the health of a water body. Post 2014, the level of this parameter would drop to as low as 3.5 mg/l in Futala when idol immersions would be carried out in the lake. Gandhisagar and Sonegaon lakes also look healthy, indicating that the civic body’s efforts to protect water bodies yielded fruitful results. The three lakes didn’t witness much change in the turbidity too, which is presence of suspended solids. After analyzing the water samples, Surbhi Jaiswal, team leader at Green Vigil Foundation, said, “NMC took a major step by barricading all the major lakes during ganpati and devi visarjan and hence, for the first time in a decade, there has been negligible impact. This is excellent news and also an example of how policy decisions can help to protect the environment.” However, Sakkardara Lake continues to remain in a shambles. “The water level of Sakkardara Lake is down and the maximum area of the water body is covered by water hyacinth and other weeds, which caused a dip in the dissolved oxygen level. It dropped to 3.0 mg/l. Turbidity was reported as 60 -65 JTU and pH as 7.8. It’s very important to clean Sakkardara Lake immediately to save it,” added Jaiswal. Raising concerns, the other members of the group, Mehul Kosurkar, Sheetal Choudhary and Shriya Jogey, who were also a part of water monitoring, said, “The only oxygen supply to our lakes is by atmospheric diffusion. So, in order to maintain dissolved oxygen level in our lakes, we need to install artificial oxygen supply like fountains. Along with beautifying lakes, conserving the lake ecosystem is of utmost importance.” LAKE VIEW * For the first time in a decade, negligible impact on 3 lakes post visarjan * Dissolved oxygen, turbidity of Futala, Sonegaon and Gandhisagar lakes remained unchanged * Sakkardara Lake in bad condition * Water level of lake low * Water body covered in hyacinth||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/banning-idol-immersion-helps-retain-quality-of-water-bodies/articleshow/87265767.cms||Manka Behl

The accused was detained from the spot on Sunday itself but was arrested completing all formalities. After killing the woman, the accused clung on to the body until police came. The accused identified as Ganesh Meena (21) has been making advances towards Shantidevi (32) for a long time. Jalore SP Harsh Vardhan Agarwalla said, “The accused was an daily wager and had been after Shantidevi for quite some time. She worked as a MNREGA worker and had reached the site Jojawar Nadi with other women on Sunday morning as usual. Ganesh approached her with an axe in his hands and proposed her. The woman asked him to stay away.” “According to eye witnesses, Ganesh got furious and warned her that he would kill her. In a fit of rage, he kept striking on her with the axe until she fell down. After this, he clung on to her and remained so until police reached the spot and removed him,” said Agarwalla. He said even police had to struggle to separate him from the body. According to the officer, the incident lasted for about 45-60 minutes until police reached the spot following information from other workers. “There were many people at the site but nobody dared to intervene seeing his rage and axe”, the officer said. Police suspect that Ganesh must be drunk at the time of incident considering the ferocity he exhibited but added that the fact would only be known after the medical report of the accused. “We arrested him on Monday after preliminary interrogation and subjected him to a medical examination, report of which is being awaited”, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jodhpur/day-after-killing-woman-in-jalore-jilted-lover-arrested/articleshow/87265771.cms||---

With just over a week remaining for the festival, footfall in marketplaces has started swelling over the past few days. ACP (traffic) Sitaram Gaikwad said the rising rush of people in markets leads to traffic snarls as many indulge in haphazard parking, wrong-side driving, among others. “Taking this into account from Tuesday bandobast would be increased in marketplaces like Shalimar, CBS, Main Road, MG Road, Panchavati, Nashik Road, College Road,” Gaikwad said. “Traffic personnel would be deployed at all such points to see that the movement of traffic is free and unhindered,” he added. Shalimar, CBS and MG Road witnesses heavy traffic for most part of the day on a regular basis. However, ahead of festivals like Diwali, rush of vehicles becomes almost out of control. Same thing is observed in Raviwar Karanja, College Road, Gangapur Road and Untawadi Road where malls are situated. Gaikwad said that apart from deploying towing cranes to pick up illegally parked vehicles, traffic police would also click pics of illegally parked vehicles by special devices and send e-challans to the motorists concerned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-traffic-cops-to-deploy-extra-bandobast-in-markets/articleshow/87263192.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Locals had complained against the hotel for carrying out construction in the CRZ area, by damaging the beach at Vaddy. But the hotel representatives failed to appear for the GCZMA hearings, and the authority has now decided to serve fresh notices through the police to the hotel for the hearings. In the meantime, GCZMA has ordered the hotel to stop operating commercial activities from the alleged illegal structures. “Authority decided to issue a stop commercial activities order to the respondent in view of the demolition order issued by the village panchayat, which is on record. The police and the deputy collector, Bardez, will ensure compliance,” GCZMA said. GCZMA first received a complaint from Vaddy locals in March this year against the hotel. This was followed by another complaint by Candolim residents later in the same month. The complaints stated that the hotel had illegally carried out construction of a swimming pool with deck, balance tank for the swimming pool, sitting area, restaurant, steps in front of the restaurant stage, washrooms with wash basin and laterite flooring in front. The illegal constructions using laterite stones had been carried out by the hotel by destroying the beach, sand dunes and beach vegetation at Vaddy, Candolim, alleged locals. In August this year, another local group, Calangute Constituency Forum, filed a third complaint against the hotel. However, the hotel failed to depute a representative for the GCZMA hearing. “The authority decided to issue fresh notices on respondent (hotel) to be served through police inspector, Calangute police station,” the GCZMA said. GCZMA will be hearing the matter next on October 28. Locals had complained against the hotel for carrying out construction in CRZ area, by damaging the beach at Vaddy.

Former mayors Sandip Joshi and Nanda Jichkar, ex-deputy mayor Deepraj Pardikar, ex-water works committee chairman Vijay Zalke and former standing committee chairman Virendra Kukreja were involved in giving the waiver.The inquiry was initiated after former corporator and NCP leader Vedprakash Arya filed a complaint with Sadar police station in August. Though the city police have not filed any case yet, it handed over investigations to the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Nagpur police crime branch.Arya had alleged that all terms and conditions of the contract were framed to benefit the private firm. According to Arya, OCW was supposed to replace old meters with new and implement the 24x7 project in five years from April 1, 2012, to March 31, 2017. He said OCW failed to achieve the target and NMC revised the deadline to 2022. For the delay in completing works, a penalty of Rs54 crore was imposed on OCW for failing to replace the old meters and Rs38 crore as interest on fine.

Former Congres MLA Namdeo Usendi said that Wadettiwar could not join the andolan as he had to participate in an important meeting at Bengaluru.Around 4,000 protesters had raised a security concern for the district police in the Maoist belt of eastern Vidarbha. Though the cops were a relaxed lot after the peaceful conclusion of the morcha, some protesters are still camping at Etapalli. It’s learnt they might plan to barge into the mining site near Surjagarh to trigger a fresh protest.SP Ankit Goyal said the security bandobast has been retained and every move is being watched. “Protesters who had come from far-off places have assured to leave by morning. If they resort to any unlawful activities, then action would be initiated accordingly,” he said.Usendi, who along with zilla parishad president Ajay Kankaldwar, ZP members Sainu Gota and advocate Lalsu Narote, had led the agitation, said the protest focused on several questionable issues surrounding the project. “The government agencies and other authorities must take cognizance of local population’s concerns regarding mining and take decision keeping in mind the issues of environment, bio-diversity, and especially the particularly vulnerable tribal group,” he said.The protesters also alerted the SDM that the mining company is set to use explosives for the project but Maoists may try to loot them for their anti-national activities.“Maoists use 20 kg mine which often leaves police vehicles mangled. If they get any access to the explosives in huge quantity, it may pose a serious problem,” said Usendi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/surjagarh-protest-ends-but-mining-projects-to-face-opposition/articleshow/87264024.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Ahmedabad||‘Ahmedabad will get a festival-like atmosphere’||AHMEDABAD: A ‘festival-like atmosphere’ will engulf the city in April and May with the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Monday adding Ahmedabad as one of the two new franchises for the 2022 season. The other new franchise is Lucknow. International equity investment firm CVC Capital won the bid for the Ahmedabad franchise with a bid of Rs 5,600 crore. The Lucknow franchise was claimed by Kolkata-based business tycoon Sanjiv Goenka’s RP-SG Group for Rs 7,090 crore. In all likelihood, the Narendra Modi Stadium at Motera, the world’s biggest cricket stadium with a capacity of 1,32,000, will be the base of the new franchise. The new franchise, former cricketers told TOI, is expected to give fillip to domestic cricketers, support staff, and associated activities. BCCI junior selector Pathik Patel told TOI, “It will be nothing less than a carnival. A festival-like atmosphere will prevail in the city with a new franchise setting up base here. It will be fun for players and spectators to play at the world’s biggest cricket stadium.” In the long run, he said, Gujarat’s cricketing structure will benefit. Former Ranji coach of Gujarat Hitesh Majumdar told TOI, “The new IPL franchise will benefit local players and help the growth of domestic cricket.” “The team will have its base in the city and this will benefit coaches, physiotherapists, trainers and other cricketing support staff from city and state as those who are from the state will know the best talent,” said Majumdar, under whom Gujarat won its maiden Ranji Trophy in 2016-17. He further said, “An entire economy surrounding the new franchise will be developed, giving people associated with cricket more opportunities.” Young players from Ahmedabad and other parts of the state have a good chance to showcase their prowess in local Twenty20 events, he said, pointing out that Gujarat emerged champions in the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament, the domestic T20 tournament, in 2012-13 and 2014-15.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/city-will-get-a-festive-atmosphere/articleshow/87265795.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Over 1 lakh Mumbai college students unvaxxed, only 4,000 take jabs||MUMBAI: In a special immunisation drive aimed at students of higher educational institutions on Monday, 12,772 got vaccinated across the state. Of them, 3,920 were from Mumbai. The numbers were a dampener for the state which was hoping to vaccinate 28,000 on Day One. There are roughly 5,000 colleges under the higher and technical education department, including polytechnics, ITIs, professional colleges and other affiliated institutions which cover nearly 40 lakh students who are over 18 years. In a bid to boost vaccination, the Maharashtra government had announced a week-long special focus drive — Mission Yuva Swasth Abhiyaan — for students across campuses from October 25 to November 2. The choice of vaccine will depend on availability. Data collected by colleges of Mumbai show that to date, about 50,000 students of the city and suburbs have taken their first shot, another 70,000 are fully vaccinated but over a lakh (1.02 lakh) are yet to receive their first dose. Higher education minister Uday Samant told TOI preliminary raw estimates show 60% students in higher education are vaccinated. “The drive will see at least 5-7 lakh students getting vaccinated,” he added. Around 55 colleges affiliated to Mumbai University held the special drive on Monday. In Mumbai city and suburbs, 3,920 students in 16 colleges took their shots. The numbers will pick up in two to three days, said officials. “In many colleges, exams for second year students are going on. Hence, they are not opting for vaccination now,” said a government official. MMK College in Bandra, which sent messages to all students about the drive, saw 350 register. Of them, 102 got vaccinated on Monday. “We will continue on Thursday and may hold one or two more sessions before Diwali vacation. A majority of students who registered were from our college,” said Kishore Peshori, principal, adding students from nearby colleges are welcome. The college reached out to the local ward office to hold the immunisation drive after getting a directive from the joint director’s office. Sharwari Kadam, a student from MMK College, said the drive was very smooth and time-saving. “Students should take advantage of this initiative,” she added. The college ensured both Covaxin and Covishield doses were available. In Mumbai, Rizvi, Chetana, MMK and Valia colleges conducted the special drive on Monday. A principal from a city college said many students would prefer to take vaccines from colleges near their houses. “It would be better to enable colleges to hold vaccination drives and keep it open for all students with valid identity cards. Why would students who are staying in far-flung in the suburbs travel to colleges in south Mumbai to get vaccinated?” he asked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/over-1l-mumbai-city-college-students-unvaxxed-only-4k-take-jabs/articleshow/87266716.cms||Yogita Rao

The leopard was shifted to Karunashram rescue centre at wildlife NGO ‘People For Animals’ for medical observation, said officials. The leopard will be observed for 24 hours after which it will be released into the forest following the official process, said range forest officer (RFO) Rupesh Khedkar.The leopard was spotted on the rooftop of a nearby hostel around 9am, but hid inside the drainage — which was ajar — due to the commotion around it. Acharya Vinoba Bhave rural hospital (AVBRH) CEO Abhyuday Meghe said, “Our employee told management that the leopard was on top of the hostel near Shalinitai Meghe Superspecialty hospital.”The leopard was “peacefully sitting” on the rooftop, added Meghe, but when the news spread in hospital premises, people rushed to see it. The leopard then jumped over a tree. As the road was busy and a lot of people surrounded the area, the leopard was unable to flee. It then hid in the drainage outside the road. Khedkar said, “I received a phone call around 10am and immediately called our rescue team and the team from Karunashram. After reaching the spot, we had to call the anti-riot team, police and revenue department to control the public.” The 20-member rescue team from wildlife department, 10 members from Karunashram, local police, tehsildar and anti-riot squad were deployed for the operation. Six hours later, they were successful. “We were careful to ensure the animal’s safety,” the RFO added. The wildlife department used a tranquillizer gun to administer anaesthetic injection. After the drainage was closed from both sides, the rescue team used a JCB machine to break it and get the leopard out. “As there was risk of injury to the leopard, we did it very carefully and hence, the operation took such a long time,” Khedkar said. AVBRH medical superintendent Chandrakant Mahakalkar said, “We provided oxygen to avoid any physical harm to the leopard, due to unconsciousness after the injection. With the drain closed, there was no ventilation, so we used a pipe to supply oxygen inside the drainage.” The forest department was surprised that the leopard entered such a busy area. “There is no forest area up to 40km from the Sawangi hospital. We suspect that the leopard was hungry and came in search of food. It has not harmed anyone; the viral photos and videos being circulated are fake,” Khedkar said. People For Animals secretary Ashish Goswami said, “The leopard was under stress but is fine now. We will release it as per the orders from the forest department.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/leopard-rescued-from-wardha-hospital-drainage-after-6-hour-operation/articleshow/87264037.cms||Balwant Dhage

---||Chandigarh||333 days & over 600 deaths later, struggle still strong||Bathinda: Having weathered hail, rain, heat and even bone-chilling cold over the past 333 days, the farmers’ protests underway at the doorsteps of the national capital are going on as usual, without any hint of a let-up in intensity. Farmers said though more than 600 activists had died in the protests, they were going to stay put on the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders of Delhi till the central government repealed the three contentious farm laws. Protests on the borders of Delhi will complete 11 months on Tuesday. On November 26, 2020, farmers from Punjab had reached Singhu and Tikri borders after a showdown with Haryana Police. Since then, they have been staying at the borders of Delhi. Ever since farm groups have put into motion Mission Uttar Pradesh, a campaign aimed at ensuring BJP does not come to power in the populous state, the struggle has been facing propaganda unleashed by the ruling party, said activists. In West Bengal elections too, farm activists had campaigned against the BJP. The success of a kisan mahapanchatyat at Muzzafarnagar in the past and a plan to hold another mahapanchayat in Lucknow on November 22 has added to BJP’s woes, claimed protesters. “A lot of conspiracies are being hatched to break the protest, but farmers are vigilant and countering these. The killing of a person by Nihang Sikhs at Singhu border, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar making claims that many farm organisations are in favour of the laws and struggle will die down soon, and lately claims by a group of Punjab former CM Capt Amarinder Singh that they were in touch with top leaders of farm groups and the struggle will end soon, are all part of the controversies to deflect attention and cause dissensions in farmers’ unity,” said Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Darshan Pal. SKM, a grouping of farm unions, is spearheading the agitaationa. Farmers said they expected more such things (attempts to break the stir) in future. They said the BJP government in Haryana had been doing this already, either by asking certain groups of people to demand the road to Delhi be vacated or asking its activists to prepare groups of up to 1,000 persons to attack the protesters. BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said in the past 11 months, numerous examples had come to fore showcasing the efforts of the government to weaken the mandi system while forcing farmers to indulge into a distress sale of various commodities with no support from the government. “This open loot to benefit corporates has necessitated the need for giving a guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for every commodity to every farmer; this demand is inseparable from the demand for repeal of farm laws,” he added. Box ‘Lakhimpur Kheri incident has firmed up resolve to fight’ The killing of 4 farmers at Tikunia village in Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh, while opposing BJP leaders, has further firmed up the resolve to fight, said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan, who is amongst the leaders at the forefront of the struggle. “We will keep fighting till the end without any remorse. The farmers struggle is not an ordinary protest, but a path-breaking one which has shown to the world how one only needs determination to take on mighty governments,” said Ugrahan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/333-days-over-600-deaths-later-struggle-still-strong/articleshow/87265814.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Delhi||Delhi Metro building first Metrolite corridor in bid to cut costs||NEW DELHI: In a few years from now, those driving to the northern parts of the city might find a Delhi Metro train zooming past on an adjacent lane marked off only by a fence. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is mulling the use of its conventional trains on the capital’s first Metrolite corridor between Rithala and Narela instead of trains with smaller, articulated coaches. The Metrolite corridor is part of Delhi Metro’s Phase IV project. The trains on this service will run on a nearly 22-km-long, rail-based corridor in the middle of the road, fenced off on both sides. Though no design has been finalised, the plan is to have smaller trains similar to other light rail projects around the globe because the ridership on the route is not expected to be high. “While we have firmed up the alignment, the option of what type of train to use has been kept open,” DMRC’s managing director Mangu Singh told TOI. Singh said that the typical trains used for light rail projects were designed with sharp curves, steep gradients, etc, in mind and that was why such trains had short coaches. He said that compared with a Delhi Metro coach, which is 22 metres in length, Metrolite coaches are 10-11 metres long. “Three coaches are coupled together to form one train unit,” explained Singh. “The technology is different so that shorter and articulated coaches can negotiate sharper curves. That technology, however, is actually costlier.” He added that Delhi’s Metrolite might be a cheaper system since the corridor is not likely to have sharp curves, but a fairly straight alignment. “Ultimately, keeping techno-economic considerations in mind, we realised that the conventional metro coach could be suitable,” Singh said, adding that it is probable DMRC would go for that option. Singh said that while the company could possibly use the current metro coaches, the overall concept would remain that of the Metrolite, including platforms with sheds in the middle of the road instead of big stations, ticket validators inside trains instead of automatic fare collection gates etc. This is why light rail systems cost less than half of a high-capacity system like a metro network. Singh, however, added that the choice of train was not final and DMRC would opt for the most economical alternative. In the case of a Metrolite, passengers will be able to access the platforms in the middle of the road through subways opening to both sides and the middle of the road. Singh said that while the Metrolite on Rithala-Narela route would be mostly at-grade, the second Metrolite proposed between Kirti Nagar and Dwarka Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre might have elevated sections wherever needed. Though the Lajpat Nagar-Saket G Block (7.9 km) and Inderlok-Indraprastha (12.5 km) corridors of Phase IV, both awaiting approval, were earlier being considered for the Metrolite system, they were now to be part of existing metro corridors. He said Inderlok-Indraprastha was the extension of the Green Line (Inderlok-Brigadier Hoshiyar Singh), where continuing the same system was better, while the Lajpat Nagar-Saket G Block corridor would be a ‘feeder line’ connecting three existing corridors, with its trains being parked in the Silver Line (Tughlaqabad-Aerocity) depot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/picture-this-as-you-drive-metro-train-zooming-past-just-across-the-fence/articleshow/87265863.cms||Sidharatha Roy

He assured the family members that the culprits will be booked under sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Sampla also said that Lakhbir’s daughters will get free education and money for living and the victim’s mother will get a monthly pension. The commission chairperson further added that those organisations and individuals, who had given a call of boycotting the victim’s family and those who are actually boycotting, will also be punished under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. In the viral videos, the culprits and other people can be seen saying that Lakhbir had disrespected the Sikh holy book but in reality, no video has proved that he had really did so, said Sampla. He added that the commission will summon civil administration and police authorities to ensure release of compensation amount and financial aid to Lakhbir’s family.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/national-sc-panel-announces-rs-8-25l-to-lakhbirs-family/articleshow/87265841.cms||---

This is the first-ever IPL team for any city of India's biggest state. The Kolkata-based RPSG Ventures limited bought the team at Rs 7,090 crore. Reacting to the development, former chairperson of IPL and vice-president of BCCI, Rajeev Shukla said, “It's a big achievement, a big success. I congratulate the people of Uttar Pradesh as the state didn't have any IPL team before.” Former vice-captain of the India Under-19 cricket team that won the 2012 ICC World Cup, Akshdeep Nath said, “Anyone willing to invest in the game is good for cricket in Uttar Pradesh. The crowd from the state will be more involved in the IPL. The state has huge talent and the IPL team for Lucknow will provide opportunities to local players.” Similar thoughts were shared by Manoj Singh Kushwaha, the coach of Indian woman cricketer Poonam Yadav. “With IPL team for Uttar Pradesh, I believe the day is not far when we will see a women's IPL team as well. Many congratulations to the cricketers of Uttar Pradesh for the IPL team.” Sonu Pandey, a level 2 coach of BCCI based in Lucknow said, “The IPL team of Lucknow would not only benefit players, but also the local businesses such as cricket kit manufacturers, merchandise and others. The Ekana Stadium has around 50,000 seating capacity with top quality facilities for both players and audience. Events like IPL will attract more investments.” “One can gauge the importance of the IPL team for Uttar Pradesh from the fact that the bidding margin between Lucknow and Ahmedabad was around Rs 1,500 crore,” he added. Nishant Singh, a local under-18 cricketer associated with Bijnor-based cricket academy said, “After Indian team, IPL is the next big dream. Not everyone can make it into an Indian team, but for the IPL there is huge talent at the local level. Since the IPL specialized in short format games, Lucknow has top class players for the same.” Ekna Stadium CMD Uday Sinha said, "We are happy at the introduction of the IPL team for Lucknow and Ekana as the home ground. We are thankful to Jay Shah and Rajiv Shukla as their tremendous efforts made this possible. This is a gift for not only Lucknow but for the whole UP too."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-talent-to-get-a-boost-say-cricketers/articleshow/87266366.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Till now, only GPS was installed which just gave information about the location of vehicle. However, under the new system, details such as where the vehicle went, how many houses it catered to and time spent in front of a house will all be monitored. JMC-Heritage commissioner Avadhesh Meena said, “We invited tenders on Monday. Software will be developed to keep tabs on vehicles. This will resolve the problem of irregular absence of vehicles.”This has been a long-standing problem in the city as vehicles do not cover areas for several days. Most of the time, vehicles do not cover every lane in the city. Ward 9 councillor Rajat Bishnoi said, “Vehicles come every five days to collect garbage. It doesn’t matter how many times we have complained, but the situation hasn’t changed. The entire Walled City is facing this problem.”Now it has to be seen whether the newly planned system functions properly. JMC-Greater installed cameras in landfill sites to keep a track on garbage trucks arriving. Its monitoring room was made in JMC-Greater office. However, the system has remained shut for the last two years due to non-payment money to the company. There are 250 hoopers in JMC-Heritage and 240 in JMC-Greater. The actual number of hoopers were much higher when the company responsible for garbage collection started functioning. Tussle between the corporation and company still continues although every month Rs 1.5 crore is paid by both the municipal corporations to lift garbage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/new-tech-to-track-trash-trucks-soon/articleshow/87265836.cms||---

Read AlsoDoctors wary of case spike overwhelming medical infraNEW DELHI: Low incidence of Covid-19 has made people more confident. They are going out, meeting people and shopping. It's good. What is bad is the lack of adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour. Public health experts are alarmed at the level of complacency being seen in the public, most of whomA bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna dismissed a petition to stop Covishield and Covaxin vaccination until all the stages of the clinical trials are completed as per the New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules 2019 and the National Guidelines for Gene Therapy Product Development and Clinical Trials-2019. The petitioner approached the court after his plea was not entertained by Karnataka HC. "We should not entertain such petitions. The HC is very right. Let us not cast a doubt on vaccination. It is the key to protecting our population. Even issuing notice on this petition would subject it to great mischief," the bench said. The SC said that the vaccination was being done across the world and the court would refrain from interfering in the process.

---||Thane||Thane: Waste water will have to be recycled for industrial use, says Jayant Patil||THANE: Metropolitan cities including those in Thane district that are currently facing water shortage, will henceforth have to recycle water for industrial users in order to tackle the looming water crisis in urbanised pockets, state water resources minister Jayant Patil said at a press meet. Patil made the statement following a review of the potable water supply situation in Thane district, Monday afternoon. He announced setting up of a task force led by the Thane collector to help formulate ways to solve the rising water crisis. Several metropolitan cities in the region including Mira-Bhayender, Kalyan-Dombivli and Thane city have been facing acute water shortage by the end of monsoon itself. “Growing urbanisation in the MMR including Thane has led to a spike in water requirement and existing water resources are soon likely to fall inadequate. The need of the hour is to segregate domestic and industrial use and treat and recycle waste water generated from domestic areas for industrial purposes. We cannot afford to utilise costly treated water for commercial use in times of crisis,” said Patil. Thane district consumes around 2,500 million litres of water daily (mld), which is sourced from three main reservoirs Andra, Bhatsa and Barvi. A specific quantity is allocated to each of the various agencies including the STEM, MIDC, MJP among others that further distributes a pre-fixed supply to the local government bodies. However, rising population in cities like Thane has led to a spike in demand, straining the existing supply. Meanwhile, when questioned about the crucial construction of reservoirs in the district, Patil said he has asked the department to look into fast tracking the Kalu and Shai reservoirs while he assuring the Thane corporation of the promised 100mld water supply from Barvi dam soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/mumbai-city-waste-water-will-have-to-be-recycled-for-industrial-use/articleshow/87266719.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Chandigarh||Farmers lay siege to Bathinda DAC over compensation||Bathinda: After a gap of five days, the farmer organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) resumed the protest at Bathinda district administrative complex on Monday, demanding fair compensation for aggrieved farmers whose cotton crop had been damaged in pink bollworm attack. Earlier, the protest, which continued for 15 days outside the residence of Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal at Badal village, had been lifted on October 19 with call to farmers from five districts of Bathinda, Mansa, Muktsar, Fazilka and Faridkot to assemble at Bathinda on October 25 for indefinite period. A large number of farmers, including women, laid siege to all the four gates of the district administrative complex, not allowing anyone to come out or go inside and declaring that this protest will go parallel to ongoing protests at Tikri border and 40 places across the state, including toll plazas, business establishments of certain corporates and BJP leaders. As the siege continued till evening, the farmers allowed only employees on two-wheelers to go out, but no car was allowed to go out. Farmers warned the employees that they won’t be allowed to go inside on bikes on Tuesday and declared to continue sitting at the gates even in the night. The farm organisation has been demanding Ra 60,000 per acre as compensation while the state government has shown its inability to pay more than Rs 12,000 per acre on the loss found to be over 76%. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said the state government is only shedding crocodile tears, claiming it to be sympathisers of the farmers. “But in reality, it is no less than the BJP government at the Centre in dealing with the farmers. We have calculated the costs which farmers have put in for growing cotton and government is not ready to provide the fair compensation even though it agrees with the costs of farmers,” he added. He said the protests will continue till government does not agree to pay fair compensation. The girdawari (revenue assessment) has not been completed yet and it is only after the girdawari that the quantum of loss will be known. The government has asked the district authorities to complete girdawari till October 29. Cotton has been sown in 3.03 lakh hectares in Punjab out of which half is in districts of Bathinda and Mansa where crop has been damaged. “We have also asked the government to investigate the quality of seeds and pesticides as these are suspected to be spurious,” said farm union leader Shingara Singh Mann.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/farmers-lay-siege-to-bathinda-dac-over-compensation/articleshow/87265857.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Bareilly||80 women of UP’s Katri, where dacoits once roamed, get training to make LED bulbs||BAREILLY: Eighty women from Shahjahanpur's Katri area, once known for harbouring dreaded dacoits who committed bone-chilling crimes, are now being trained on how to assemble LED bulbs and decorative lights, whose quality is as good as the ones available in the market. Competitively priced, these lights are in high demand, especially during festivals. Shahjahanpur district magistrate (DM) Indra Vikram Singh, who had spent some time with these women workers recently, also placed an order for 1,000 LED bulbs to encourage them. The Shahjahanpur unit of Indian Industries Association is providing training in an effort to help these women earn a decent living and uplift themselves economically. These women are assembling “good quality” LED bulbs -- which are on par with the branded ones available in the market -- and are selling these at Rs 50 or even Rs 35 a piece. Ashok Agarwal, national president of Indian Industries Association, told TOI, “The initiative is aimed at providing financial help to women in rural areas and also develop it as a cottage industry.” "Most of the women have acquired the skill to assemble a 9W bulb in 12-15 minutes, and are honing their skills on how to assemble strings of lights. We have two manufacturing units running at present -- one of these is located at the reserve police lines. We will soon be shifting one of our units to a village in Mirzapur. As of now, we have provided transportation to the women to come over to Shahjahanpur for training. We provide raw materials to the women. A 9W bulb is not only energy efficient but also lasts a minimum of two years. The women are selling the bulbs for Rs 50 or even less. The profit earned is shared with the women. We have not thought about branding of the product as of now, and so the product does not have a name," said Agarwal. Agarwal said, "I came to know that manufacturing of LED bulbs is an easy process. Mirzapur and Kalaan areas fall under the Katri belt, which was once infested by dacoits, and hence the area did not develop the way it should have been. Several villages taken under the Namami Gange project are in this area. Vivek Kumar, a Lucknow-based trainer was hired to shortlist the women for training. Recently, Shahjahanpur district magistrate (DM), along with senior superintendent of police (SSP) S Anand, visited our unit and also learned how to assemble a bulb, which is easy.” “We are ensuring that raw materials only from India are used so as to make quality bulbs. We will soon train these women to manufacture other items so that we are able to compete with China-made products. We are expecting more orders from other offices as the prices of our bulbs are nearly 50% less than those available in the market. Besides, there is a two-year warranty on our products," Agarwal said. Jamuna Devi, a trainee, said, “We never thought in our wildest of dreams that one day we would learn how to make LED bulbs. I feel confident now, because I know that this skill will change the fate of my family and I have many buyers in neighbouring villages.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/80-women-of-ups-katri-where-dacoits-once-roamed-get-training-to-make-led-bulbs/articleshow/87264082.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Police arrested LRD constable Atul Patel while his aide, listed bootlegger Mayur Damor, managed to escape leaving his multi-utility vehicle (MUV) behind. According to Bhiloda police, Patel was running a bootlegging business with his accomplice Damor. “They were nabbed when they were transporting the liquor in a MUV. It was surprising to see a cop with a bootlegger,” said Bhiloda police inspector Manish Vasava. Acting on a tip-off, the police had cordoned road near Dhansur village and were checking passing vehicles. This is when Patel and Damor arrived in the MUV. On checking police found Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) worth Rs 46,000. While cops nabbed Patel, bootlegger Mayur Damor who was driving the car, managed to escape.

Addressing a mammoth gathering at Mehdiganj here on Monday after launching the mission and inaugurating 28 projects of Rs 5,189 crore for Varanasi, he said: “Projects like PMABHIM, which are being rolled out as India’s major step towards holistic healthcare while keeping health and wellness a priority, should have been done after independence. But, the previous governments kept the people deprived of facilities by not developing the health infrastructure, the PM said, adding, “Most of the areas had no hospitals. If hospitals existed, they lacked the facilities for accurate diagnostic tests, surgery and critical care. This led to crowding at big hospitals at major centres and made patients and their families struggle for facilities.” “Considering these problems faced by the people, we are working round the clock to upgrade the facilities. The money, which was lost in scams, is now being utilised in development projects. We are developing infrastructure with a huge investment,” said the PM, mentioning that his mission will also create a lot of job opportunities for the youths in different sectors. The PM said that as the weak health sector had always remained a matter of concern for the poor and the middle class, a solution was needed. “Keeping this in view, there was a need for a solution that could help in combating even pandemics and also detect the disease early in order to provide timely treatment. Under PMABHIM, the health infrastructure and network at block, district, state and national levels will be strengthened with special focus on hill and North East states,” he said. “PMABHIM has three major aspects,” said Modi, adding, “it will fill critical gaps in public health infrastructure, especially in critical care facilities and primary care in both the urban and rural areas. It will provide support for 17,788 rural health and wellness centres in 10 high focus states, while 11,024 urban health and wellness centres will be established in each state for free of cost consultation, diagnostic tests and medicines. The critical care services will be available in 600 districts, where 37,000 beds are being arranged in this regard. Also, referral services will be available in 125 districts.” The second aspect of PMABHIM will enable people to have access to a full range of diagnostic services in the public healthcare system through a network of laboratories across the country. The third aspect of the mission will enable the country to combat epidemics effectively as 80 viral diagnostic labs will be upgraded while four new national institutes for virology and a regional research platform for WHO South East Asia region will be set up as a part of new network and ecosystem of research labs and viral diagnostics centres, he elaborated. The PM also spoke about the nine medical colleges for Siddharthnagar, Etah, Hardoi, Pratapgarh, Fatehpur, Deoria, Ghazipur, Mirzapur and Jaunpur he had inaugurated in Siddharthnagar before arriving in Varanasi. "In all, projects worth Rs 75,000 crore were launched in UP today. To support the advanced health infrastructure doctors and paramedical staff would be needed in high numbers. The upcoming medical colleges are going to help in increasing the number of seats for medical studies and enabling the children of poor to join medical studies. In the next 10-12 years, the nation is going to receive a number of doctors that will be more than the number of doctors that graduated out of medical colleges in the 70 years after independence," he added. Regarding the projects launched for Varanasi, he said, “In the past seven years, the image of Kashi, which had remained ignored for 70 years after independence, has improved without disturbing its soul and heart. Today, the city has good road connectivity with world-class infrastructure, Ganga has become cleaner, ghats are beautified and Banaras Hindu University has revived its old glory by emerging as one of the major hubs of technology and innovation.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/pm-launches-rs-64k-cr-projectto-fill-critical-gaps-in-health-infra/articleshow/87264944.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Students of classes one to five were greeted with visible glee by the teachers and other staff at their respective schools. That attendance remained high in most schools attested to the interest among the children to return to the campus. Balloons greeted the children, as did traditional rituals such as aarati in some schools. Teachers decided to focus more on fun and less on lessons to ensure that the children returned home happy. Truancy on campus was mostly owing to hesitation among parents to send their wards to school, or on account of their being out of town. Headmistress of Canara Higher Primary School in Urva Lalana J Shenoy said that classes one to five registered 90% attendance at her institution. “On average, we have around 45 students in each class, which we divided into three sections to ensure every child was seated at a safe distance from the other. Under this arrangement, one section will attend classes on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, while the other will come to the campus on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. We will resume full-fledged classes with the entire strength of one class from next week. We will schedule the lunch break such that there is no crowding. We have noticed that children are finding it difficult to keep their mask on throughout the day. The school will continue to send lessons on video to those opting for online classes,” Lalana said. Headmistress of St Aloysius Higher Primary School Philomena Lewis said that all the teachers had been prepared for the resumption of classes on campus. “A few students did not come to the campus since we are yet to resume operations of our school bus. We made sure that the children were taken to restrooms in turns; uniforms are not compulsory this week. In accordance with the request from parents, who have more than one child studying at our school, we retained the younger siblings till their older counterparts could join them, and they could return home together,” Philomena said. At St Theresa’s School, teachers gifted each student either a pen or a pencil. Sister Lourdes, the school principal, said, “We put up a poster to illustrate how children can greet each other, and their teachers without having to shake hands. Children can select one of the nine methods shown on the chart. Attendance in classes from one to five hovered around 60% on Monday. A few parents are still reluctant to send their kids to school. Children seem to be missing the sports classes.” Deputy director of public instruction, Dakshina Kannada Malleswamy said that attendance for classes one to five in the district was around 70% on Monday. His counterpart in Udupi NH Nagur said that the attendance at schools in that district was close to the same figure. All the safety guidelines were scrupulously followed at schools, with all children being subjected to thermal screening. Meanwhile, a few schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education deferred resumption of classes for lower primary students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/excited-teachers-welcome-kids-back-to-school-in-dk/articleshow/87264695.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Dehradun||Choppers flying too low over Kedar sanctuary: Locals||Dehradun: The residents of the villages near the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (KWLS) have approached the forest department alleging that choppers ferrying pilgrims to the Kedarnath shrine fly at low altitudes and disturb animals of the reserve. This, they say, violates the 2015 NGT order which mandates choppers to fly at an altitude of above 2,000 feet while crossing a sanctuary to avoid any disturbance to the wildlife. “All the choppers fly very close to the hills. This not only disturbs the wildlife but also the children who have returned to schools after almost two years,” read the complaint filed by Anoop Bisht, Kedarghati Mazdur Seva Samiti, Gaurikund. The application has got support from the members of the National Senior Citizen Association of Ukhimath. At present, seven heli companies operate from Guptkashi, Phata, Shersi, Rampur and Sitapur etc. helipads to ferry pilgrims to the temple. On a good weather day, these choppers on an average make a cumulative 150-170 sorties. It takes nearly 20 minutes to ferry the pilgrims from these helipads to the temple. Nearly 19,000 pilgrims have been ferried by the choppers to Kedarnath shrine since the service commenced on October 4.  The KWLS is nestled in the lap of Himalayas at an altitude above 11,000 feet and so is the Kedarnath temple. The sanctuary is home to several IUCN Red List wildlife like musk deer, Himalayan bears, snow leopards and other high altitude wildlife. A study by forest officials had stated that the high noise levels are likely to increase the "stress levels in animals, disturb their hormonal balance and prompt them to shift from the forest zone.” Amit Kanwar, DFO of KWLS division, said, “The heli companies have been told to adhere to the NGT guidelines to fly above 600 metres above the ground except during take off and landing.” In 2020, TOI had reported that forest officials had recorded 74 instances of choppers violating the norms and flying as low as 270 meters . Heli companies cite poor weather conditions to fly low in order to do maximum sorties, said a senior IFS officer at the forest headquarters in Dehradun. “Ideally, the sortie numbers should be regulated,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/choppers-flying-too-low-over-kedar-sanctuary-locals/articleshow/87264958.cms||---

The decision was taken after elected members of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), across party lines, raised the issue at the general body meeting on Monday. “A survey of these spots would be conducted. A report of these accident-prone spots would be drafted in two days and a copy of the same would be sent to the Union government as well as the state government authorities. The blind spots and other problems here would be resolved at the earliest,” said mayor Murlidhar Mohol. The corporators of PMC claimed that flaws in the flyovers’ designs and construction had led to accidents. “The Navale bridge has become an epicentre of accidents. As many as 68 people have lost their lives in accidents near this bridge, since it was constructed a few years back,” said Ajit Darekar, a Congress co-opted corporator. Corporators from other parts of the city — Warje, Bavdhan, Kondhwa, Katraj, Parvati and Peth areas — shared their observations about the flyovers and bridges in their areas. The elected members claimed there was a blame game over taking the responsibility of the accidents. They said PMC blamed the state government, while the state PWD pointed fingers at the PMC and this was delaying the repair and restoration works.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-to-conduct-survey-of-accident-prone-stretches/articleshow/87265044.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Three get life imprisonment for double murder in Rajkot||RAJKOT: Three of a family were sentenced to life imprisonment by a local court in Rajkot on Monday for the murder of two persons during a clash between two communities in Kalipat village about 8km from here in July 2011. Two others of the same family were found guilty of assault by the court that acquitted five other accused giving them the benefit of doubt. Additional session judge D A Vora convicted Dinesh Dudhrejiya (44), Suresh Dudhrejiya (38) and Chagan Dudhrejiya (49) for murder and sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for life. The court sentenced Babu Dudhrejiya to 2.5 years and Dhiru Dudhrejiya to six months in prison for assault using sharp weapons. All those convicted are cousins. According to case details, in July 2011, a religious function was held in Kalipat village. During the function, a clash broke out between two groups of different communities. Both the groups attacked each other with weapons like sticks, pipes, bill hooks and others. Mahendrasinh Jadeja (37) and Vishvajit Jadeja (21) were killed during the clash. Mahendrasinh was the father to two children — a six-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son. While Vishvajitsinh was unmarried. During the course of the trial, the prosecution submitted 160 documentary evidence out of which 103 were examined by the court. Statements of 25 witnesses were recorded, including three government doctors, and two private doctors. Special public prosecutor Anil Desai told TOI, “During the hearing I had urged the court not to show leniency as both the victims were young and were brutally murdered.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/three-get-life-imprisonment-for-double-murder-in-rajkot/articleshow/87264968.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Stadium, fans & conducive atmosphere made city a hot option||Lucknow: One of the biggest stadiums in terms of audience capacity with direct connectivity with satellite cities having densely populated fan bases for cricket, and change in perception about the state with the improvement in law and order. These may have been some factors according to industry experts over the Rs 7,090-crore bid for the Lucknow team by Kolkata-based RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group. Speaking to TOI, Sibtain Baqri, the former COO (chief operating officer) of Pune Warriors owned by the Sahara Group said, “It is a long-term investment. Decade ago, Rs 1,700 crore was considered a huge deal in IPL but today it’s comparatively nothing. Secondly, Lucknow has a large stadium where the franchisee can sell tickets and earn revenue. Unlike Chandigarh and Jaipur, the city itself is easily connected to satellite cities which have densely populated large fan bases.” Additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal said: “The state is the second biggest economy in the country, number three in number of demat accounts for share trading. People now have money to spend and watch matches in a 50,000 capacity stadium. Perception about the state has improved with a better law and order situation.” It’s important to note that due to improvement in law and order, in the 2018 investor summit held in Lucknow, the industrialists pledged to invest Rs 4.5 lakh crore in Uttar Pradesh. A big chunk of this has come on ground. “The impression of UP has changed. Earlier, license raj harassed investors, who had to wait years and years for permission. The law and order has improved, which has resulted of UP's becoming second state in the ease of doing business from 11th position two years ago," says another “Further, the city of Lucknow has shown that it can host mega events like IPL. In December 2016, men’s Junior Hockey World Cup was organized at Dhyan Chand Stadium and the city has also been hosting badminton league and hockey league. Today, more hotels have come up and direct connectivity with a large number of cities helps tourists to move around in the state,” he said. Adding further, “Historically Lucknow has been known for hockey, but the fan base of cricket in UP or in the state capital is second to none.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/stadium-fans-conducive-atmosphere-made-city-a-hot-option/articleshow/87266380.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Lucknow||PM Narendra Modi liberated UP’s ailing health sector from curse: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday compared the hitherto ailing health sector of Uttar Pradesh with ‘Ahalya’ of the Ramayana, who was “waiting for Lord Ram” to get liberated from the curse. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has just done that. His vision of a healthy and capable India is unprecedented,” Yogi said, addressing a gathering at the BSA ground in Siddharthnagar on the occasion of virtual inauguration of nine medical colleges by the PM. “The state government is committed to ensuring that no one dies due to lack of health facilities in the state. Health sector remained neglected since independence. The opening of nine medical colleges simultaneously is a tribute to those who died due to lack of medical services,” he said. “Before 1947, there were only 3-4 medical colleges in UP despite the fact that today’s Uttarakhand was also a part of the state. From 1947 to 2016, only 12 medical colleges could be set up in UP. In contrast, our government, under the guidance of PM Narendra Modi, managed to come up with 30 medical colleges in the state in just four-and-a-half years,” the CM said. He added that nine medical colleges would not only enhance health facilities but would also inspire the youth to become doctors and serve the society. “India has set a model for other countries to emulate under the visionary leadership of PM Modi by developing two vaccines in a short span of time and administering over 100 crore vaccine doses to save lives even as various developed countries battle helplessly with Covid pandemic,” Yogi said. “The impact of PM Modi’s plans was visible in the entire state. The new medical colleges bear testimony to this. In 2019, MBBS course was started at seven medical colleges of the state and today nine new medical colleges are being made operational,” he said. Yogi said the construction of 14 new medical colleges was currently underway with the cooperation of the Centre. “The idea of ‘One District-One Medical College’ is fast turning into a reality,” he said. Yogi said the PM also ensured employment and free ration to people apart from offering free vaccination for Covid. “This shows his sensitivity towards the plight of the people,” he said. “In the past, Siddharthnagar was badly hit by encephalitis which used to claim many lives. However, with improved health infrastructure, better cleanliness through construction of toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission, availability of pure drinking water and setting up of paediatric ICUs and encephalitis treatment centres, encephalitis deaths have come down by 95%,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/pm-modi-liberated-ups-ailing-health-sector-from-curse-cm/articleshow/87264979.cms||Arjumand Bano

The food and drugs administration (FDA) has collected the samples to test the seized consignment at government laboratory. Police said the consignment was allegedly procured and bought from a Chhindwara businessman, identified as Farook by Vijay Traders owner Vijay Jethani, who has been made an accused in the case. Senior inspector Vaibhav Jadhav of Jaripatka police station said the vehicle’s driver Kishan Tandekar was taken into custody, while owner Jethani is at large since the action. “The sacks of scented and flavoured tobacco were being ferried behind the milk crates. We intercepted the vehicle after specific information,” said Jadhav, adding that the action was led by zonal deputy police commissioner (DCP) Manish Kalwaniya and ACP Roshan Pandit, supervised by CP Amitesh Kumar. “We have also included the name of the Chhindwara supplier Farook in the FIR against the racketeers,” Jadhav further said, adding that there are previous records against Jethani after his consignment was intercepted by crime branch a few days ago. According to an insider, Jethani and other tobacco kingpins in the city like Anil, Bharat and Niraj had been procuring flavoured tobacco from Chhindwara and Seoni in Madhya Pradesh, where suppliers like Shankar and Farook have been providing them consignments worth crores of rupees. These consignments are brought in carrier vehicles behind sacks of grains, masala and so on, to evade interception. Apart from Nagpur, it’s learnt that Yavatmal too has become a hub of scented tobacco, due to its proximity to Madhya Pradesh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/banned-tobacco-worth-rs8-85-lakh-seized-from-milk-container-owner-absconding/articleshow/87265866.cms||Soumitra Bose

In a statement to the media, GJEPC said it has proposed the formation of a mechanism for the direct supply of natural rough diamonds by Alrosa, especially to micro, small & medium enterprises (MSMEs) in India. Estimating a stable growth this year, Alrosa anticipates diamond output of 31.5 million carats with chances of an increase to 33 million carats. On the topic of lab-grown diamonds, Alrosa reiterated that it would continue to focus on the natural diamond segment of the business and that it has no intention of entering the synthetic gems segment. “The direct sourcing of rough diamonds would help our MSME sector in a big way. We have discussed possible ways of collaboration with ALROSA, and will soon submit a plan so that our MSME sector would secure direct access to rough from the world leader in diamond mining,” said Colin Shah, chairman, GJEPC. “From Alrosa’s perspective, India remains the most important centre for manufacturing diamonds, and is the third-biggest consumer of diamond jewellery as well. I’m certain that today’s discussions will further strengthen Indo-Russian cooperation in diamonds and benefit the natural diamond pipeline at large,” stated Evgeny Agureev, deputy CEO of Alrosa.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/gjepc-seeks-direct-supply-of-roughs-to-msmes/articleshow/87265032.cms||---

Why additional charge could not be given to some other officer?” asked a bench led by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta while hearing a PIL.  On October 4, the high court appointed Dorje as special officer and sought a report on what is to be done to prevent deaths. Dorje conveyed his inability, informing that he was given two additional charges between September 25-October 24. The judges said they expected the home minister to relieve Dorje to facilitate preparation of the report. They have directed the report to be submitted on November 29.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/allow-nashik-ig-to-focus-on-malnutrition-deaths-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/87266726.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Cong holds mock bike rally, give pain balm as prize||Udupi: Congress organised a novel protest against bad roads in Karkala by holding a bike rally and awarding pain balm as prizes besides a trophy. The rally was conducted symbolically on the roads of Karkala, the constituency of energy minister V Sunil Kumar. Congress leaders alleged that roads in the town are not motorable due to potholes. Karkala Town Youth Congress Committee president and Karkala Town Municipal Council (TMC) member Shubhada Rao told TOI that the bike rally was organised on Sunday as a token of their protest since all roads in the town are suitable for a bike rally and not fit for traffic movement. “Karkala TMC has no concern for the problems of motorists in the town. People of Karkala are questioning the authorities concerned for not taking up road development works even though the MLA is a minister. Those who are elected in the name of development and people of Karnataka should understand the plight of people. Hence, we have decided to bring the pathetic plight of roads in Karkala to the notice of people’s representatives through a symbolic bike rally,” Rao said. The first, second and third prize winners of the rally were given trophies, he said. “We have also distributed pain balm along with trophies to highlight the plight of our roads that may trigger body pain after a bike ride,” he said, adding that nearly 20 participants took part in the bike rally. When contacted, Karkala TMC president Suma Keshav said the urban local body has already earmarked funds for the development of all roads in the town. “We have prepared plans and reserved funds to develop all roads in the city. Work could not be taken up only because of the continuous rains. However, we have taken up several temporary pothole filling works and major works will be taken up soon,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/cong-holds-mock-bike-rally-give-pain-balm-as-prize/articleshow/87264800.cms||---

The five locations will be identified in a day or two. The proposed five locations are CBS, Dahipul, Bytco Point, Cidco residential area and Panchavati. The Nashik regional office of MPCB also carried out noise tests of firecrackers commercially available. The tests of 15 varieties of firecrackers were carried out at one location in the city and the noise limit was between 68 and 115 decibels (dB). As per the MPCB norms, firecrackers generating noise levels exceeding 125 dB are prohibited. “We recently tested different varieties of the firecrackers which are commercially available and the noise level was found below the permissible limit,” said MPCB officials. “We have also decided to check the noise level during the four days of Diwali starting from Dhanteras to Bhaubeej. We will deploy our teams of officials and employees to check the noise pollution at the five locations which are to be finalised in a day or two. The locations are expected to be the same as last year’s,” said the officials. During Diwali last year, the MPCB had monitored noise levels during day and night.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/mpcb-to-monitor-noise-pollution-at-5-locations/articleshow/87263296.cms||Tushar Pawar

Identified as Ishant Sharma, the victim was a resident of the Gujrada locality and was brought to the rehab centre by his family five months ago. On Sunday evening, the family was informed that Ishant was being rushed to a private hospital at Haridwar road considering his deteriorating health. Later, he died during treatment. The police reached the rehabilitation centre following the death and questioned the staff. "We will be able to ascertain the cause of death only after the autopsy report comes in," said Nehru colony station officer Satbir Bisht. In August this year, four women inmates had escaped from a private rehabilitation centre. On being caught, they accused the centre's manager of rape. The involvement of a female staff had also come to light during the investigation. In another incident, 17 people undergoing treatment at a rehabilitation centre in Clement Town had also escaped from the facility due to 'ill-treatment' meted out to them by the staff.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/rehab-inmate-dies-in-hosp-probe-underway/articleshow/87264983.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Over 40k cases disposed in Aurangabad range||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad range police — comprising Aurangabad rural, Jalna, Beed and Osmanabad units — have successfully disposed over 40,000 cases pending for the past several years. This feat has been achieved by the four police units between October 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021 — making Aurangabad range set a record of having least pendency from previous years in the state. As per the obtained figures, from the year 2019 the range is left with only 22 pending criminal cases that are either related to economic offences or have been stayed by high court or Supreme Court. While from the year 2020, only 391 cases are pending, out of which several of them are pending for reports from expert agencies like forensics or complex cases in need of further investigation. Authorities said this is for the first time in the state that every single application, investigation, filing of charge sheet that were pending for decades, have been screened and filed, unless there were some legal limitations. Those privy to the work said in large number of cases, investigations were completed, but their charge sheets or summary reports were pending. It was within five days of taking charge of Aurangabad range as special inspector general of police, K M Mallikarjuna Prasanna took the task of clearing all the pendency. When contacted, Prasanna said, “Even in the thick of pandemic, our police personnel across hierarchy took consistent and conscious efforts to clear all the pendency, without compromising on quality and today we have got the least pendency in the state.” The officer said by establishing a daily evaluation system and introducing checks and balances, the four police units have filed over 34,000 charge sheets, over 4,200 A final reports, around 450 B final reports, over 600 C final reports, around 250 NC final reports and close to 200 abated summary reports. In addition to this, 11,400 accidental death reports have been filed, while out of 21,803 total pending inquiry applications, 20,500 have been finalized. Beed superintendent of police R Raja, whose unit has filed over 7,500 charge sheets in the past one year, said, “The initiative to clear all pendency has also mentally relaxed our investigation officers who were under constant pressure due to large pendency.” Echoing similar views, Jalna superintendent of police Vinayak Deshmukh said due to clearing this pendency around 90% of the investigation officers are now busy probing offences registered since January this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/over-40k-cases-disposed-in-aurangabad-range/articleshow/87263365.cms||---
---||Delhi||London dreams? Delhi HC stresses on need to strike balance, to review Street Vendors Act||NEW DELHI: Underlining the need to balance various rights, Delhi High Court on Monday decided to put to legal examination the validity of Street Vendors Act that it found to be “tilted” in favour of vendors. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked all stakeholders to remain prepared to begin arguments in connection with various facets of the Act and the rules that flow from it. The court pointed out that often it was said that Delhi must become like London but without focusing on planning, it couldn’t be achieved. The bench also acknowledged that in a mega city such as Delhi, street vending gave employment to several from the poorest strata of society, but reiterated that even those who went to markets or rent shops had rights that can’t be ignored. “You can’t even walk in places like Connaught Place and Nehru Place, where vendors have occupied spaces and set up permanent business...we had to take suo motu cognisance of the fire incident at Nehru Place because the condition is like a slum. There is a need to decide on how many vendors can be permitted in such markets,” the bench orally observed, listing the batch of petitions challenging and supporting the Act for hearing on October 30. The court also clarified that it wasn’t against street vendors but wanted to ensure everyone’s rights were respected and there was no overcrowding due to them. It had earlier flagged certain provisions of the law governing street vendors, saying they “tilt the balance” in favour of vendors at the expense of planned development of cities and indicated it would seriously consider the issue. The court had said the Act needed to be examined in light of “possible infringement of fundamental rights of the citizens who live in any city, or town, particularly, under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, while hearing petitions on squatting rights and setting up a town vending committee (TVC) in various places in the capital. It also highlighted how the “representation of the various authorities tasked with the task of local administration, including the municipal administration, police administration, public works department, etc, all put together is less than 50%” in the TVCs. In a sense, the street vending committees appear to be heavily loaded in favour of the street vendors, the court had observed giving its prima facie view that “the scheme of Street Vendors Act and the rules framed thereunder greatly tilts the balance to encourage street vending”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/london-dreams-hc-stresses-on-need-to-strike-balance-to-review-vendors-act/articleshow/87265907.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Ahmedabad||First cricket game in India was in Gujarat||Historical records reveal that the gentlemen’s game was first played in India on the western coast of the country, in the port town of Cambay, in the beginning of the 18th century. Cambay, now Khambhat, was the port nearest to Gujarat’s capital city of Ahmedabad. Historians agree that Lieutenant Clement Downing’s experience of playing cricket in Cambay is the first account of cricket on Indian soil. Lt Downing’s book, published in 1737 — ‘A Compendious History of the Indian Wars’ — has a reference to the gentleman’s game being played by sailors and watched by coolies. An East India Company fleet played the game first during a stopover at Cambay, just outside the port town. Lt Downing headed this fleet which had company officials, sailors and some soldiers. "We lay here near a fortnight before our captain returned and all the while kept a good look out; and tho’ all the country round was inhabited by the culeys, we everyday diverted ourselves with playing cricket, and other exercises, which they would come and be spectator of." Lt Downing also penned down his experience with regard to their interactions with local residents in the port town, when they went to buy a pair of bullocks. "So soon as they perceived we were coming one of the head of the town come out on horseback and demanded our business....we told him we came in friendship...he said if we behaved ourselves civilly we should have what we wanted and should be welcome to come into the town," Downing wrote.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/first-cricket-game-in-india-was-in-gujarat/articleshow/87265885.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Kiran Gosavi sends city scribes on a wild goose chase||Lucknow: Kiran Gosavi, the private detective from Mumbai who made headlines with his selfie with Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan after his arrest by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), sent the journalists in Lucknow on a wild goose chase after he announced on Monday evening that he would surrender before the Lucknow police shortly. Gosavi made the announcement while talking to Mumbai-based journalists on video calls. He said he was reaching Lucknow shortly and would surrender at the nearest police station. Asked which police station was closest to his then present location, he identified it as Madiaon. What, however, left a question mark on Gosavi’s announcement was the fact that he was wanted in a case lodged with the Pune police and Lucknow Police had neither any jurisdiction nor authority to accept his surrender or custody. However, unwilling to take any chances, television news crews and local journalists gathered at Madiaon police station. Asked why he was surrendering in Lucknow when the case had been filed with Maharashtra, KP Gosavi said he felt "threatened" and has been told that he will not be spared even if he is sent to jail. Meanwhile, Commissioner of Police (CP), Lucknow, DK Thakur told TOI that Gosavi cannot surrender at any of the police stations in Lucknow as police here have no jurisdiction to take any action against him. Senior officials did not rule out the possibility of Gosavi deliberately talking about surrendering in Lucknow to deflect the focus of the police in Maharashtra. According to reports, he has four criminal cases pending against him related to cheating (section 420 of the IPC) among other sections with the Thane, Pune and Mumbai police lodged between 2007 and 2018. Gosavi first made headlines when he was spotted whisking away Aryan Khan like an NCB sleuth following his arrest following the raid at cruise ship in connection with possession of banned drugs. His selfie with Aryan in custody also went viral raising questions over his access to the NCB setup. On Sunday, allegations of bribery were levelled against Gosavi by one Prabhakar Sail, who has identified himself as the private detective’s personal bodyguard and a witness of the NCB in the cruise case. Sail had claimed that he was present in a car when Gosavi had a telephonic conversation about pay-offs with one Sam D'Souza. On Monday, NCB declared Sail as a hostile witness.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/kiran-gosavi-sends-city-scribes-on-a-wild-goose-chase/articleshow/87266420.cms||---

A week ago, tomatoes were being sold at Rs 40 per kg in the wholesale markets, while in the retail markets it was being sold for Rs 70 per kg. On Monday, tomatoes fetched a maximum price of Rs 20 per kg in the wholesale market and Rs 50 per kg in the retail markets. Similarly, a bunch of coriander (cilantro) was sold for Rs 40 per bunch in the APMC a week ago, while the retail price was Rs 60 per bunch. Now, the wholesale and retail prices of coriander was Rs 20 and Rs 40 per bunch respectively. Though it appears that retailers are making the most of the opportunity at hand, the citizens seem to be unhappy with the fluctuating price trend. Ravi Shinde, a resident of Kasba Bawda, said, “Earlier, Rs 300 was sufficient for buying vegetables for a week for my family of three. On Sunday, I had to spend Rs 500 to buy vegetables for the entire week.

---||Nagpur||New fungal infection found in post-Covid patients||NAGPUR: While the country is witnessing decline in number of Covid-19 cases, several under-diagnosed post-Covid complications are now coming to fore. After black fungus in lungs, and yellow fungus in eyes, a difficult to diagnose complication of the dreaded virus which causes bone damage to the spinal-disc spaces has been reported in Nagpur. This infection is called aspergillus osteomyelitis. Internal medicine and critical care consultant Dr Vaibhav Agrawal informed that the cases of this infection are on a gradual increase. “We have started getting some patients in hospitals. Especially, Covid-19 recovered patients complaining of mild fever and back pain are suffering from this fungal infection, ”said Dr Agrawal. “This infection has led to severe bone damage to the spinal-disc spaces of a patient,” he added. This invasive fungal infection is extremely difficult to diagnose as it mimics spinal tuberculosis (TB). Dr Agrawal said aspergillosis is an infection caused by a type of mold or fungus called aspergillus. This fungus is commonly found in the environment but does not lead to any kind of infection in a healthy individual. However, when a person with compromised immunity or lung infection breathes in the spores, they may develop allergic reactions and lung infections due to it. “In severe cases, it can even spread to blood vessels and beyond. The symptoms of this new fungal infection depend on the type of aspergillosis a person is infected with,” he added. Infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade said aspergillosis is a well-established infection and cases were seen along with the mucormycosis outbreak post second wave of the pandemic. “Covid-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is known to doctors. Such fungal infection has been detected in mouth cavities of Covid-recovered patients, and, in rare cases, in lungs,” she said. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde claimed that half the post-Covid mucormycosis cases were actually aspergillosis. “However, the worst is now over. Those who had severe Covid and had steroids should not neglect some common symptoms of this infection,” he said. Doctors said that patients who have recovered from Covid recently, and have a persisting backache, should contact the doctor immediately and get an MRI scan done. If detected and treated early, patient might be spared the most agonising complications. The symptoms of this infection include fever and chills, shortness of breath, coughing with blood, skin lesions, and joint pain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/new-fungal-infection-found-in-post-covid-patients/articleshow/87265699.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Kolkata||Nakas, special teams to stop entry of illegal crackers in Kolkata||KOLKATA: A slew of measures — including special night checks at 28 different spots — have been put in place from Monday to stop the entry of illegal firecrackers into the city. Two special teams, including officials of the pollution control board, have been formed to carry out raids at major godowns in two shifts everyday. According to the special anti-firecracker operations plan prepared by joint commissioner (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar — a copy of which is with TOI — multiple teams will monitor markets. In addition, 18 teams of Kolkata Police will carry out surprise checks at important crossings in each of the nine divisions. Reserved Force personnel — including those from the combat unit of KP — will be accompanying these teams wherever necessary. The DD and SSPD units have already seized 1,500kgs of crackers since last month. Raids near Covid hospitals will be a priority, said a cop. “Some areas — like those near Beliaghata ID hospital and MR Bangur — have a history of creating noise pollution on the day of Diwali. Last year, we had tackled this menace through advance raids and police postings. A similar plan has been readied this year. We have been receiving similar complaints close to private hospitals, like the ones in Dhakuria and Beckbagan. We are trying to address these problems this year,” the officer added. With around 10 days to go for Kali Puja, the biggest challenge for city cops is to ensure that firecrackers from local manufacturing hubs —like Champahati and Nungi — do not enter the city for local consumption. “We have set up checkpoints at all entry points near Taratala, DH Road, NSC Bose Road and EM Bypass, among other places. We plan to check cars, trucks and even bikes. We are working in close co-ordination with the South 24 Parganas police,” said a Kolkata Police officer. To rein in several manufacturers and sellers who are now illegally trying to sell crackers at lower rates, South 24 Parganas police has formed special teams to conduct sustained raids at multiple places. “In the last few days, we have seized crackers worth several lakhs and arrested a few people for illegally selling and transporting banned crackers. We have also had meetings with the fire department and have asked them to book the unlicensed manufacturing units,” said an officer of Baruipur police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/nakas-spl-teams-to-stop-entry-of-illegal-crackers/articleshow/87265048.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Sandalwood trees stolen from NCL guesthouse in Pashan||Pune: Some men chopped and stole two sandalwood trees, collectively valued at Rs15,000, from the old guesthouse of the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) in Pashan in the early hours of Sunday. NCL senior security officer Parag Chitnavis has registered a case with the Chatushrungi police related to theft under sections 379 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The theft occurred between 2.45am and 3.15am, as per the complaint. “Three men scaled the rear compound wall to enter the guesthouse premises and, using electric cutters, chopped and stole two sandalwood trees,” Chitnavis told TOI on Monday. Chitnavis said a security guard posted at the hostel’s main gate heard the noise but was unable to see the thieves as it was dark. “After the guard raised an alarm, the thieves threw stones at him, jumped over the compound wall and slipped into the darkness.

PCMC is giving us 50 motorcycles,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash told TOI. The proposal is due for approval in Wednesday’s meeting of the standing committee of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. According to the standing committee agenda, the police had asked for vehicles fitted with GPS trackers, microphones, flashlights, sirens, and helmets. The 50 bikes will be purchased from Rs 2.34 crore collected from norm violators. Officials said the increase in patrolling will help control rising crime and traffic congestion in the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits and the industrial corridor across Hinjewadi, Chakan and Talegaon. The motorcycles will help police personnel ride through narrow lanes or slum areas, an official said. Activist Maruti Bhapkar said such initiatives were the need of the hour and would be a deterrent to criminal elements. “It will also help in maintaining the law and order situation in the civic limits. “The civic body can purchase even 100 vehicles, but they should be effectively used by the police department,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pcmc-to-buy-50-bikes-for-police-patrolling/articleshow/87265055.cms||---

The BMC will spend Rs 3.15 crore on the customised bikes, including their total maintenance cost. A proposal to buy the fire bikes will be placed before the civic standing committee on Wednesday. The proposal was first mooted in January 2020 but was delayed due to the pandemic. “The bikes alone will cost Rs 2.76 crore. We will spend an additional Rs 28.32 lakh on service and maintenance for five years. This cost will include assembling and commissioning the bike and its maintenance. Once the work order is issued, bikes will be inducted in two months. We will take another two months to assemble them,” said an official. The official said fire bikes will be fitted with a water tank, a water pipe, a hose reel and a pump. The bikes will be fitted with tanks that can carry around 40 litres of water along with firefighting equipment. Officials said the bikes will be fired with a GPS device and the pump attached to the bike will be able to spray close to 8 litres of water in a minute. “Two firemen can ride the bike and can reach the spot before the team reaches with the big water tankers and fire engines and assess the situation and report back to the command centre,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/soon-fire-bikes-to-douse-slum-blazes/articleshow/87266754.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Sunday’s incident has left her shaken. She has high blood sugar and has been advised regular walks. But she needs time to get over this trauma,” said Badi-ur-Rahman, the woman’s husband and a former Calcutta University professor. Zakia Rahman was walking near her home at EE Block around 7.30am on Sunday when two men on a bike tugged at her gold chain and dupatta. She fell on the road and hurt herself as the bikers scooted off. Some neighbours came to help but the bikers fled before anyone could notice their bike registration number. Cops are checking all the CCTV cameras on the main thoroughfares but had trouble getting immediate leads in the absence of cameras in the lanes and bylanes of the block. “We had asked the block representatives within the township on numerous occasions to install CCTV cameras. Even during the pre-puja meetings we had raised the issue but nothing has been done. We are trying to trace the culprits using source networking and available electronic evidence,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Cops on Monday approached the woman with photographs of criminals from the area, asking her to locate any resemblance with the criminals and the photographs available with the cops.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/chain-snatching-horror-victim-scared-to-step-out/articleshow/87265057.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Kolkata||Cop no to Dhanteras stalls on Kalakar Street this year||Kolkata: Kolkata Traffic Police has raised an objection this year in the manner stalls are put up on Dhanteras by blocking Kalakar Street for three days. The road is usually shut between Dhanteras and Diwali every year. According to police sources, stall owners has paid Kolkata Municipal Corporation to set up such stalls. The traffic police usually set up barricades almost two weeks prior to Diwali to ensure smooth traffic flow as crowd count increases on this stretch. But this year, cops say it is not possible to shut Kalakar Street as its only alternative — KK Tagore Street and finally Vivekananda Road — is partially shut for the demolition of Posta flyover. A meeting was held at Lalbazar on Monday on how to keep the traffic flowing in the Burrabazar-Posta region during Diwali. "The Howrah Bridge traffic guard has been asked to submit a report, after which the traffic department will sit for consultation with the central police division. The matter will then be taken up with KMC,” said a senior officer at the traffic department. The Burrabazar-Posta area — which is expected to remain crowded for the next two weeks in the run-up to Diwali — is going to see additional police deployment in phases. According to Lalbazar sources, the traffic circulation plan may see restricted access to specific roads. Local traffic cops have proposed specific barricading for pedestrians at Kalakar Street before Diwali to maintain social distancing. “This year, Diwali sales have not picked up yet and all trading is being conducted only via road as local trains are yet to ply. Hence, the rush is likely to be higher in the final weeks and we need to be prepared,” another officer said. “Unlike Durga Puja, when shopping was evenly spread across the city, Diwali sees a huge jump in the trading hub. Hence, we have to ensure precautionary measures in central Kolkata,” an officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cop-no-to-dhanteras-stalls-on-kalakar-street-this-year/articleshow/87265062.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The award also carries a cash prize of Rs 1,50,000. Currently writing the third season of ‘Delhi Crime’, Saria describes his film as “a cat-and-mouse game between a 60-something Bengali man who is designing the perfect crossword and a 20-something Nepali boy who decides to interrupt him”.  Shantilal Mukherjee plays this elderly gentleman who has been following a routine for 22 years of his life where 11 months of office work earns him his annual month of bliss in Darjeeling which he dedicates to designing the perfect crossword. “Not only is the idea unique, Sudhanshu’s style of working made me go back to my days of theatre with Ramaprasad Banik where he wanted us to delve on the back stories of the lives of characters,” Shantilal said. In the feature film section, the silver lotus awardees included Prabuddha Banerjee for the background score (‘Jyeshthoputro’), Kaushik Ganguly for the best original screenplay (‘Jyeshthoputro’) and Srijit Mukherji for the best adapted screenplay (‘Gumnaami’). Directors Farha Khatun (director of best film social issues - ‘Holy Rights’), Bauddhayan Mukherji (best promotional film - ‘The Shower’), Shantanu Sen (director of best film on environment conservation/preservation - ‘Water Burial’), Bimal Poddar (director of best animation film - ‘Radha’), Saptarshi Sarkar (on-location sound recordist of ‘Rahas’) and Arjun Gourisaria (for editing ‘Shut Up Sona’) won silver lotus in the non-feature section. Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute’s production ‘Oru Paathiraa Swapnam Pole’, directed by Sharan Venugopal, also brought home a silver lotus. ‘Gumnaami’ bagged a silver lotus for the best Bengali feature film. On social media, Srijit shared that this is the “fifth individual national award and tenth for the team.” Kaushik said, “Only a Bengali film movie will win the National Award for the best Bengali film. But it feels special when Srijit, Prabuddha and I are competing pan-nationally to get the awards for best background score or best screenplay.” Farha told TOI that the recognition for a documentary on triple talaq “encourages” independent filmmakers like her to keep on doing the good work. “It gives us the liberty to talk about sensitive issues. While it is challenging to speak about sensitive issues, it’s important to talk about too. There will never be an ideal scenario, we have to create our space in our way,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/siliguri-boy-leads-bengal-contingent-at-67th-national-film-awards-ceremony/articleshow/87265072.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The study, which is a part of the ‘Vision Zero Project’, undertaken by the agencies since 2018 to minimize the number of accidents on the highway, further revealed that in 2020, most number of accidents occurred under the jurisdiction of the Khopoli police station. “In 2018, when the project was initiated, the Mumbai-Pune section of the NH-48 recorded 268 fatalities. As a result of interventions carried out under this project, the number of fatalities reduced to 206 in 2019. In 2020, the actual number of fatalities stood at 79 as per police records,” an NGO official said. According to some of the key findings, rear-end collisions were the most prevalent type of crash on the NH-48. In 2020, a total 27 rear end crashes were reported. Rear-end collisions were followed by pedestrian knockdowns and crashes involving pedestrians. While most number of accidents were reported under the Khopoli police station jurisdiction, Panvel city, Khalapur and Lonavla rural also witnessed a considerable number of mishaps. “The number of fatalities is higher around the region of Khopoli police station when travelling towards Mumbai from Pune. Also, towards the Pune direction, the number of fatalities are higher near Khalapur police station,” the study said. Another important aspect, which the study highlighted, was the fact that in 2020, the maximum number of fatal crashes were observed between 9pm and 12am. Also, the number of accidents between 3am and 6am remained high last year. Chandrakant Pulkundwar, the joing managing director of the MSRDC, said, “Last year, we spearheaded certain key initiatives on NH-48, which have helped us improve road safety, including eradication of the black spot at Anda Point. We now have dedicated patrol vehicles to also ensure strong enforcement. Over 1,200 engineering related safety improvement measures have been implemented through MSRDC under the project.” To reduce the accidents, a total of 22 types of engineering issues were rectified. They included closure of unauthorized medians, installation of 34 emergency number signs and 185 Chevron Signages at sharp curves. To further reduce accidents, steps like enhanced smart patrolling have been undertaken, the study said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/maximum-accidents-reported-near-khopoli-on-old-mum-pune-highway/articleshow/87265074.cms||Joy Sengupta

After the workshop, there must be appropriate follow up actions to bring this vision into reality.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ut-plans-to-make-city-carbon-neutral-by-2030/articleshow/87265100.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Lucknow||Sultanpur court grants bail to Arvind Kejriwal in case filed in 2014||LUCKNOW: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been granted bail by a special court in Sultanpur on Monday in two cases related to disturbing communal harmony and committing various electoral offences during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Special Judge PK Jayant granted bail to Kejriwal after he appeared before the court and sought relief in both the cases. The court has fixed November 3 for the next date of hearing in the matter. The CM’s counsel Madan Singh said that even though Kejriwal had been granted exemption from a personal appearance before the court by the Supreme Court, he decided to appear on his own accord. “As a responsible citizen and to get the matter to proceed quickly, the CM appeared before the court willingly. He applied for bail, which was granted to him. The court has fixed November 3 as the next date of hearing,” he said. Kejriwal was booked in two cases lodged against him and other AAP leaders at Gauriganj and Musafir Khana police stations of Amethi during the 2014 general elections. AAP UP spokesperson Vaibhav Maheshwari said: “Kejriwal ji had come to campaign for Kumar Vishwas for a day when he was contesting the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Amethi. The UP police had then booked him for violation of section 144 and model code of conduct and for hate speech.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/sultanpur-court-grants-bail-to-kejriwal-in-case-filed-in-2014/articleshow/87266439.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Chennai||Test only in English, Hindi: Madras HC suspends central science exam||MADURAI: The Madras high court has suspended an aptitude test for a Centre sponsored scholarship programme — Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) — slated for November 7 as the examination was to be held only in English and Hindi. The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice M Duraiswamy ordered the postponement of the test while hearing a plea which sought the exam in all regional languages. The court also sought response from the Centre on the steps taken to conduct the exam in multiple Indian languages. Rejecting the Centre’s submission that it does not have adequate personnel to assess answers given in various languages and that it may be difficult to find an equivalent term in local languages for scientific words and terminologies, the judges said: “It would not do for the Centre to say that it does not have qualified assessors to appreciate the material put up by non-Hindi and English-speaking aspirants. If at all, it is the deficiency with the Centre and young aspirants from non-Hindi and non-English speaking belts in the country should not suffer on such grounds.” KVPY is a national program of fellowship in basic sciences funded by the department of science and technology, government of India. The objective of the exam is to identify students with talent and aptitude for research, to help them realize their academic potential and to encourage them to take up research careers in science by providing fellowships. Even if it is a token scholarship of Rs 5,000, it amounts to recognition of a young mind and every Indian of such age should be entitled to equally participate in the process and exhibit their talent, said the court while hearing a PIL filed by G Thirumurugan of Ramanathapuram. It is possible for a bright young mind groomed in Assamese vernacular or another young prospect from deep in rural Odisha to be able to come up with brilliant ideas that the KVPY project aspires to tap into. Merely because the aspirant may not be adept at Hindi or English languages may not amount to the aspirant being disqualified, observed the judges. The PIL-petitioner stated that conducting the exam only in English and Hindi would do injustice for the students studying in the other mediums of instructions. Hence, the petitioner sought to conduct the KVPY exam in all the regional languages, including Tamil. The case was adjourned by a fortnight and it was posted before the principal bench at Chennai for further hearing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/test-only-in-english-hindi-hc-suspends-central-science-exam/articleshow/87265955.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Having failed to clear the exam in 2019 and 2020, Loiya came back with a bang by topping the all-India level merit rankings. “I am very happy with this result after what had happened in the previous two exams,” laughed Loiya, whose preparation for the exam was all self-study. “I am a chartered accountant and was looking at CS as an additional degree. So the entire studies happened at home with no professional coaching,” said Loiya. The earlier two failed attempts did not affect him at all and he kept the focus on the goal. “It probably helped that I was professionally already a CA, and thus the failure did not have any negative impact on me,” said Loiya. With schooling from BP Bhavan’s Vidya Mandir and Delhi Public School, Loiya later attended Hislop College for commerce degree. “I completed CA in 2018 and then started preparing for the CS,” he said. Coming from a business family, Eshan is the first among kin to appear for the CS. Loiya traces his family legacy right down to the time Kamptee was founded. “My forefathers were the founding members of Kamptee town. There was a sprawling business empire, which of course does not exit on that scale any more, but charitable organizations in our family name continue to operate even now,” he said, while talking about his family roots in and around Nagpur. The results of the CS examination for professional programme (old and new syllabus), executive programme (old and new syllabus) and foundation programme, June, 2021 session were declared today. Loiya, who appeared from Nagpur centre, and Vaishnavi Badrinarayan Biyani, who appeared from Pune centre, have secured all-India first rank in professional programme (old syllabus) and professional programme (new syllabus) exams, respectively. In professional programme (old syllabus) exam, 33.22% of candidates passed in module-I, 30.65% in module-II and 79.23% in module-III, while in professional programme (new syllabus), 26.14% of candidates passed in module-I, 16.86% in module-II and 29.80% in module-III.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/after-failing-twice-city-boy-eshan-tops-all-india-cs-exam/articleshow/87265727.cms||---

Husain claimed that the 70-year-old’s already fragile health has deteriorated further due to the shifting.  In a statement, Husain claimed the activist was shifted to the Anda cell from the regular barracks on October 12 and questioned as to how long would Navlakha be “persecuted for his views and to what extent would the authorities go to break his spirit”. “In the Anda cell, he is deprived of daily walks in the jail’s non-concreted greener areas and fresh air and his health has deteriorated further, making specialised medical care an absolute necessity, if he is to live to fight this unjust and false case hoisted on him,” Husain said.  Navlakha was arrested on August 28, 2018. PTI||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbaishifting-of-navlakha-to-anda-cell-bad-for-his-health/articleshow/87266760.cms||---

As per the defence ministry’s conditional nod to the construction of the bridge, PCMC is expected to build an underpass, a security watchtower, and other facilities around the bridge across the river that would link Bopkhel village to the old Pune-Mumbai highway in Dapodi. PCMC needs 16,122sqm area for this purpose and had submitted moved a proposal for the cutting of trees to facilitate the construction. “These trees stand close to the 512 Army Base Workshop. They were not planted. They grew on the bank of the river in the past few years,” a senior DEO official said. “The Khadki station commander first gave the sanction for cutting of the trees. As a condition for this, PCMC has planted 60,000 trees in Training Battalion 2 of the Bombay Engineering Group centre over the past two years. Besides, the civic body has also deposited about Rs39 lakh of the cost of the trees with us. Now, its garden department will clean the area that is required for this work. As such there is no defence infrastructure in the area so no further clearance is required for this,” said a senior official from the DEO. Srikant Savane, joint city engineer of PCMC, told TOI on Monday, “We have asked the appointed contractor to carry out the geotechnical investigation of the area. This exercise is crucial to understand the physical and chemical properties of the soil, which will help make recommendations for the foundation requirements, etc. It will soon be done at the site by a team of experts. Based on their report, we will start the work at the site,” said Savane. “The construction work of the pillars and other aligned work of the bridge has been done from the Bopkhel village side so far. The remaining work will also commence in the coming days” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/502-trees-to-be-cut-on-defence-land-for-bopkhel-bridge-work/articleshow/87265101.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Pune||Motorcyclist held on charge of attempt to extort biker||Pune: The Kondhwa police on Sunday arrested a 27-year-old motorcyclist for trying to extort Rs10,000 from a biker on the pretext of seeking damages in a road accident. The incident occurred at Hemant Karkare chowk on the night of October 17. Sub inspector Sachin Khetmalis said on Monday, “The complainant, a 31-year-old biker (name withheld), had stopped alongside the road to respond to a phone call. Due to this, a PMC garbage tempo coming from behind had to suddenly stop. As the tempo stopped, another motorcyclist, coming from behind, crashed into the tempo. This led to an altercation and the tempo driver took out his anger on the complainant for causing the mishap.” Khetmalis said, “The second motorcyclist then started demanding money for damages caused to his vehicle from the tempo driver, but the driver refused to pay him money. The driver blamed the complainant for the accident and asked the motorcyclist to recover damages from him.” “The motorcyclist then picked up an argument with the biker but he refused to bear expenses of the damage caused to his vehicle. After efforts to recover money proved futile, the tempo driver forced the biker to park his vehicle in the premises of a building at Meethanagar in Kondhwa, where he was staying. The suspect then removed the ignition key and kept it in his possession. He then instructed to biker to compensate for his loss,” he said. The complainant then registered a first information report relating to extortion under Section 384 of the Indian Penal Code. “We have arrested the motorcyclist because he had no authority to confiscate the complainant’s motorcycle and to demand money. He should have lodged a police complaint in case he felt he had a genuine grievance in the matter,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/motorcyclist-held-on-charge-of-attempt-to-extort-biker/articleshow/87265108.cms||---

On Monday, cops visited some community markets in various parts of the city to check the situation. Several market committees have already instructed members about the instructions but it was a difficult job since people were reluctant. “Officers of the local administration got in touch with us on Saturday and instructed us to enforce the safety guidelines strictly since cases were rising. They said shopkeepers and service staff must always wear masks and insist customers wear masks as well. We have been told to ensure there is no crowding in markets. We have conveyed this to our members, but we need police support to enforce the rules,” said the secretary of a market committee in south Kolkata. The market committees have also asked members and support staff to get vaccinated. “Most members have taken jabs, but some are due for the second shot. We are trying to get all support staff and labourers vaccinated too,” said Ramen Haldar, a member of the College Street Shopowners’ Welfare Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/market-bodies-get-orders-to-adhere-to-safety-guidelines/articleshow/87265102.cms||---

Kalaskar said the student hailed from Boisar in Palghar district. The body was handed over to his parents after an inquest panchnama, police said. A case of accidental death has been registered in this regard. The hostel manager told TOI, “We have given our statements to police and they are investigating the case.” Kalaskar said, “The student had shifted to the hostel three months back.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Councillors get 15 days to submit revised proposals||Thiruvananthapuram: Nearly seven months after the town and country planning department submitted the draft master plan 2040 to the centre and initiated a consultation process among ward councillors, only eight of them have so far suggested ward level revisions. This was revealed in the council document presented in the latest council meeting in which all the agenda items, including that of the master plan for the city, were declared as passed in less than 10 minutes. Mayor Arya Rajendran made that declaration in the wake of protests staged by the UDF and BJP councillors regarding the tax fraud in zonal offices in the city. Owing to the tense scenes in the council meeting, no discussion could be held on this matter. The agenda pointed out that councillors were given development proposals for each ward and were directed to submit changes and revisions within a month. However, revised proposals came from only eight out of 100 wards. This has forced the council to come up with an ultimatum that if new revised proposals are not made available within 15 days, the existing, compiled proposal note will be deemed as approved. The timeline has been fixed citing that corporation needs to finalise the master plan in a time bound manner. The agenda contained the proposal for reconstitution of special committee for master plan. Parliamentary party leader D R Anil had read out the names of councillors and had said a consultation would be done with the BJP with regard to their representation in the special committee which has the mayor as chairperson and corporation secretary as convenor. The publication of draft master plan 2031 had led to intense protests both inside and outside the council mainly due to difference in opinion regarding the proposals. Even though ward level consultations had dragged on at a slow pace during the tenure of previous council mainly to avert similar situation while publishing the draft master plan 2040, the move did more harm than good since councillors have been tepid towards the move. Even the newly elected council rarely brought the matter to the council meeting till Friday when the agenda for reconstitution of special committee was introduced and passed without any discussion. The department of town and country planning which completed work on the draft GIS based master plan for Trivandrum-2040 had initiated preliminary steps to take the draft master plan for the approval of the corporation council. A meeting in this regard was held in June. The officials held a presentation to introduce the new councillors and members of the town planning committee to various components of the GIS based master plan. The department forwarded the draft of the master plan of Trivandrum to the state mission management unit in March. It was later submitted to the centre. The councillors were given a proforma to fill in their inputs which shall form a part of discussion when the draft master plan comes up for council discussion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/councillors-get-15-days-to-submit-revised-proposals/articleshow/87244312.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Lucknow||Bhagidari Morcha fate in a limbo as Owaisi unlikely to attend SBSP meet||Lucknow: The October 27 Mahapanchayat in Mau convened by Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar to announce his support to Samajwadi Party for the 2022 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh may mark the beginning of a fresh political alignment in the state. At the same time it may put a question mark on the very existence of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha that was formed on the initiative of the SBSP itself. Founded on October 27, 2002 the BSPS made its presence felt in the electoral politics of Uttar Pradesh in 2017 when it sided with the BJP to contest the assembly polls from 8 seats and bagged four of them. After more than two years of tumultuous ties with the BJP, Rajbhar parted ways and is now all set to align with the SP. Party president OP Rajbhar is set to share the stage with SP chief Akhilesh Yadav at the mahapanchayat in Mau. However, the development will put a question mark on the future of the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha – a political front of 10 smaller regional political outfits which also managed to rope in Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), and till recently was in talks with Bhim Army chief Chandrashekar Ravana as well. Led by OP Rajbhar as its convenor, the Morcha leaders including Rajbhar, Owaisi and Chandrashekhar had called on Akhilesh Yadav’s estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav recently as well. With Rajbhar all set to shake hands with SP, the BSM seems all set to fall apart. “I will attend the Mau event,” Akhilesh said responding to a media query but refused to talk about it any further. Asked if leaders or leaders of other smaller political outfits accompany him, the SP chief, in a lighter vein, said he would be going to Mau on a chopper and it does not have room to accommodate many people. On the SBSP-SP alliance, Akhilesh said: “The development will close the doors through which BJP has entered the corridors of power in UP. Other smaller parties will put a latch on that door.” What adds to the uncertainty over BSM’s future is the fact that contrary to reports, neither AIMIM nor Shivpal are likely to attend Rajbhar’s Mau mahapanchayat. While Owaisi is to address a public meeting of AIMIM in Muzaffarnagar, hivpalwill be in Bareilly on Wednesday. “There is no change in his pre-scheduled tour till now,” said Deepak Misra, spokesperson of Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party–Lohia (PSP-L) founded by Shivpal Yadav.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bhagidari-morcha-fate-in-a-limbo-as-owaisi-unlikely-to-attend-sbsp-meet/articleshow/87266444.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Delhi||Gay marriages: Centre sticks to stand in Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Marriage is recognised only between “a biological man and a biological woman” under the Indian law, the Centre on Monday told Delhi High Court, reiterating its stand. “The law as it stands...personal laws are settled, and marriage, which is contemplated, is between a biological man and a biological woman,” solicitor general Tushar Mehta submitted before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, opposing a clutch of petitions seeking recognition/registration of same-sex marriages. Mehta echoed the government’s earlier stand disclosed in an affidavit that a “spouse” means either a husband or a wife and “marriage” is a term associated with heterosexual couples. “The issue here is whether marriage is permissible between homosexual couples. Your lordships have to see that. There are some misconceptions regarding the Navtej Singh Johar case. It merely decriminalises consensual homosexual act. It does not talk about marriage,” Mehta contended, adding that there is no need for the Centre to file any specific reply regarding Citizenship Act, which has also been invoked by certain petitioners. The bench also heard the counsel for the petitioners. Advocate Karuna Nandy, appearing for one of the couples, said they got married in New York and the laws applicable were Citizenship Act, Foreign Marriage Act (FMA) and Special Marriage Act. She pointed out that Centre had not yet filed a reply to her clients’ plea that highlighted how Citizenship Act was silent on the gender and sexuality of the spouse. Senior advocate Saurabh Kirpal, representing another set of petitioners, said the Supreme Court verdict on homosexuality might not have expressly allowed same-sex marriage, but constitutional jurisprudence required interpretation and the verdict favoured recognising it. The high court listed for final hearing all petitions that include two same-sex couples seeking a declaration recognising their union under the special, Hindu, and foreign marriage laws. It also allowed the parties to file replies and posted the matter for November 30. Petitions have also been filed by two men who got married in the US but were denied registration of their marriage under FMA. Another petition seeks to allow a foreign-origin spouse of an OCI cardholder to apply for OCI registration regardless of the gender or sexual orientation. The other petitioners have contended that homosexuality has been decriminalised by the apex court, but same-sex marriages are still not being allowed under Hindu Marriage Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/gay-marriages-centre-sticks-to-stand-in-hc/articleshow/87265978.cms||Abhinav Garg

These drivers are meant to operate garbage vehicles, sprinklers, jetting machines and mechanical sweepers in the SDMC areas. The issue was raised on Tuesday by councillor and deputy standing committee chairman Poonam Bhati as she complained about lapses in civic services in her ward due to missing drivers. “We have been planning to fill the posts for a long time, but have failed to find a solution,” she said. The matter was also raised in the previous two-three standing committee meetings and every time officials said they had applied on the Government e-Market Place portal. Standing committee chairman Col (retd) B K Oberoi asked the officials concerned for updates on Tuesday and directed the department to act immediately. He told TOI that the positions had become vacant after the death/retirement of employees or due to other reasons. “We are diverting drivers from other duties to perform activities related to pollution control on priority. But some of our services are getting affected due to the vacancies. I have categorically asked the officials to speed up the process,” he said. The chairman cited the financial crisis and insufficient supply of funds by the Delhi government as the key factors behind the delay in hiring staff. “We don’t have sufficient funds, otherwise we would have started the process a long time ago,” claimed Oberoi. “It is only when funds were arranged, we applied on the GeM portal to finalise vendors who can supply us staff/drivers,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/drivers-vacancies-at-sdmc-may-hamper-drive-to-tackle-bad-air/articleshow/87290053.cms||Vibha Sharma

On examination of the parcel, 620g of hashish oil was recovered and seized. In a statement on Monday, NCB said that it received specific intelligence and kept a prolonged surveillance for the receiver of this parcel. On October 23, two people, both residents of Pudukottai, who came to receive the parcel, were apprehended by the authorities. Preliminary inquiries with the two revealed that the main receiver was from Coimbatore. He too was apprehended on Sunday from Coimbatore.Subsequent search in the house of the kingpin resulted in the recovery of 21.48g hashish and 221g of magic mushroom honey (Psilocybin). The trio confessed to trafficking drugs for distribution of the same in Pudukottai and other parts of South India.The NCB said that on account of persistent and vigilant activities by law enforcement agencies, the trend of smuggling through courier parcels has been on the increasing trend. It is pertinent to note that fake identity documents are used for booking parcels so that tracking of the original person booking/receiving the parcel becomes difficult. Drug addicts are also into addiction of magic mushrooms which contain a chemical called Psilocybin that has an intoxication effect, zonal director of NCB, Chennai zone said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/ncb-seizes-hashish-oil-arrests-three/articleshow/87265975.cms||---

Locals said the nearest fire station from where engines reach their areas are from the station located near Bandra Reclamation. Santacruz BJP corporator Hetal Gala who has been pursuing the matter with the Fire Brigade and the BMC said there was a reservation in the Development Plan (DP) at the spot where now the mini fire station stands. “I followed up with the authorities for over three years when finally the construction began in November 2019. The construction was completed earlier this year, however the mini fire station is not being activated,” said Gala. TimesViewIn a congested city like Mumbai where heavy traffic can slow down emergency vehicles, it is inexcusable that the fire brigade has failed to make the Santacruz mini fire station operational. Khar and Santacruz are prime suburban areas which have seen a spurt in new high-rise buildings. The BMC’s top administrators should ensure that this fire station starts functioning soon.Santacruz resident Deyasini Choudhary, secretary of Chapel Lane ALM, said the area has many narrow lanes and therefore needs ‘mini’ fire engines, which are smaller and carry less water as against the 4,500 litres in regular fire engines. “The illegal encroachments on various roads like Chapel Lane will hamper the movement of large fire engines in case of a blaze. A mini fire engine could handle the situation till the time a big one reaches the site,” she said. Trivankumar S Karnani, a lawyer, who runs the Mumbai North Central District Forum Twitter handle (@MNCDFbombay) said that with increasing developments in the area, the need for a fire station in Khar, Santacruz is even more. “Currently we have only one fire station which is at the end of the Bandra that covers Khar, Bandra and Santacruz localities,” said Karnani. When contacted, a senior fire officer said that there is a shortage of staff. “We have not been able to recruit owing to the pandemic even when there are 700 vacant posts. Walk-in interviews are held, which results in a large gathering. Owing to the pandemic we have been avoiding this. However, we hope to start the mini fire station soon by outsourcing or getting a few from other fire stations adjusted in the mini fire station at Santacruz,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-santacruz-residents-want-mini-fire-station-opened/articleshow/87266775.cms||Richa Pinto

He said the BJP government is committed to serve the industrialists who have already set up silos and other infra-structure because of the farm laws. “Ho sakta hai … main aaj keh raha hoon aapse … Punjab ke chunao dekhte hue, Uttar Pradesh ke chunao dekhte hue, ho sakta hai kisano ke quanoon radh kar diye jayen teeno … aur phir chuanv ke baad naye quanoon phir aa jayenge (There is a possibility … I am telling you today … keeping in mind the elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, the three farm laws may be recalled … and implemented again in a new form after the elections),” Akhilesh told reporters at the party headquarters in Lucknow. The former CM said the BJP government will implement the farm laws afresh after the elections because it is committed to help the corporates who have already spent money on setting up the infrastructure required once the farm laws are implemented. Akhilesh was interacting with the media after former BSP leaders and Mayawati confidants, Lalji Verma and Ram Achal Rajbhar, formally joined the SP on Monday. Verma was the BSP Legislature party leader and Rajbhar, a UP BSP chief, when Mayawato expelled them for anti-party activities. The duo will take the membership of SP at a mega rally in Ambedkarnagar on November 7. SP chief will preside over the event. Akhilesh said the government may soon “sell” the recently inaugurated airport in Kushinagar and added that it is selling away everything primarily to deprive the benefits like reservation in employment which will not be applicable once the project is taken over by a private entity. “Don’t be misled by the gala inauguration of the Kushinagar airport recently. For the BJP leaders it was like visiting a property that a common man plans to sell,” he said. He said the Kushinagar airport project was conceptualised by his government and Rs 260 crore was allocated in the budget for its construction. “BJP is doing what it does the best. They are claiming that the Kushinagar project is their initiative,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjp-may-drop-farm-laws-before-up-polls-implement-later-sp/articleshow/87266461.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Delhi||Northeast district police restructures riots cells to streamline probe of cases||NEW DELHI: The northeast district police have decided to restructure riots cells for proper investigation of cases. Each of the 11 police stations that were affected by the riots will have such a cell where an inspector-level officer will monitor the cases exclusively. On October 13, DCP (Northeast) Sanjay Kumar Sain passed the order for restructuring the riot cells. “The reason behind the move was to streamline the probe and conduct proper pairvi (argument) of riots cases. A few officers were also transferred,” said an officer. “There will be three wings of the riot cell. While one will be at the district level, the second will be at the police station level and the third the pairvi team,” added the officer. The district cell will scrutinise case files to be listed before the courts, preferably 4-5 days in advance. “They will be helped by the scrutiny team. The cell will ensure proper and close coordination with the special public prosecutor. The team will update data daily and also inform senior officers about the diaries, reports and issues related to the cases,” the officer said. At the police station level, the cell will comprise ACPs, inspectors and investigating officers. “All IOs will report to the inspector in-charge of the cell, who will be responsible for proper investigation, scrutiny of files and better representation of cases before the court,” said the officer. It would be the prime responsibility of the SHO and the in-charge of the riot cell of the police station concerned to conclude the probe in a logical way so that chargesheets are filed in the cases at the earliest. “The SHO will be the chief investigating officer. He will be responsible for smooth functioning of the riots cell, in addition to performing other duties of the police station. He will also closely monitor the progress in the cases,” the officer said. “The in-charge of the riots cell will ensure that guidance, directions and inspection memos given to the IOs from senior officers or the cell is compiled within the given time frame. SHOs and in-charges will update data and dairies daily. The SHO will provide necessary manpower and infrastructure for smooth functioning of the cell. The pairviteam will prepare the cause list and a daily diary of outcomes,” said Sain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ne-district-police-restructures-riots-cells-to-streamline-probe-of-cases/articleshow/87290076.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Vadodara||C R Paatil pulls up Vadodara mayor over cattle menace||VADODARA: Vadodara mayor Keyur Rokadiya and the municipal corporation were left red-faced after state BJP chief C R Paatil rapped the former on his knuckes over increasing menace of cattle and beggars in the city. Paatil has taken up the issue of cattle menace on roads in cities as well as begging. He said that he discussed this with chief minister Bhupendra Patel too. All municipal corporations in the state have started work in this direction, but Paatil was clearly not impressed by Rokadiya's work. In a public function, Paatil clearly stated that the work being done in Vadodara was below expectations.  Paatil was speaking at the Global Patidar Business Summit organized at the Sardardham in the city. During his address, he spoke on how he had taken up the issue of cattle menace and beggars and the work being done in Surat. “Today, we don’t see beggars on the street in Surat. When we asked Rokadiya, he said that we will be starting (the work) soon and meetings had been done with all. But now meetings are enough,” Paatil said. Paatil said when Rokadiya was made mayor it was felt that he would work fast and not walk this slowly. Paatil told Rokadiya from the stage that he should create a situation where people would call Paatil in 8-10 days and tell him that cows and beggars were not seen any more. He added that Rokadiya should stop meetings and show results instead. Later, a visibly embarassed Rokadiya told reporters that Vadodara had captured 600 cattle in 15 days which was the highest in the state. He added that over 500 of these had been sent to cattle shelters. He said that he would assure the residents of the city that the issue would be resolved. The city unit of the Congress took the opportnity to slam the BJP and the mayor for the situation. “The mayor should resign after the comments made in public. Paatil should appoint an active mayor in place of the unsuccessful one who is forced on the city,” said leader of Congress party in VMC Ami Ravat. She added that Rokadiya should himself resign for self-respect and not tolerate the insult.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/paatil-pulls-up-vadodara-mayor-over-cattle-menace/articleshow/87265157.cms||---

This is due to the efforts of Sahyadri Sanchaya, supported by NRI Vasudev Aithal launched ‘Vana Chethana’, a special education programme for the tribal children of Uttara Kannada district. After conducting 24 camps in Yellapur of Uttara Kannada district as part of ‘Vana Chethana’, the team will conduct camps in Joida from Tuesday during which children will get access to smartphones. At Yellapur, television sets were distributed to a few schools so that children have access to Samveda e-classes telecast on DD Chandana. Sahyadri Sanchaya convenor Dinesh Holla said, “More than academics, the teachers have appreciated the extracurricular activities like paper craft, music, dance, kite flying and others conducted by resource persons at the camp. After class hours, we make it a point to visit the houses of students and understand their problems and solve issues. Since Joida is one of the backward taluks, Vasudev Aithal decided to procure 20 smartphones. He has tied up with Bengaluru-based Akshara Foundation, for a software that gives access to mathematics practice and learning to children. This way, our attempt is to bring children even in the remotest village to the mainstream during the 10-day camp,” Holla said. The camps will be held from October 26 to 30 and from November 8 to 11 at various schools. “Based on requirements, we have also connected donors with schools and provided them with books, solar lamps, basic infrastructure and so on. We have involved ourselves in community development works. For instance, at Shirle, we have managed to restore a temporary wooden foot bridge. We visit homes and convince people to send their children to school and for higher education,” he said. Once the camps are conducted, the next three months will be spent on follow-ups with the schools. “We have received requests from a few more schools to conduct the camps, especially in Yellapur and Anashi. A detailed report on the camp and its impact on tribal children will be submitted to the government,” Holla said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/tribal-kids-of-joida-to-get-smartphones-during-10-day-camp/articleshow/87265089.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Officials said 59 plots would be auctioned in two days. On October 27, HSIIDC will conduct e-auction of three plots of one acre (4,050 square meters) and 17 plots of 1,800 square meters, while on October 29, 39 plots of 1,012 square meters will be auctioned. Earlier, the last date for participation in the auction was fixed on September 30. However, on the demands of industrialists who wanted dates extended till the Navratras, it was extended to October 8 and the date for auction was fixed at October 25. However, the auction was cancelled over delay in finalisation of the layout plan. The auction, which is planned in the days to come, was cancelled twice before, but the HSIIDC is determined to organise it and earn enough to offset the financial loss it had incurred. Sources said 159 industrialists have registered for the auction so far. Besides Haryana, industrialists from Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have also applied for industrial plots here. Haryana chief minister recently announced that electricity and water would be provided at minimal charges to industrialists in Barwala. A number of industrialists who have their units in Parwanoo and Baddi had also requested the Haryana Assembly Speaker to provide them land and discount in power and water charges to set up industries here, as most of them are residents of Panchkula who go to Himachal for work. Haryana government has planned to set up pharma and life sciences industrial hub on 50-acres of land in Barwala. HSIIDC hinted that if more industrialists expressed interest, area of Industrial Area would be extended.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/hsiidc-e-auction-on-oct-27-29/articleshow/87265123.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A day after the murders, Vicky reported at his office headquarters in Tollygunge and asked for “some urgent money”. He collected Rs 1,500 claiming he also needed a three-day break since his father had passed away. Police said this cash is what Vicky is surviving on in Sunderbans even as three police teams continue to chase him. Sources said he realized the cash he took from victims Subir Chaki and Rabin Mandal was not enough for going into hiding. “He also had to distribute a little among his associates. His WhatsApp was working till next morning because he sent out certain messages to his management, said sources. The police team expects him to contact his associates once the money runs out. “He is changing his location often, which involves a separate cost. We are working with multiple sources to pick him up. The other teams are working on the other two accused who are also absconding,” said an officer. Meanwhile, joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma confirmed the two accused nabbed along with Mithu — Bapi Mondal and Jahir Gazi — were new to crime. Though Sharma was tight lipped, sources said the duo was promised a job related to marble and brought to Kolkata. Gazi was not even directly acquainted with Vicky. Sources claimed Mithu had offered Rs 50,000 to three persons to accompany Vicky.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/vicky-collected-cash-from-office-after-murders/articleshow/87265172.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

But the gravity of the situation may compel us to do so in a day or two,” said a KMC official. For now, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has decided to keep a vigil on areas that have been witnessing a steady upward Covid graph in the past fortnight. “We have decided to engage our doctors at the ward level to assist Covid patients in distress, particularly children,” said an official. The civic body will also launch an awareness drive in Covid-sensitive areas, including pockets of south Kolkata, where numbers have escalated. Following the rise in cases during and after Durga Puja, the KMC Covid-combat team at the civic headquarters had sought ward-wise Covid data from borough health executive officers. This data reached the civic headquarters on Monday and led to urgent deliberations on whether the situation warranted immediate declaration of micro-containment zones. “We have to guard against fresh infection as Covid cases in certain neighbourhoods are rising steadily. But it isn’t time to declare micro containment zones and put restrictions on people’s movements at a time when offices are functional and schools are about to open. If needed, we may declare some stand-alone buildings with high case rates as micro containment zones,” said an official. The ward-wise Covid report showed an upward graph in Topsia, Picnic Garden, Kasba, Dhakuria, Jadavpur, Tollygunge, Naktala, Patuli and Garia. Sources said in some of these areas, particularly in the Jadavpur-Naktala belt, the number of fresh cases was increasing by 10-15 daily. “We are keeping a close watch over the situation in the areas which have so far been the worst hit by the resurgence of Covid cases,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/no-micro-c-zone-in-city-yet-but-kmc-keeps-eye-on-cases/articleshow/87265141.cms||Saikat Ray

The residents alleged that Milind Gaikwad, who claims to own part of the land on the riverbank, had dumped so much debris that the natural nullah joining the river is blocked. Gaikwad told TOI that the land belongs to him and claimed that he was allowed to dump debris. On Monday morning, a group of citizens walked across the green zone belt starting from Gunjan Chowk up to Kalyaninagar corner along the river to see the damage caused by the dumping of construction debris. “Civic authorities are aware about the reserved green zone land and the debris still is being dumped rampantly. Our letters to the PMC have not yielded any results and a mere fine will not help. As our requests have gone unanswered, we decided to hold this agitation,” said resident Sameer Nikam. Meghana Baphna, who is among the core members of the Save Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, said the residents are disappointed as the civic body has turned a blind eye. “The the dumping in some areas will be impossible to remove even with heavy machinery,” said Baphna.  Gaikwad who also visited the spot on Monday morning, said, “The land belongs to me and I am the owner of this land. I admit I have dumped the debris because I have authority over the land I own.” When contacted, area ward officer Suresh Jagtap, said, “We have been issuing notices to the offenders, however, the dumping has continued. We will take action against the dumping.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/residents-to-protest-against-debris-dumping-at-sanctuary/articleshow/87265191.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

He said that Congress and SP were not political parties, but family trusts’. “They let go of terrorists and compromise with them. These people are doing business by forming a party.

He soon informed his team of bird watchers at Shola nature society Suraj Choodal, Kiran RJ, Abin Raj P and Sujith Surendran who followed Anoop’s findings. They have observed the behaviour of the bird over the next two days and took photographs. The Indian spot-billed duck is a large dabbling non-migratory breed that lives in freshwater wetlands across the Indian subcontinent. Normally, the ducks in this species are grey with a pale coloured head and neck. They have black beaks with dark yellow tips and white wings with black and sparkling green flight feathers. According to Anoop, the duck he spotted was white with a few brown flight feathers and seemed different from its flock. Anoop also explains about the colour change in the bird’s feather. Leucism is a genetic abnormality that prevents pigments, especially melanin, from correctly depositing on the feathers of the birds. As a result, they seem white and distinct from their species. “I have been into this field for the past 15 years and birding is a part of my life. After spotting the bird, I uploaded the photo onto an e-bird site. The species is not rare but the colour variation is. I would consider this place as a hotspot, because I have seen many water birds in this area,” said Anoop.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/duck-with-rare-genetic-trait-spotted-in-dist/articleshow/87244357.cms||---

The colleges announced the cutoffs only for the courses with vacant seats. According to the university guidelines, the cutoffs under the special list had to be similar to the last declared cutoff marks. Most of the sought-after colleges saw courses continuing to have high asking scores while some reported courses opening up for admissions with seats falling vacant after the third cutoff list. Gargi College, which had closed admissions for BA (H) political science after the second list, has vacant seats now. Under the special list, the cutoff for the course is set at 98%. Similarly, at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, BA (H) economics closed for the third cutoff list, but has opened with an asking score of 98.75% under the special list. With a cutoff of 98.75% for BCom (H) and BA (H) economics, Kirori Mal College has also reopened admissions for the courses under the special list.

While some have questioned the hike in the registration fee during the pandemic, officials of the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) said that there is no actual hike in the delegate registration fee. They said that only GST has been added to the existing fee of Rs 1,000, which has taken the amount up by a marginal amount. This marginally hiked amount was applicable as delegate registration fee from the last edition of Iffi, they said. Officials said that since 2016 the delegate registration fee for Iffi continues to be Rs 1,000. But during the last edition of the festival, it was pointed out by internal auditors that GST has to be applied to the fee. Accordingly, the delegate registration fee was increased to Rs 1,180 by adding the GST component from last year. Meanwhile, open air screenings of films will be back at Iffi this year. Last year’s festival was a muted one due to the pandemic. This year too, Iffi will be held in the hybrid format with a mix of physical and virtual events. However, the organisers will be conducting open air screenings once again for the 2021 edition of Iffi. Temporary structures for the purpose will be erected at Miramar beach.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/gst-addition-hikes-iffi-delegate-fees/articleshow/87266004.cms||---

Protesters said there were more than hundreds of grinding stone makers and sellers who were affected by the shortage of stones due to closure of quarries. There are more than 3,500 families which are traditionally involved in making hand grinding stones in Govindampalayam, Nallakattipalayam, Velliampalayam, Thimmanayankkanpalayam, Sedarplayam and Kavundampalayam in Tirupur district, they said. “But the high court ban on operation of quarries has hit our business,” said a protester. They pointed out that they could not obtain licence from the government for extracting stones because they operate in small area ranging from five cents to 50 cents. Only for stone quarries operating on large areas the government was granting licence, they said. .“Hence we request the government to take initiatives on our behalf and get us exemption from the ban,” a petition submitted to the collector by the protesters said. Protesters also said the 4,000 workers dependent on the grinder industry in Coimbatore are also staring at uncertainty as the sector was hit due to stone shortage. Grind stone makers, who had visited the collectorate to submit the petition, assembled on the road near the collectorate and sat on a protest. Police and revenue officials pacified the protesters and disbursed them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/grinding-stone-makers-protest-demanding-reopening-of-quarries/articleshow/87266001.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

She also assured that the district administration was making all-out efforts to ensure smooth procurement in every center. The DC said water had been cleared from five procurement centers of Kharar and arrangements for the same were being made in other centers too. She reiterated the commitment of compensation for farmers suffering losses and said that since the administration had made arrangements in all centres of the district, the rain did not cause major problems in procurement. Urging farmers to bring dry paddy to procurement centers, Kalia said the downpour would increase the moisture content in paddy but farmers should bring the crop to mandis only after drying it properly so that they did not face issues in selling it. She said mandis were well equipped with tarpaulins and bardana (gunny bags) and the administration had ensured that farmers would not face any difficulty selling the crop. The deputy commissioner also said that the state government led by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had ordered a special Girdawari to assess crop damage so that farmers got compensation accordingly. She said that timely procurement, payment and lifting was being ensured in the district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/farmers-to-get-compensation-for-loss-caused-by-heavy-rain-in-mohali-dc/articleshow/87265213.cms||---

The incident happened after Surat police reached the hotel searching for his paramour who was staying with him. The deceased Sharad Mishra and the married woman Hinal Goti had been living in a hotel at Sayajigunj for the past couple of days. Goti had left her home in Surat on October 19 without informing anyone following which her husband had lodged a missing person complaint. Meanwhile, searching Goti based on her mobile phone’s location, cops from Surat reached Vadodara in the wee hours of Monday. The hotel’s management initially did not allow Surat police to go to the couple’s room. After help from Sayajigunj police was sought, the cops were allowed to go upstairs. Around 3.56 am, when police knocked on the couple’s door, the duo got scared and under fear of getting shamed, they decided to jump out of the window. Police said that Mishra jumped out of the window and became unconscious after the fall. As Goti too was planning to jump out, cops waiting downstairs appealed to her to not jump and instead get down by staircases. Police sources said that the woman kept shouting to save Mishra, who was lying unconscious, and could have jumped too. “We kept telling her that we had called the ambulance and she should not jump, like the man, as she is pregnant,” said a cop. A female cop was sent upstairs and brought Goti down after she opened the room. Later, Mishra was taken to SSG Hospital where doctors declared him dead before admission.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/caught-with-paramour-man-jumps-to-death-from-hotel/articleshow/87265221.cms||---

But the Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti (PMDS), which is headed by the district collector, has continued with the online darshan pass system even when there is no requirement for it.

In a letter written to the railway minister, president of Pollachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry G D Gopalakrishnan said better railway infrastructure in Pollachi station will help decongest Coimbatore railway junction. Podanur-Pollachi single line was converted into broad gauge and electrified recently. Before the gauge conversion, the Pollachi station had pit lines and maintenance facilities for trains. The railways also took away coach maintenance shed and train watering facilities from Pollachi after gauge conversion. “Ten trains, including Coimbatore-Rameswaram express/passengers, Coimbatore-Madurai Intercity Express, Coimbatore-Thoothukudi Fast passenger, Coimbatore-Kollam trains, were not re-operated after spending hundreds of crores of public money for broad gauge conversion of Podanur-Palakkad-Pollachi–Dindigul section,” Gopalakrishnan said. During the creation of the Salem division, Pollachi and Kinathukadavu railway stations were added to the Palakkad railway division in 2007. The chamber had passed a resolution seeking transfer of Pollachi and Kinathukadavu railway stations to Madurai or Salem railway divisions from Palakkad division for operational convenience. This will also help in operating trains in Coimbatore–Kinathukadavu–Pollachi-south TN section.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/restore-facilities-in-pollachi-rly-station/articleshow/87266017.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The registrations this year stood at 51 lakh, a decrease of 5 lakh from last year’s 56.1 lakh. The figure in 2019-20 stood at 57.9 lakh, while in 2017-18, 66 lakh candidates had registered for the exams. In 2011, UP board saw 57.2 lakh candidates registering for the exam. The fall in the figures has led to extension of dates for filling of online examination form for the third time. The new deadline for paying the examination fee (with late fee) is November 8. Additional chief secretary, secondary education, Aradhana Shukla could not be contacted despite repeated phone calls and messages. State president, UP Secondary Teachers’ Association, RP Mishra said less than 20% students enrolled in secondary schools in UP had access to online study material. “Online teaching merely remained on paper. A majority of students did not have smartphones or internet connection,” Mishra said. He added, “Mismanagement on part of the government to provide facilities to students has kept them away from UP Board this year.” Teacher MLC (Allahabad-Jhansi division), Suresh Kumar Tripathi attributed low registrations to the Covid pandemic mainly, which disrupted teaching. “The Board has extended the date. I believe a lot of students who missed will now apply. But even then the figures are low. This is largely due to shutdown of schools due to Covid-19,” Tripathi said. A quick look at the figures show that for 2021-22 academic session, 27.7 lakh students have registered for class 10 while 23.4 lakh have registered for class 12. In 2020-21, 29.9 lakh and 26.1 lakh students had registered for class 10 and 12 respectively. The registrations for class 10 and 12 in 2019-20 academic session stood at 30.2 lakh and 25.8 lakh respectively. The year 2013-14 saw the highest registrations when 38.6 lakh students applied in class 10 and 31.3 lakh in class 12.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/registrations-for-up-board-at-a-decade-low/articleshow/87266484.cms||Isha Jain
---||Goa||Dept lacks data to mark fish breeding zones for CZMP||Panaji: Goa is racing against time to meet the deadline of December 31, 2021, set by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), to finalise the state’s Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP). While the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) had tasked different departments with specific work to be able to finalise the coastal plan, the fisheries department has told the authority that it is unable to demarcate fishing zones and fish breeding zones. The department has told GCZMA that it has no scientific data available to mark such zones. “Fishing zone cannot be marked since fish are migratory and venture in and out of the area in search of food, for breeding and shelter. Fish breeding area cannot be demarcated as there is no scientific study carried out by the department. The fish breeding areas and fish can breed anywhere in the water depending on environmental factors, physio-chemical parameters of the water, season and maturity conditions of the fish,” the department has told GCZMA. After deliberating on the department’s response, GCZMA has decided to convey this input to the National Cente for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai, which is working to incorporate any changes in Goa’s coastal plan. Following the public hearing held in July, GCZMA had allotted tasks to different departments to carry out ground truthing based on the objections and suggestions received from the public. “After considering the replies from the department, the authority decided to submit the same to NCSCM,” GCZMA has decided at its meeting held earlier this month. Meanwhile, based on the list of heritage monuments submitted by the department of archives and archeology, GCZMA has decided to ask NCSCM to demarcate such structures of historical importance located in CRZ areas on Goa’s coastal management plan. “The authority has taken on record the replies sent by department of archives and archaeology and those sites within jurisdiction of CRZ as per CZMP to be marked on the CZMP maps. The authority recommends that NCSCM may examine the comparison and those differences which are required to be incorporated may be incorporated in the CZMP maps,” GCZMA said. GCZMA has said that ground truthing could not be carried out based on many objections and suggestions received from the public seeking demarcation of high tide line, mangroves, khazans, bunds, sluice gates, etc. This was because the exact survey numbers were not specified in the objections and suggestions. “The local bodies, i.e. panchayats and municipal councils were requested to submit their draft CZMP maps. In response, 118 panchayats and eight municipalities have submitted their draft CZMP maps. The draft CZMP maps submitted by the local bodies have been compared with the draft CZMP maps of NCSCM and the differences have been tabulated,” GCZMA has stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/dept-lacks-data-to-mark-fish-breeding-zones-for-czmp/articleshow/87266009.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The teachers blocked Airport Road near Singh Shaheedan Gurdwara for over three hours before police lifted the barricading they had installed. Concurrently, Elementary Teacher Training-Teacher Eligibility Test (ETT-TET) Qualified Unemployed Teachers Union members also blocked the Kharar highway for hours, disrupting traffic. The coordination committee of 646 unemployed PTI Teachers Union said that three of their members are still staging a fast unto death on top of the water tank. They said they would commit suicide one by one if their demands were not met. Union president Gurlabh Singh alias Bhola said, “When he was an MLA, Pargat Singh promised us that if he became minister, he would get our appointments regularised at the earliest but an honest political leader like Pargat also forgot the promise he made after becoming minister. We have also presented a memorandum in this regard.” Aman Rana and Dharampal Nukerian are still sitting atop the water tank near Desu Majra and have threatened to jump if the Punjab government does not fulfill their demands. Representatives of the teachers’ union, who were wearing black ribbons, said their two members stationed on the water tank were facing several problems. Union president Deepak Kamboj, said, “In 2016, we raised our demands when present Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and MP Preneet Kaur visited us. They assured that our demands would be fulfilled. Even after four years of being in power, the ruling dispensation is ignoring us.” The teachers demanded that one lakh ETT teachers recruitment notification must be published, only EET-TET pass teachers must be considered for appointment, age limit must be relaxed, points for higher qualification must be abolished and extra weightage given to education providers and volunteers must be withdrawn.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/charuni-with-them-teachers-block-airport-road-for-3-hours/articleshow/87265225.cms||---

---||Goa||2.15 lakh persons due for second jab, but hesitant to take it, says health expert||PANAJI: There are 2.15 lakh persons in the state who are due for their second dose of Covid-19 vaccine but are not coming forward, state immunologist Dr Rajendra Borkar said, adding that the number is equally distributed in North and South Goa. The DHS has announced a mega camp on Sunday, October 31 between 9.30am and 5pm specially for those who are due for their second dose, including one facility in each taluka for those without any ID cards. “I request you not to take it lightly. It is a sincere request for those who are eligible for the second dose and have completed 84 days to come this Sunday and take the second dose to be fully protected. Panaji is flooded with tourists. Anything can happen at any time, we cannot be complacent,” he said. Some people are sitting on the fence and without motivation may even skip their second dose, Borkar said. “Covid has reduced, but has not gone from Goa or India so everybody must take their second dose,” he added. Director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said in order to get ready for “schools to start and for the tourist season”, the government instead of waiting has decided to rope in over 200 healthcare facilities — six times the regular vaccination centres — for the public to get their vaccines on Sunday. “We have already finished vaccinating 104% of the population and 73% have taken their second dose. Our concern now is vaccinating the 3-4 lakh floating population that comes in to support the tourism season. By the end of November, we hope most of our target population will be fully vaccinated and the vaccination programme will be integrated into our normal vaccination programme,” she said. Borkar said that Goa’s vaccination statistics are fantastic where over 70% have taken their second dose compared to the all India average of 30%. “In Goa, we have a typical situation where we are dependent on tourism and are also planning to start schools, so there is a possibility that those who haven’t taken the second dose may get infected and spread the infection. Our goal is to get as many people covered by the second dose,” the state immunologist said. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said that the vaccination is presently available at one’s doorstep. At a later stage, this will be merged with routine immunisation and the people will have to visit their health centres to take the vaccine. Panaji: Director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said vaccinating all adults will create a “protective ring” around the children. “Vaccines for children are not yet licenced for us to give them yet. There are many in the pipeline, and if we finish vaccinating adults we will be ready to take on vaccination for children when it starts,” she said. State immunologist Dr Rajendra Borkar said the state wants to finish vaccinating the adult population before vaccination for children starts as things could get complicated. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/2-15-lakh-persons-due-for-2nd-jab-but-hesitant-to-take-it-says-health-expert/articleshow/87266018.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Pune||Centre may take up review of social work institutes||PUNE: The Union government plans to take up a review of social work institutes to understand what is being imparted and the output, among other matters, along with some other non-mainstream courses, Vinay Sahasrabudhe, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on education, women, children, and youth & sports, said on Monday. Sahasrabudhe, also the president of Indian Council for Cultural Relations, was speaking after a function on National Education Policy at Savitribai Phule Pune University. According to him, the education system has many areas that are not considered part of the mainstream. “Even now arts, science, commerce, engineering and medical courses are considered mainstream. Take the example of architecture and town planning, where we have very few planners. If there are 10 different reasons for the problems faced by any city, one of them will be lack of proper planning. We need to focus on this. We will review town planning and architecture education. Similarly, there are areas that need attention such as education in fine arts, performing arts and visual arts. Now, we have studied that to an extent and are finalising our report. Another area is social work. Of the total social work institutes in the country, 70% are in Maharashtra. What social work are we teaching, what is happening to them... nobody has focused on them. We will review them,” he said. Sahasrabudhe appreciated the Maharashtra government’s initiative to reduce the weight of school bags by introducing a single textbook for all subjects for one term. He said he would recommend this plan to the Centre via the parliamentary committee. The state education department had come up with a one book system on a pilot basis starting this year. According to this, some schools in the state, have integrated books for their Std I students. “The entire year’s syllabus was divided into four sections and for each term, one book containing all four subjects was developed. This ensures that the student is carrying only one textbook at a time which will greatly reduce the weight of the school bag and also ensure that the student gets to study all subjects every day,” an official from Balbharati said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/centre-may-take-up-review-of-social-work-institutes/articleshow/87265223.cms||Ardhra Nair

Usually, the nip in the October air brings smiles on the faces of customers visiting the vegetable markets across Jamshedpur, but this year may be an exception as the prices are skyrocketing. TOI during its visit to Sakchi wholesale vegetable market on Friday morning found that bartbatti (snake beans) which are normally sold for Rs 20 a kilo at this time of the year, is not less than Rs 60. The prices have shot up three times in this festival time, which is a major concern for homemakers, whose budgets have just gone haywire. They feel that either they have to compromise with their budgets, which is very difficult in this Covid time, or they have to cut down on the number of dishes. Bristi Mazumdar from Sakchi said Simla mirch (capsicum) is required in most of the Chinese dishes she prepares for her daughter Arna but now the price is Rs 200 a kilo, which she cannot afford. The price of capsicum a month ago was around Rs 60 a kilo. She said after facing a salary cut after the onset of the pandemic last year, it has become difficult to run the household. The high prices of vegetables are just adding to the woes. Tomatoes, another product required for most of the dishes, is Rs 60 a kilo, nearly double the price. Vegetable vendors at Sakchi said local supply of vegetables from Patamda, Boram and Ghatshila areas has almost dried up and all the products are being transported from outside, like from Karnataka. So with the rising price of diesel, which has crossed the century mark, the prices of vegetables are also going u p. Kanu Hansda, a shopkeeper, said people are buying less as the spiralling prices are beyond many people’s reach. He said local supply has dried up as rain has damaged vegetables and other crops in this area. Kanu said the situation will not improve in the next fortnight. He expressed hope that in the second week of November, the prices might come down after local supply resumes. He said many shopkeepers have stopped selling vegetables as they fear they will face losses as their goods might not be purchased due to high prices. Another shopkeeper said potatoes are being sold for Rs 20 per kilo and onions for Rs 40. He said prices of potatoes and onions will come down only in December, when fresh stocks arrive from West Bengal and Nasik.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jamshedpur/jsr-braces-for-diwali-chhath-amid-soaring-prices-of-veggies/articleshow/87265700.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

This comes after Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd (JBVNL) officials allegedly gave them several assurances in the past eight months of replacing the poles but did nothing, prompting the locals to beg for money to complete the work at the earliest. The locals have announced a week-long begging programme, starting from Monday, from Mango Chowk. In the subsequent days, they would collect funds begging at Dimna Chowk, Hanuman temple, Daigutu, Pardih chowk and at surrounding landmark spots. As an initial step, the locals are begging at roadsides, later they will corporate houses for funds. Mango resident and BJP leader Vikas Singh, whom locals approached to lead the begging campaign, said the funds collected in begging would be deposited with the JBVNL to ensure there’s no funds shortage in executing the pole replacement work. “We made several requests to JBVNL for replacing the wooden poles but it was all in vain. We recently came to know that the work is getting delayed because of a shortage of funds. Hence, we decided to help the department with funds to get our work done,” Singh added. JBVNL’s Jamshedpur division general manager Paritosh Kumar, however, said there’s no dearth of the materials required for replacing the wooden poles. “Funds shortage is not an issue and we have sufficient material. Why the poles have not been replaced is a matter which I will look into,” Kumar added. Those living in Turiabera, Gajadih, Baliguma Bagan area, particularly, are scared of electrocution as some of the wooden poles are damaged because of rain. “Over 24 poles in eight slums, across the three aforementioned residential areas, need to be changed on an urgent basis,” D K Sahu said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/irked-after-jbvnl-mango-residents-begin-begging-campaign-to-replace-electric-bamboo-poles/articleshow/87265715.cms||B Sridhar

"All such schemes introduced by me during my previous tenure as the chief minister for downtrodden people were scrapped/withheld by the BJP during the five years of its rule. We are again rolling them out, " Soren said addressing in the local Santhali dialect. Explaining his prolonged delay in arriving to his constituency, Hemant cited the burden of vast responsibility in terms of looking after the entire state as a chief minister. "I beg pardon for being late to turn up before you as I am mandated to take care of the whole state. This coupled with Covid-19 pandemic made it difficult for me to come here before,” Soren explained and highlighted the efforts of his government about how thousands of migrant labourers who were stranded in faraway places were brought via planes and other means. He further said that with the sharp decline in coronavirus cases, the government is focusing on development works apart from introducing new welfare schemes for the marginal section of the society while referring to dhoti saari scheme that was relaunched recently. "Under the scheme people belonging to the BPL category can buy dhoti, sari and lungi by paying just Rs 10," he said. He also distributed assets to beneficiaries of different welfare schemes and inaugurating and laid foundation stone of series of development works in the area today. Soren also directed the local administration to highlight those schemes among the qualified beneficiaries particularly in rural areas so that they could avail them all. Soren was accompanied by Rajmahal JMM MP Vijay Hasda and his political representative Pankaj Mishra. They also attended another programme with CM at Rajabhitta in Boarijore block of the neighbouring Godda district and Patna in Sahebganj. Chief Minister is scheduled to attend the passing out ceremony of the new batch of trainee JAP constables in Sahebganj district headquarter on Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/hemant-slams-previous-bjp-govt-says-ex-cm-scrapped-schemes-for-poor/articleshow/87265625.cms||---

Lawyer Sumit Gadodia, who represented the Congress leaders, said the court of the speaker adjourned the matter after the petitioners sought time for filing a rejoinder to the reply filed by Tirkey and Yadav. In the petition, the BJP leaders have claimed that both Yadav and Tirkey had won from the then Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) ticket and later joined the Congress in violation of the anti-defection laws. It may be noted here that the speaker would also hear petitions filed against former chief minister Babulal Marandi under the anti-defection law on Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/speaker-adjourns-hearing-on-defection-of-jvm-p-mlas-to-cong/articleshow/87265736.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Madhupur BDO Rajiv Kumar Singh in his complaint dated on October 24 alleged that Dubey’s statement made through his Twitter handle on April 15 against Congress’s Jamtara MLA Irfan Ansari had the potential to trigger communal tension in the poll-bound constituency. “The honourable parliamentarian has violated the provisions of Sections 116,188,506 and 171(F) of the IPC and suitable legal action must be taken against him,” read the complaint which was filed after being directed by Deoghar deputy commissioner-cum-district magistrate Manjunath Bhajantri to do so on October 23. While reacting to the allegation on social media, Dubey said, “It is ridiculous for the Deoghar administration to lodge an FIR against me six months after the bypoll. This indicates the political vendetta.” This is not the first time that the Deoghar administration has slapped an FIR on Dubey. Bhajantri and Dubey have apparently been at loggerheads for a long time. Dubey had even accused the DC of acting at the behest of chief minister Hemant Soren, with whom Dubey does not see eye-to-eye.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/fir-against-godda-mp-for-tweeting-harmful-remark/articleshow/87265711.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Unfinished work may delay Sindri plant opening||Sindri: Even as Hindustan Urvarak and Rasayan Ltd (HURL) is confident of starting commercial production of urea from its upcoming fertilizer unit at Sindri by March next, ground realities suggest that it may get extended further. The delay in completion is bound to result in cost escalation of this ambitious project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After the then NDA government decided to close down all the loss making fertilizer units of FCI (Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd.) and HFC (Hindustan Fertilizers Corporation Ltd.) in 2002, there are no urea plants in the eastern region of the country. Farmers have to procure urea from northern and western parts of the country. Modi government, however, decided to set up new fertilizer units at Sindri, Barauni and Gorakhpur at a cost of Rs 6,000 crore per unit. HURL, a special purpose vehicle floated by a consortium of NTPC, CIL and IOC, is setting up 3,850 tonne per day neem coated gas based urea plant at all these places. Modi laid the foundation stone of the Sindri fertilizer unit on May 25, 2018. The plant was expected to start commercial production by May 2021. However, due to Covid-19, the possible production dates was initially extended to November 2021 and then March 2022. HURL MD A K Gupta, who recently visited Sindri to review the project, maintained that all the three projects got delayed by 10 months due to the pandemic. “The cost of each of the project has also gone up by nearly Rs 1,200 crore,” he added. GM of the Sindri project, K Jha said, “97% work of the project is completed and we are confident of commercial production by March next year.” However, some insiders said that construction of the bagging building of the plant is still to be over as the firm constructing it was referred to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for defaulting on bank loans. HURL management has now decided to get it completed through the petty contractor of the firm. According to reports, construction work of this building is still on halfway mark. Since there is no provision of silo, urea produced has to be directly sent to the bagging building and then to the platform for onward transportation through rail, said an official. Similarly, RITES is still in the process of laying rail tracks and electrify them. HURL is also yet to complete the process of recruiting its own manpower. “If the plant is to start commercial production by March, the operating team of HURL must start working with the project team to get familiar with the functioning of the plant,” said the sources. The GM, however, said that recruitment of 98 technical persons has been finalized and they have started joining in batches. “Initially the prime contractors, Technip and L&T, are to oversee running of the plant for 6 months and by that time our manpower shall be in place. The RITES has to complete tract work before March. We are striving hard to get the construction work of the bagging building completed on time,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/unfinished-work-may-delay-sindri-plant-opening/articleshow/87265695.cms||Anil Ashutosh
---||Ranchi||Congress and RJD leaders downplay their rift in Bihar||Ranchi: Amid the fractured alliance between RJD and Congress in Bihar, leaders of both the parties here said the gathbandhan in Jharkhand is intact and ruled out the two parties going separate ways and contesting the 2024 parliamentary elections independently. Leaders of both parties in Jharkhand described the developments in neighbouring Bihar as local and temporary and claimed that it was highly premature to declare that the alliance has snapped. State Congress president Rajesh Thakur said there are different kinds of talks and differences during the elections but the decision on two seats of Bihar does not reflect the national stance of the parties. He was referring to Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur seats in Bihar where bypolls are scheduled on October 30. He said, “RJD and Congress in Bihar and Jharkhand are separate units and the developments at one place does not impact the other unless there is a discussion at the national level.” Asked if he was trying to undermine RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s stand against Congress, Thakur claimed that decisions about an alliance are taken by the top leadership of the parties and much credence should not be given to individual statements. “We have a bigger challenge in the form of BJP to protect the democratic interests of the people in the 2024 elections. So all secular parties have to put aside their personal interests and fight for a common goal,” Thakur said. Expressing similar views, the state unit of RJD also described the developments in Bihar as local and temporary. The party's state committee member and spokesperson, Manoj Yadav, said RJD and Congress are alliance partners and not members of the same party. “The difference is the essence of alliance politics and we welcome it. There were some differences between us here also when erstwhile Jharkhand Congress chief Rameshwar Oraon tried to undermine RJD’s strength but everything was sorted out with the senior leaders of Congress and there is no malice anymore,” he said, stressing that the recent developments in Bihar are not going to impact their alliance in Jharkhand or at the national level. A senior Congress leader of the AICC claimed that the Bihar issue is being blown out of proportion to suit the political agenda of BJP and JD(U) in the neighbouring state. “We are trying to forge a stronger alliance of secular parties for which each and every big or small party would have to be ready to do their bit and sacrifice. The picture would be clearer as the national elections approach,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/congress-and-rjd-leaders-downplay-their-rift-in-bihar/articleshow/87265640.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Coal production limps back to normal, power crisis over: Experts||Ranchi: Resumption of economic activities across the country after the number of Covid-19 cases go down resulted in a sudden rise in demand for power and coal, which eventually stressed the coal producers, experts here said. If experts are to be believed, the recent coal crisis is linked to the demand-supply gap which is gradually coming back on track. While the resumption of industrial and business activities resulted in demand for power, extended monsoon played spoilsport with coal production which feeds around 80% of the power producers in the country. The Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), a subsidiary of Coal India Limited and one of the largest coal producers of the country, has ramped up its daily production target to 1.80 lakh metric tonne and is working towards escalating it further to 2 lakh tonne. The largest power producer — National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) — has also increased its coal production in all three mines — one each in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. CCL officials admitted that during the second wave, the demand for coal had reduced considerably. “We had written letters to the power producers to offtake coal being mined but having received no response from them. Hence, we were forced to cut down production to under one lakh metric tonne per day,” an official said, adding that the surge in demand started all of a sudden since September when the industries and markets started opening up. Sources said the manufacturing industry, mostly in western and central India had either closed during the second wave or were functioning at half capacity. “Workers started returning when the vaccination rate picked up and different state governments started issuing permits for the operation to the industries. Ahead of the Durga Puja, the economic activities touched the peak,” said Mukesh Kumar, a former member of the Chamber of Commerce here. Power engineers claimed that the coal crisis is also linked with extended monsoon this year. All India Power Engineers Federation member M P Yadav said the shortage of coal supply during monsoon is a regular feature. “This year, the situation was aggravated because of the extended monsoon which resulted in inundation of most of the open-pit coal mines, which constitute 70% of the coal mines in Jharkhand,” he said. During the rainy season, the coal stock in the yards of power producers often gets wet resulting in a reduction in power production. Yadav further said the coal is powdered in mills before being fed to the burners and if wet, they turn into paste resulting in poor efficiency. CCL officials also agreed that several open cast mines in Jharkhand were inundated and it was not possible to mine coal there. “The monsoon generally retreats by the second week of September, but this year, the rain continued till late October, resulting in the coal crisis during October,” the CCL official said. CCL’s head of public relations, Anupam Rana, said senior officials of the company are monitoring coal production from the fields on a regular basis and the situation has started to improve. “We are targeting two lakh metric tonne daily production and have escalated it to 1.80 lakh metric tonne as of date,” he said. Notwithstanding the claims of coal producers to have increased production, the shortfall in the local market continues as most of the coal is being sent to the big power producers. The state-owned power producer, Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited (TVNL) in Bokaro, is surviving with a one day stock and getting coal rakes on a daily basis to feed its plant. The CMD of TVNL, Anil Kumar Sharma, said they have shut one unit of 210MW since September and need around 2,700 metric tonne coal to run the second unit of 210 MW. “We have a stock of around 3,000 metric tonnes of coal and if there is no supply for two days, we will have to shut the plant,” he said.

---||Ranchi||NHM contractual workers’ stir likely to mar Cov mgmt in state||Ranchi: The ongoing strike by the contractual workers of the state unit of National Health Mission (NHM) -- considered the backbone of the state health department -- may derail the state’s management of the pandemic and that too at a time when Covid cases are witnessing a surge. Following Durga Puja, the state’s cumulative active case load has gone past the 200-mark and out of the daily target of 3 lakh vaccinations, Jharkhand has achieved only 50% of it so far. The protest has already derailed the daily reporting and evaluation of Covid data, as a result of which the state’s Covid dashboard hasn’t been updated since the stir began on October 10. NHM has also stopped issuing the daily Covid and vaccine tracker because of the strike. This has happened for the first time since the outbreak of the virus in March last year. Since a majority of the work is handled by the contractual workers, the effects of the strike is now being felt in other districts as well, besides Ranchi. “More than half of NHM’s staff work on a contract basis and they take care of data management, daily reporting, administrative works, managing files and programme management, among others. At the state level, all of these works are suspended at the moment and many districts, too, are experiencing similar issues. Work related to malaria, dengue and routine immunization is getting delayed as well,” said a member of Jharkhand health employees’ welfare association, under whose banner the strike has been organised. An NHM official, however, said that Covid work, such as testing and vaccination, has remained unaffected so far. “There is no effect on Covid management and all districts are taking care of their respective needs,” he added. Around 4,000 employees are protesting for reinstatement of a state programme manager named Jwala Prasad, who was terminated owing to financial irregularity, implementation of HR policy and pay in lieu of working on holidays, among others. NHM MD Bhuvanesh Pratap Singh didn’t respond to TOI’s calls, while state health minister Banna Gupta said, “I have already asked the NHM MD and health department to sort out the matter at the earliest.” The vaccination drive is also likely to be affected as NHM’s ANM/GNM workers, who also work on a contractual basis, are apparently also planning to join the protest. Talking to TOI, NHM’s ANM/GNM association’s secretary Veena Kumari said, “We have already given our in-principle support to the strike as the contractual workers are fighting for a genuine cause and if required, we will also go on strike. Despite working in tough conditions, we are continuing to work for public welfare but the government remains indifferent towards us.” An ANM claimed that the health department has recently slapped ‘false’ FIRs on 16 ANMs, who were part of a day-long protest at Nepal House on October 20. “Those ANMs were called for talks by the health department following the protest but the department slapped FIRs on them, citing violation of Covid protocols,” the ANM said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/nhm-contractual-workers-stir-likely-to-mar-cov-mgmt-in-state/articleshow/87265667.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Transition to low carbon economy warrants policy changes||Ranchi: The Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) on Wednesday organised a session here on the future of the economy and on the sustainability of livelihoods in a low-carbon economy. Policy-makers cutting across party lines discussed possible alternatives to coal and fossil fuel reserves which are limited and are a major cause for pollution. The CEED offered to provide a resource centre which will work as a common forum to facilitate research-based discussion and help the state government take informed decision in formulation of new policies and programs in this regard. BJP MP Sanjay Seth said that the transition from a coal and fossil fuel-based economy to an alternative would require social justice so that the livelihood of lakhs of people centered around coal is not affected adversely. JMM MLA Lobin Hembram said that the depletion of resources has already started affecting the masses. “We are witnessing migration due to a lack of resources and ill-effects of pollution, which needs attention,” he said. Congress and Ajsu Party agreed when Poriayhat MLA Pradeep Yadav stressed on involving the common people in the decision-making process. Ajsu Party’s Lambodar Mahto also agreed that it is the local residents who bear the brunt of a fossil fuel-based economy. Stressing on the need to find an alternative ecosystem, the director of Centre for Excellence in Green Energy & Efficient Technology at Central University of Jharkhand, S K Samdarshi, said, “Loss of jobs in the eventual phase out of coal and other resources must be tackled by a clear identification of the alternative sectors and new skill development programs to capacitate people for the suitable employments.” The CEO of CEED, Ramapati Kumar, said that there was an urgent need for bringing in enabling policy and financing framework with an implementation roadmap to ensure inclusive transition. “There has to be an inter-departmental and convergence approach since a transition is not confined only to energy and environment areas, which places the need of a multifaceted and inter-sectoral approach from key departments for effective planning and implementation,” he said adding that the resource centre is ready to extend help with research and experts’ guidance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/transition-to-low-carbon-economy-warrants-policy-changes/articleshow/87265690.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Touted as the country's largest pan India health infrastructure scheme, the mission is aimed at ensuring robust public health systems in both urban and rural areas, along with strengthening of surveillance and research so that states are capable of effectively responding to any public health emergency in the future and also combat disease outbreaks like Covid-19. The scheme is in addition to the existing National Health Mission that addresses the health needs in rural and urban areas. Addressing a gathering at Mehdiganj here on Monday after launching the mission and inaugurating 28 projects worth Rs 5,189 crore for Varanasi, PM Modi said, "Projects like PMABHIM, which are being rolled out as India's major step towards holistic healthcare while keeping health and wellness a priority, should have been done after independence. But, the previous governments kept the people deprived of facilities by not developing the health infrastructure." "Most of the areas had no hospitals. If hospitals existed, they lacked the facilities for accurate diagnostic tests, surgery and critical care. This led to crowding at big hospitals at major centres and made patients and their families struggle for facilities," he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-launches-64k-cr-project-to-boost-indias-health-infra/articleshow/87267307.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||India||Due to BJP 'threat', CPM may continue with Cong alignment||NEW DELHI: With the threat due to BJP intensifying since 2019, a broad consensus appears to have emerged at the end of the three-day meeting of the CPM Central Committee that it will be politically expedient to continue with the party’s existing political line vis-à-vis the Sonia Gandhi-led Congress, as was agreed in the Hyderabad party congress in 2018. In 2018, the CPM party congress had decided that though Congress, like BJP, represented the big bourgeoisie and that there could be no tactical line that treated it as an ally or partner in a united front, the BJP, and Congress cannot be treated as “equal dangers”. An outline of the party’s draft political resolution was discussed during the meeting. Sources said what stood out during the deliberations, a crucial precursor to the next party congress in Kannur in April 2022, was the “mixed bag” of reactions from Kerala leaders, many of who asserted that a “pragmatic line” to tackling Congress – allying in West Bengal and opposing in Kerala – actually helped CPM reinforce its sincerity and commitment in fighting the BJP and the right-wing. A section of Kerala leaders also pointed out that this approach bumped up minority support for CPM in Kerala and gave the LDF a historic second term in a state used to seeing a revolving door policy. While a section of leaders from Kerala and other states insisted that Congress cannot be the sole “anti-BJP fulcrum”, others argued that talk of electoral alliances just yet was premature and that such discussions should only be had based on prevailing situations in states and closer to polls. Sources said general secretary Sitaram Yechury, who is seeking re-election as party chief, underscored the threat BJP and RSS posed to the Left and secular, democratic movement. Quoting the CPM’s Party Programme, Yechury is understood to have told the meeting that RSS gets access to the instruments of State power and the State machinery when BJP is in power and that the Hindutva ideology “promotes revivalism and rejects the composite culture of India with the objective of establishing a Hindu rashtra.” The programme also says the spread of “such a communal outlook leads to the growth of minority fundamentalism. This has serious consequences for the secular basis of the polity and poses a serious danger to the Left and democratic movement.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/due-to-bjp-threat-cpm-may-continue-with-cong-alignment/articleshow/87267312.cms||Swati Mathur
---||Business||RPSG bags Lucknow franchise for ₹7k cr, CVC Ahmedabad for ₹5.6k cr||In 2008, when the Indian Premier League was a fledgling venture and investing in it was something of a leap of faith, eight victorious bidders collectively pumped in around Rs 3,000 crore to bag eight franchises. Thirteen years on, with the IPL firmly enthroned as one of the premier sports properties in the world, one company, RP-Sanjiv Goenka (RPSG) Group, bid Rs 7,090 crore—more than double the collective figure raised in 2008—to walk away with the Lucknow franchise. Private equity firm CVC Capital Partners was the other winner, bagging Ahmedabad for Rs 5,625 crore. The Indian cricket board (BCCI) began the bid process at 12.30pm IST in Dubai (11am local time) and spent the first six hours technically evaluating all bids to see if they met the eligibility criteria. It’s only from 6.30pm IST onwards that the board began to look at the financial bids. Adani Sportsline, considered a frontrunner for the Ahmedabad franchise, submitted a bid of Rs 5,100 crore for Ahmedabad as well as Lucknow. CVC bid Rs 5,625 crore for Ahmedabad and Rs 5,166 crore for Lucknow. RPSG Group bid the same amount (Rs 7,090) for both Ahmedabad and Lucknow. BCCI gave RPSG the choice of picking a city first, by virtue of being the top bidder, and the group settled for Lucknow. The Ahmedabad franchise thus automatically went to CVC. As one of the world’s largest private equity players, CVC comes with a deep knowledge of sports franchises and businesses. The PE player has been a very successful partner and business-builder for global sports platforms such as La Liga, Formula One, the rugby league and Moto-GP. A world leader in private equity and credit with $117.8 billion of assets under management, CVC will not just put the IPL under a global spotlight but is also expected to add serious value to the T20 league.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rpsg-bags-lucknow-franchise-for-7k-cr-cvc-ahmedabad-for-5-6k-cr/articleshow/87267313.cms||K Shriniwas Rao

The high court has also restrained the department from promoting the principal to block education officer. Justice Ramachandra Rao passed these orders on the petition of that postgraduate teacher (PGT) posted in Gurgaon district. She had sought directions to the government for quashing the August 6 orders of dropping the charges, pleading that the minister had no jurisdiction to interfere in the departmental proceedings, that too when the order itself stated that the charges were proved. She also sought further directions to act on the inquiry report and pass an order of punishment. The petitioner submitted that the local complaint committee of Gurgaon had found the principal guilty under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013. The counsel for the petitioner argued that: "Since in this inquiry under Rule 7 of the HCS (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 2016, the charges of sexual harassment were proved prima facie, the dropping of the charge-sheet appears to be arbitrary patently." A criminal case dated August 11, 2016, and registered under Section 354A (assault to outrage woman’s modesty) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) is pending against the principal. Justice Rao ordered: "In these circumstances… it is undesirable to grant any promotion to the respondent principal to block education officer." The next hearing is on January 27, 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/hc-restrains-hry-minister-from-promoting-principal/articleshow/87266142.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Chandigarh||12 districts in Punjab have Covid cases in single digit||CHANDIGARH: Amidst fear of the spread of Covid-19 during the festive season, the situation in Punjab appears to be in control as of now with 12 districts having active cases in single digit. Of these districts, three are having just one active case each. The count of patients undergoing treatment across the state stands at 229. As per the record, Nawanshahr, Mukstar and Mansa had just one active case on Sunday, while Pathankot and Moga had nine active cases each, eight in Barnala, seven each in Kapurthala, Ferozepur and Tarn Taran, five in Gurdaspur, and three in Sangrur. The drop in active cases has also relieved the pressure on the health facilities across the state. The occupancy of oxygen beds — 3,927 in government and 5,641 in private — has come down to just a little over 2%. As many as 9,375 oxygen beds, out of total 9,568, were vacant, while only 54 ICU beds out of 1,596 were occupied. In recent weeks, the state witnessed more recoveries than fresh cases, pushing the active case ratio near to 0.038% against the All-India active case ratio stands of 0.47%. Punjab deputy chief minister O P Soni warned people against letting their guard down. “We cannot lower the guard even if a single active case exists in the state or the surrounding areas,” said Soni who urged people be careful during the festive season. He asked people to get themselves if any symptom of Covid develops. The deputy chief minister said that the state government has so far vaccinated more than 76% of its population with at least one dose and around 29% of people are fully vaccinated. He appealed to everybody to get jabbed at the earliest and to follow the Covid appropriate behaviour as this is the only way to fight the pandemic. The vaccination is being done vigorously throughout the state and special camps are being organised to inoculate workers on their worksites, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/12-districts-have-active-cases-in-single-digit/articleshow/87266155.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||No MSP on bajra, farmers protest outside BJP MLA’s house, ask him to pay instead||Rohtak: Upset over not being able to sell their bajra crop on minimum support price (MSP), as promised by Haryana government, farmers from Rewari on Monday protested outside Kosli BJP MLA’s residence. The call to protest was given by farmers under Sanyukt Kisan Morcha. The protesters took a quintal of bajra packed in sacks and dumped it outside the residence of MLA Lakshman Singh Yadav. Police force was deployed outside Yadav’s residence to maintain law and order. Rajender Singh, SKM president in Rewari district, said the said BJP MLA daily claimed in public that MSP on crops would remain permanent. “We have brought one quintal bajra with us as it is not being sold at MSP in the market. Farmers are asking Yadav to ensure we get the right price,” he said. He said since bajra was not getting MSP in the market, Yadav could pay it since he claimed openly that MSP would not go away and was permanent. Ram Kisan Mehlawat, another farmer leader, said their protest was to expose the lies by BJP MLAs about MSP on bajra. “While the government claims that bajra is being sold at MSP of Rs 2,250, the reality is that it is being sold at Rs 1,200 only,” he said. Speaking to protesting farmers assembled outside his residence, Yadav said they were improving the system of buying crops on MSP and it needed everyone’s cooperation. “Since bajra is arriving from other states in the local market, in native farmers are getting left behind,” he added. The BJP MLA said he will speak to the CM to fix the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/no-msp-on-bajra-farmers-protest-outside-bjp-mlas-house-ask-him-to-pay-instead/articleshow/87266166.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||No lapses in sub-inspector exam, says Haryana commission chairperson||Chandigarh: Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) chairman Bhopal Singh on Monday reiterated that there had been total transparency and faultless in the conduct of written examinations for the recruitment of male and female sub-inspectors of Haryana police, held in September and October. Interacting with TOI, Bhopal Singh also cleared the air about not putting issues related to objections by candidates before releasing the result of tests. He accused YouTubers and coaching centres of defaming the commission and its officers, while referring to examinations at three centres in Gurugram. “Let me tell you that only unsuccessful candidates, coaching centres with vested interests and some persons on social media have tried to tarnish our image. Let me make it clear that only 10 out of 350 persons who appeared on October 13 could qualify and only 750 have qualified from those who appeared on September 26. Rest, just wait for the final results and appointments, then you shall come to know the reality,’’ said Bhopal. Bhopal admitted to the commission not raising objections and its remedies on the site before releasing results. He reasoned the move was targetted at avoiding an unnecessary delay. “There were only seven common objections in the question paper of September 26, while three objections were filed in the test conducted on October 13 were accepted by commission. We addressed those and gave marks to candidates. Largely, two objections were related to questions linked to me and home minister Anil Vij,’’ said the chairman. “So far as these two questions are concerned, we have already blacklisted the paper setter as he violated the rule related to questions on personal life etc,” he added. HSSC had been in the news over the reconduct of examinations at three centres of Gurugram and controversial questions asked from the candidates. In Gurugram, centres had opened the wrong set of papers. BOX FIR ordered Amid allegations of a scam in written examinations of Haryana Police women constable, the HSSC chairman has ordered registration of FIR and probe into 38 blank answer sheets found during checking. An AICC had alleged that this had to be done as a tool devised by the government to give backdoor entry to certain candidates. HSSC chairman Bhopal Singh said he himself had ordered an FIR to find out the truth behind blank sheets. “Let police reach out to candidates and find out the truth first,” said Bhopal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/no-lapses-in-sub-inspector-exam-says-haryana-commission-chairperson/articleshow/87266178.cms||Manvir Saini

The 17-month low of 889 cases (after 841 cases on May 5, 2020) was accompanied along with an 18-month dip in the daily toll (12). State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate reeled out a list of other "achievements": 14 districts reported zero cases; 12 other districts only had single-digit tallies; and the 12 deaths were from only five districts while 32 districts saw no deaths. Two Mumbai districts reported seven of the 12 deaths, while two deaths each were reported from Pune and Ratnagiri, and one death from Navi Mumbai.

Apart from the decline, state officials said the Monday drop could also be attributed to low testing over the weekend. Only 84,460 tests were conducted in the state on Sunday as against the daily target of 1.2-1.5 lakh. Tests done over the last 24 hours are the lowest since early this year. Mumbai, which saw a doubling of cases after restrictions for train travel were eased on August 15, registered 263 cases. On August 16, Mumbai had registered its lowest daily tally (195) this year so far. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said: “While fewer tests are done over the weekend (27,185 as against the usual 35,000-plus) due to a staff crunch, the low tally could also be due to the festival season.” Concurring, a senior state official said the Covid fatalities too could have dropped because of the staff crunch resulting in delayed mortality reporting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-logs-889-covid-cases-and-12-deaths-lowest-daily-figures-in-1-5-years/articleshow/87267418.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Kolkata||805 new Covid cases in West Bengal; doctors focus on next 2 weeks||KOLKATA: The number of Covid-affected people continues to fluctuate in Bengal and Kolkata with fresh cases hovering around the 1,000-mark. On Monday, new cases dropped to 805 from 989 on Sunday even as the number of tests, too, slid to 29,109. Experts feared that once the number of tests returned to the daily average of 42,000, fresh cases will cross the one-thousand threshold. Even as Kolkata recorded 229 cases on Monday, the positivity rate rose marginally to 2.7% on Monday from 2.3% a day earlier. “We are staring at a rise in numbers over the next two weeks. While most of the cases should be asymptomatic, thanks to vaccination and herd immunity, positivity rate will increase. In fact, there could be a big swell in the number of mild cases that could pull the positivity rate very sharply,” said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. A post-Puja spike was inevitable since Covid norms were ignored during the festival, said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “For more than a fortnight, there had been a complete defiance of Covid norms in Kolkata. It was similar to what had happened in Europe during last summer’s Euro Cup football tournament. The results, too, will be similar. So, a spike in the number of affected people will continue for the next few weeks,” said Dhar. Vaccination has played a significant role in preventing a spread of Covid-19, said Sarkar. Bengal and Kolkata recorded fewer cases in the week after Durga Puja this year when compared to the post-Puja week of 2020. “The lower number of cases in the post-Puja week reflects a drop in symptomatic cases. We have managed to vaccinate around 60% of the eligible population in Bengal and the results are evident. Since the second wave, mutations, too, have not been active that has prevented severe infections. So, this year we will see a lot more mild cases that will remain undetected,” said Sarkar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/805-new-cases-in-state-docs-focus-on-next-2-weeks/articleshow/87265531.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Many principals said they would soon start repairing the labs for the senior section to use it. “We have been sanitising the premises regularly. We will resume classes according to the SOP that the education department will suggest,” said Parimal Bhattacharyya, principal of Jadavpur Vidyapith. The West Bengal Government Teachers’ Association has written to the state, welcoming the reopening decision. They requested that the junior section be also allowed to go to school once or twice a week so that their lessons are not ignored either. “Online classes can’t be an alternative for in-person classes.We must ensure kids from all classes are called even if for one day a week. We must start the process with safety guidelines,” said Saugata Basu, secretary of the association. Before the Puja, schools were sanctioned funds for renovation. “Bu a lot of schools are yet to receive the money,” said Haridas Ghatak, president of Advanced Society for Headmasters and Headmistresses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/govt-schools-ready-want-junior-section-to-be-back/articleshow/87265566.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Mumbai||Central Railway, Western Railway to run 100% locals 1st time in 19 months||MUMBAI: The railways has decided to operate 100% suburban services on both Central and Western corridors from Thursday. The services return to their full schedule for the first time since March 22, 2020, when the national lockdown was imposed. CR and WR now run 1,702 and 1,304 services, accounting for 95.7% of the full schedule. "From October 28, CR and WR will run 1,774 and 1,367 services, respectively. However, only those categorised by the state government and approved by the ministry of railways are permitted to travel by trains," said CR chief PRO Shivaji Sutar. Expect rush to grow, so hiked ops, says rlysAt present, WR carries 18 lakh passengers per day as compared to 35 lakh before Covid. On CR, 21 lakh passengers travel now as against 45 lakh earlier. After PM Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown, local train services were suspended from March 22, 2020. A few services commenced from June 15 for essential services workers (see box). The categories of commuters allowed to take the local trains by the state government and approved by the ministry of railways have subsequently enlarged. Besides essential workers, the government has allowed fully vaccinated passengers to travel by train from August 15. Now, under-18 students who are not vaccinated are also allowed since schools and junior colleges have reopened. A senior official said: "More and more people are getting fully vaccinated and we expect the rush to increase. So we have decided to increase services." Commuters welcomed the move but demanded relaxation in ticketing norms as railways is now issuing only monthly season tickets. "Railways should permit quarterly as well as yearly season tickets" said Borivli resident Suman Rao. Mohammed Ibrahim, an AC technician who commutes from Kurla, said: "Why are daily tickets not issued? There are people in the informal sector who are on field duty every day at different locations. They are facing unnecessary harassment despite being fully vaccinated."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/central-railway-western-railway-to-run-100-locals-1st-time-in-19-months/articleshow/87267449.cms||Manthan K Mehta
---||Goa||Ex-governor Satya Pal Malik alleges Goa govt corrupt, BJP says baseless||PANAJI: In a major embarrassment for BJP, former Goa governor Satya Pal Malik on Monday levelled serious allegations of corruption against the Pramod Sawant-led government and said he was shunted from Goa in August 2020 since he had exposed it. “There was corruption in Goa government in handling of anything and everything. I was removed because of my allegation of corruption against the Goa government,” Malik, who is now the governor of Meghalaya, told a national channel. Soon after Malik made the allegations, BJP came out strongly against it and said it would apprise the central leadership about the true picture. “This is a totally wrong and baseless allegation,” state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said soon after Malik’s interview was telecast by a national channel. The opposition was quick to latch on to the allegations and demanded Sawant’s resignation and said the Centre should initiate a judicial probe. “When lockdown was declared in Goa, the government said they will not allow any essential commodities shops to remain open and the government provided services at the doorsteps. It was done at the insistence of a private company that had paid them money. Congress and others asked me to verify and I verified and informed the Prime Minister. He asked the same people whether they were involved. They will not say that they are doing it, but I knew it,” he said. Malik said he had directed trucks to stop transportation in Vasco, but they continued “and as a result of which Covid spread in the state”. He said while he was in Goa, he did not create a ruckus but tried to make Sawant understand the gravity of the situation.  “I also supported him, but there is a line a person follows. He said let’s demolish existing Raj Bhavan and construct a new one. It is a heritage property and also a functioning property and there was no need to demolish it. So, I said there was no need to do it,” he said. Malik alleged that Sawant came up with an idea for a new governor’s house when “Goa was under financial duress”. Malik’s allegations come three months before the state goes to polls, with BJP trying for a third term in the tiniest state. The opposition immediately called for Sawant’s resignation with opposition leader Digambar Kamat saying the CM “has no moral right to continue in power after revelations made by a constitutional head”. “Governor Satya Pal Malik ji always stood for the people of Goa. He spoke the truth and completely exposed corrupt @BJP4Goa @GovtofGoa @goacm. Pramod Sawant must resign immediately,” he said in a tweet. Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar also said Malik’s allegations have “vindicated” their charge that BJP was making “business” out of “people’s sickness” during Covid. “A sitting governor makes grave comments about a sitting @BJP4Goa CM who shamelessly amassed wealth when people of #Goa suffered & died in #COVID19! Won’t @psspillaigov demand his resignation & impose President’s rule? We exposed every corrupt act of theirs! For #Goa and #Goemkars!” Goa Forward Party president and Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai said in a tweet. Both AAP and Trinamool Congress have demanded judicial inquiry into the charges made by Malik against the Goa government. AAP convener Rahul Mhambre and parliamentary wing leader of TMC Derek O’Brien have demanded resignation of the chief minister. They said what their parties had been highlighting for long has been confirmed by a governor appointed by BJP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ex-guv-malik-alleges-goa-govt-corrupt-bjp-says-baseless/articleshow/87266293.cms||---
---||Goa||After singing paeans of Didi, GFP takes uncertain pause||Panaji: As Goa's political cauldron continues to boil, the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), which was on the verge of creating a major political upheaval, suddenly finds itself being cold shouldered in the state by a regional party. Goa Forward Party (GFP), which appeared to be gravitating towards TMC, has put the brakes on the talks with I-PAC and appears to be scouting for yet another chance with Congress to take on BJP. Political watchers in the state were confident that GFP and TMC were on the cusp of a tie-up. However, developments over the weekend appear to have dampened the appetite for the Bengali sweets that West Bengal chief minister Mamta Banerjee was expected to come bearing on Thursday. Key GFP office bearers, including party chief Vijai Sardesai, said that the party is no longer in a hurry to rush into an alliance with TMC, whose praises the party functionaries could not stop singing till last Friday. “We have never spoken to TMC. We have had talks with Prashant Kishor. We were thinking of some kind of a tie up but right now, we are going slow while trying to gauge the sentiments of the people,” said the Fatorda MLA. GFP has also called off the party state executive meeting where TMC’s offer was to be discussed. Sources said that TMC is keen on getting Sardesai on board ahead of the state assembly polls scheduled for early next year and had reportedly offered the Fatorda MLA opportunity to lead the state TMC unit. Former Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro’s appointment on Friday as the TMC national vice president only lent further credence to speculation that Sardesai will be the president of TMC in Goa. Sources said that GFP sympathisers and some of the party’s aspiring candidates are uncomfortable with TMC’s image. Many have expressed reservations about “abandoning” GFP and TMC’s perception as an “outsider” in Goa’s political landscape. Hyper regionalist aspirations, fanned by Sardesai and other local political outfits, appear to have convinced GFP to rethink its dalliance with Banerjee. “Whatever we do, we will never sacrifice our principle of Goem, Goemkar and Goemkarponn,” Sardesai said and claimed that doors for an alliance with like-minded parties remain open. After screaming blue murder against Congress for rebuffing alliance talks, the former deputy chief minister appears to have calmed down and is willing to give Congress a fresh shot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/after-singing-paeans-of-didi-gfp-takes-uncertain-pause/articleshow/87266312.cms||Newton Sequeira

Ajgaonkar, however, said he is in favour of the festival. “If the Covid situation is under the control,” he saidto a question if it should be allowed. “The PM has opened tourism. We want tourists to come and if we want rich tourists to visit Goa, we need such events.” Asked on what basis are the organisers of the festival already promoting the event, he said he didn’t know, and said, “I have asked the (tourism) director to look into it”. On Sunday, organisers of the festival said that it would be held from December 28 to 30 at Vagator, and that only double-vaccinated persons would be allowed.

---||Goa||Goa: TMC unveils nine-point ‘chargesheet’ against BJP govt||PANAJI: All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Monday released a nine-point ‘chargesheet’ against the BJP government that has been at the helm of the state for close to 10 years. TMC accused BJP of inept handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, failing to protect Goa’s ecology and identity, and not addressing the rising unemployment in the state. Addressing reporters at Azad Maidan, TMC national vice-president Luizinho Faleiro said successive governments have led Goa backwards and have done little to increase private sector employment and to protect the interests of locals. In the chargesheet, TMC accused BJP of mismanaging the state’s economy, the mining sector and the Covid-19 pandemic. The chargesheet also points to “state-sponsored environmental destruction” despite public opposition. TMC blamed past and present governments for betraying fishermen andfarmers, destroying healthcare and education, and slammed the rising crimes against women. TMC MPs Mahua Moitra and Saugata Roy along with former BJP MP Babul Supriyo were present at the release of the chargesheet. The party has already announced its decision to contest the assembly elections in Goa and its MPs and senior functionaries have arrived in Goa ahead of West Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee’s visit to the state scheduled for Thursday. “We are here for the women who cannot walk safely on the streets, for the youth who cannot get jobs,” Moitra said while speaking to reporters. “The Goa government has failed its people for the past 20 years, whichever government it was. The government of today is not one that was given the mandate by the people of Goa.” Supriyo expressed confidence that his party will do “very well” in the Goa assembly elections due early next year. “Law and order in Goa has reached an abysmal bottom under this government. These are the reasons why we are here. We think Goa deserves better and Mamata Banerjee can do it,” said Moitra. She also said that giving adequate representation to women in the state assembly and in Parliament is in TMC’s DNA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/tmc-unveils-nine-point-chargesheet-against-govt/articleshow/87266325.cms||---

A TMC delegation comprising Faleiro, party’s Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra, former Union minister Babul Supriyo, party functionary Priya Rathod met the girl’s family at their residence. Moitra and Supriyo are currently in Goa ahead of Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s visit to the state. Banerjee is expected to arrive in the state on October 28. “We will meet the governor and put forward the family's demands and we will ensure that there is justice for this girl,” Faleiro said. “We are with the family and we will fight for justice and take it forward because our party stands for women empowerment for justice and we will do that,” he said. “Under pressure the government had formed a three-member investigation committee to check on the postmortem and to examine the case, it reiterated that it was a case of drowning and that further investigation should be done. But it was not done so I think the middle class family is not getting justice because they are not mighty enough to tackle the government,” Supriyo said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/teen-girls-death-not-probed-as-per-law/articleshow/87266337.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The facility has been demanded for all the prisoners, irrespective of the cases under which they have been held. This comes after jail authorities in the state stopped the facility and resumed the conventional physical meetings with the prisoners from this week. The kin have submitted a memorandum to the Additional DGP (prisons) Sunil Ramanand and the special inspector general of police (prisons) Byculla Jail, Chhering Dorje. They have demanded that the jail authorities continue with a hybrid facility allowing the option of meeting in the jail as well as making a phone call. They have also cited examples like Tihar jail as well as prisons in Jharkhand and Gujarat where both the facilities are being continued. Physical meetings may not be possible for relatives of all the prisoners. There are elderly and financially weak relatives living away from Mumbai who may not be able to make it each time for meeting, the relatives stressed. Similar facility has been demanded for access to lawyers also. They have to wait in the long queues to get their turn and sometimes come repeatedly, says the memorandum. Susan Abraham, the wife of one of the accused, Vernon Gonsalves, said the authorities had already given an undertaking during the bail petition that the phone call facility would be allowed. Tushar Kanti Bhattacharya, the husband of Shoma Sen, the Nagpur university professor and an accused in this case, said that the relatives have to first register for the meeting. “After that they have to come within a stipulated time. If they miss, the whole process has to be repeated again,” he said. Even in the jail, the prison and relatives can only meet across a glass pane and talk through an intercom for a fixed time. Many times they conversation is incomplete and the line is cut. “During the pandemic two phone calls were allowed in a week. Sometimes even video calls were made but we would be happy even if normal calls are continued,” said Bhattacharya. Recalling his days as a prisoner in a jail in present day Telangana, he said all political prisoners were allowed to meet their kin separately in the office of the superintendent or the deputy. Sahba Hussain, the partner of Gautam Navlakha, a 70-year-old accused in the case, has said in a release that he is already in solitary confinement. “As it can take a toll on his health the two phone calls allowed so far were the only means for them to connect,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/allow-phone-calls-with-prisoners-say-kin-of-elgar-parishad-accused/articleshow/87265855.cms||Shishir Arya

On Monday, Godinho held a meeting with officials of the directorate of panchayats to discuss the procedure to issue house numbers to illegal houses to collect house tax. He also said that a block development officer will monitor the process of issuing house numbers to people to avoid misuse. Godinho had said that around 60% of houses in Goa do not have house numbers. In July, the Goa legislative assembly had passed the Goa Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which would enable persons living in panchayat areas to construct houses by demolishing their old structures with only the panchayat’s permission, and obtain house numbers for illegal structures. The bill then got the governor’s assent and became an act. The bill also sought to amend Section 7 of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act to hold the election procedure in a free and fair manner by handing over the election process, including reservations, to the Goa state election commission as mandated under the 73rd constitutional amendment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/govt-circular-soon-to-issue-numbers-to-illegal-houses-min/articleshow/87266360.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Get ready to reopen schools, colleges on November 16: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||SILIGURI/KOLKATA: Schools, colleges and universities in Bengal will reopen for physical classes after a 20-month hiatus on November 16, chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced on Monday. The school education department is likely to convene a virtual meeting with DMs and senior officials on Tuesday to discuss the modalities of completing preparatory work for the reopening. Banerjee is likely to attend it. Educational institutions in Bengal have been shut since March 16, 2020 over Covid fears. Physical classes resumed for a brief period for senior school students on February 12 this year only to shut down again in April as Bengal faced a severe second Covid wave. “Kali Puja is on November 4, Bhaiphonta on November 6, Chhath Puja is on November 10-11 and Jagaddhatri Puja is on November 13. Start making arrangements for reopening of schools and colleges after that,” the CM told chief secretary H K Dwivedi at an administrative meeting held for the two districts, Alipurduar and Jalpaiguri, at Uttarkanya on Monday. The initial reopening date, November 15, was revised as it’s the birth anniversary of Adivasi icon Birsa Munda. The resumption of offline classes will happen in a phased manner, beginning with classes IX to XII for schools. An SOP is likely to be issued soon, officials said. In its campus-reopening SOP issued in February, the state had asked schools to ensure 50% class strength on any given day. Schools were also asked to set up isolation wards and health facilities. The CM was considering re-opening educational institutions in November. Accordingly, repair work of school buildings had begun. On Monday, she directed the chief secretary to arrange for cleaning and sanitation of all educational institutions before their gates are thrown open to students. The CBSE and the CISCE first semester offline board examinations kick off in the last two weeks of November. But a formal notification by the state government is required to allow students back in school. The CM’s announcement also cleared that ambiguity. The state has nearly completed its vaccination schedule for all teachers and college-goers. Following Monday’s announcement, schools said they would wait for the government SOP and also meet parents for their suggestions. “We are ready to restart physical classes. We are aware of the health protocols having run schools for three months from February 12. While we wait for the government notification on how to conduct classes, we will start meeting parents and take their inputs from next week,” said Sunita Sen, principal, Ballygunge Siksha Sadan. Dominic Savio, principal of St Xavier’s College, said: “We have called a meeting on Tuesday to plan the necessary arrangements. Primarily we are planning to call final-year students and those who have practical subjects in a scattered manner. If permitted, we can open the hostel for outgoing students with one student in each room to follow Covid norms. Jadavpur University vice-chancellor Suranjan Das welcomed the decision. “With due precautions, and ensuring the safety of students, teachers, and staffers, this can be done,” he said. Lady Brabourne College principal Siuli Sarkar said, “We are expecting the detailed guideline very soon. The sanitisation for the college building and hostels is complete.” Several states have already begun physical classes for school and college students. Delhi, while reopening schools from September 1, had left it to parents to opt for offline or hybrid modes. Maharashtra, which reopened schools and college from September 29, is following staggered timelines to decongest classes. Educationist Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri said they were waiting for a long time for this announcement. “Covid cases are now increasing but we must understand the situation of children and that their studies have already been affected terribly,” he said. Educationist Pabitra Sarkar, too, felt there was no alternative to physical classes. “Everywhere physical classes have started with proper precautions,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/get-ready-to-reopen-schools-colleges-on-nov-16-mamata/articleshow/87266428.cms||Roshan Gupta

Do we want such people in Goa?” he said, speaking on the sidelines of an event in Panaji. Godinho also said that parties such as TMC would help BJP win the election. “People of Goa know who is what, and as far as BJP is concerned, these parties are giving BJP Z-security to form the government again,” he said. “By entering Goan politics, they will divide the votes, which will help BJP form the government with full majority, with more seats.” He was asked if the state would accord Banerjee Z-security on her arrival in Goa. Godinho, who is also protocol minister, said that that doesn’t fall in his domain.“Goans are gearing up to give a huge welcome to Banerjee, but little do people know what she used to do when Sonia Gandhi was leading Congress,” he said. “When Rajiv Gandhi was PM, I spent ten years with the youth Congress as president, and she was the West Bengal president. She used to argue and exhibit eccentric behavior. Does Goa want to welcome such leaders?” He further lashed out at local functionaries for joining TMC, and without naming anyone, said that a former Goa chief minister has neared his expiration date. “There are some Goans who would switch to Congress when they were nearing their expiration date. Such people have started to now switch to TMC as they are reaching their expiration date This party (TMC) is capable of unusual things that Goans have never seen — violence, creating divisions in society, etc. We don’t want this culture in Goa,” he said. With the meme wars between the two parties’ followers having begun, Godinho reacted to a cartoon of the PM, the Union home minister and the Goa CM being crushed under the TMC’s foot. “This shows their mindset,” Godinho said. “Do we want the culture of violence and stabbing each other for political purposes in Goa? Something like this will not work in Goa. This party is like decay, and if Goa’s infected with it, there will be nothing left.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/godinho-slams-tmc-says-goa-doesnt-need-culture-of-violence/articleshow/87266377.cms||---

Welcoming him, AAP Goa convener Rahul Mhambre said his entry has boosted youth and the party’s grassroots workers. Gauncar said that he joined AAP as he was impressed by party chief Arvind Kejriwal’s vision for Goa. “I have taken this step after observing AAP and seeing the work that has been done by the party both in Goa where they don’t have a single MLA and in Delhi where they have a government. It is very clear that this party is working for the betterment of the common Goenkar. There has been a mass movement from all across the state to support AAP today. AAP’s Rozgar Yatra has highlighted the true problems of Goan youth in getting jobs,” he said. Earlier, AAP had tried to woo MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco from the same constituency||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/zp-member-from-raia-joins-aap/articleshow/87266389.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Junior college admissions: Vid has more vacant seats than rest of state||Nagpur: Junior colleges in Nagpur and Amravati, the only two centres in Vidarbha under the Common Admission Procedure (CAP), are struggling to find students, with over 40% seats remaining vacant. On Sunday evening, education minister Varsha Gaikwad had tweeted admission figures for the five cities that are part of the junior college CAP. These statistics show that vacant seats in Vidarbha are much higher than those in rest of Maharashtra. The combined average of vacant seats in Mumbai, Pune and Nashik is 12%, while that for Nagpur and Amravati is around 42%. The state education department has again started admissions under CAP so that those who recently cleared the supplementary board exams are able to join. CAP is mandatory for the cities it is notified for, which at present is limited to five urban centres in Maharashtra. The entire process is online and is conducted by the state government. Ravindra Fadnavis, a senior academic, said CAP must be stopped immediately. Fadnavis said, “For so many years I have been saying that we need to scrap CAP, because there is excessive supply. Where in the world will you find admissions being given on merit rankings even though half the seats are empty. It’s illogical, everyone will get admission anyway.” Fadnavis represents an umbrella organization of educational trusts. Each member trust runs a number of schools and junior colleges. “Hence I know the problem that all these junior colleges, specifically those from vernacular medium, are facing. Our Marathi colleges are just not getting admissions as kids have started following the coaching class culture,”said Fadnavis. Science stream has been the dominant one in city’s admission landscape. Majority of the coaching classes enter into an informal agreement with junior colleges so that their students do not have to attend classes. Their attendance is marked by colleges while all the students sit in coaching institutes. Another senior academic, who did not wish to be identified, said, “Coaching classes are herding students to colleges just outside city limits, which is out of CAP ambit. And that too has led to vacant seats in the city.” TABLE SEAT NUMBERS (*Admissions are still going on) City---------------- Intake --------------------Vacancy Amravati---------- 16,230--------------------5,947 Mumbai----------3,21,620-----------------9,283 Nagpur----------59,195----------25,902 Nashik----------25,380--------------------6,317 Pune----------1,13,285--------------------40,575||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/junior-college-admissions-vid-has-more-vacant-seats-than-rest-of-state/articleshow/87265894.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A well-known actress and playwright from the city, Shweta Pendse, has written screenplay and dialogues for the movie while software engineer Rohan Gokhale is one of the music directors. The team of producers attended the award function on Monday. Dr Chimote said he has no words to express the joy. “This award was announced months back and we were waiting for this moment. We are more happy to bring a National Film award to Nagpur and Vidarbha,” said Dr Chimote. Apart from being a leading embryologist, Dr Chimote runs ‘Panchajanya’ that invests in movie production. Pendse said that the basic storyline was so interesting that she enjoyed writing the screenplay. “In some schools of Buddhism, Bardo is an intermediate, transitional or liminal state between death and rebirth. It was amazing experience to write about something after death and before one’s next birth, when one’s consciousness is not connected with a physical body,” said Pendase. She has also penned lyrics for one of the songs. “Singer Savaniee Ravindrra won the best playback singer award for the same song which brought double delight to me,” she said. Bardo’s team of actors includes popular names like Makarand Deshpande, Anjali Patil, Ashok Samarth and Pendse. The Nagpur connection - Bardo is director Bhimrao Mude’s second Marathi film - It is produced under banner of Ritu Films and Panchajanya Productions - Won National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Marathi - Also bagged Best Female Playback singer for Savaniee Ravindrra - Screenplay and award winning song penned by Shweta Pendse, a Nagpurian - Panchajanya Production is a venture of Dr Nishad Natchandra Chimote and Rohan Gokhale, both Nagpurians||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/marathi-film-bardo-produced-by-city-embryologist-wins-national-award/articleshow/87265936.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

At least five more bodies are expected to reach Kolkata on Tuesday, all casualties of a Himalayan tragedy. Several more trekkers had gone missing in treacherous weather between Harsil — at an altitude of 2,745m in Uttarkashi — and Chitkul at an altitude of 3,450m in Himachal. Grief-stricken family members of Subhayan Das, Tanumay Tewari, Bikash Makal, Richard Mandal and Sourav Ghosh were in tears as they received the coffins that reached the city in two flights on Monday. Tanumay Tewari’s body reaches his Nepalgunj home and a local pays respects to Subhayan Das in Kalighat While Das is from Kalighat, the rest are from Nepalgunj. October 14 was the last time the family members were able to communicate with them. The bodies were spotted on October 22. While the heady intoxication of trudging through the Himalayas was what drew these men time and again. Das’ family members had urged him to take a break as he was scheduled to get married next year. “Trekking, like any adventure sport, involves risk. We had pleaded with Subhayan to desist from going on the trek this time. But he shrugged off our fears and went all the same. I guess, this was his fate,” said his brother Subhojit. Laboni Majhi, wife of trekker Sukhen Majhi who is still missing in the mountains, was torn between grief for her nephew Tanumay whose body reached the city and uncertainty over her husband’s fate. “For the rest, there is a closure. But for me, I don’t even know what is in store. There is also a possibility that his body may never be found,” said Laboni, breaking into sobs. Bandana Makal, a college student and sister of Bikash, said the loss of her brother had plunged the entire family into financial difficulty. “He was the family bread-earner. I don’t know whether I will be able to fund my college studies but I know I have to start earning soon,” she said. Nearly all the men who have died provided the financial bedrock on which their families depended. Bishnupur MLA and minister of state for transport Dilip Mondal, who visited the families, said he would try to extend whatever help possible to the families. “They were brave men pursuing their passion. We are proud of them,” he said. Bishnupur-I BDO Subir Kumar Dandapat, who was at the airport to facilitate the transport of the bodies, said the government had been in touch with the families all through the difficult phase and would continue to offer support.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/5-trekkers-return-home-in-coffins-more-to-be-brought-back-today/articleshow/87265037.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||India||Centre reiterates opposition to gay marriages||NEW DELHI: Marriage is recognised only between "a biological man and a biological woman" under the Indian law, the Centre on Monday told Delhi High Court, reiterating its stand. "The law as it stands...personal laws are settled, and marriage, which is contemplated, is between a biological man and a biological woman," solicitor general Tushar Mehta submitted before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, opposing a clutch of petitions seeking recognition/registration of same-sex marriages. Mehta echoed the government's earlier stand disclosed in an affidavit that a "spouse" means either a husband or a wife and "marriage" is a term associated with heterosexual couples. "The issue here is whether marriage is permissible between homosexual couples. Your lordships have to see that. There are some misconceptions regarding the Navtej Singh Johar case. It merely decriminalises consensual homosexual act. It does not talk about marriage," Mehta contended, adding that there is no need for the Centre to file any specific reply regarding Citizenship Act, which has also been invoked by certain petitioners. The bench also heard the counsel for the petitioners. Advocate Karuna Nandy, appearing for one of the couples, said they got married in New York and the laws applicable were Citizenship Act, Foreign Marriage Act (FMA) and Special Marriage Act. She pointed out that Centre had not yet filed a reply to her clients' plea that highlighted how Citizenship Act was silent on the gender and sexuality of the spouse. Senior advocate Saurabh Kirpal, representing another set of petitioners, said the Supreme Court verdict on homosexuality might not have expressly allowed same-sex marriage, but constitutional jurisprudence required interpretation and the verdict favoured recognising it. The high court listed for final hearing all petitions that include two same-sex couples seeking a declaration recognising their union under the special, Hindu, and foreign marriage laws. It also allowed the parties to file replies and posted the matter for November 30. Petitions have also been filed by two men who got married in the US but were denied registration of their marriage under FMA. Another petition seeks to allow a foreign-origin spouse of an OCI cardholder to apply for OCI registration regardless of the gender or sexual orientation. The other petitioners have contended that homosexuality has been decriminalised by the apex court, but same-sex marriages are still not being allowed under Hindu Marriage Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-reiterates-opposition-to-gay-marriages/articleshow/87267538.cms||---

Airtel formally communicated its decision to the telecom department last week, kicking off the process for availing relief on statutory payments. The company has also said that it wants to retain the option of pre-paying according to NIA (notice-inviting applications) norms of the spectrum auction rules. In line with the reforms unveiled for the telecom sector, the government recently wrote to telcos such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio, asking them to convey by October 29 if they would be opting for the four-year moratorium on dues. Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal had said last month the company will opt for payment moratorium and redirect the cashflow to aggressively build networks. "Overall cash flows of the government has to be invested back in the country and industry. It has to be utilised. There will be no dividend from this."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/airtel-to-opt-for-4-yr-moratorium-on-dues/articleshow/87267541.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Follow 50% occupancy rule, West Bengal govt tells bars||KOLKATA: The government, over the weekend, instructed bars and eateries in the city to adhere to Covid-safety guidelines which include allowing guests to occupy only 50% of the establishment’s capacity, screening visitors for fever and social distancing. This led many outlets in the city to cancel their plans around the India-Pakistan cricket match on Sunday evening to prevent crowding. Officers of local police stations either visited or called up the managers of several bars in central Kolkata and Park Street to check if the guidelines were being followed. Managements of bars and eateries have also been told to shut down by 10pm, which has led to many outlets not accepting orders after 9.30pm-9.45pm. Bars and eateries had been told to continue following the latest order till further notice, but it was issued afresh over the weekend keeping in mind the cricket match. “On Saturday, we received instructions from the authorities to strictly follow the guidelines. Usually, high-voltage sports events attract a lot of guests, which increases our sales. But we decided to adhere to the order and follow all the guidelines,” said a representative of a pub inside Quest Mall. Local police also contacted some of the bars in central Kolkata with the guidelines. “We were instructed to only allow guests to fill up 50% of the capacity. The place also had to be shut by 10 pm. We are adhering to the guidelines given to us and are not accepting orders after 9.45pm,” said Sandeep Sehgal of Broadway Hotel on Ganesh Chandra Avenue. Some clubs also received calls from their respective local police stations on Sunday evening. “The officers of the local police station contacted us and told us to abide by the rules, which we are doing. We have already instructed our staff to switch off all the lights in the club before 11pm. The club has already issued a circular in this regard,” said Chandan Roychowdhury, secretary, Calcutta Rowing Club. “There was a phone call from the police and we informed them that we were closing everything by 10.30pm. Our last drink order is now at 9.45pm,” said Subrata Guha, joint secretary, Lake Club.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/follow-50-occupancy-rule-govt-tells-bars/articleshow/87265093.cms||Zeeshan Javed
