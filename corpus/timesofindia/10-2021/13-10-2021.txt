Sakir alias Sakir Ahmed of Pahari and his associates Kasam Khan and Jameel Khan from Baitullah, all in their late 20s, would befriend men on social media in the guise of women and get them to strip during online chats and record the same. Later, showing the videos, the accused would blackmail the victims. The CID said the trio was arrested following three complaints. “They had extorted more than Rs 1.5 lakh from the victims in the three cases. When the suspects started demanding more money, the victims filed a complaint with us in March,” the press release read. The accused had purchased SIM cards by producing fake documents. “Last month, we had arrested three men from Rajasthan on charges of illegally selling SIM cards against fake documents. The accused had bought 200 SIM cards from them. They are small link in a big chain of network rooted in Rajasthan and surrounding areas,” an officer said. Asked about the tentative number of cases that the accused could be involved in, another officer said: “We have taken them in police custody. We need some time to arrive at the conclusion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-from-rajasthan-held-for-running-sextortion-racket/articleshow/86975994.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: When slush piled up at residents’ doorstep in Kothanur||BENGALURU: When Patel Muniswamppa Layout in Kothanur was flooded after downpour in September last year, residents thought it was a one-off incident. But they were proved wrong on Monday night after heavy rain left the layout inundated again. The roads were flooded and rain water stopped at the threshold of most houses. But by then the swirling waters had caused enough damage to their vehicles parked outside. Residents had spent thousands of rupees on fixing the damage caused to vehicles after they were submerged in rainwater last year. Lt Col Emmanuel P Dayal, a resident, said: “Last year when a similar incident occurred, I spent Rs 65,000 to have my car repaired. So many others from the layout had to replace their engines completely.” The layout is built adjacent to a stormwater drain which carries water from eight villages in the area. The drain separates Kothanur from Narayanpura and eventually flows into Kalkere. “The stormwater drain becomes very narrow after Kothanur police station. We have requested the MLA several times to widen the drain as well as desilt it so as to increase the capacity. Recently, all hyacinth was removed and dumped alongside the drain itself which has flown into it and clogged it, causing the water to flow in the reverse direction and enter our layout,” Dayal added. There are close to 100 houses in the layout and almost every single one was affected on Monday night. Dayal said his house was the last in the layout. “It started pouring heavily at 9.30pm on Monday and after sometime we could hear the water gushing into our basement.” The residents pointed out the road had been dug up over two years ago for various reasons and has not been restored yet. They still have to walk around in sludge and puddles. Ravi Pius, a resident, said: “My two-wheeler is now at the service station as it was completely under water on Monday. Last year, I spent a huge amount of money on having my car repaired. I have been living in this layout for two years and we witnessed two such incidents. BBMP is least bothered about our misery.” The assistant executive engineer for the ward said the area needs a bigger storm water drain. "Temporarily, we have been given orders to increase the depth and width of the drain to prevent flooding. Once the rain stops, work will commence on restoring the roads in the layout."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/when-slush-piled-up-at-residents-doorstep/articleshow/86976002.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Flooding caused Rs 1.5 crore loss, say Commercial Street traders||BENGALURU: Traders of Commercial Street said they have lost material worth Rs 1.5 crore due to rainwater flooding their premises in the last couple of days. They are blaming the poor quality of development work taken up on the avenue by Bengaluru Smart City Limited (BenSCL). While the 458-metre-long stretch has been getting waterlogged at the slightest hint of rain for over a month now, things worsened due to the recent downpour. Zuhayr Ebrahim, member of the Commercial Street Traders Association, said they are desperately waiting for their suffering to come to an end. “Looks like the Smart City architects failed to do their job properly. There is a new architect who is working now to fix the damage. The quality of stones used for the work is very bad; they keep popping up every time it rains,” he said. Azam Sait, owner of Aanchal and member of Bengaluru Commercial Street Association, said he has incurred a loss of Rs 30 lakh over one year due to BenSCL work.“Every time it rains, water gushes into many stores on Commercial Street and traders are incurring huge losses. Smart City won’t compensate us,” he rued. Sait said the traders have suffered losses of Rs 1.5 crore in the last few days. The Rs 5.4-crore Smart City work to redevelop the road began in December 2020, but was disrupted due to the pandemic. The traders agreed to wait for a year till the work is completed, hoping the authorities would beautify the stretch and help in increasing customer footfall. “The tender was awarded favouring an architect who did not have the ability to execute the work, which has affected Smart City work,” admitted sources in BenSCL. “The architect who is currently executing the work, was the first preference, but internal politics resulted in another architect getting the contract but he failed in performing his duties. Now the old architect is working,” they said. “The problem of waterlogging and water entering the shops of Commercial Street has been resolved. It was due to some issues with drains. That has been fixed,” P Rajendra Cholan, MD, BenSCL, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/flooding-caused-1-5cr-loss-say-commercial-st-traders/articleshow/86976010.cms||---

According to a complaint filed by Sheikh Mastan, resident of MS Palya and automobile mechanic, he had borrowed Rs 25,000 from a financier, Ravi Kumar of Tindlu in Vidyaranyapura, in May when lockdown was imposed and his earnings were dented. According to Mastan, he had repaid around Rs 10,000. But due to business being hit, he could not pay the daily instalments during October. On October 8 morning, Ravi is said to have visited Mastan’s shop, asking why the loan repayment was stopped. Mastan said he would arrange the money and Ravi left saying he would return by afternoon.  Ravi returned to garage at 1pm. But Mastan was not there. Mastan’s elder son, a class IX student of a private school, was inside the shop and was attending online class on his father’s mobile. “Ravi asked my son where I was. When Tabrez told him that I had gone out for work, Ravi abused my son. He hit him on his chest and thigh with a hammer,” Mastan said. A little later, Mastan returned and found his son crying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/financier-attacks-borrowers-minor-son-with-hammer/articleshow/86976015.cms||---

At present, police is presently managing the system through a private company and a division bench is considering petitions to hand over the system to TDB. In a report filed to the high court, Sabarimala special commissioner N Manoj said it is the TDB that has the authority to manage the virtual queue system as per law. The report also noted that it is the devaswom boards that manage the websites of Vaishno Devi temples and such a system should be followed at Sabarimala also. Police is effectively controlling the crowd at Sabarimala but there is no need to allow the force to manage the virtual queue system as police can control the crowd by verifying the coupons issued through the system even if the devaswom board is managing the system, the report said. The court was also informed by the special commissioner that the emblem of the police is given priority on the website for virtual queue system and that there are advertisements of private firms on the homepage itself. Even though the number of darshans allowed when the temple opened in August and September last year was fixed at 15,000, only less than 30 per cent of this figure came for darshan, the report stated. Further, the special commissioner said the website is getting lakhs of visitors per day as it is the only online booking service. If online facility for booking of pooja and making donations are made available at the website, the number of visitors can be increased and revenue will increase, the commissioner suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sabarimala-virtual-queue-tdb-has-right-to-manage-not-police-kerala-hc/articleshow/86973995.cms||Mahir Haneef

One of the five slain terrorists was identified as the killer of migrant food vendor Virendra Paswan in Srinagar on October 5. While the terrorists who killed a JCO and four soldiers in Poonch on Monday appeared to have escaped the Army's dragnet, the overnight operation in Shopian marked the second consecutive counter-terrorism success in the Valley in as many days following the killing of two TRF terrorists in separate encounters in Bandipora and Anantnag. One of them was linked to a recent civilian killing in Bandipora. "At about 6pm Monday, acting on specific inputs about the presence of terrorists in Tulran and Feeripora villages of Shopian, a joint team of the police, the Army's 34 Rashtriya Rifles and CRPF launched a cordon-and-search operation in these areas," a police spokesperson said. "The terrorists were given repeated opportunities to surrender. Instead, they fired indiscriminately, forcing our team to retaliate." The operation in Tulran continued overnight, although there was no firing from either side for some hours until dawn broke. "In the morning, announcements were made again to get the terrorists holed up in the buildings to surrender. They responded by opening fire again," the spokesperson said. IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar identified the three terrorists killed in the Tulran hideout as Danish Hussain Dar of Shopian, Yawar Hussain Naikoo of Pahlipora and Mukhtar Ahmed Shah of Sindbal Ganderbal. Mukhtar had carried out the attack on migrant vendor Paswan, he said. The two terrorists killed in the other gunfight at Feeripora village were Ubaid Ahmad Dar of Ray Kapren and Khubaib Ahmad Nengroo of Braripora. Both were TRF members working under the Lashkar-e-Taiba's command. IGP Kumar said the police, Arny and CRPF had been working with "great synergy and coordination on the ground to carry out counter-terrorism operations in a professional manner without collateral damage". In Jammu, security forces continued scouring a forested area connecting the twin frontier districts of Rajouri and Poonch for the terrorists involved in the killing of a junior commissioned officer and four soldiers despite indications that they may have fled deeper into the jungle terrain. "After the initial encounter at Charmer village of Surankote, the terrorists fled to nearby Bhangai village of Rajouri, leading to another encounter," an official said. "The exchange of gunfire between the two sides stopped after some hours, suggesting that the terrorists escaped." The entire forest belt in the Rajouri-Poonch axis has since been cordoned off and a search operation was underway till late on Tuesday. Senior police and Army officers have reached the area to oversee the operation, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/5-terrorists-killed-in-twin-swoop-on-valley-hideouts-poonch-operation-hits-forest-dead-end/articleshow/86983085.cms||M Saleem Pandit

India are the only unbeaten team in the championship but two unconvincing draws against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka made life difficult. A win against Nepal kept the seven-time champions alive, and they now need to edge past leaders Maldives to finish among the top two. “It’s clear what we need to do,” coach Igor Stimac told reporters on Tuesday. “From the very beginning, we have to go for a win. That's how we will approach the game and that's what we are working on. The team has done well considering the short time for preparation. We had just two shots against us in three matches. Our goalkeeper was not busy at all.” Goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu has had an easy time, but it’s the strikers who have had it tough. Captain Sunil Chhetri has scored both goals so far, taking his international tally to 77, the same as legendary Brazilian striker Pele. The others have simply failed to rise to the occasion. “There is an old problem which is following us and that’s converting chances. We cannot be dependent on just one player and need to be more confident in front of goal,” said Stimac. India must score against the hosts to make it to the title clash. A draw will be enough for Maldives, who did not have the best of starts as they lost to Nepal, but two victories against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka took them to the top of the table. The home crowd will root for Maldives, but India must find a way or risk losing two successive editions of the SAFF Championship for the first time since inception in 1993.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-battle-maldives-for-place-in-saff-final/articleshow/86976845.cms||---

Lt Gen D P Pandey said all such operations were purely based on "human intelligence" about terrorist presence and plans. The GOC urged both security forces and the people of J&K to be conscious about maintaining communal harmony while going after the terrorists responsible for the latest round of attacks in which Kashmiri Pandits, Sikhs and other minority communities have been the prime targets. On infiltration attempts by terrorists from Pakistan, Lt Gen Pandey said, "The Army is alert and ready to foil any infiltration attempt along the LoC. Terrorists operating in the hinterland will be killed with the help of inputs from the people of J&K," he said, paying tributes to the bravery of the five Army personnel killed in action at Dera Ki Gali on the Poonch-Rajouri border on Monday. The GOC ruled out the need for deployment of additional forces anywhere in Jammu and Kashmir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-link-between-army-ops-and-targeted-terror-killings-goc/articleshow/86976953.cms||M Saleem Pandit

In parallel, we aim to launch a Hubilo marketplace that will provide a collection of vendors and services that will allow our enterprise clients to plan out a more comprehensive event strategy in one place. We will also continue to expand the go-to-market footprint of Hubilo across the globe, with a particular focus on North America and EMEA,” said Hubilo founder Vaibhav Jain in a blogpost on Tuesday. Hubilo went from zero revenue to a million-dollar company in less than a year. Jain said this was because of his “amazing team who rather than quit as our revenues dwindled, worked tirelessly to build a new engagement platform in 26 days.” “They not only saved the company, but they brought to us our loyal customers and partners, all of whom provide us with endless inspiration and fuel for continued growth,” he said. Jain is a computer graduate from Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA- IICT), with ten years of marketing, operations, and finance experience in the IT sector. Jain said there are many events platforms in the market. “None of which were built around the understanding that the top KPI for most events is engagement…And none of which are building for a future in which we can add revenue channels to already successful event models such as sports and concerts. There are sizable TAMs (total addressable market) that we have not even begun to scratch the surface of, but with your help, we are excited to be the first to successfully expand the TAM potential of this new virtual and hybrid world,” he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hubilo-resurrects-gets-125-million-in-funding/articleshow/86977072.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

The National Games were originally scheduled to be held in 2011 but have been postponed several times with Goa’s lack of preparedness among the prime reasons. “We don’t know when the National Games are going to happen, but from our side we are fully prepared. We are almost ready with the infrastructural work,” Sawant said during the general body meeting of the Sports Authority of Goa (SAG), which he chaired on Tuesday. While the state government has consistently maintained they are “almost ready” with the infrastructure, several projects are still awaiting completion. Refurbishment of swimming pool at Campal, upgradation of squash court at Chicalim, construction of lawn bowls court at Chicalim, development of lawn tennis courts at Fatorda, construction of changing room at hockey ground (Mapusa) and development of baseball field at Campal are yet to be completed. The SAG general body has told Goa Olympic Association general secretary Gurudutta Bhakta to convey its message to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and seek clarity on fresh dates. With state assembly elections scheduled for early next year, the National Games could be held in Goa only after monsoon. Sports minister Manohar Ajgaonkar said the state government is spending a lot of money on sports activities, but the associations have to step up and do its bit. “The government has provided better infrastructure and we require players to win medals for Goa,” said Ajgaonkar. The SAG general body agreed to allow state associations to engage coaches on their pay-roll, expenses of which would be reimbursed to the state sports association. The coaches will be appointed for a maximum period of one year and earn a monthly remuneration of Rs 40,000. Bruno Coutinho, director of coaching at SAG, will be member of the selection committee for appointment of coaches. "One coach shall be permitted for each registered state sports association and applications are invited from all associations with deadline to submit this request by October 31, 2021,” SAG said in its agenda note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-know-when-national-games-will-happen-but-goa-fully-prepared-pramod-sawant/articleshow/86977162.cms||---

POPSK Dombivli is the 13th POPSK under the jurisdiction of Regional Passport office Mumbai and is a part of the cooperation between the Ministry of External Affairs and Department of Posts to improve the access of passport related services to citizens. Earlier, Thane District had only one passport office in Thane. Kalyan Lok Sabha MP Dr Shrikant Shinde who had taken initiative to start passport office in Dombivli, said, “In 2017, I managed to get a new passport office sanctioned for Dombivli by Sushma Swaraj ji but later due to some technical problems related to the office in Dombivli, the project got delayed”. Dr Shinde said, “When the project was delayed many opposition leaders from the city targetted me but I continued my follow-up with the centre and recently when I met Communications Minister Devusinh Chauhan, he resolved the technical problem related to the new passport office ”. The new passport office will benefit around 50 lakh citizens from Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath, Badlapur and other adjoining areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/dombivli-gets-post-office-passport-seva-kendra/articleshow/86973938.cms||Pradeep Gupta

However, cryptocurrency exchanges are the real facilitators that have established the crypto market and catapulted cryptocurrencies to massive popularity. Let's revisit the world of cryptocurrency exchanges and the way they operate. CryptocurrencyLiveCryptocurrencies exchanges are online platforms where trading of digital currencies and fiat currencies take place for which a transaction fee is necessary. The cryptocurrency exchanges like ZebPay act as trustworthy intermediaries between buyers and sellers. * The trading of cryptocurrency involves buying and selling of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Cardano, etc. - Trading could also include changing digital currencies into fiat currencies and vice versa. * Exchanges can be used to convert cryptos back into fiat currencies when the user wants to withdraw the amount from the banks. How do these exchanges work? Before we understand the working of exchanges, let us remember first that all the cryptocurrency transactions and trading done through the exchanges are recorded on a distributed ledger. There are a few basic steps to be followed for crypto trading: * Firstly, you need to open an account or get registered in one of the crypto exchanges based on your own research and inclination. * Then the crypto exchange needs to be downloaded, and an account has must be created after fulfilling KYC, email and mobile verifications. * Finally, a password needs to be set, the user finally gets officially into the world of crypto trading. This password needs to be remembered for further uses. * Crypto exchanges allow buyers to deposit money, using various methods like direct bank transfer, UPI, using debit or credit cards. Now, based on the regulatory framework and customer’s convenience, crypto exchanges can be centralized or decentralised. In India and across the world centralised exchanges (CEXs) are the most trusted and widely prevalent crypto exchanges as they are controlled and regulated by the exchange, which securely holds the customer’s money like a bank. They are known for higher liquidity and faster transactions. Decentralised exchanges (DEXs) offer a peer-to-peer marketplace that connects buyers and sellers directly for trading without involving intermediaries.

After a dull 2020, the effigy makers in Gurgaon say they are seeing a revival with sales almost touching pre-pandemic numbers. Over two dozen of these effigy makers sit on the roadside of MG Road in Sector 14, selling Ravana effigies anywhere from one-foot-tall to over eight feet high. They range from Rs 500 to over Rs 8,000. Over two dozen of Ravana effigy makers sit on the roadside of MG Road in Sector 14Makers and sellers of effigies begin lining up the sides of this road every year about two weeks before Dussehra. These craftsmen say that last year was bad as there were hardly any takers for these effigies due to the pandemic. But things have turned around this year. As many residential societies in Gurgaon are planning Ravana dahan this year, their sales have been good though not quite as good as they used to be. However, these makers hope it will improve in the days to come. Many people buy effigies up until the last day and the last two days actually make up for a bulk of their overall sales.

---||Business||5 developing countries will accept Bitcoin by the end of 2022: BitMEX CEO predicts||NEW DELHI: The CEO of cryptocurrency exchange, BitMEX, Alex Hoeptner has spoken about Bitcoin adoption in developing countries. Hoeptner’s article ‘Developing Countries are leading the way in Bitcoin Adoption’ published on October 6 on the BitMEX blog explores the future of Bitcoin adoption in countries that are currently undergoing financial distress like El Salvador. CryptocurrencyLiveHoeptner substantiated his prediction with three reasons: * Remittances as one of the key reasons. - He quoted a World Bank’s report, according to which middle and low-income countries receive about 75 percent of the total global remittances. - However, the current services providers charge as high as 10 percent for sending money home. - Bitcoin addresses the issue with extremely low fees and quicker and 24x7 transactions. * Inflation is the second cause which will accelerate to 5.4 per cent from current 5.1 per cent in developing countries in 2021 according to IMF forecasts. - In Turkey, when inflation jumped to 15 per cent in 2021, crypto adoption also surged and the subsequent ban on the use of crypto for buying goods and services led to a further increase in inflation. - Bitcoin, which is a popular inflation hedge, addresses this problem with its limited stock of 21 million coins. * Politics is the third factor, as there are many skilled and tech-savvy politicians who are keen to position themselves as progressive and populist leaders. - Hoeptner said that Bitcoin is an embodiment of technology, value, payment means, a culture and most of all the manifestation of people’s lack of faith in the global financial system. - Politics can help in adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender but the failures of these political adoptions can also harm the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. Hoeptner concluded that the countries living in persistent unequal financial systems are turning towards Bitcoin in their own self-interest.

Now, admissions have touched 202 and the school has students from LKG to grade eight. The school is all set to celebrate its centenary year in January 2022. It has received smart classes and other facilities, which are on par with private schools. Civil engineer Santhosh Kumar, an alumnus, has adopted the school and has worked towards this development. Headmaster Narayana Poojary SK said, “Due to the mushrooming of private English medium schools, the demand for government schools was shrinking. We went from house to house convincing parents to enrol their wards at our school. But that did not work. Hence, we came up with the idea of starting LKG/UKG classes.” Since then, there has been no looking back for the school. A lot of developments took place in the last six years. The school started a Kannada-English medium class with help from Santosh and others. Narayana said teachers were appointed on contract basis and gradually admissions increased. This year, the government has officially given permission to start bilingual medium classes and admissions have reached 202. Santosh said the school also gave prominence to agriculture and other activities. “I want to help the school by inviting experts from various fields every month. The next project is building washrooms,” he said. The school recently received a vermicompost unit. It boasts of solar and smartclass facilities and has an areca garden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/100-yr-old-govt-school-is-alive-again/articleshow/86978358.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Business||Singapore emerges as the new crypto hub in South East Asia||NEW DELHI: Multiple factors, both financial and geo-political, have caused Singapore to emerge as a major cryptocurrency hub in South East Asia. China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies has opened up avenues of a thriving crypto market in other locations. CryptocurrencyLiveWhether it is the US moving to take over crypto leadership with cleaner mining resources or Singapore that has welcomed unprotected crypto enthusiasts, exchanges and investors from China into its crypto-friendly haven, the world is witness a shift towards Singapore. What is more, Singapore has also created a crypto-enabling environment in the country. This has seen the fast growing crypto market in the country boom and an influx of cryptopreneurs from China. The closure of certain crypto entities subsequent to the Chinese crackdown down and their migration created new opportunities for Singapore. Here are some examples: * Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Huobi, which is one of the largest in terms of trading volume, has stopped registering new accounts and will close the existing accounts by the end of the year. * Other crypto exchanges BitMart and BiKi, have taken similar measures. * The crypto price comparing websites, CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko are no longer functional in China. * Social media crypto communities such as Weibo have decided to migrate to Twitter, Discord or Telegram. According to the blockchain security company, PeckShield, there has been a 62 percent increase in capital outflows from Chinese crypto exchanges such as Huobi and Binance to foreign exchanges. A capital worth $28.3 billion made its way into the foreign exchanges in the first half of 2021, according to Reuters. Singapore has seen the immigration of many Chinese crypto markets since May, ever since China started tightening its crypto regulations. Some of these are : * TheChina-based Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was affected. * ByBit, Huobi and OKCoin are some other Chinese crypto exchanges, fully operational in Singapore. * Babel Finance, a crypto financial services company opened a new business headquarter in Singapore in September 2021, amidst extreme fear of a crypto ban. * Cobo, a crypto asset management and custodian platform, also moved its office recently to Singapore from Beijing. The crypto-enabling regulated environment of Singapore makes it an attractive and hospitable place for crypto-preneurs. Here’s how: * Singapore, a key financial centre in Asia has embraced fintech and has been progressively marching towards crypto ownership and trading. * The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), enforced a crypto-related legislation in 2020 to regulate the crypto industry under its Payment Services Act. - The regulation primarily saves the users and safeguards the government against money laundering and terrorist financing dangers. - The act obliges the cryptocurrency exchanges and digital token payment systems to be licensed. * MAS has granted licenses to some of the big investors like DBS Vickers, the brokerage arm of DBS Bank and Australian crypto exchange, Independent Reserve. * MAS also mandates crypto firms to share personal information of anyone who makes a transaction beyond a certain limit also called travel value. * Singapore has clearly set regulatory measures for different crypto activities such as payment tokens, securities, custody, crypto fund management. Lily Z King, the COO of a Singapore-based crypto asset management company said that this would help Chinese crypto lovers to warm up to the Singapore market. She believes that South East Asia is a new potential crypto player and Singapore is enabling the crypto boom in the regionby offering an enabling environment for users. Chia Hock Lai, co-chairman of Blockchain Association, Singapore said that the country offers a suitable environment for crypto research and development, reported Forkast. The clear regulations and stringent penalties against the wrongdoers and bad actors ensure that.

However, the final approval of EUA from the drug regulator and inclusion of the vaccine in the national Covid immunisation programme for the paediatric population will take a few more days as data submitted by the company will be further evaluated, top government sources said on Tuesday. “The subject expert committee (SEC) has only partly recommended EUA for Covaxin. The recommendations are given along with many conditions. The application is still under evaluation and will take a few more days before we arrive at a final conclusion,” a top regulatory official said. Once the Drugs Controller General of India grants the final regulatory approval to Covaxin for restricted emergency use in the 2-18 age group, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) for Covid-19 will also evaluate the data before including it in the national programme. Besides Covaxin, Zydus Cadila's ZyCov-D has been granted EUA for children above 12. Serum Institute of India is carrying out phase II and III trials for Covovax among children seven to 11 years of age. With Covaxin likely to receive EUA soon, availability of vaccines for children is likely to improve holding out hope that vaccination will move beyond the initial plan to cover children with co-morbidities. There are around 44 crore children in the country. While Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D has already been approved for emergency use in children above 12 years of age, a final approval to Covaxin will be significant because it will help increase supplies to cover the paediatric population. The government is yet to start inoculating children with anti-Covid jabs under the national programme. The conditions prescribed by Subject Expert Committee includes continuation of clinical trials by Bharat Biotech. The firm has also been asked to submit updates prescribing information, package insert, summary of product characteristics as well as factsheet. It will also have to submit adverse event data and analysis every 15 days for first two months and monthly thereafter. “The firm should submit risk management plan,” the SEC recommendations said. Bharat Biotech said the data have been thoroughly reviewed by the drug regulator and SEC which have provided positive recommendations. “This represents one of the first approvals worldwide for Covid-19 vaccines for the 2-18 age group… We now await further regulatory approvals from the CDSCO prior to product launch and market availability of Covaxin for Children,” the company said. Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, which completed the phase 2/3 trials of Covaxin for use in children aged between 2 and 18 years, had submitted the data to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) for its verification and subsequent approval for EUA in the beginning of this month. The SEC examined the data and deliberated on the EUA application on Monday. “After detailed deliberation, the committee recommended grant of market authorisation of the vaccine for the age group of 2 to 18 years for restricted use in emergency situations subject to the certain conditions,” the SEC said in its recommendations. The recommendations have been forwarded to the DCGI for final approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/expert-panel-recommends-approving-covaxin-for-kids/articleshow/86978499.cms||Sushmi Dey

The PIL has also sought removal of the national emblem and flag from it. A bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and S G Dige heard the PIL filed by Vikrant Chavan, Thane district Congress president. Modi is made a party respondent as he is chairman of the Fund and settlor of the deed. Chavan’s petition states that PM Modi, on March 27, 2020 executed a deed of trust constituting the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund, which is purported to be a public charitable trust. However, the use of the name PM, his pictorial representation, the national emblem and national flag name violates provisions of The Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and The State Emblem of India Act (Prohibition of Improper Use), 2007 and rules under them. The PIL states that Modi, who is regarded as a repository of the Constitutional trust, is expected to preserve the sanctity of the names, emblems and pictorial representations. However, they were used to appeal for donations on digital and traditional media in the entire country. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh sought time to take instructions.

With enhanced supply, the situation is expected to be normal in a month or so,” a government source said. The statement from the Centre came on a day with coal and power secretaries made a presentation before the prime minister’s office detailing the steps that are being taken, while assuring that there will be no blackout. Simultaneously, the states have been asked to ensure that there is no profiteering on their part and they do not sell electricity on exchanges to earn a premium, while resorting to power cuts. While several states have cautioned on possible outages, government sources said that Coal India has stepped up supply from under 1.6 million tonnes until a few days ago to over 1.9 million tonnes now with 2 million tonnes to be dispatched from its mines on a daily basis from next week. "We are geared up for more supply and transportation has also been tied up with the railways," a source said. Railways will provide 350 rakes, including an additional 50 to transport higher quantities of coal. Times ViewThe extent of the problem can be a matter of debate. What’s important is to fix the issue immediately. A power shortfall should not be allowed to come in the way of a resurgent economy.The power ministry also rubbished claims by Delhi that it was facing a crisis and released data to argue that the Capital’s entire demand had been met over the last two weeks and instructed state-run NTPC and DVC to meet the entire demand from the city. The Centre said that Coal India is ready to meet the additional demand from coastal power plants, which are shunning imported coal as global prices have soared over three times in recent months. Coal imports have dropped by around 12%, resulting in lower generation by units dependent on overseas supplies. Some of this demand has also moved to the domestic market, and states such as Jharkhand, which is yet to clear production from a large mine, are being asked to approve them. Government sources said that states had been advised for months to pick up coal from the mines but several of them did not heed to the suggestion, resulting in Coal India paring production amid mounting stocks. They said that in April stocks had reached 100 million tonnes, a third higher than last year when it was estimated at 75 million tonnes. Besides, the states are being urged to clear dues of nearly Rs 19,000 crore to Coal India, with Maharashtra (Rs 2,600 crore), Tamil Nadu (Rs 1,100 crore), Madhya Pradesh (Rs 1,000 crore) and UP being on the list with large arrears.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/worst-is-over-coal-stocks-rising-centre/articleshow/86978815.cms||---

Speaking exclusively to TOI about large vacancies in various HCs and the time lag between each set of recommendations and appointments, the law minister said that if the vacancies in the HCs are examined it could be seen they are not pending with the government. “Either they are in the process or with the Supreme Court collegium,” he explained. As on October 1, the 25 HCs in the country had 471 posts of judges vacant. As per laid down procedure, after recommendations are made by an HC collegium, comprising the chief justice and two seniormost judges of the HC concerned, the file goes to the law ministry with a copy to the SC collegium. On every new appointment of an HC judge, the law ministry conducts a mandatory verification through the Intelligence Bureau (IB) to know the person's antecedents and reputation in the Bar and society. This assessment is shared with the SC. Rijiju said the delays are often for circumstantial reasons, but clearance of files has picked up pace and is being done in the right spirit, much faster now. He, however, said that both the SC collegium and the government are on the same page to fill the sanctioned strength in HCs. “We are working with the SC collegium on appointments and clearing files as fast as possible,” he said. The minister appreciated the efforts made by CJI N V Ramana and said that the government has “complete understanding” with the SC collegium to move faster on appointments. There are around 200 recommendations currently in various stages of being processed. The minister’s comments are significant considering that the CJI had recently expressed concern at the delay in processing files recommended by the apex court collegium. Justice Ramana had specifically asked the minister to look into delays and clear all pending recommendations. The IB report on candidates is followed by a due diligence at the law ministry on professional capabilities besides checks on other eligibility criteria, including minimum annual income and age requirement. On completion of the verification, the report with the files are sent to the SC collegium for its approval. On an average, up to 50% of recommendations are sent back to HC collegium for reconsideration after due diligence by both the government and the SC collegium. Rijiju also pointed out that the judiciary must consider giving wider representation to women and the weaker sections of society. While some states have given up to 35% reservation for women in the lower judiciary, there is no such quota in the higher judiciary. A 2016 report of the ministry had found that the representation of women in the judiciary was below 28% in the subordinate courts and less than 12% in the higher judiciary. On huge pendency in courts, the minister said it is time that justice is provided at the doorstep. “The process of giving justice to the poor must be faster and easier,” the minister said while referring to justice on wheel schemes initiated by the high courts of Uttarakhand and some others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delay-in-picking-judges-not-governments-fault-kiren-rijiju/articleshow/86979114.cms||Pradeep Thakur

Data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Tuesday showed retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, slowed to 4.4% in September, lower than the 5.3% in August, providing headroom to the central bank to move on interest rates if the softness persists. The rate was at 7.3% in September 2020. Rural inflation in September was at 4.1%, while urban was at 4.6%. The food price index was at 0.7% during the month, lower than the 3.1% in August. Prices of vegetables fell an annual 22.5% in September, while cereals and products contracted 0.6%. Oils and fats maintained their pressure, rising 34.2%, while fuel and light rose 13.6% during the month. “However, oils and pulses still are major pressure points. Also, vegetable prices have started moving up quite sharply of late, which are not getting covered here due to the base effect,” Care Ratings said in a note. “Particularly worrisome is the fact that fuel and light is up by 13.6% and with both petrol and diesel prices increasing across the country, pressure on inflation will remain,” said the ratings agency. Experts expect RBI to continue with easy policy stance and wait for some time before moving on rates, most probably early next year. Separate data showed industrial production growth for August was at a robust 11.9%, marginally higher than the 11.5% recorded in July. Economists said a comparison with the 2019 IIP data showed that industrial activity touched the pre-pandemic level. “Encouragingly, the IIP rose by 3.9% in August 2021 relative to the pre-Covid level of August 2019, led by all the categories except consumer durables, highlighting the enduring impact of the pandemic on big-ticket demand,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency Icra. “With the excess rainfall affecting mining, electricity and construction activities, and the non-availability of semiconductors impinging upon auto output, we expect IIP growth to dip sharply to 3-5% in September 2021. Subsequently, the healthy GST e-way bill generation for early October 2021 suggests inventory buildup ahead of the festive season, which augurs well for the IIP print for the current month, even as continued constraints in the auto sector and the looming concerns on availability of coal and power pose risks,” said Nayar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/retail-inflation-at-5-month-low-in-september-iip-up-11-9-in-august/articleshow/86979302.cms||---
---||India||Some trying to dent India’s image in name of human rights: PM Narendra Modi||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a strong attack on the opposition, saying those who engage in "selective interpretation" of human rights with an eye on political gains and losses harm both democracy and human rights. "There is another aspect associated with human rights which I want to speak about today. In recent years, some people have begun interpreting human rights in their own way prioritising their interests. They see human rights violation in one incident but cannot see it in another incident of similar nature. Such mindset harms human rights a lot… Human rights suffer a great deal when they are looked at through a political prism and considered according to political gains and loss. Such selective conduct harms democracy a great deal too," Modi said at the 28th foundation day of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). The Prime Minister did not name any party or organisation but said India should be wary of people who try to dent the country’s image in the name of raising concerns over human rights violations. The nod seemed to be towards the opposition focus on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence while implying absence of similar protests when it came to atrocities in non-BJP states. The suggestion was immediately reinforced by BJP after the event and the party elaborated instances of anti-Dalit crimes in states like Jharkhand and Rajasthan, providing details Modi's speech did not have. The Prime Minister also underscored "pro-poor, pro-women and pro-Divyang" initiatives taken by his government, and targeted the opposition as people who chose to see human rights violations in some incidents but not others. He said improving the quality of life and options for the poor is key to protecting their human rights, enabling them to look beyond daily survival. Home minister Amit Shah lauded India’s strong tradition of delivering justice and upholding human rights. He said the Modi government was the country's most popular elected government since Independence and said Modi has worked relentlessly for the welfare of poor, backwards and deprived sections of society. Shah also lauded NHRC for its efforts to protect the human rights of people in the 28 years of its existence. He said since its inception, NHRC disposed of 20 lakh cases and awarded Rs 205-crore compensation to scores of people whose human rights were violated, which is a commendable figure. The BJP press conference criticised a section of human rights groups, some with global presence, and alleged that they highlighted cases of alleged rights violations selectively and with a bias against the government. Modi also highlighted the government action to approve a 26-week maternity leave to working women, a right, he said, that is still not available to women in many developed countries. Speaking at the function, NHRC chairperson Justice Arun Kumar Mishra (retd) said the 20th century has witnessed close to 12 crore people fall victim to political violence across the globe. "The murders of innocent people cannot be glorified. For such terrorists to be referred to as freedom fighters is wrong. Social service organisations and human rights defenders should join forces to condemn political violence and terrorism as disregarding this engenders fundamentalism," Mishra said. He also said India has emerged as a powerful entity on a global level and it has got recognition as a new power. This, he said, is to the credit of India's people, its constitutional system and leadership. The NHRC chief also complimented the "untiring efforts" of home minister Amit Shah for fostering peace in Jammu & Kashmir and the northeast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/some-trying-to-dent-indias-image-in-name-of-human-rights-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/86979584.cms||---
---||India||At G20, PM Narendra Modi cautions on terror from Afghanistan||NEW DELHI: Addressing the G20 Leaders’ Summit on Afghanistan Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi yet again underlined the need to ensure Afghan territory did not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism, regionally or globally, and also reiterated India’s call for an inclusive government that has women and minorities. The PM also called for the immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan as the country battles food and health crises. Modi participated virtually in the summit that was convened by Italy, which currently holds the G20 presidency. The meeting focused on issues related to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, terrorism and human rights. According to a statement issued by the Indian government, Modi emphasised the need to enhance the joint fight against the “nexus of radicalisation, terrorism and the smuggling of drugs and arms in the region”. In order to preserve the socio-economic gains of the last 20 years and to restrict the spread of radical ideology, the PM called for an inclusive administration in Afghanistan, which includes women and minorities. Modi called on the international community to forge a unified international response without which, he said, it will be difficult to bring about the desired change in Afghanistan’s situation. He added every Indian felt the pain of Afghans facing hunger. Modi also conveyed support for the important role of the UN in Afghanistan and called for renewed support of the G20 for the message contained in UN Security Council Resolution 2593 on Afghanistan. India sees the August 30 resolution as a template for international action in Afghanistan. The resolution, among other things, calls upon the Taliban to not allow Afghanistan territory to be used against others. In his remarks, the Prime Minister welcomed the initiative of the Italian G 20 presidency in convening the meeting to take stock of the current situation in Afghanistan. He emphasised the centuries old people-to-people ties between India and Afghanistan. “The Prime Minister mentioned that over the last two decades, India has contributed to promoting socio-economic development and capacity building of youth and women in Afghanistan. He recalled that over 500 development projects have been implemented by India in Afghanistan,” said the government. “The PM noted that the Afghan people have a great feeling of friendship for India. He conveyed that every Indian feels the pain of Afghan people facing hunger and malnutrition. He said the need for the international community to ensure Afghanistan has immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-g20-pm-narendra-modi-cautions-on-terror-from-afghanistan/articleshow/86979682.cms||---
---||India||Gujarat courts grant divorce to man, conjugal rights to wife||AHMEDABAD: A family court in the city granted divorce decree to a man, while another court on the same campus allowed his wife’s request for restitution of conjugal rights, three years ago, which have both come up for hearing in the Gujarat high court on appeal. On Monday, a bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati questioned the reason for the contradictory orders by the family courts. In reply, it was submitted that the husband’s suit for a divorce decree was going on in Court No. 2, where the wife could not remain present, as she had received court summons from an adjacent court. At the same time, the wife’s application filed under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights was undrway in Court No. 3, where the husband was absent. Both the parties were litigating for a few years and each court passed ex parte orders in favour of the respective litigants in 2018. The husband approached the high court and challenged the family court’s order directing him to perform his matrimonial duty. While the husband’s appeal was pending, the wife also moved the HC recently and challenged the divorce decree stating that it was passed without hearing her. The husband’s lawyer argued that the wife had known about the divorce proceedings, but she chose not to appear in the proceedings and went on to demand restitution of conjugal rights in another court. The wife’s lawyer claimed that the woman had no inkling about the divorce suit and the summons was served in the form of a public notice, which was published in a newspaper. The couple got married in 2008 and have been living separately since 2013. They have an 11-year-old daughter, who lives with her father. The HC admitted the wife’s petition and decided to hear the appeals filed by both the parties together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/guj-courts-grant-divorce-to-man-conjugal-rights-to-wife/articleshow/86979742.cms||Saeed Khan
---||India||Expand IOR cooperation, says US as Malabar starts||NEW DELHI: Even as Phase-II of the quadrilateral Malabar naval exercise kicked off in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday, a top American military officer said India, the US and other like-minded countries should further expand their cooperation in the Indian Ocean as well as the larger Indo-Pacific. With China already fielding the world’s largest Navy and fast-expanding its military capabilities in both the nuclear and conventional warfare domains, visiting US Navy chief of operations Admiral Michael Gilday said, “The key is allies and partners…We are not going to outspend China.” While the US is making “focussed investments” to ensure “its national interests are protected”, Admiral Gilday said the “real asymmetric advantage” that his country has is with its partners and allies in the region as well as globally. “India is a supreme example of such a partner with whom we have common interests…In the tangible way, our navies can come together to protect those interests and fill the gaps that we may each have in capabilities in order to make us stronger against not just one particular nation but anybody who wants to disrupt a free, open, prosperous and rules-based Indo-Pacific,” he added. Admiral Gilday, who met chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh on Tuesday, said the US Navy had already rebalanced with over 60% of its forces now operating in the Indo-Pacific. India is “one of the closest strategic partners” of the US in ensuring a “peaceful and secure” Indo-Pacific. “We will no doubt increase the interoperability of our navies for decades to come. I am confident we can build a partnership that is fit for today’s and tomorrow’s challenges…a pushback on authoritarianism,” he said. The ongoing Malabar Phase-II exercise, after the first one was conducted off Guam in end-August, has nine warships and a submarine -- including the over 1,00,000-ton Nimitz-class super aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson with its 90 fighters and aircraft -- taking part in the extensive combat manoeuvres in the Bay of Bengal. Admiral Gilday said the Malabar exercise among India, the US, Japan and Australia could be expanded to include other countries “if the partners in the Quad” decide to do so in the future. On the bilateral front, India and the US are already using “each other’s airfields, ports and refuelling capabilities” under the military pacts inked to bolster interoperability, he added. The two inked the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) in 2002, the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016, the Communications, Compatibility and Security Arrangement (COMCASA) in 2018 and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geospatial Cooperation (BECA) in 2020. “I see these agreements being exercised more and more regularly,” said Admiral Gilday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/expand-ior-cooperation-says-us-as-malabar-starts/articleshow/86979741.cms||Rajat Pandit

Paatil made the statement in a party cadre meeting. “Hundred new faces will replace the old ones in the upcoming state assembly election in 2022,” he said. “The sitting MLAs present here need not take this message personally.” He added: “Nobody should approach me for tickets as this decision has been taken by the higher-ups.” The BJP high command changed the entire cabinet in the state recently, replacing every minister. Vijay Rupani’s chief ministerial chair was given to Bhupendra Patel. Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel was dropped. In the 182-member Gujarat assembly, BJP has 112 seats; the opposition Congress, 65; the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP), 2; and the NCP, 1. The lone independent legislator is Jignesh Mevani, who will contest the next election on a Congress ticket. One seat is vacant.  Paatil said: “I am saying this to every elected representative. Give priority to party workers.” He added: “If there are complaints from party workers, they will be accounted for.” Paatil said that BJP has been winning because of its workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-to-field-100-new-faces-in-22-guj-polls-many-mlas-may-be-hit/articleshow/86979747.cms||---

Defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, “Wreaths were laid by senior Army officers and civil dignitaries in a ceremony in Rajouri. The mortal remains of the junior commissioned officer and four soldiers will be sent to their hometowns.” “The mortal remains of soldiers from Punjab will be moved from Jammu by road on Wednesday while those of the two martyrs from Uttar Pradesh and Kerala will be moved by air and will reach Lucknow and Trivandrum airports the same day,” he added. In Kerala’s Kollam district hundreds braved torrential rains and arrived at ‘Visakham’, the house of martyred soldier H Vaisakh, 24, who had joined the Army five years ago. Among those who lost their lives, Naib Subedar Jaswinder Singh, 39, belonged to a farming family in Punjab with strong links to the Army. His father Harbhajan Singh retired as Captain and his elder brother Rajinder Singh is an ex-serviceman too. Thirty-year-old Mandeep Singh’s brother Jagroop Singh too was a havildar in the Army. They are from Gurdaspur in Punjab.

Farmer leaders said the protests will grow stronger every day until Union minister Ajay Mishra, whose son Ashish has been accused of killing the farmers and the journalist, is sacked. Around 10am, the antim ardas or final rites for the four farmers — Lovepreet Singh, Gurwinder Singh, Nachattar Singh and Daljeet Singh — were held at the Kaudiyala Sahib gurdwara. After the ritual, the scene shifted to the protest gathering, where farmer leaders from Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh joined. Posters honouring the four farmers and the journalist, Raman Kashyap, as “martyrs” lined the massive tent under which the protesters gathered. Many farmers, anticipating resistance, had arrived in Kheri late on Monday. Others, who started on Tuesday morning, were stopped at several places along the way, trickling in by afternoon. The district administration had reportedly sent lekhpals to the houses of local farmers to “advise” them to skip the meeting to avoid “law and order” problems, attending farmers said. ADG (Lucknow zone) SN Sabat told TOI that “required forces” had been deployed in the area for security. Earlier in the day, police tried to stop RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary at the Bareilly airport but had to let him go after his supporters staged a blockade. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi arrived at the protest around noon but was not allowed to speak on stage. “It’s a non-political programme,” a farmer leader said. On the stage were families of those who died and farmer leaders. “We are not happy with the way the investigation is going on. Our protest will continue. The next mahapanchayat will be in Lucknow on October 26,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait told the gathering. “The minister and his son must be lodged in separate barracks in Agra, not in Lakhimpur jail, because they are guilty of murder. The minister must resign and be arrested.” Prominent BKU leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni accused the government of pitting people from one community against another. “The government is trying to play the Hindu-Sikh card. But this is a fight for justice by people across faiths. We will all fight together,” he said. A demand for the minister’s resignation was a recurring concern among all speakers. “The state government has met our demands — the FIR, arresting the minister’s son, handing out compensation and jobs. But there’s one that remains, that the minister be sacked. They said it’s in the hands of the Centre,” Bhartiya Sikh Sangathan president Jasbir Singh Virk said. “He has not even been summoned yet … We will intensify our movement until the minister is sacked.” Farmer leaders also asked why the prime minister had not spoken about the violence. “PM (Narendra) Modi has not uttered a word about this incident. He has shown that not everyone is equal to him,” a farmer leader from Uttarakhand told the gathering. Another, from Punjab, added, “The government is speaking to people jailed in Kashmir, with the Taliban, but not to farmers.” After the meeting, the ashes of the four farmers were handed over to farmer leaders from 75 districts of UP and from each state in India. “The ashes will be immersed in the holy rivers of each of these places,” Tikait said. “The glory of these farmers who attained martyrdom should be shared with people across the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/thousands-gather-for-final-rites-of-farmers/articleshow/86979791.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Burj’ pandal laser show ‘blinds’ pilots, stopped||KOLKATA: The city’s most-hyped Durga Puja pandal, a replica of Dubai’s iconic skyscraper Burj Khalifa created at Sreebhumi, Lake Town, has suspended a spectacular laser show that had emerged as a showstopper. The decision to suspend the show came hours following multiple complaints by airline pilots on Monday evening about the laser lights intruding their cockpits while they were approaching Kolkata airport to land. Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) mandates an 18.5 km radius exclusion zone for laser lights around airports to prevent pilots getting blinded by laser beams during the crucial landing phase. The puja pandal is barely 8.5km from the runway and next to the aircraft approach funnel. The organisers of the puja helmed by Bengal fire minister Sujit Bose, though, claimed they had voluntarily shut the laser display on the 145-ft high pandal to control the crowds. "We decided to suspend the laser show as revellers were refusing to move on and were recording it on their cellphones. As a result, crowd control was becoming a challenge," said Dibyendu Goswami, the chief coordinator of the puja committee. Sources in the airport said pilots of at least four flights had complained of laser lights that can momentarily blind the pilots' vision in the cockpit. While three complaints were made by pilots over the VHF radio set to the air traffic control that was duly reported to the Airport Operations Command Centre, another pilot was so angry about the laser that he made a written complaint to the Airports Authority of India. "When they complained of laser beams, the flights were at an altitude of 1,500-1,800 feet and descending fast to touch down in less than 5 minutes. Any intrusion at this juncture is not only irritating, it is hazardous as well," explained an official. Sources said the state administration, including top officials, were informed about the problem that flights were facing as a result of the high-decibel laser show. In the past, pilots have complained of laser shows at Kali Puja or even functions held on the city's northern and eastern fringes. Kolkata airport authorities have even complained to the police about the issue. Airport officials said they would have done so even this time had the organisers not stopped the show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/burj-pandal-laser-show-blinds-pilots-stopped/articleshow/86980097.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Royte said the incentives to mothers to have more children was given in accordance with “more children drive” launched by different church denominations and the central committee of the Young Mizo Association (YMA). Ngurauvi of Tuithiang locality, who bore 15 children (8 daughters and 7 sons) bagged the highest award and was presented with a citation along with Rs 1 lakh in cash, followed by Lianthangi of Chhinga Veng locality, mother of 13, who was given a citation and Rs 30,000 in cash. Two women and one man, who have 12 children each, were awarded the third prize and a cash incentive of Rs 20,000 each while 12 women, with 8 children each, were each given consolation prizes of Rs 5,000 and citations. The function was presided over by Rev. P.B. Mankima of the Presbyterian Church and attended by leaders of YMA, including president of the central committee of the YMA, Vanlalruata. The church denominations, including the Presbyterian Church and the Baptist Church, have been campaigning to create awareness among the people of the importance of having more children for the survival of the Mizos. The YMA also made efforts to educate young couples across the state to bear more children saying increasing the population is the need of the hour for survival of the Mizos. The churches and some of the civil societies were disturbed by the low population growth rate among the Mizos while the growth rate of the Chakma community, residing in the south western parts of the state adjoining Bangladesh, is extremely high. Many Mizo people, including the YMA and student organisations, alleged that the high growth rate among the Chakmas, branded foreigners, was always high due to heavy influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Mizoram’s population density of 52 persons per sq. km was much below the national average of 382, they said, adding, “The infertility rate and the declining growth rate of the Mizo population has been a serious concern for many years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/more-babies-more-cash-drive-in-mizoram/articleshow/86976111.cms||HC Vanlalruata

The villagers were holding a meeting to condole the death of four Kuki militants who were gunned down in the nearby Maphou dam area by security forces in an encounter on Sunday when the miscreants suddenly fired at them, a source said. Another minor boy, who sustained injuries in the attack, has been rushed to hospital. Many villagers of the area, fearing further attack by the miscreants, have rushed to safer places. A massive search operation has been launched by the state and central forces to track down the miscreants. Chief minister N Biren Singh, who also holds the home portfolio, strongly condemned the attack on innocent villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/imphal/village-chief-among-4-gunned-down-in-manipur/articleshow/86976143.cms||---

---||India||Amit Shah ushered in ‘new age’ in Jammu and Kashmir, North East: NHRC chief||NEW DELHI: It is increasingly common for external forces to level false allegations of human rights violations against India and this should be opposed strongly, said National Human Rights Commission chairperson Justice Arun Mishra on Tuesday. He said India has emerged as a powerful entity on a global level and it has got recognition as a new power and this is to the credit of India’s people, its constitutional system and leadership. “Failure by rights defenders and social service organisations to unequivocally condemn political violence and terrorism will engender fundamentalism”, Justice Mishra said, addressing the 28th Foundation Day ceremony of the NHRC here. The NHRC chief also complimented the “untiring efforts” of home minister Amit Shah for “ushering in a new age” and fostering peace in Jammu & Kashmir and the Northeast. “The murders of innocent people cannot be glorified. For such terrorists to be referred to as freedom fighters is wrong. Social service organisations and human rights defenders should join forces to condemn political violence and terrorism. Apathy on this issue engenders fundamentalism and history will never forgive us for this,” Justice Mishra said, adding that the 20th century has witnessed nearly 12 crore victims of political violence across the globe. “India has the spirit of ‘Sarvadharma Sambhav’ (harmony of religions). Everyone has freedom to build a temple or mosque or a church. But in many countries, such liberties are not there...,” he said. The rights panel chief also said NHRC has been working in India for 28 years even when many powerful nations still do not have such an institution. Adding that the press, media and cyberspace have been given freedom in the country, which is within the obligations of constitutional duties and human responsibilities, Justice Mishra said, “But no one has the freedom to destroy the prestige of the Republic’s fundamental pillar, the judiciary, through contemptuous behaviour, and neither should anyone be given this freedom.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amit-shah-ushered-in-new-age-in-jammu-and-kashmir-north-east-nhrc-chief/articleshow/86980151.cms||---
---||India||BSF can now seize, arrest deep inside Assam, West Bengal, Punjab||NEW DELHI: In what might raise political hackles of states, home ministry has extended the area under jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) – where its officers have powers of arrest, search and seizure, on par with their counterparts in the police – to a 50 km-belt in West Bengal, Punjab and Assam, running along the country’s borders, from 15 km earlier. The border stretch under BSF in Gujarat stands reduced to 50 km from 80 km earlier, while the area remains the same in Rajasthan at 50 km. As was the case earlier, no such limit has been prescribed for the five north-eastern states of Meghalaya, Nagaland, Mizoram, Tripura and Manipur or the Union territories of J&K and Ladakh. Section 139 of the Border Security Force Act, 1968, empowers the Centre to notify the area and extent of the border force’s operational mandate, from time to time. As per the latest notification issued by the home ministry on Monday, the Central government has revised the ‘Schedule’ specifying the border stretch where BSF would have powers of search, seizure and arrest under Acts like Passport Act, NDPS Act, Customs Act etc as well as Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to the states of Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, and Meghalaya; UTs of J&K and Ladakh; and 50 km-belt in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. As per earlier notifications published on September 22, 1969; June 11, 2012; and July 3, 2014; the ‘Schedule’ area comprised the states of Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura Meghalaya and J&K and area within 80 km border belt in Gujarat, 50 km in Rajasthan, and 15 km in West Bengal, Assam and Punjab. While the addition of an extra 35-km stretch to the BSF’s mandate could rile the affected states – Punjab, West Bengal and Assam (the latter two ruled by Opposition parties) – and lead them to question the step as an encroachment upon their powers and against the federal structure, BSF sources said it would empower its personnel to carry out operations against narcotics/arms trafficking and illegal infiltration seamlessly in border stretches. “We can act on information regarding entry and movement of traffickers and intruders till 50 km inside the border, rather than be limited by the need to coordinate with the state police beyond 15 km,” said an officer. It was not immediately clear if state governments were taken on board before issuing the latest notification. However, every order made under Section 139 of BSF Act must be subsequently laid before each House of Parliament, which can either modify or annul it. It be recalled that an attempt by the erstwhile UPA government in 2011 to amend the BSF Act to extend the force’s powers of search, seizure and arrest beyond the border stretches and include other areas – such as Left-wing extremism-hit states in where BSF is deployed – had met with fierce resistance from the then opposition-ruled states as well as many opposition parties in Parliament, leading the government to withdraw the Bill from the Rajya Sabha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bsf-can-now-seize-arrest-deep-inside-assam-wb-punjab/articleshow/86979746.cms||Bharti Jain

Usually, the city hosts over 400 Pujas every year. But the impact of Covid-19 pandemic can be seen everywhere, as the shine is missing from the Puja pandals. The sharp rise in prices of clothes, food including sweets, have severely dented the pockets of the common man. Moreover, the spiralling prices of petrol and diesel have only added to the woes. The price of petrol breached the century mark in the city on Sunday. “Despite the price hike, people have come out to celebrate, albeit adhering to the basic Covid-19 protocols. The vaccine has helped allay the fears to some extent. However, we have to maintain Covid protocols to stay safe,” said Prasanna Sarma, a reveller. Meanwhile, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma appealed to the people to maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour and avoid overspeeding while driving or riding two-wheelers. The budget of one of the most attractive Pujas in the city — Maligaon Kalibari Durga Puja — is just around Rs 4 lakh. “The budget before the pandemic was around Rs 15-16 lakh,” said Amitabh Choudhury, the executive member of the committee. He said, “People are already going through a severe economic crisis due to the pandemic. People do not have the capacity to donate now. You cannot demand also. On the other hand, the prevailing Covid-19 situation is also another reason to avoid gatherings. Considering all these things, we have fixed the budget around Rs 4 lakh and organised the Puja.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/guwahati-revellers-welcome-puja-break/articleshow/86974897.cms||Mukut Das

Addressing foreign ministers’ at the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Kazakhstan, he said the world no longer tolerates the use of terrorism by one state against another. “Cross-border terrorism is not statecraft; it is simply another form of terrorism. The international community must unite against this menace … Any calculation that extremism, radicalisation, violence and bigotry can be used to advance interests is a very short-sighted one. Such forces will come back to haunt those who nurture them.” His words were directed as much against Pakistan as against the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, where he rued the lack of stability, pointing out that it would make it difficult to get Covid under control. Jaishankar took a jibe at China too, saying while connectivity was essential in the modern day, it needed to follow certain rules. “As we build these modern arteries of commerce, it is absolutely essential that the most basic principles of international relations are observed. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations rank foremost among them,” Jaishankar said. Later, when he met Kazakh President Qasym-Jomart Toqayev, Jaishankar said: “Ensuring that Afghan territory is not used to support terrorism and promoting the formation of an inclusive government are recognised as priorities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cross-border-terrorism-isnt-statecraft-external-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar/articleshow/86980455.cms||---

Director general of police (DGP) VS Yadav said altogether 7,660 armed personnel have been deployed to man as many as 2,176 community Pujas, including 865 Pujas in urban areas and 554 in Agartala and its surrounding areas this year. There will be a total of 157 police-assistance booths all over the state, including 50 exclusively in Agartala city, Yadav said, adding that as many as 98 watchtowers — 25 in Agartala — were being constructed at all important locations across the state. “The sensitive and important places with high footfall will be kept under CCTV surveillance and altogether 78 additional CCTVs were installed in various locations all over the state. Railway police stations have taken steps for safety and security of the devotees. In addition, eight platoons of CRPF have been deployed in eight major police station areas,” the DGP said. The BSF has been requested to seal the border and intensify area domination patrolling in the bordering villages. Preventive operations in vulnerable areas have been stepped up by the police and TSR separately.

The power utilities have been directed to get ready to implement the load-relief (power cuts) in all segments. Sources said the distribution companies have already readied a tentative plan to go for load relief and are waiting for the final green signal from the state government.  Power cuts are likely to come into force from Saturday, a day after Dasara festival. Though the energy department is making all-out efforts to avoid the power crisis, the situation is not looking so bright for a bailout. This is the first time in the last seven years that Andhra Pradesh is facing a severe power crisis resulting in power cuts particularly in monsoon season. According to initial estimations, the power utilities have been directed to manage the deficit of over 45 million units a day through power cuts. Sources said rural areas will face at least a three-hour power cut between 6 pm and 10 pm in different schedules. Similarly, municipal towns and other urban areas will face load relief between 9 pm and midnight. However, big cities are likely to go without power from 11 pm to 3 am. The power utilities will go for power cuts ranging between three and five hours depending on the availability of power on a particular day. Discoms have started cuts  In fact, the discoms have already started enforcement of power cuts in rural areas without any official announcement. They have been claiming technical glitches as the reason for the power cuts in rural areas. Severe fluctuation between the demand and the supply is leading to power outages in rural areas, said a senior official. Sources said the total available power is just around 140 million units against the actual demand of 190 mu. AP-Genco has pooled up just around 75 million units from its own sources. While 23 million units of power was generated from hydel plants, 38 million units was produced from thermal power plants. Non-conventional sources could offer just 1.8 million units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/power-cuts-to-be-enforced-in-state-a-day-after-dasara/articleshow/86980598.cms||Samdani MN

---||Guwahati||Parents breathe easy after Covid vaccination nod for children||GUWAHATI: Parents breathed a sigh of relief as an expert committee on Tuesday gave emergency approval to Covaxin for children, even as health experts say immunity levels among kids are better than adults to resist the virus. Juri Konwar, a housewife in Dholpur in upper Assam’s Lakhimpur district is still skeptical to send her 10 year-year-old son to the nearby government school simply for the reason that her son is not vaccinated. She stopped her son from going to the playground last year and confined him to the courtyard of the house. The private tutor is also not allowed to stay in the house for long. She was not enthused at the state government’s decision to reopen elementary schools from October 19, despite the fact the online classes remained disrupted on most occasions due to poor internet connectivity in this last fringe of the district — far away from the district headquarters. But as the news of Covid vaccine for the below-18 population appeared on TV screens, she was relieved. Only a couple of weeks ago, she lost her 90-year-old father to Covid. “The life of our children is much more important than their academic career. I would prefer online classes initially, though physical classes of my son will begin from October 19. I may not send my son to school unless he is vaccinated,” said Juri. Amid third wave concerns, many health experts and guardians feared that lack of vaccine shield could severely affect children’s health in case of another surge in Covid cases. But doctors who closely dealt with Covid patients said most of the children are free from co-morbidities and can survive Covid-19 with little precaution. “The natural immunity among the children is good as the majority of them do not have co-morbid conditions. Further, guardians nowadays bring almost all the children for routine immunization programmes. The Covid vaccine for the children will further eradicate the fears of the virus among kids,” said Dr Anupal Sarma, additional superintendent of Mahendra Mohan Choudhury Hospital, Guwahati. Gauhati Medical College Hospital principal Dr Achyut Baishya said the kids have hardly shown any post-Covid complications. “Once the children recover from Covid, they are in good health,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/parents-breathe-easy-after-cov-vax-nod-for-children/articleshow/86974570.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Guwahati||Assam aims to vaccinate 70 lakh children between 2 & 18 years||GUWAHATI: An estimated 70 lakh children aged between 2 and 18 years in Assam will get Covid vaccine, the state immunization office said here on Tuesday. Though the Centre is yet to formally communicate with the state to chalk out plans to vaccinate the kids, state nodal officer of Covid vaccination, Munindra Nath Ngatey, told TOI that his office is planning to vaccinate most of the children on the school campuses itself. Elementary classes, where around 50 lakh kids are enrolled in Assam, are going to reopen on October 19 after these were shut in April owing to the second wave. “Vaccinating the children is going to be comparatively easier. Kids between 2 and 15 years are anyway vaccinated under routine immunization and thus we can reach out to them easily. Moreover, since all school campuses are reopening soon, the rest can be vaccinated in the schools,” said Ngatey. He said out of the total children to be vaccinated, almost 80% are likely to be tracked in schools. Nevertheless, the government health facilities will be among the first to offer the vaccine, health department officials said. Around 12,000 Covid cases in the state are less than five years old, whereas 55,000 are between 6 and 18 years. Altogether 67,000 cases are below 18 years and this accounts for 11% of the total cases. “The SEC nod to administer Covaxin for children between 2-18 years is a huge step in our fight against #COVID19. It’s a matter of great pride that an Indian vaccine has taken this lead & is a testament to the hard work of our scientists & foresight of Adarniya PM Shri @narendramodi ji,” CM Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted. The SEC nod to administer Covaxin for children between 2-18 is a huge step in our fight against #COVID19It's a ma… https://t.co/cq7uIIcvHY— Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) 1634037110000Before rolling out the vaccine for the kids, the health department, however, needs to sensitise the rural population, a significant number of whom have always been skeptical of new vaccines in the state. Especially in the minority belt, the health department had to struggle to convince a large number of villagers initially to overcome vaccine hesitancy. A few years ago, a large number of students in several government-run schools in interior pockets of minority-inhabited lower Assam districts like Kamrup, Nalbari and Barpeta either stopped going to school or were taken away by their guardians following social media rumours about a vaccine that could make them sterile.  At that time Japanese encephalitis vaccination was accelerated in the state, though schools were not linked in any way. During the fourth nationwide sero survey for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 published in July, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) detected sero prevalence in children on a par with adults in Assam. Children between six and 14 years were found to have similar sero prevalence in the range of 39.4% to 52.2%, as in adults.  It was cautioned that besides high-risk individuals like elderly people and persons with co-morbidities, children should take extra precautions to prevent infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-aims-to-vaccinate-70l-children-between-2-18-years/articleshow/86974551.cms||Kangkan Kalita

The hotel, Vivanta by Taj, sought seven days’ time from the Kamrup (Metro) district administration to reply to it. The district administration on Sunday had showcaused the hotel, located at Khanapara in the city, for organising a party while the Covid curfew was in force, thereby violating protocols, and directed it to reply within 24 hours. The state is currently under a seven-hour night curfew from 10pm to 5am the next day. “They (the hotel) could not file a reply to the show-cause notice and have sought seven days’ time. So, we have granted them that time. Actions will be taken if they fail to reply by next Monday,” said Biswajit Pegu, Kamrup (Metro) deputy commissioner. Baruah was allegedly driving her car at a high speed in an “inebriated condition” after allegedly attending a birthday party at hotel Vivanta by Taj at Khanapara and hit the workers near Rukminigaon area. The workers were engaged in the city’s beautification work ahead of the visit of vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu to the state. She was granted bail in less than 12 hours, which triggered massive outrage, and several FIRs were lodged at different police stations in the state. On October 6, police arrested her from the ICU of a private hospital, where she had got admitted after getting bail, on the basis of a report by a panel of six government doctors of Gauhati medical college and hospital. However, she was found fit to appear before the investigation officers. On October 8, the court of chief judicial magistrate, Kamrup (Metro) sent her to judicial custody. Meanwhile, following the direction of director general of police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta, police are investigating the CCTV footage of the party in the hotel on the night of October 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/hotel-where-rajkanya-partied-fails-to-reply-to-showcause-notice/articleshow/86974619.cms||Mukut Das

Baruah had allegedly hit a former BJP MLA’s son, Karan Jyoti Handique, with her speeding car, leaving him critically injured, on October 26, 2017. The city police arrested Baruah in connection with the 2017 case on Tuesday, and produced her before the court of judicial magistrate, Kamrup (Metro). Earlier on October 8, the court had sent Baruah to judicial custody after she was arrested for allegedly knocking down eight roadside workers on the night of October 2. According to Handique, son of former BJP MLA Nabanita Handique, he had sustained multiple injuries, including nerve issues, in the accident at Khanapara area in the city and had to undergo treatment at hospital for several months. Narrating the incident, Handique said, “I had gone for dinner at hotel Palacio at Khanapara that night and was returning home on my motorcycle. I had seen Baruah’s car parked a few hundred metres away from the hotel. After riding for a few metres, she suddenly hit me, following which my left hand and left leg broke. I got a nerve injury too. I had to undergo medical treatment for at least three months.” He had lodged the FIR on March 20, 2018 at the Dispur police station after recovering from his injuries. Gauhati high court lawyer Bhaskar Dev Konwar said, “Police did nothing despite an FIR being lodged against the accused. There was sufficient evidence against her. Now, after almost three years, police have arrested her and the court sent her to jail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/model-arrested-for-hitting-eight-workers-with-her-car-sent-to-jail-in-another-case/articleshow/86974604.cms||Mukut Das

Officials in the Assam State AIDS Control Society (ASACS) told TOI on Monday that 116 jail inmates have tested HIV positive in various jails in Assam since April. Significantly, 73.27% of them, nearly 85 cases, are from the special jail and central jail, Nagaon, followed by seven each in Morigaon and Nalbari districts, six in Cachar and four each in Golaghat and Karbi Anglong jails. In Sivasagar, Jorhat and Darrang jails, one prisoner each has been found HIV positive between April and September. “Most of the 116 prisoners are injected drug users and were apprehended by police during the recent crackdown on drug peddlers,” Ranjan Jyoti Deka, monitoring and evaluation officer at ASACS told TOI, citing the latest reports from the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres. A total of 4,495 prisoners were tested during the period. Health screening has been intensified in the past couple of years, though it was initiated in 2017. Assam became the first state in the country in that year to launch the prison intervention programme. Unprotected sexual behaviour between multiple persons and usage of injected drugs are said to be two most leading causes of HIV infection. Health officials were taken aback at the findings that are mainly because of sharing of needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipments, though according to the estimation report of National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), 2019, the annual new HIV infection rate in Assam has reduced by 22.7%. The detection of HIV among prisoners, however, brought an opportunity to prevent spread of the virus. “Inside jails we believe they cannot spread HIV. We have developed a mechanism to bring them to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to effectively suppress replication,” said Pankaj Choudhury, who leads the North East Technical Support Unit of NACO, putting emphasis on preventing their high-risk behavior after release from jail. He said currently the screening is going on in prisons across 22 districts of Assam and more cases may be detected. “Our mission is to make 95% of the HIV-infected people know their health status. Otherwise, they will keep the spreading the infection,” said Choudhury. In 2020-21, a total of 1,279 HIV-positive cases were detected in Assam. In 2019-20, 1,955 cases, in 2018-19, 1,715 cases and in 2017-18, 1,586 cases were detected. Health department sources said detection of cases came down last year as most of the technicians and counsellors were engaged in battling Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/116-peddlers-arrested-in-recent-assam-crackdown-hiv-positive/articleshow/86974623.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Aspirants have been sharing their bio-data on WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram and other online platforms. This has become a headache for netizens as each person can recommend only up to three names but there is flood of requests for recommendation. Meanwhile, many scholars and celebrities feel that online recommendations may lead to support only popular and tech-savy achievers and the service of others may go unrecognised.Mayur Patil, a private employee, said that he received a message from one of his elder friends on Saturday, requesting to recommend his name. “I was wondering that why such a request was sent to me as I am nowhere concerned with the government and its process.

Justice Murthy directed the HC registry to place the petition before the CJ. — Srikanth Aluri||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-appeal-plea-sent-to-cj/articleshow/86975382.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The new SFB has been incorporated as ‘Unity Small Finance Bank’ — the first new bank licence in six years. The RBI had earlier this year issued an in-principle approval to the consortium on the condition that they acquire the business of Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank and aid its resolution. In the first phase, the lending business of Centrum (small business lending and microfinance) would get subsumed into the bank. It will also acquire some assets from BharatPe. Meanwhile, BharatPe on Tuesday announced that it has appointed former SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar as its chairman. Speaking to TOI, Centrum Group executive chairman Jaspal Bindra said that as the proposed bank would be digital, it would not be requiring physical infrastructure in the form of branches. “We will become operational in a matter of weeks. We will start by offering digital banking products using our technology platform. As a bank, customers will have access to ATM network and other payment systems,” said Bindra. The merger of PMC Bank would take a few months more. Last month, the central bank sought depositor consent for seeking relief of up to Rs 5 lakh under deposit insurance. Depositors have until October 15 to submit their claims. The merger of PMC Bank’s business will happen only after the retail claims are settled by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of India. “The proposed business model is one of collaboration and open architecture, uniting all its stakeholders to deliver a seamless digital experience. Centrum’s successful MSME and micro finance businesses shall be merged into Unity Small Finance Bank,” a statement issued by the partners said. Founded in 1997, Centrum has businesses in investment banking, mid-corporates & SME credit and broking to FIIs, pension funds, mutual funds and domestic institutions. It also provides MSME credit, wealth management services to high-net-worth individuals and family offices. It extends affordable home loans in tier-2 & -3 cities, microfinance and retail broking. BharatPe was co-founded by Ashneer Grover and Shashvat Nakrani in 2018 targeting small merchants for digital payment acceptance and distribution of loans. It has distributed loans totalling to over Rs 2,200 crore to its merchants since launch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/centrum-bharatpe-gets-small-fin-bank-licence/articleshow/86979762.cms||---
---||Business||India Inc must drop archaic tools to engage employees||By Vibhash NaikThere’s an intense war for talent out there, and it’s easier said than done. It’s becoming gruelling for companies to hire and retain the right set of people. They conceive innovative people strategies, but what could be the differentiator while deploying these plans? What would make them click? The answer undoubtedly lies in technology. Let’s see how technology cuts across various touch-points of the employee life cycle… * Talent acquisition: The role of technology that was confined to source candidates from job portals and tracking their journey has now metamorphosed into striving for a one-stop solution for the complete recruitment process. The tech stack now encompasses tools for superior employer branding, recruitment marketing, candidate relationship management & sourcing, screening, testing, and applicant tracking. Like digital marketing, human resources (HR) is leveraging programmatic advertising solutions to automate job ads. Artificial intelligence (AI) can warrant suitable ads to reach the targeted candidate pool and generate warm leads cost-effectively. AI has also disrupted the traditional ways of searching for candidates. Recruiters need not spend long hours hunting for the right ‘fit’. Instead, they can rely upon advanced AI-based solutions to locate just the accurate match. Similarly, conversational AI chatbots on career sites engage candidates and solve inquiries instantly. Bots even eliminate unsuitable candidates based on predefined rules. The entire screening and selection process has moved to virtual, contactless modes because of Covid. So, aligning calendars for interviews and administering tests are now passe. The next-generation on-boarding tools have discounted manual administrative tasks, reduced regular orientation sessions, and allowed HR to acclimatise the new joiner to organisational culture. In recruitment, the need of the hour is creativity, speed, accuracy, quality and efficiency. Technology is the most viable solution that seems to knock on the doors. * Talent development & engagement: HR tech has significantly disrupted the way employees are engaged and updated. The dependence on traditional classroom training has decreased with online, mobile-enabled learning experience platforms that use innovative AI-based tools and provide personalised training inputs to develop talent. These sleek virtual, online training tools eliminate the constraints of time and space and enable anywhere-anytime training. Tech-enabled career-planning tools encourage employees to plan their careers proactively. These platforms follow employees’ career interests and recommend suitable internal jobs at the right time. The devices also prescribe developmental inputs to facilitate their transition to the new job effectively. Organisations also leverage engagement platforms to encourage social/peer-to-peer recognition and revamp the reward & recognition process. There’s more to come, and employee engagement and training & development (T&D) will soon witness an orbit shift because of new-age technology. * Communication: Are you still working on emails? Mind you, most of it must be getting missed, ignored or archived. In a complex world with intense information overload, HR grapples with releasing strong, relevant, timely communication every few minutes. The teams are now looking to various new age tools and internal social media platforms to personalise communication, reduce clutter and communicate efficiently. The pandemic has also expedited online collaboration tools, enabling virtual working, transforming the entire workplace concept. * People analytics & employee experience: Today, employees demand a closer-to-real life experience. Companies cannot afford to offer tools that the new age folks call ‘archaic’. With digitalisation traversing to the next level in e-commerce, fintech and edtech, HR too will have to create a comparable employee experience. Years ago, technology just intended to automate manual tasks and streamline record-keeping. Today, it strengthens decision-making, enables seamless execution of processes during the employee life cycle, provides personalisation of services, and dignifies the overall employee experience. HR-tech is omnipresent — and there’s a lot that’s yet to be… The writer is chief HR officer, HDFC Life Insurance||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-inc-must-drop-archaic-tools-to-engage-employees/articleshow/86979852.cms||---

Rising crude oil prices also kept pressure on the domestic currency. Dealers said that while capital flows continue to remain strong, the dollar was gaining in strength and no large-scale intervention was seen from the central bank. Intraday, the rupee had weakened to a low of 75.66. In the absence of major purchases by the RBI, traders are expected to keep testing new levels. “There may have been intervention from the RBI at higher levels, coupled with lumpy corporate flows which pushed prices lower, but rising oil prices and firming US bond yields kept bids alive. Over the near term, bias remains upward. The range can be between 75.10 and 75.90 on spot,” said Kotak Securities deputy vice-president Anindya Banerjee. Forex consultancy firm IFA Global said in a note to clients that the rupee was relatively overvalued and volatility was close to a multi-year low until a few weeks ago. “The RBI therefore seems to be content seeing the overvaluation get corrected and has not intervened too aggressively by selling dollars. Higher dollar-rupee bodes well from RBI’s balance sheet standpoint as well,” the note said. Selling dollars at a higher rate helps the RBI to beef up its profits. IFA Global has advised importers to cover their exposure up to three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/re-falls-16p-to-75-52-as-rbi-stays-away-from-market/articleshow/86979789.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Vaccination drive hits 2nd jab complacency hurdle||VISAKHAPATNAM: After the initial Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, it is now vaccine complacency that is affecting the ongoing mass inoculation drive in Andhra Pradesh. Thousands of people in each district of Andhra Pradesh, who have completed their first dose and are due for their second shot, are not coming forward to complete their immunisation. As per existing guidelines, the second dose of Covaxin should be given within four to six weeks from the date of first dose administration. For Covishield, the recommended interval between the doses is 12 to 16 weeks. The decrease in daily infection numbers, case positivity rate and fatalities might have partly contributed to the trend of deferring vaccination. Corroborating this hypothesis is the low turnout being observed in areas that are witnessing a very low disease incidence. Medical professionals have warned that a single dose will only offer partial protection against the pandemic. When TOI visited a vaccination centre in Visakhapatnam on Tuesday, the vaccinating staff complained that several people had crossed their due date for the second dose. “With the help of the local secretariat staff, we are sending reminders to or calling those who are due for their second shot,” they informed. The Andhra Pradesh health department, in association with an NGO, has recently deployed 28 Tika Expresses (mobile vaccination vehicles) to reach out to residents of remote rural and tribal parts in every district. While some districts have been allocated three vehicles, each district has got two mobile vaccination centres. State Covid-19 nodal officer and director, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr Rambabu said skipping the second dose is almost equivalent to missing the entire vaccine schedule. “At a time when developed countries are looking forward to booster shots, we should at least complete the two-dose cycle to achieve maximum vaccine efficacy. The decreasing disease incidence should not give any scope for vaccine complacency. The health department is taking all measures to fully immunise the public against the pandemic, right from creating awareness and setting up vaccine centres in the villages to operating the Tika Expresses in the remote parts of the state,” said Dr Rambabu. From a peak daily case positivity rate of 25% in May, the case positivity rate has remained under 3% for at least the last 70 days in Andhra Pradesh. In recent weeks, the case positivity has further dropped below the 2% mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vax-drive-hits-2nd-jab-complacency-hurdle/articleshow/86975193.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Patna||Principals are teaching staff, to retire at 65 years of age: Patna HC||PATNA: The Patna high court has ruled that principals are teaching staff as defined in the Bihar State Universities (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2012 and Patna University (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2012. It also ruled that all those principals who were forced to retire at the age of 62 between 2012 and 2017, be deemed to have continued on the post of principal till they attained the age of 65 years. They shall be entitled to all consequential benefits, including pay and emoluments, as well as continuity in service, the court ruled. A bench of Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah, in the judgment delivered on October 8, has also directed that the recoveries made from certain persons by the authorities concerned be returned forthwith. The petitioner principals had to wait for at least four years for the final judgement as the court, on April 2, 2018, had observed that arguments were concluded and listed matter under the heading ‘For Orders’ on April 9, 2018. A battery of lawyers, including senior counsels Jitendra Singh, PK Shahi, Mahesh Narayan Parbat with Harsh Singh, Abhinav Srivastava, Raushan and Namrata Mishra represented the petitioners in the case. The order, which came in the public domain on Sunday evening, brought major relief to more than 20 principals who were superannuated on attaining the age of 62 years by May 18, 2017, instead of actual retirement age of 65 years, as they were considered the non-teaching staff. The Bihar State Universities Act, 1976 was amended and the 2012 Act was brought into force in which the word principal was absent from the definition of teacher. The Act was deemed to have come into effect from October 5, 1991, the day when UGC Regulations 1991 came into force. “Teacher" means person holding the post of only university professor/professor, reader and lecturer and such sanctioned posts in the teachers grade on the basis of regulations issued by the UGC from time to time,” the definition reads. Amendments were made again and Bihar State University (Amendment) Act, 2017 was enacted and came into force on May 18, 2017 with ‘the word ‘principal’ inserted again for clarity. The same follow-up changes were made in the Patna University (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2012 and then in the Patna University (Amendment) Act, 2017. The petitioners’ counsels had extensively argued that the amendments in 2012 were made in order to synchronise the Acts with UGC guidelines of 1991 and further amendment in 2017 was made for clarity. They also submitted that the state government nowhere had made any cabinet decision or passed any other order declaring principals as non-teaching staff. The education department authorities had communicated to the university authorities that those principals who had attained or exceeded 62 years age on May 18, 2017 would stand relieved, assuming that they were non-teaching staff from 2012 to 2017. Following this, the affected principals moved the high court in 2017 for setting aside of the education department’s order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/principals-are-teaching-staff-to-retire-at-65-years-of-age-patna-hc/articleshow/86974103.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||TaMo to raise $1bn from PE investors for 15% in EV business||MUMBAI: Tata Motors will raise Rs 7,500 crore ($1 billion) from a foreign private equity group by selling up to 15% in its nascent domestic passenger electric vehicle (EV) business. The external money will boost the $103-billion Tata Group flagship’s efforts to accelerate transition from fossil fuel cars to eco-friendly models. American investment firm TPG along with ADQ of Abu Dhabi will get a share of 11-15% in Tata Motors’s India passenger electric mobility unit against compulsorily convertible preference shares, taking the new entity’s post-money valuation to $9 billion. Tata Motors will transfer assets dedicated to the domestic passenger EV business such as talent and design capabilities to a separate company in which the foreign private equity group will hold a significant minority stake. TOI reported about Tata Motors’ $1-billion fund-raise plan to push EV play on October 8. Tata Motors’s India passenger EV business — it entered the space with Nexon in January 2020 — is expected to clock a revenue of Rs 500-600 crore in fiscal 2021. All liabilities and other assets related to the domestic passenger vehicle business like manufacturing facilities and brands will be housed under TML Business Analytics Services — a 100% arm of Tata Motors. The domestic passenger electric mobility unit, in which the private equity group led by TPG will get one board seat, will pay royalty for “the name plates it will use that belong to TML Business Analytics Services”, said Tata Motors CFO P B Balaji. The TPG-led private equity group will invest 50% of the $1-billion commitment by next March after the new electric mobility unit is set up and will invest the remaining amount by December 2022, said Tata Motors, which has a 70% share in India’s passenger EV market. Tata Motors will channelise the foreign money to develop more EVs and catalyse investments in charging infrastructure and battery technologies. The automaker plans to create a portfolio of 10 EVs by fiscal 2026 (it currently sells three models) and, in association with sister companies like Tata Power (for charging infrastructure) and Tata Chemicals (for battery cells), aims to scale up its play in its home market. Its luxury electric cars are housed separately under Jaguar Land Rover. According to Tata Motors, its domestic passenger electric mobility business will require an investment of $2 billion in the next five years and so it decided to tap external investors. Moreover, EV technologies are still evolving and risks could be shared with partners that bet on decarbonised transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tamo-to-raise-1bn-from-pe-investors-for-15-in-ev-biz/articleshow/86979330.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Vijayawada||War, disease outbreak shaped journey of this doctor from Vijayawada||VIJAYAWADA: Whether it is saving lives in conflict zones or handling Covid-19 patients in Sierra Leone, there is little that Dr Shiny Kaki (35) from Vijayawada, has not done when it comes to taking care of her patients. After earning her MBBS degree from CMC, Vellore in 2009, she did her mandatory two years of rural service at a leprosy hospital in Allahabad where she cured several patients. It was in Allahabad that her passion for public service was sparked. Little did she know then that she would be joining Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) aka Doctors Without Borders, and serve in conflict zones. Between 2013 and 2014, Shiny witnessed an outbreak of diseases and treated those wounded in wars in conflict-stricken countries such as Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. Shiny was first taken to Warder, a place situated between Ethiopia and Somalia. Out there, the young Telugu doctor was thrown into a tense environment in which not just Al Shabab militia, but little children, wise beyond their years, handled guns. However, even the militia were aware that she was part of an apolitical organisation and was there to save lives. Looking back at some emotional moments during her stint with MSF, Shiny said, “Losing colleagues and friends in conflict zones continues to, and will forever, weigh heavily on me. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a real thing. The concept of “why her/him and not me” and your own fears or ideas about your own mortality needed to be addressed and processed.” But coexisiting with these ruminations are memories of saving lives. “The best days are the days you go to bed with the knowledge that you saved a life that day or helped someone live better,” she adds. Since then, she has continued to work with MSF across Syria, Sierra Leone and Ethiopia and having garnered considerable experience, taken on more senior roles with more advocacy and negotiation responsibilities and collaborating with local ministries of health. Currently, Shiny is keen to play a bigger role in the public health sector. “I’m currently taking a break from my professional life to pursue a degree in public health at London. And the idea is to branch off to other humanitarian organisations, maybe even the World Health Organisation (WHO), which has always been a dream/goal,” Shiny told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/war-disease-outbreak-shaped-this-docs-journey/articleshow/86975234.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Business||RIL invests in German co, 3rd solar deal within 3 days||MUMBAI: Reliance Industries (RIL) will invest in Germany’s NexWafe for 25 million euros (Rs 217 crore), marking its third deal in clean energy. A couple of days ago, RIL inked deals to buy Norwegian-headquartered solar panel maker REC Solar Holdings and India’s Sterling and Wilson Solar. NexWafe develops and produces monocrystalline silicon wafers grown directly from inexpensive raw materials. By going directly from the gas phase to finished wafers, it obviates the need for costly and energy-intensive intermediate steps such as polysilicon production and ingot pulling on which traditional wafer manufacturing relies. The NexWafe transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The investment will be routed through Reliance New Energy Solar and will accelerate product and technology development for NexWafe, including completion of the commercial development of NexWafe’s solar photovoltaics products on prototype lines in Freiburg, RIL said in a late night regulatory filing. Besides its deal with NexWafe, RIL has also signed an arrangement with Denmark’s Stiesdal to manufacture the latter’s hydrogen electrolyzers in India. The technology for hydrogen electrolyzers has the potential to deliver significant cost reduction compared to currently available technologies thereby paving the way for rapid decarbonization, RIL said. The proposed acquisitions are part of RIL’s plans to become net carbon zero by 2035. In June, it had said that it would invest $10 billion in clean energy over three years. NexWafe incorporated on May 18, 2015 had a turnover of 1.41 lakh euros in fiscal 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-invests-in-german-co-3rd-solar-deal-within-3-days/articleshow/86979264.cms||---

ADG (HQ) JS Gangwar on Tuesday directed the Darbhanga SSP and Munger SP to depute liaison officers to ensure that they get the allocated number of CAPF companies inducted by Wednesday. As per state police headquarters sources, Darbhanga has been allocated three companies of CAPF and Munger five. Munger is one of the 10 Bihar districts affected by Left-wing extremism (LWE). Sources said additional CAPF companies would reach Darbhanga and Munger just before the polling for deployment at booths on the polling day. When contacted, Darbhanga SSP Babu Ram said the three companies would reach there by Wednesday. He said they would be deployed for area-domination, raids, vehicle-checking and other purposes. The SSP said more CAPF would arrive before the polling day. “We have written to senior authorities for deployment of CAPF at and around all booths like in the 2020 assembly election,” he said. The SSP said in case the required number of CAPF is unavailable, the combination of Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP) and district armed police (DAP) would be deployed at the polling booths. Munger SP J Jalaraddi said he had demanded more CAPF companies, keepng in view the LWE issues. “Decision on allocation is taken by senior authorities,” he said. The SP said the number of BSAP or DAP to be deployed in the byelection along with the CAPF, is not decided yet. “That call will also be taken by the state police headquarters soon,” he said. Jalaraddi said addition and deletion of booths were still going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/8-capf-companies-to-reach-k-asthan-tarapur-today/articleshow/86973546.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The youth, Shailav Raj, who was in his mid 20s, was working as an executive assistant on contract at Patna district transport office. SHO of Kadamkuan police station Vimlendu said preliminary investigations revealed that Raj was suffering from depression as his girlfriend had dumped him and went away with another boy. “The family members rushed Raj to a local hospital where he was declared brought dead by the doctors,” the SHO said. He added it was not clear what kind of poison Raj had consumed as no such substance was recovered from his bedroom. Raj used to live with his mother and younger brother. His other relatives live separately in the same locality. Vimlendu said the family members alleged that Raj had a relationship with a girl and she had even lived at his house during last year’s Covid-induced lockdown. He said no suicide note was recovered from the spot. “We have come to know from the family members that Raj used to tell the girl over phone that he would take extreme step if she refused to become his life partner,” the SHO said. He added Raj’s family members have so far not submitted any written complaint in connection with the case. “However, they have alleged that Raj committed suicide due to the girl. It has come to light that while leaving, the girl had put a condition before Raj that she would marry him only if he arranged Rs 20 lakh for her. However, these allegations need to be verified,” he said. Quoting Raj’s family members, the SHO said the girl, who was preparing for medical entrance examination, had shifted to Delhi after leaving Raj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/spurned-by-girlfriend-patna-youth-ends-life/articleshow/86973509.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The project should be completed keeping in mind the projected population,” the CM said while reviewing several sites of this multi-crore project in three districts –Gaya, Nalanda and Nawada. He also visited Sita Kund in Rajgir where a suspension bridge is proposed to be constructed. At Motnaze in Nawada, the CM inspected construction of a water reservoir. Officials informed him that Ganga water would be taken to Rajgir and Nawada from there. Nitish also reviewed the progress of the Ganga water lift project in Gaya along with the construction work of a rubber dam in the Falgu river. He inspected the water treatment plant at Abgila in Manpur. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh informed the CM about progress of the projects. “At Abgila hill, RCC tank of 0.938 million cubic metre (MCM) storage capacity is being made. At this reservoir, water can be stored to fulfil the requirement at Gaya and Bodh Gaya for five days. The reservoir at Tetar has the storage capacity of 18.633 MCM,” the DM said.

This is the first debarment under section 45MAA of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. This section was introduced in August 2019 following an amendment of the Act, which gives the RBI powers to remove directors of an NBFC and supersede the board and also remove or debar auditors for a period of up to three years. Shailesh Haribhakti on Tuesday said he ceased to be a partner of Haribhakti & Co LLP with effect from March 31, 2018. “I am not responsible for any activities or actions, whatsoever, by the same company. Any references to me in connection with Haribhakti & Co or Haribhakti & Co LLP (as these names are used interchangeably) may be inappropriate,” he said in a statement. The RBI said in a press release, “This action has been taken on account of the failure on the part of the audit firm to comply with a specific direction issued by the RBI with respect to its statutory audit of a systemically important non-banking financial company. The central bank has clarified that the two-year ban starts from April 1, 2022, and will not impact ongoing audit assignments in regulated entities for the current financial year that ends on March 31, 2022. Although the RBI did not name Srei in its press release, officials confirmed that the debarment related to the audit of the Kolkata-based financial services group. According to the annual report of Srei Infrastructure, Haribhakti & Co were statutory auditors for the company between financial years 2016 and 2020. The action comes a week after the RBI superseded the boards of Srei Infrastructure Finance and Srei Equipment Finance, and initiated bankruptcy proceedings against them. The central bank has taken a tough stance against the auditing industry following a series of high-profile failures including IL&FS, DHFL and Yes Bank. Earlier this year, the RBI issued new auditing rules requiring banks and financial companies to change auditors every three years as against four years earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-bars-ca-firm-for-2-yrs/articleshow/86979792.cms||---

The funds will be used for scaling, product development and enhancement, creating new engaging content, forging partnerships with leading animation houses, and hiring talent, the company said. Of the total funding, Kalaari Capital is investing $2.1 million, while the rest of the funds will come from well-known angel investors like Harish Bahl, Shashin Shah, Jinesh Patel, Atul Nishar, Ashwin Puri and Giridhar Malpani, it said. Creative Galileo is one of the early learning apps in the country with a monthly active user base of over half a million. Outside of India, the app is also gaining traction in international markets that include Nepal, Bangladesh, the UAE and the US, it said.

He said there would be constant vigil at all the important places, including local markets and puja places, in these districts as it could pose risk of Covid-19 virus spread. “Besides Patna airport, all important railway stations and bus stands in these districts will be under the scanner of the district administration. All the DMs concerned have been told to get inputs from the village sources regarding people coming from other states, especially those coming from places having higher number of Covid-19 cases and ensure their testing,” said Agarwal. Consequently, Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh instructed civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari to constitute teams for Covid testing at ten important puja pandals on Tuesday from 9am to 9pm till October 15.

The solar power plants will be set up on Selaulim, Amthanem, Anjunem and Chapoli dams on a design, built, finance and operate model for a period of 25 years. The last day to submit the EoI is October 25. A senior officer said that the objectives of the EoI includes solar power generation, conservation of water due to less evaporation, creation of employment to the rural community and higher solar generation due to maintained temperature of solar panels. Since the solar power project will be installed on the water surface, the other land surfaces for the same capacity of the project can be utilised for other purposes and land cost is not applicable. The senior officer said that the salient feature of the EoI is that the department of new and renewable energy (DNRE) will assist in providing the required area at all the four sites from the water resources department (WRD) for installation of floating solar power plant projects. The scope of the developer will include the construction of grid connected floating solar power plants on the water surface available at all four dams with operation and maintenance and the possible evacuation of the power and its transmission arrangement up to the nearest substation. The senior officer said that the bidders will be asked to submit their concept note and feasibility report along with technical and financial feasibility of the concept and the bidder’s technical and financial capability. The senior officer said that the main scope of the bidder is to assess the potential of the grid connected floating solar power plant capacity at each location. The scope of the work also includes design, engineering, manufacture, supply, erection, testing and commissioning of the plants with operation and maintenance and the evacuation of the power and its transmission up to the nearest substation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-set-up-floating-solar-plants-on-4-dams/articleshow/86977705.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Teacher in soup over remarks on Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi||VADODARA: A prominent city-based school has run into trouble after its teacher made objectionable remarks about Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru while conducting a class. Videos of the class went viral sparking a controversy. The teacher who teaches class 9 students made the remarks while taking a social studies class. While the date of the video is not known, he is seen wearing a mask hinting that the content cannot be very old. The teacher made a series of comments which clearly were not linked with the syllabus. In the three short videos, the teacher is heard saying that Gandhi was sad with the Chauri Chaura massacre as Britishers had died. The teacher commented that any number of Indians could have died, but Britishers should not have died. The teacher even claimed that while Gandhi promoted Swadeshi, Nehru was fond of Videshi. He even alleged that Nehru used to smoke imported cigarettes and a special plane was sent to fetch them after he became the PM. The teacher even said that children of his family used to have parties inside aircraft. He says that leaders from Congress claimed they were from poor families. “What poor families?” he was heard questioning. The city unit of the Congress has taken up the issue and will be submitting a memorandum to the collector. “We will also file a police complaint and approach the police commissioner,” said city unit president, Prashant Patel. Jagdish Nimavat, who runs the school that is amongst the leading concept schools in the city, said that a notice had been issued to the teacher. “He has been asked to submit an explanation. We do not support such activities,” he said. The school was also going to issue a statement which is awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/teacher-in-soup-over-remarks-on-nehru-gandhiji/articleshow/86974754.cms||---

State health department’s special secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh told this newspaper that the vaccination drive for kids would start soon after receiving any directive in this regard from the authorities concerned and ample doses of vaccines by the state. There are more than 3 crore children in the state and, hence, the pace of vaccination will depend upon the doses of vaccines received, he said. Singh further pointed out that during the first and second waves of the Covid-19, a large number of children were infected, but about 70% of them had developed the anti-bodies. Welcoming the permission for using Covaxin on children, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS Patna, said necessary arrangements are already there at his hospital and the process of vaccination would start immediately after the vaccine doses are made available. He said the vaccine is quite safe and effective for children, as indicated during its trials. Dr Kumar said nearly 200 children were administered Covid-19 vaccine doses during clinical trials at AIIMS-Patna in three separate phases (12-18 years in phase I, 6-12 years in phase II and 2-6 years in phase III) and there was no adverse report from any child. Children above 12 years in the USA are already being vaccinated against Covid-19. “Covaxin is the second Covid-19 vaccine to be approved for emergency use among children in India after Zydus Healthcare’s ZyCoV-D, meant for children above 12 years of age. Now all the children would be protected against Covid following the successful execution of the vaccination meant for them,” he said. Noted paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said nearly 40 crore children in the 2-18 age group in the country would be protected against Covid-19 with the use of Covaxin. He said the ZyCoV-D vaccine is already there for children, but it is not to be supplied free of cost. The terms and conditions for the supply of Covaxin are yet to be announced by the government, but he hoped it would be administered free of cost to the children in government hospitals and health centres. Shah appealed to the guardians to get their children vaccinated as soon as the vaccine doses are made available for them. The vaccine is as safe and effective for children as it is for adults, he said. Rana Avanindra Singh, a resident of Anandpuri locality, said he has been anxiously awaiting the launch of the Covid-19 vaccine for children ever since his 12-year-old daughter started attending her offline classes in the school. “I will get my daughter vaccinated as soon as the process starts in the city,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-ready-to-vaccinate-kids-against-covid-official/articleshow/86972338.cms||B K Mishra
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat courts grant divorce to man, conjugal rights to wife||AHMEDABAD: In what has ended up as one big paradox, one family court granted a divorce decree to the husband, while another court on the same campus has allowed the wife’s request for restitution of conjugal rights thereby directing the husband to dispense his matrimonial duties. This marital dispute which got conflicting orders has now ended up in the Gujarat high court which admitted the case. During proceedings on Monday, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati questioned the reason for the contradictory orders by the family courts. In reply, it was submitted that the husband’s suit for a divorce decree was going on in court No. 2, where the wife could not remain present as she had received the court summons. At the same time, the wife's application filed under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights was underway in court No. 3, where the husband was absent. Though the courtrooms existed side by side and both the parties were litigating for a few years, the courts passed ex-parte orders in litigants’ favour in 2018. It was obviously difficult to execute the conflicting orders at the same time. The husband approached the high court and challenged the family court’s order directing him to perform his matrimonial duty. While the husband’s appeal was pending, the wife also moved the HC recently and challenged the divorce decree stating that it was passed without hearing her. The husband’s advocate argued that the wife had known about the divorce proceedings, but she chose not to appear in the proceedings and went on to demand restitution of conjugal rights in another court. The wife’s advocate, on the other hand, claimed that the woman had no inkling about the divorce suit and the summons was served in the form of a public notice, which was published in a newspaper. The couple got married in 2008 and have been living separately since 2013. They have an 11-year-old girl, who lives with her father. The woman also has a grievance about the custody of the child. The high court admitted the wife’s petition and decided to hear the appeals filed by both the parties together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/husband-gets-divorce-wife-conjugal-rights/articleshow/86976156.cms||Saeed Khan

Rajiv Mehta, lead analyst at YES Securities said, “Following the resumption of businesses post the lifting of second lockdown, there has been an acute increase in the fresh loan disbursement by small finance banks.This is majorly driven by both pent up and fresh demand, besides a steady recovery of loans.” On the improved collection efficiency of small finance banks, Mehta said, “Collection efficiency has improved from July onwards (over 101%) at the bank level. It needs to not just sustain but further improve for PAR 30 correction and to arrest the incremental credit cost.” Another SFB, AU Finance, had formed a 2,000 people special task force for collections besides tying up with collection agencies in metro, tier-1 and 2 cities. Disbursements had increased to Rs 1300 crore in the month of July, as compared to Rs 1,000 crore.

Though the list got approval from the party on October 9, it was made public on Tuesday. The list includes names of Kanhaiya Kumar, Jignesh Mevani, Hardik Patel, former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, former Union minister Tariq Anwar and Bollywood actor-turned-politician Shatrughna Sinha among others.

Prabhakar* (66) complained of mild fever and severe lower back pain a month after recovering from Covid-19. He was initially treated conservatively with muscle relaxants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs without relief. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed severe infection-led bone damage to the spinal-discs spaces called spondylodiscitis. A bone biopsy and culture grew aspergillus species — a type of mold (fungus). Medically termed as aspergillus osteomyelitis, the invasive fungal infection is extremely difficult to diagnose as it mimics spinal tuberculosis (TB). Such fungal infection has been detected in mouth cavities of Covid-recovered patients, and, in rare cases, in lungs. “We diagnosed vertebral osteomyelitis caused by aspergillus fungi species in four patients in three months. Prior to this, aspergillus vertebral osteomyelitis had not been documented in post-Covid patients in India,” Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag told TOI. The common thread in the four was that they had severe Covid and were treated steroids to get over Covid-linked pneumonia and related complications. “Long-term use of corticosteroids may increase the risk of opportunistic infections, depending on the underlying disease being treated and what other drugs are being used,” he said.

Shivani, an Intermediate student better known as Chulbuli in her locality, is the sole earning member of her family. Ever since the death of her father in 2016, she is taking financial care of the family, which includes her mother Rita Devi and two younger siblings. Financial crisis started hitting the family after Chulbuli’s father, Shyam Babu Gupta, was diagnosed with cancer in 2014. In the process of his treatment, the family had to spend all its savings and also incurred debt. Two years later, he died. Instead of crying and sobbing after he father’s death, Chulbuli took up the responsibility of the family. She sells pakaura, litti and other edibles at Municipal Chowk in the town, using the same cart her father once used to sell food items and run the family. The family members said the income was sufficient for their living. “After the demise of my husband, we faced an acute financial crisis. When he was diagnosed with cancer, we spent a lot on his treatment, but could not save him. His death two years later came as a big shock for us. We were helpless with no guardian and earning member. However, my daughter showed strength and took up the responsibility,” said Chulbuli’s mother Rita Devi, adding her daughter is also continuing her studies. While Rita prepares the butter, as she used to do during her husband’s time, Chulbuli leaves with the cart by around 3pm and sells hot fried fritters with chutney at Municipal Chowk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/after-fathers-death-this-chhapra-girl-takes-up-cudgels-to-run-family/articleshow/86973296.cms||H K Verma

The police are presently managing the system through a private company and a division bench is considering petitions to hand over the system to TDB. In a report filed to the high court, Sabarimala special commissioner N Manoj said it is the TDB that has the authority to manage the virtual queue system as per law. The report also noted that it is the devaswom boards that manage the websites of Vaishno Devi temples and such a system should be followed at Sabarimala also. Police are effectively controlling the crowd at Sabarimala but there is no need to allow the force to manage the virtual queue system as police can control the crowd by verifying the coupons issued through the system even if the devaswom board is managing the system, the report said. The court was also informed by the special commissioner that the emblem of the police is given priority on the virtual queue website and that there are advertisements of private firms on the homepage itself. Even though the number of darshans allowed when the temple opened in August and September last year was fixed at 15,000, only less than 30% of this figure came for darshan, the report stated. Further, the special commissioner said the website is getting lakhs of visitors per day as it is the only online booking service. If online facility for booking of pooja and making donations are made available at the website, the number of visitors can be increased and revenue will increase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tdb-should-manage-not-police-hc-told/articleshow/86976112.cms||---

According to the intelligence inputs, the camp that was held in connection with the formation day of CPI (Maoist) in September 2016 in a forest near Nilambur Mundakadavu Colony in Kerala had reportedly featured arms training, flag hoisting and study classes. According to a Q-branch official in Tamil Nadu, the Kerala police had identified 19 participants from a photograph that was taken during the camp. The Kerala police had booked them in 2017 for indulging in anti-national activities under sections 121 and 122 of the Indian Penal Code, sections 18 A, 20 and 38 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and Section 3 of the Arms Act. The official said the Kerala Thunderbolt police had killed more than five Maoists in separate encounters at Manjakandi in Palakkad and Wayanad. In August this year, the Union home ministry had ordered the NIA, Kochi, to take over the case from the Kerala special task force. The NIA re-registered a first information report on August 20 and R S Sreekanth, inspector, NIA branch office, Kochi, was appointed the chief investigation officer. On Tuesday, G Dharmarajan, superintendent of police, NIA, Kochi, had dispatched teams to Coimbatore, Chennai, Salem, Theni, Sivaganga, Kanyakumari and Pudukkottai districts to conduct searches at the residences of Maoists and their sympathizers. In Coimbatore, a team led by deputy superintendent of police Rajesh, combed the house of Dr Dinesh, 30, a dentist from Puliyakulam. The city police, meanwhile, extended their support to the NIA officials. While Dinesh wasn’t among the 19 accused in the training camp case, the Kerala anti-terrorist squad (ATS) had arrested him in February this year. “We have collected some incriminating documents, a SIM card, a pen drive, bank passbook and pamphlets of some associations from the house of Dinesh,” a senior NIA official said. The NIA also searched the houses of Maoist S Danish alias Krishna, 32, of Kamarajar Street at Ramanathapuram and A Santhosh Kumar, 28, of Angalakurichi near Pollachi. The raid at the house of Danish, who is lodged in a jail in Thiruvanathapuram, lasted for more than five hours. The official said Santhosh Kumar was involved in the weapon training camp. “He had left his house in 2014 and joined CPI (Maoist). “The Tamil Nadu Q-branch police and Kerala ATS teams had tried to arrest him, but in vain. He hadn’t contacted his parents since 2014. We did not seize anything from his house.” Another NIA team, meanwhile, combed the residence of 50-year-old U Murugesan, brother of the slain Maoist U Karthik alias Kannan, on Rice Mill Road at Kallur in Pudukkottai district. Karthik was killed in a police encounter at Attapadi in Kerala on October 28, 2019. The team has seized two books on Maoism, photocopies of Karthik’s death certificate and the voters’ identity card of Murugesan, a farm labourer, from the house. In Salem district, the NIA searched the houses of relatives of Maoist leader Manivasagam, who was killed in an encounter in a reserve forest in Kerala in 2019, at Ramamoorthi Nagar. The team also interrogated them. In Sivagangai district, the NIA conducted a raid at the house of Singaram, brother of Maoist A Kalidoss, at Annamalai Nagar. Kalidoss is lodged in a jail in Kerala. “We have seized mobile phones, SIM cards, pen drives, manifestos, pamphlets and other incriminating materials from the house,” an official said. The NIA also carried out searches at five locations in Karnataka and three places in Kerala on the day.

---||Delhi||BJP and AAP trade barbs over Chhath celebration ban||New Delhi: Amid ongoing confrontation between BJP and Aam Aadmi Party over Chhath Puja ban in public places, AAP minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday said Covid guidelines were mandatory for organising Chhath. As National Disaster Management Act is in force, the state government can only give exemptions for organising Chhath on the central government’s guidelines, he said. Meanwhile, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari, who was hurt during a protest organised on Tuesday to demand revocation of the ban, said he would continue to raise the demand and mobilise people. Rai said BJP was doing politics over the sacred Chhath Puja. “BJP doesn’t care at all about the people of Poorvanchal. Manoj Tiwari (who is a Poorvanchali) was sidelined despite good results and treated like a second-grade politician. BJP knows it is going to be kicked out of municipal corporations and thus, it is trying to gain political mileage on the pretext of Chhath Puja,” he claimed. The AAP government has written a letter to the central government seeking clarification over the guidelines regarding Chhath Puja. “If the BJP is so concerned about Chhath Puja, then why has it not issued guidelines till now?” Rai asked. Tiwari said the AAP government should have sought clarification from the Centre before banning the celebrations. In a letter to CM Arvind Kejriwal, Tiwari stated: “There is no doubt that a positive decision about organising Chhath Puja is going to be taken soon…but you have hurt the sentiments of the Hindus by banning Chhath.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-and-aap-trade-barbs-over-chhath-celebration-ban/articleshow/87005478.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Aurangabad||Pankaja Munde: Protect OBC ordinance or face outcry||AURANGABAD: BJP national secretary Pankaja Munde on Tuesday said the state government should ensure that the ordinance issued by it to keep the political reservation for the OBCs intact must be protected in the future — failing which, the government would have to face huge public outcry. “Even if the state government has come out with an ordinance with considerable delay, what is the fate of such a move? It is a hanging sword over the OBC community for future elections. In the absence of political reservation, an OBC candidate may win a poll from the open category, but what is the guarantee that the community at large will get the desired opportunity,” she said. Addressing a region-level meet of OBC community, Pankaja said members of the OBC community would take to streets if their political rights were snatched. “When the BJP was in the power in Maharashtra, quotas and rights for all deserving communities were granted. However, these quotas are getting snatched away during the current government’s tenure,” she said. Pankaja also said that she senses a new conspiracy these days when demands for reservations are mixed. “As and when the demand for political reservation for the OBCs is raised, some voices raise the demand for Maratha reservation. The public knows who are behind such misleading tactics aimed at creating conflicts between two communities. Maratha community is not fighting for political reservation, but demanding quota in jobs and education. Both communities fall in the broad category of Bahujan and should get their rights,” she said. In her speech, the BJP national secretary also made a mention of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis amid speculations of her growing differences with him. “While opponents were criticising him (Fadnavis) over his caste, he only offered Maratha reservation and fulfilled the long-pending demand,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/protect-obc-ordinance-or-face-outcry-pankaja/articleshow/86972130.cms||---
---||Delhi||Act now before pollution peaks during winter, says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Making an appeal to people to actively participate in the fight against air pollution, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday shared a three-point formula to combat the crisis. The formula includes switching off engines of vehicles at red traffic signals, using public transport or carpool once a week, being vigilant about causes of pollution in nearby areas and lodging complaints on the Green Delhi app. TimesViewDelhi is one of the most polluted capitals of the world. Switching off vehicles at red lights is an essential but little more than a piecemeal measure. Far more sweeping changes are required to make a real impact.Delhi government will launch the “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign on October 18. A report by Petroleum Conservation Research Association states that turning off cars at red lights can save about Rs 250 crore and reduce pollution by 13-20%. Kejriwal said the neighbouring states were not helping out and the two crore people of Delhi would have to fight against pollution as much as possible. He added that Nasa images showed stubble burning was on the rise in the neighbouring states. "For the last one month, I have been tweeting data about Delhi’s air pollution levels consistently to make people aware of the actual problem. Delhi’s pollution levels stay within the safe limits throughout the year despite the presence of vehicular, industrial and other sources of pollution,” said Kejriwal. The CM added, “However, pollution rises gradually at this time of the year. This is because the governments of the neighbouring states are not trying to help farmers manage crop stubble, which forces them to burn it. Because of this, Delhi will have to again bear incessant winter pollution.” Stressing that after coming to power, AAP government had managed to significantly reduce pollution, Kejriwal said, “Because of active participation of Delhiites in our campaigns, we’ve been able to reduce both PM2.5 and PM10 levels by 25%. However, the fight doesn’t end here. Now, air pollution is coming from neighboring states. We need to bolster Delhi’s own fight against pollution. We need to take this issue seriously to protect our health and of our loved ones.” He further stated that it was not known when the Centre and states would aid in the pollution fight, so Delhiites needed to do all they could. Last year, the AAP government got 23,000 complaints on the Green Delhi app. Urging people to lodge pollution complaints, Kejriwal said Delhi government teams would immediately act on them. The winter action plan entails 10 steps to control pollution levels, including use of the bio-decomposer solution on farmlands to check stubble burning, strengthening anti-dust measures, stopping burning of garbage, ban on firecrackers, monitoring of pollution hotspots and strengthening green war room. The government has identified 64 congestion points and is taking steps to control traffic and the resultant pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/act-now-before-pollution-peaks-during-winter-cm/articleshow/86976050.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Chandigarh||PGI testing viability of Vitamin D supplement as Covid booster dose||CHANDIGARH: In a country which cannot afford a booster dose against Covid, vitamin D supplementation is being tested in PGI to see if its intake, along with immunisation, can work as a booster dose. Clinical trials have started. The study sample will comprise 300 subjects who are completely immunised with Covishield. Half of these will be placebo--without vitamin D and the other half will be given the supplement. “Walk-in patients in the hospital will be participants in the study. We anticipate that the Vitamin D will have a longlasting effect following immunisation. Patients will be followed up after six months in the one-year trial. The T cell culture will be evaluated as the cell mediated response is significant as compared to antibody test,” said Dr Pinaki Dutta, principal investigator of the study at PGI. Those who are not in the placebo group shall be given Calcifediol 50mcg oral capsules, Vitamin D supplement, after complete immunisation daily for one month. This will be followed by 25mcg oral capsules daily for six months. The other group shall be given placebo capsules after the second dose of the vaccine. This is the first such placebo randomised control trial to test efficacy of vitamin D after Covishield vaccination. “The study will also examine the efficacy of the vitamin on the asymptomatic who took the vaccine. Also, there are some whose vitamin D levels are low and we do not know if the vaccine works on them or not. The same can be found after this study,” said Dr Pinaki. The immunomodulatory role of vitamin D is one of its well-known effects. There is also evidence that vitamin D suppresses inflammatory cytokines. Besides, Vitamin D supplementation has been associated with improved antibody titres in influenza, tetanus and stronger skin reactions against BCG vaccine. “Studies conducted in the past have found that after vitamin D intake, there has been mortality benefit and reduction in hospitalisation in those who had Covid. However, for vaccine beneficiaries, this will be the first study to ascertain if it can boost immunity after vaccination or not,” said Dr Liza Das, research scientist, department of endocrinology, PGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-testing-viability-of-vit-d-as-covid-booster-dose/articleshow/86976072.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Chief executive officer of Vanasiri Rural Development Society (VRDS), Ranebennur SD Baligar told TOI, “Farmers from Hanumapur Tanda, Chatra, Chatra Tanda threw themselves enthusiastically into the ‘Jala-Nela’ project that was launched three years ago. Financial support from the Concern India Foundation (CIF) and Shankar Build Pro helped us train 625 farmers, who owned 2,200 acres between them. They all dug pits of dimensions 18ftx3ftx3ft on the borders of their fields. These pits can hold up to 3,500 litres.” Shankrappa Lamani, a farmer from Chatra Tanda, said that they had reinforced the pits with ‘hemmata’ grass. “We use the grass for our cattle, and we cultivate plants to retain the nitrogen content in the soil. We planted silver oak, teakwood, guava, mango, coconut saplings on the border of the fields. We even constructed retaining walls to conserve the fertility of the soil. We succeeded in ensuring that our land absorbed the excess water,” he said. Jairabi Nadaf and Sharamma Hadapad are among the women farmers who were involved in the initiative. “The project, besides recharging groundwater reserves, helped 32 families in our villages supplement their income by around Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 each month. The availability of water kept us afloat even during the Covid-induced crisis. We are cultivating many vegetables on our farms, and consuming nutritious food as a result,” they said. Regional head for CIF, Bengaluru Thangam George said that said that the project had helped stem the tide of migration from the villages into cities. “It has improved the quality of the villagers’ life, and increased their income,” George said. Joint director of agriculture B Manjunath said that VRDS had selected villages lagging behind both economically and in terms of social development to implement the initiative. “Community participation has really yielded fruit,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/in-haveri-modern-day-bhagirathas-help-recharge-groundwater-reserves/articleshow/86973867.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Delhi||Officials meet to ready road map for GRAP in NCR||NEW DELHI: A meeting of Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and adjoining areas, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), state pollution control boards and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee took place on Tuesday to prepare a roadmap for implementing Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in NCR. CPCB announces certain measures under the “very poor to severe” category of GRAP to control further deterioration of the air quality. Though GRAP is usually implemented from October 15, an official said its enforcement this year would depend on Air Quality Index (AQI), which might remain in the “moderate” category this week. “The overall AQI of Delhi is better as compared to AQI of the past three years around the same time. No final decision has been taken on the measures to be implemented under GRAP and the final approval is awaited,” said the official. The commission asked people to keep 4Cs in mind before driving as pollution would rise in the winter months. “Check the validity of your PUC certificate, cease the use of diesel vehicles (over 10 years) and petrol vehicles (over 15 years), choose e-vehicles (if you have an option) and care for air, care for nature, care for people,” it tweeted. Last year, the use of diesel generator sets was banned in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Faridabad and Gurugram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/officials-meet-to-ready-road-map-for-grap/articleshow/86976073.cms||---

Many such vaccines will be available by the year-end for children. “These vaccines will come after DCGI approval. However, there is no need to wait for vaccination to open schools. Already, around 70% children in the city have developed antibodies against Covid and vaccination will enhance their immunity against the virus,” said Prof Sanjay Verma, paediatric vaccinologist in PGI. He added, “There are many other vaccines for children in the pipeline. One of them would be with a jet and not using a needle. For this, healthcare workers shall be trained as it is the first such vaccine to come up in the country.” In his comic series, Dr Ravindra Khaiwal of the department of community medicine and school for public health highlighted the role of vaccines in children a long time back. “Children have better immunity and a high number of T cells. The vaccine will enhance their natural immunity. The first wave affected 4% of children, which increased to around 10% during the second wave. ICMR’s serosurvey found that 50% of children between the age group six years and 17 years had developed antibodies against Covid,” mentioned the comic, “Kids Vaayu and Corona.” Public health experts said that while administering the vaccine to children, first consent shall be taken from their parents and then from the children themselves. “It is essential to vaccinate the paediatric group because it is challenging to isolate them. This group is at higher risk as they come in contact with parents and other family members, who become risk factors to them,” said Dr Khaiwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dgci-nod-for-vaccination-for-kids-likely-soon/articleshow/86976109.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has defended its action by maintaining that only exotic old tress were cut and the loss has been replenished by planting new native trees. Honorary wildlife warden for Aurangabad Kishor Pathak on Tuesday alleged that work of setting up the memorial was getting carried out at the cost of local ecology. “Even if chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had assured that green-cover at the memorial site would be kept intact, the civic authorities are cutting trees in an indiscriminate manner. We are not against the memorial, but the same should not damage the local biodiversity,” he said. Spread over seven hectares, the memorial site is known as preferred habitats of many birds besides home to other flora and fauna. When contacted, AMC garden superintendent Vijay Patil said some old trees of Subabul (River Tamarind) and Nilgiri (Eucalyptus) along with Giripushp (Gliricidia) that were in the way of construction were removed. “The trees that were removed are of exotic species and very old. To replenish the loss, we have planted 274 trees on a range of native varieties. In general, more than five trees are planted per one axed tree,” he said. Patil said the upcoming memorial will witness cultivation of around 4,500 native trees in days to come. “With wide variety of native trees, the memorial will serve as true oxygen hub and biodiversity hotspot of Aurangabad,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/latest-round-of-tree-felling-at-memorial-site-draws-flak/articleshow/86972163.cms||---
---||Delhi||PM levels start rising in Delhi, but expect relief over weekend||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality deteriorated slightly on Tuesday as both PM10 and PM2.5 levels started rising from midnight. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of the national capital was 179 in the ‘moderate’ category on Tuesday as against 166 on Monday. However, as the met department has predicted rain on October 17-18, experts say the air quality is expected to improve to the lower end of the ‘moderate’ category or ‘satisfactory’ category by the weekend. Track the pollution level in your cityThe last time Delhi’s AQI was worse than 179 was on July 2 when it touched 245 in the ‘poor’ category, shows data of Central Pollution Control Board. Though overall AQI was in the ‘moderate’ category, air quality at 10 stations — Shadipur, NSIT Dwarka, Jahangirpuri, Narela, Okhla Phase-II, Wazirpur, Bawana, Mundka, Anand Vihar and Chandni Chowk — slipped into ‘poor’ category (over 200) on Tuesday evening. Experts said low wind speed led to a deterioration in the air quality. VK Soni, head, environment and research centre, India Meteorological Department, said, “The wind speed has slowed down in the past two days and calm wind was also recorded during night and early morning hours. It caused accumulation of pollutants. No significant deterioration of air quality is expected on Wednesday.” He added the fire counts in the neighbouring states are low and the wind direction is not favourable for transportation of smoke from farm fires. CPCB’s central control room data showed that 24-hour average PM10 concentration for Delhi-NCR was 186 micrograms per cubic metre on Tuesday at 2 am, but it rose to 200.7 micrograms per cubic metre at 6 pm. Similarly, the 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration increased from 68.6 micrograms per cubic metre at 2 am to 74.6 micrograms per cubic metre at 6pm. The standard for PM10 and PM2.5 is 100 and 60 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. The air quality is predicted to improve from Saturday. “Rain is forecast on Sunday and Monday, which will help in settling down the pollutants. The air quality is expected to improve to the lower-end of the ‘moderate’ category or in the ‘satisfactory’ category on October 17-18.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pm-levels-start-rising-but-expect-relief-over-weekend/articleshow/86976102.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Water release from the dam is expected to raise if the water inflow continues and people along the banks have been asked not to venture near the river. Government officials said that the water level in the dam was 83 feet a week back. As the region started receiving widespread rainfall, the water level rose to 86 feet on October 9. Since October 9, there was heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of the dam in Coimbatore as well as Nilgiris district. As a result, the inflow into the dam saw a steady rise. On Tuesday morning, the inflow stood at 2200 cusecs raising the water level to 97 feet. About 3,000 cusecs of water is being released from the dam. However, officials pointed out that there was still rain in western ghats and the water level would continue to raise further. If the rain continues and inflow increases, the dam would touch its full reservoir level in a day or two, officials said. Eventually, officials have also planned to increase the outflow from the dam. Hence people living along the banks have been asked not to venture into the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pillur-dam-to-touch-full-reservoir-level-of-100ft-as-inflow-rises/articleshow/86978299.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Bawankule said, “It is the (state) government’s job to keep track of our coal consumption and stock. We have to coordinate daily with the Central government so that coal imports can be streamlined. For example, if we need to import then we would approach the Indonesian government. So for that, MVA should have sought permission from the Centre to clear the import capacity.” He then added that even if the Centre gives permission, MVA might not be able to go ahead with the deal. “For importing coal you need to pay up in cash. Does MVA have that money?” said Bawankule. The former Nagpur guardian minister said that still the situation has not gotten out of hand. “It can be resolved 100% if the state government decides to intervene with financial aid,” said Bawankule. On fears of rise in power tariff, Bawankule said it’s an issue which the state government can resolve easily. “Sharp increase in power tariff can come into play only when we purchase imported coal. I don’t think we are in that desparate situation yet. There are enough coal resources available. It’s just that the government needs to better manage lifting of coal and manage end-to-end line production,” said Bawankule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bawankule-says-mismanagement-by-mva-leading-to-energy-crisis/articleshow/86976094.cms||---

---||Delhi||Cops foil Delhi terror plan: How Ashraf Ali was indoctrinated by ISI ‘talent spotter’ in Pakistan||NEW DELHI: In the winter of 2001, a “talent spotter” for the Pakistani spy agency ISI laid his eyes on a teenager named Ashraf Ali, who lived in village Kotli Sidhwan in Narowal district. The Class X passout was deemed “vulnerable” by the spotter, code-named Zafar, because Ali’s parents had died within a few months of each other leaving him and his two brothers to fend for themselves and also look after their three sisters. Ali’s father, Umardeen, a shoe factory worker in Lahore, had barely left anything behind. The family was pleasantly surprised when they started receiving financial aid from an unknown entity. For the next two years, they got money regularly even as Ali and his brothers, Farooq and Saleem, worked to get things back on track. All this while, Ali was being motivated and radicalised to join jihad and was eventually convinced to work for ISI. Towards the end of 2003, Ali was taken to a camp and trained in weaponry and literature under his handler, code-named Nasir. The boy was finally “ready” in the spring of 2004, after which he was flown to Dhaka with the other recruits. According to Delhi Police, Ali was first kept in Mirpur and then smuggled into India via Siliguri in West Bengal. He had no weapons or explosives on him and was given instructions to lie low. For a few weeks, he remained in Kolkata, after which he left for Ajmer. He was briefed about various Indian cities, routes and espionage techniques to facilitate his stay, he revealed during the interrogation. “At Ajmer, Ali befriended a maulvi at a local mosque and stayed there for two years. In 2006, he accompanied the maulvi to Delhi and started tilawat (prayer job) in factories in the Walled City. He met other relatives of the maulvi and won their trust. He then started receiving money from his ISI handler Nasir by Western Union Money Transfer through the IDs of the maulvi’s relatives,” said DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha. In north Delhi, he got identity cards made with the help of the owner of his rented room. “He lived there for six months. My father got his Aadhaar Card made for documentation. After he left, we lost touch with him. If needed, we will cooperate with the police,” said Uzaib, Ali’s former landlord’s son. The neighbours could not recall noticing any unusual activities. “He lived in lane number 4 of Aram Park 15 years ago. He said he worked at a shop in Laxmi Nagar. He had rented the room for about seven months. He went to work in the morning and returned late,” said a local resident. In 2007, Ali shifted to Ghaziabad where he got married to a woman named Badurnissa who lived in a JJ cluster in Vaishali. However, this marriage was a sham as Ali wanted to get a ration card made using the marriage documents. He deserted the woman in 4-5 months and moved to Katihar, Bihar. There, he got a certificate of residence made by a village pradhan. Using these documents, he got a passport. During interrogation by a team led by ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan, Ali revealed that he moved to J&K around 2009 on the instructions of his handler. Intelligence sources said Ali remained in the Valley for the next eight years during which he was used for a range of tasks, including placement of IEDs and gunrunning for terror operatives. A source said they were probing a tip-off which suggested that Ali was involved in incidents where soldiers had been brutalised before being killed. He is being interrogated in this regard. Over the years, Ali was in regular touch with his handler through different communication channels, but talks about assignments were mainly through email drafts. Of late, he had been using Telegram to communicate with weapon suppliers, which was intercepted by police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-depths-of-poverty-to-terror-designs/articleshow/86976138.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai cyber cell’s email hacked, infected file sent to other units||MUMBAI: The email ID of the east region cyber cell of Mumbai police was hacked on Tuesday and phishing mails sent to other police cells, with an infected PDF attachment. This is the second recent hacking attack on a Maharashtra government entity, the first being the October 2020 malware-caused power grid failure. The PDF file attached with the phishing mail has the subject “Terrorists behind JK Attack gunned down in Mumbai”. To make it appear legitimate, the subject line states “Intelligence Inputs”, said sources. Recipients of the email have been advised by the police to not open the file as it could result in a malware infestation and thus information pilferage. Sources who spoke to experts said it is suspected that hackers may have used software to access the email ID and password of the east region cyber cell and decrypt data. During a preliminary investigation, when cyber experts tried to access the complete list of target emails, they were unable to access it. Officials said they were trying to technically trace the hackers. After Chinese hack on grid, Pak hand likely in phishingMumbai: The police email ID hack is the second such attack on a state government entity. On October 12, 2020, a malware infestation caused a massive power grid failure, resulting in an outage in Mumbai and its surrounding areas for hours. At the time of the incident, nobody had even remotely suspected that the grid failure was caused by a malware attack. That Chinese hackers were responsible came to light earlier this year when the state government submitted a report on the matter. On Tuesday’s police email hacking, an official said, “It appears prima facie that the attack was made either from Pakistan, Delhi or from a remote village in Uttar Pradesh.” Superintendent of police (Maharashtra cyber cell) Sanjay Shintre said, “We have initiated an inquiry into the hacking and have requested police officers not to open the PDF file as it may lead to a hacking of their emails. Today, out technical team visited the Shivaji Nagar police station, where the east region cyber cell office is located, and studied mails.” Unauthorised cyber access is punishable under section 43(a), read with section 66, of the Information Technology Act, and is a cognisable offence. “The point is, what reasonable security practices are Mumbai’s cyber police following to avert cybercrime being perpetrated on themselves? I feel all cyber police stations should be quarterly audited for security lapses and the same should be plugged before adversaries take advantage,” said cyber crime lawyer Prashant Mali. On March 1, the state cyber department submitted a report to the Maharashtra government on the October 12, 2020 power grid failure, which hit Mumbai and its surroundings. The report blamed the incident on a malware attack, explaining that 14 trojans and 8GB of unaccounted data was found in the Maharashtra State Electricity Board’s system. The home minister at the time had said, “A well known American company has said that maybe it was the Chinese who could have introduced the malware… Our finding was that some foreign companies were indulging in planting malware.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-chinese-hack-on-grid-pak-hand-likely-in-phishing/articleshow/86978330.cms||Ahmed Ali

According to police officers, this time, parents of all boys found loitering outside girls' schools and colleges or roaming about in the nearby streets will be called and interrogated. Besides, these squads will also keep an eye on market areas, especially in the evening. SSP Abhishek Yadav has directed that at least four such police squads be formed. “Festivals are on and schools and colleges have also re-opened. I have ordered patrolling in different areas to catch young boys standing outside colleges and roaming on the streets where women frequent. These boys will be detained and their parents will be called to explain their act,” said the SSP. Reacting to the initiative, Ravinder Singh, a girl’s father, said, “If boys are found roaming about on the streets that girls take, they should be stopped and questioned and their parents should also be informed by police. However, police must do so without humiliating the boys or their families.” It should be noted that on August 26, a girl was molested by an unknown biker. The incident was captured on a CCTV camera installed outside a shop. Later, a case was registered at the Civil Lines police station and the accused was identified and imprisoned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/parents-of-boys-found-loitering-about-girls-schools-colleges-to-be-called-questioned/articleshow/86976144.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Local police, which was probing the disappearance for the last several months -- and without any headway -- cracked the case within a few days after a nudge from the ADG, Meerut zone. The SSP had formed the team after a senior BSF official called ADG to find the whereabouts of the jawan, Rampal Singh (57). After a probe, it turned out that the two sons of Rampal allegedly killed him and dumped the body in the well. They suspected that he was “keeping an evil eye on his elder daughter-in-law”. An FIR against the two sons and their four friends was registered and they were booked for murder. The younger son and a friend have been arrested. Rampal had come home on March 29, 2021. He had taken off to meet his family members before joining duty in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer. But he never reported to his battalion. According to sources, deceased’s brother Jitendra Singh was the first to approach Augata police station in Bulandshahr to complain about the missing of his brother. He had expressed doubt that his sons may have been involved in his disappearance. “Even the sister and daughter of the jawan had written to police, but nothing had happened. Then his daughter wrote a letter to BSF commandant, who approached ADG Meerut zone to intervene into the matter. This is when the police swung into action,” said an official involved in the investigation. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Bulandshahr, Santosh Singh, however claimed that police were always keenly investigating the matter, but Singh’s sons were under the lens. “His sons had also filed a police complaint about the disappearance of their father on May 29. We were investigating the matter since then,” the SSP said. “After interrogating several people, we started phone tracking. The strange part was that the last location of Rampal on the night of his disappearance was his home, on March 30. Even his son’s phone location was at home while he had told us that he had dropped his father to Hapur. This raised doubts on their statements and when interrogated, they accepted their crime,” said SSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/missing-for-7-months-bsf-jawan-found-murdered-in-a-well-sons-booked/articleshow/86976188.cms||Ishita Mishra

The special bus operates during the Dussehra-Diwali period for devotees to visit the pilgrimage site, and was supposed to start from October 13 onwards. “There is no booking yet for the special bus. We have therefore cancelled the operation,” KTC general manager Sanjay Ghate told TOI. With its pick-up point in Mapusa, the special bus ferries devotees from Goa to Shirdi. The ticket costs Rs 1,050 per passenger and the journey takes approximately 15 hours. In November, 2020, KTC temporarily suspended interstate buses on 11 routes, including the Goa-Shirdi route, owing to the lack of load due to the pandemic. After overcoming the second wave of the pandemic this year, and with cities gradually opening up, KTC was gearing up for resumption of its special bus service for devotees to visit the pilgrimage site. Though the KTC has scrapped the idea owing to lack of demand, they are open to scheduling the special bus if there are enough passengers willing to take the trip. “So far no request has come, but if there is demand, we will operate the bus,” Ghate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-scraps-shirdi-bus-route-due-to-lack-of-response/articleshow/86978562.cms||---

Gehlot said that best management was being done at every level for smooth supply of electricity. To augment the coal supply, officers have been despatched to Singrauli and Bilaspur. Additional chief secretary, energy, and principal secretary, agriculture, have been sent to Delhi for coordination with senior officials. It was informed in the meeting that the state government is ensuring advance payment for the supply of coal to Coal India Limited and its associate companies National Coalfields Ltd (NCL) and South Eastern Coalfileds Ltd (SECL). There is no delay in payment at any stage. National Coalfields Ltd, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Limited (RVUNL) have been paid the entire dues of Rs 393 crore in August 2021 itself. After this, under the fuel supply agreement from September 2021, now the company is being paid in advance for the supply of coal regularly. An advance payment of Rs 228 crore has been made to NCL from September 1 to October 8. Similarly, SECL's outstanding of Rs 50 crore has been adjusted in July 2021 under the process of reconciliation on supply of coal less than the prescribed quantity in Kalisindh Thermal. Also, arrears of Rs 135 crore have been paid in the month of August this year. Since then, advance payment to SECL has also been started from September 2021. An advance payment of about Rs 92 crore has been made to the company from September 6 to October 4. However, on September 27, SECL has informed through a letter that the payment of Rs 277.61 crore is due. While the payment of Rs 459 crore claim on SECL under the Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanism of Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited from the year 2018 is still pending. It was informed in the meeting that due to lesser imports this year, the gap between demand and supply of DAP has increased across the country, affecting Rajasthan along with other states. During the month of April to September this year, the Cenre supplied only 3.07 lakh metric tonnes of DAP against the demand of 4.50 lakh metric tonnes in the state. Also, against the demand of 1.50 lakh metric tonnes in the month of October, 68,000 metric tonnes of DAP has been approved. This has led to a shortage of DAP in the state. The State Government is making continuous efforts to improve the supply of DAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-takes-stock-of-power-situation/articleshow/86978341.cms||---

According to SFS, girls, particularly single girl children and students from rural areas do not have adequate representation. Given the acute under-representation and divide between urban and rural areas, PU authorities should have increased overall seats with special emphasis on candidates from oppressed and exploited sections of society, they said. They also alleged that the vice-chancellor had been appointed by the RSS-BJP and wanted to convert Panjab University into a private university by cutting reserved seats. Union members appealed to the students’ fraternity and civil society members to mobilise people against this dictatorial decision.

The PIL has also sought removal of the national emblem and flag from it. A bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and S G Dige heard the PIL filed by Vikrant Chavan, Thane district Congress president. Modi is made a party respondent as he is chairman of the Fund and settlor of the deed. Chavan’s petition states that PM Modi, on March 27, 2020 executed a deed of trust constituting the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund, which is purported to be a public charitable trust. However, the use of the name Prime Minister, his pictorial representation, the national emblem and national flag name violates provisions of The Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and The State Emblem of India Act (Prohibition of Improper Use), 2007 and rules under them. The PIL states that Modi, who is regarded as a repository of the Constitutional trust, is expected to preserve the sanctity of the names, emblems and pictorial representations. However, they were used to appeal for donations on digital and traditional media in the entire country. Chavan's petition also states the Fund does not discharge any regal, governmental or sovereign functions. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh sought time to take instructions. The judges posted the matter next on October 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-seeks-centres-response-to-pil-on-pm-cares-fund/articleshow/86978382.cms||Rosy Sequeira

While incidents of chain robberies have been continuing in the city for the past two-three months there has been a rise in such incidents for the past three to four weeks. On the first day of Navratra three incidents of chain robberies were reported in the city wherein unidentified suspects decamped with gold chains worth Rs 2.32 lakh in less than two hours. On backdrop of the back-to-back incidents, commissioner of police Deepak Pandey has instructed police inspectors of all the 13 police stations to step up police presence on the streets mainly on the roads leading to the temples. Owing to the restrictions on visiting major temples during the Navratra festival, devotees are going the temples situated in their localities. Thus to deter criminals from indulging in chain robberies, bandobast has been increased in various parts of the city at the police station level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-step-up-bandobast-around-temples/articleshow/86972324.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Chandigarh||Middukhera’s killers identified, but still at large||Barinderjit.Saluja Mohali: On August 7, two assailants shot down Youth Akali Dal leader Vikramjit Singh alias Vicky Middukhera in a broad daylight murder caught on camera. Middukhera fell to 12 bullets. Cut to October 11, when Mohali police have failed to arrest the killers despite the clear and graphic visuals which made identification of the accused a given. Mohali Police and the Crime Branch have conducted raids on hideouts of the accused but in vain. Moreover, police in Delhi, UP and Haryana are also working on the case independently. NIA has conducted investigations on its own to ascertain criminals’ links with those involved in targeted killings but there are no leads so far. According to the Mohali Police, their teams are working day and night to arrest the accused. Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP) Navjot Singh Mahal said, “We are on the trail of the accused and soon they will be arrested.” After nominating gangster Amit Dagar in the existing FIR of the Middukhera murder, Mohali Police obtained his arrest warrants from the court on October 7. Apart from identifying the main shooters, Sajjan Singh alias Bhola and ‘Khabbu Shooter’ (left hand shooter), police have also identified the other two gangsters who accompanied the shooters seen shooting Middukhera in CCTV cameras. They have also established the whereabouts of the Hyundai i-20 car used in the crime. However, the police department is tightlipped on the names of the two gangsters and the place from where the car was recovered. After the arrest of Kaushal Chaudhary, one of the main conspirators of the murder, police have identified the second shooter seen in the CCTV footage. Police said other sharp shooters of the Bhola gang involved in the murder have also been identified. Apart from Rohit ‘Kartoost’ and Vijiya Malhe, four to five more sharpshooters are to be identified. Police said that four shooters came to murder Middukhera, of whom two executed the killings while the other two waited in a car nearby. Of the four, two shooters were of the Bhola-Latth gang and the other two were of Bambiha gang run by Gaurav Padial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/middukheras-killers-identified-but-still-at-large/articleshow/86976218.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Poonia, who was in Jodhpur on Tuesday to pay tribute to mother of Union cabinet minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, said this while talking to media at circuit house. “Had this government been visionary, she would have placed demand for coal in time to avoid the crisis of power generation in all the 6 thermal power plants,” he said, holding the government fully responsible for the power crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/poonia-govt-responsible-for-coal-crisis-in-power-plants/articleshow/86978365.cms||---
---||Madurai||Give incentive marks to docs of CEmONC centres: Plea in HC||Madurai: The Madras high court on Tuesday sought a response from the state government on a plea which sought to award incentive marks to doctors attached to the Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC) centres for admission to postgraduate degree/diploma courses in medical colleges. Incentive marks are provided only to the candidates working in rural or remote areas. Justice T V Thamilselvi was hearing a petition filed by three doctors - S Rajathy Fathima, M Sahul Hameed Badusa and M Manimozhi of Ramanathapuram district. In the petition, they stated that a committee constituted under the chairmanship of former judge of Madras high court justice A Selvam had made recommendations to award incentive marks to doctors working in the areas of difficult nature of works including CEmONC/NICU centres. The petitioners stated that a GO passed in 2019 shows that the government has accepted the report of a committee, however, the same was not implemented properly in respect of award of incentive marks to doctors attached to the CEmONC centres. The CEmONC centres, which have both the manpower and the infrastructure required to care of the mother and the newborn are available only in hospitals in the urban areas. Providing incentive marks only to the candidates working in rural or remote areas is not only unreasonable but also discriminatory. The petitioners stated that meanwhile, a prospectus dated October 6, was issued in the official website inviting applications from eligible candidates for admission to postgraduate degree/diploma courses for 2021-2022 in the government medical colleges and for government seats in self-financing medical colleges. October 22 has been stated as the last date for submission of the online application form. Hence, the petitioners moved the HC Madurai bench challenging the 2019 GO and prospectus, in so far as non-awarding of incentive marks to the in-service doctors attached to the CEmONC centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/give-incentive-marks-to-docs-of-cemonc-centres-plea-in-hc/articleshow/86978405.cms||---

Even after continuous engagement by the senior government functionaries, Coal India has raised supply by only one rake to six far short of 11 rakes as per the agreement. “Coal from our mines (PKCL) improved to about 10 rakes from today from around 7. Whereas coal India has increased only one rake. But we need about 19 rakes,” a RVUNL official. In total, the state is expected to get coal around 16 rakes a day from Wednesday against a requirement of about 19 rakes continuously for at least a month, as per the official. Subodh Agarwal, additional chief secretary, department of energy, who is in Delhi to meet senior central officials for enhancing the supply, said, “The situation has started improving now. And we expect the coal supplies from subsidiaries of Coal India to increase further in coming weeks.” Demand for power has increased to the festival period which will require the state government to restart the plants that have been shut down due to lack of coal. Recently, power units close to 800 MW have been restarted but now all depends of the availability of coal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/supply-from-coal-india-remains-a-concern-in-wake-of-power-cuts/articleshow/86978403.cms||---

According to the prosecution, the accused stopped the vehicle in which Jayarajan, who was then CPM Kannur district secretary, and Rajesh were travelling and attacked them around 10am in an alleged attempt on their life while they were going to visit an area which had witnessed political violence involving CPM and IUML cadres. Muslim Youth League activist Ariyil Abdul Shukoor was murdered in broad daylight at Keezhara hours after the alleged incident. It was claimed that the alleged attack by IUML cadres against CPM leaders had led to the murder of Shukoor. The court acquitted P Haneefa, P Shuhail, K P Anas, K P Muhammed Kunhi, K P Ansar, M K Rauf, K Zakkariya, M K Yahiya, P Abdul Samad, M K Sajeer, A Ashraf and K Noushad. Advocate K P Munas, who represented the defendants, pointed out during the trial that the evidence produced by prosecution were forged and that the accused were not present at the location where the alleged incident had taken place. The prosecution had produced 17 witnesses and many documents, including hospital records. Additional public prosecutor K P Rajendra Babu said that the decision on filing an appeal against the order will be taken after getting the copy of the order. Jayarajan also said that he will respond after getting the copy of the verdict. CBI, which probed the Ariyil Shukoor murder case, had in 2019 charged P Jayarajan and T V Rajesh with conspiracy to commit the murder and the chargesheet is currently before the consideration of the CBI court. IUML district president P Kunhi Mohammed and general secretary Abdul Kareem Cheleri said that following the verdict it has become clear that Shukoor was murdered after raising the false allegation that IUML workers had attacked Jayarajan and Rajesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/attack-on-cpm-leaders-12-iuml-workers-acquitted/articleshow/86976292.cms||---

There is talk of chances of a total blackout in the country's capital Delhi. Speaking to reporters briefly, Gehlot said, "It is the Central Government's responsibility to help out the states. It is well known that there is a shortage of coal, and the states are troubled. Various state governments have informed the Centre regarding the shortage. This crisis might continue, we cannot tell how big this could turn out to be. Coal India should come forward and talk to the states about their problems and requirements," he said. He said Coal India should come forward and inform the state governments on their constraints in the supply of coal and it cannot pass the buck by blaming the rains. According to CM's information, there were problems with the contractors of Coal India. He said the coal crisis has taken a global dimension as many countries including China and Europe are facing shortages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centres-responsibility-to-help-the-states-with-coal-shortage-gehlot/articleshow/86978411.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Tadoba tigers to get more space, park bigger by 79sqkm||Nagpur: Tadoba tigers in need of more space will now get an extended home with the state board for wildlife (SBWL) on Tuesday clearing the expansion of the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) by 79sqkm, equivalent to over 19,500 football fields. After expansion, by relocating Karwa village outside the Kolsa range of Tadoba, TATR’s core area will now become 704sqkm, which will be more than Pench (430sqkm) and Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (650sqkm). With the expansion, Tadoba will be elevated to 25th position from the present 31st. There are 52 tiger reserves in the country. The decision was taken at the 17th SBWL meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The Karwa village, which is in the buffer zone, will be the first such case where a village from the buffer zone will be shifted with people’s voluntary consent. Till date, such relocation has been affected only in core areas of the tiger reserves. Official sources said people have already given their consent. With the shifting of Karwa, the overall area that will be added to TATR will be 92sqkm, including the village area. There are around 240 families in the village facing difficulties as there is no human habitation up to 15km from Karwa. The relocation of Karwa will need around Rs 70-75 crores. It will be a win-win situation for both tigers and humans. There are over 85 tigers in Tadoba core and its adjoining landscape and owing to lack of space, the man-animal conflict is at its peak. Over 56 persons have died in the conflict in the last eight months in which 50 alone have died in Chandrapur (35) and neighbouring Gadchiroli district (15). The other major decisions taken by the SBWL include approval for a 10-year state wildlife action plan (SWAP) from 2021-31. The SWAP focuses on current wildlife management activities with a long-term perspective. The board also approved two reports of the expert committees on human-leopard and human-tiger conflict and conservation translocation of tigers from Chandrapur district. Sources said the most debated agenda topic was whether to give wildlife clearance to MP Birla’s cement plant in Zari-Zamni taluka in Pandharkawda division in Yavatmal. The plant has already been granted forest clearance for 467.45 hectares. “However, as the said forest area falls under the tiger corridor of Tadoba tiger reserve and Kanhargaon and Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuaries, a section of members opposed it. However, the project proponents said they have already invested crores to set up the plant and the corridor issue came up at a later stage. An expert committee will pay a visit to the area before taking a final decision,” said sources. Thackeray also sought a proposal to create additional posts and an action plan to set up rapid strike force (RSF) units in the forest department. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray suggested setting up of a regulator body to implement the SWAP. Sources said Thackeray junior has also taken a serious note of two reports published by TOI on additional areas being granted to FDCM and the lack of wildlife mitigation measures by the Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (MRIDC) to broaden the Itwari-Nagbhid railway line. Thackeray also promised to sort out the issue of upgrading the Mahendri conservation reserve to sanctuary. WHAT HAS BEEN APPROVED * Relocation of Karwa village on the north-eastern side of park to expand Tadoba * Country’s first state wildlife action plan of Maharashtra gets approval * Human-leopard & tiger-human conflict reports accepted * Report will pave way for translocation of tigers from Chandrapur * Approval to Mahendri as sanctuary to be worked out * Wildlife clearance to MP Birla cement plant in Pandharkawda to be revisited * Rapid strike force for forest department approved||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tadoba-tigers-to-get-more-space-park-bigger-by-79sqkm/articleshow/86976256.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Uttarakhand Congress chief Ganesh Godiyal said, “Please wait for 15 days to know the actual ground reality.” State minister Yashpal Arya along with his son Sanjiv, an MLA from Nainital, joined Congress in Delhi on Monday. Godiyal told TOI, “This was just a trailer and the actual film is yet to be released. The movie will be screened well before the assembly election. Many more BJP members are in touch with us.” Godiyal also pointed out that before the entry of any person in the Congress, the party will study the pros and cons before taking a call. Godiyal said that the “game has been started by the BJP and it will be brought to an end by the Congress.” In the last three days, there have been rumours of three legislators regarded close to former CM Harish Rawat clubbing hands with the BJP. Trashing the speculations doing rounds in political corridors, Congress legislator from Kedarnath Manoj Rawat said, “The point arises that why will anyone go to the BJP. It is a sinking ship in Uttarakhand as the party has failed to carry out any development and changing three CMs in four months confirms the fact.” Rawat asserted that be it 2016 or 2021, the BJP was involved in an “unhealthy form of politics in Uttarakhand.” He claimed that rather than promoting its work, “the BJP was more inclined towards trying to convince MLAs and leaders of other political outfits to join the party.” Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh termed Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami as a “night watchman, who has failed to perform his duties.” Singh said, “Dhami has proved the weakest player. BJP has failed to fulfill the promises made to people of Uttarakhand. People are still waiting for Lokayukta. All kinds of wrongdoings, including fake Covid test at Kumbh, have been reported in the BJP tenure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/many-more-bjp-leaders-will-soon-join-congress-says-partys-uttarakhand-chief/articleshow/86974075.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Pune||PUNE: PMC panel approves controversial proposal to hire e-cars||PUNE: Over two months after it was tabled, the controversial proposal to hire electric cars has been approved by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) standing committee on Tuesday. Now, the civic body will hire these e-vehicles for the day-to-day use of its staff and politicos, spending an estimated Rs 23 crore on the project. As many as 38 e-cars are to be taken on rent for eight years. The proposal was first tabled in July this year, and was getting continually postponed since then. Opposition parties have consistently objected to it, as has the PMC workers’ union. The move stands to lead to job losses for drivers, leading to them opposing the initiative. Prithviraj Sutar, leader of Shiv Sena in PMC, maintained, “The civic administration can procure these vehicles. Why is it pushing to take them on rent?” He added that a proper tendering process was not carried out and only one agency has been selected for the project, casting doubts on the intentions of the civic administration. On the flip side, standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “The state environment department wants to promote sustainable transport and the e-cars project has been finalised to reduce pollution,” adding that the move also aims to save public funds. During Tuesday’s meeting, an amendment was moved and approved to not avail of the services of drivers from the agency involved. With this, nearly Rs 28,000 per driver per month per vehicle will be saved. As per the proposal, after the contract period is over, PMC will have to buy these vehicles at 5 per cent of MRP. The firm providing the vehicles was also to provide drivers and take the responsibility of maintenance for eight years. As per estimates, the total project cost is Rs 23.28 crore, of which Rs 21.95 crore will be spent after the end of this financial year. The general body of PMC will have to shoulder the responsibility of this post-dated expenditure. In other decisions on Tuesday, the civic administration planned to issue tenders for the riverfront development project. The Rs 4,700-crore project will be carried out alongside around 44 km of riverfront. A green light has also been given to set up a blood bank for the municipal medical college.

The counsel for the petitioners submitted that no specific overt act has been mentioned against them in the FIR registered by the Medical College police in the district on June 5, 2020. Justice G Ilangovan observed that it is not a case of assault or injury to expect the specific overt acts to be stated in the FIR against the accused. In the case of forging the documents, the question of stating specific overt act against all the people is not possible. The judge observed that the details as to whether they were involved or not involved in the offence can be found only during the course of investigation. The fact that no overt act has been mentioned in the FIR against the petitioners cannot be taken into account, at this stage. After completion of the investigation, if the petitioners are aggrieved by the contents of the final report, they can seek remedy before the concerned court, observed the judge. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/forgery-case-plea-to-quash-fir-dismissed/articleshow/86978410.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Man served in PAC on fake identity for 15 yrs, held||Lucknow: An imposter was arrested on Tuesday after serving in the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) for 15 years on a fake identity. The crime surfaced only when a reminder for payment of a credit card bill reached the man whose identity was stolen. The accused, Amit Kumar Singh of Ballia, had adopted the identity of constable Manish Kumar Singh, also from Ballia and employed with UP Police. Manish was recruited in 2006 under the category of dependents of freedom fighters. Both Amit and Manish share their father’s name. “Amit had got an SBI credit card issued in the name of Manish. Manish also used an SBI credit card and was getting constant reminders regarding a pending bill of Rs 7,000,” said a senior police officer privy to the probe. Manish was flummoxed as he had paid all his bills and so he contacted the bank. However, he was again told that Rs 7,000 on his credit card was due. Being a constable, Manish began investigating the case himself. He then found that there were two credit cards issued in his name and the second one had transaction history every month. However, Manish had not clue about who was using that card. He went to the bank with details and found that all information about the card holder was his: name, address, date of birth, father’s name. Even his PAN was used for the card and his phone number was linked with it. Manish then searched the UP Police website and found that a PAC constable had the same details but different posting number on the site. Manish then lodged a case with Vibhuti Khand police. ADCP east Qasim Abdi said fraudster Amit had stolen Manish’s identity and was committing fraud. He added that after a chargesheet is filed, a recovery will be made of the money amassed by him as salary. He added that Amit was also involved in the case of fake recruitment in police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/man-served-in-pac-on-fake-identity-for-15-yrs-held/articleshow/86978450.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

No death was reported, said deputy commissioner Isha Kalia. The active case count has reduced to 15 from 19 a day before while recovery rate remains the same at 98.43%. One case each was detected in Gharuan and Kharar, said health officials.

A team comprising WCCB personnel and Madurai forest division raided a house in Keelapanangudi on receiving information of illegal trade of wild animals and raptors in the district. District forest officer D Gurusamy said that range officer Manikandan and others found four men to be in possession of the endangered wildlife species. Jungle cats are protected under schedule I of the Wildlife Act and eagles under schedule II. He said that investigations were on to find out where the men got the animals and birds. Madurai is home to some rare raptors as about 20 species of birds of prey are found in Arittapatti hills near Melur, which draws ornithologists and birders regularly to watch them. Shasheen falcons, endemic to the Western Ghats, are said to be thriving on these hillocks. It is also home to Bonelli’s eagle and migrant species like the booted eagle. Sources said that there are chances of birds being caught in Madurai or neighbouring districts. They added that this may be the tip of the iceberg and may involve a bigger racket, as they had information that a big gang had been transporting crocodiles and pythons through the southern districts. The four men who were arrested included two from Kerala and two from Madurai. They included Jyothish and Renjith from Thiruvananthapuram, Kanaga Anand of Madurai and his driver Ramar, who had been instrumental in transporting the animals from Madurai to Chennai and vice-versa. It is suspected that some courier services across the state are also involved in transporting these animals, which may fetch a big price in the international market, to Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/endangered-jungle-cats-owl-and-eagle-seized-in-madurai/articleshow/86978493.cms||---

Though committees have kept celebrations low profile due to the pandemic, there were no signs of dip in fervour that’s distinctive of puja. Nitish Tiwari, organiser of Mitro Shangho Durga Puja Samiti, said, “This year we have digitised the entire pandal so that we can involve as many people as possible. We have viewers from the US, Australia and many other countries as well.” Arun Banerjee, president of Bengali Club, said, “We are paying homage to all those who lost their lives in the pandemic across the world and seeking Durga Ma’s blessings for the welfare of all.” At Ravindrapalli Durga Puja, ‘dhunachi’ dance on the beats of dhak went on till late evening. Men and women of all age groups were seen taking part in it, with a number of visitors capturing the moment on their mobile phones. Alpana Das, a visitor at Bengali Club said, “My husband and I are visiting all the pandals in the city.” Kamal Kishore Agrawal, another visitor said, “Earlier, various competitions organised by the club during puja used to be a major attraction but now they are not being held because of the pandemic.” Dr Aradhana Dwivedi, a lecturer, said, “I am looking forward to Sindur khela and dressing up in Bengali attire.” Srirupa Maitra, a housewife who visited a pandal in Aminabad area, said, “I have been coming here since last 10 years but this year the crowd is missing. I wish and pray to Ma Durga that the situation gets back to normal again.” Ridhi Wadhwani, who visited Model House pandal for the first time after her marriage last year, said, “I along with my husband came here to witness the grandeur of the Durga puja festivities in Lucknow.” “The decorations have changed since my childhood when I used to visit the pandal with my parents,” said Bandita Dey, a visitor to a pandal in Aminabad. Rachel Pope, a student from West Bengal, said, “I miss home during puja times. In Bengal, you will find a pandal in every area.” “We are performing all the rituals as per the tradition.

---||Amaravati||Gazette to take effect from tomorrow: Krishna River Management Board||AMARAVATI: In a major development, the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) on Tuesday announced that the gazette notification on projects management will come into force from October 14.  The board resolved to take over 16 installations on Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar in the initial phase and expand its control bracket later. Taking Andhra Pradesh’s strong objections into consideration, board chairman MP Singh declared that it would take over the power plants on Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar too into its control without delay. Singh on Tuesday directed AP and Telangana state governments to hand over all the outlets on Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar projects to KRMB by October 14. The board asked the state governments to issue separate GOs to complete the process of handing over of the projects listed in the gazette issued by the Union jal shakti ministry. The decision to take over all the installations including power stations, canals and regulators under Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar was taken at the full board meeting held in Hyderabad on Tuesday. However, the suspense over KRMB taking physical control of the projects will continue for next two days as Telangana government is still reluctant to hand over the hydro-electrical power stations located on its soil on Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar. In fact, KRMB sub-committee headed by its member RK Pillai had suggested the board to take at least 29 installations into its fold for effective implementation of the gazette notification. The committee held discussions with the officials from both states before readying the blueprint. However, the Telangana representatives have not signed the sub-committee report in protest against the inclusion of hydel power plants. Apparently, taking Telangana’s reservations into consideration, KRMB chairman at Tuesday’s meeting proposed to take over 17 installations on four projects-Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar, Pulichintala and Sagar tailpond without making a reference to power stations in both states. At this point, AP water resources secretary J Syamala Rao strongly objected to the blueprint saying that it was against the spirit of the gazette notification. He insisted that AP is willing to hand over the projects only when the board takes over the hydel projects on both the sides into its control. He said the Centre issued the notification by fixing the board’s jurisdiction only after AP government raised an objection about the unauthorised utilisation of water from Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar by Telangana. The board declared that there is no postponement of the schedule to implement the notification. “We have assured the board that we will hand over projects from our side as soon as Telangana issued a GO to handover the hydel power plants,” Syamala Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/krmb-gazette-to-take-effect-from-tomorrow/articleshow/86976343.cms||Samdani MN

Police administration had locked the main gate due to the protest by ABVP members for cancelling REET and JEN recruitment examination. There was a big tussle between the police and ABVP members and later, their state president Hushyaar Meena was arrested. Geography department professor Mahipal Singh said, “The university is not a place for such protests which has nothing to do with any matter related to us. This is not a dharamshala.

All of us living in the campus quarters have to face problems in commuting due to the gates being locked. Hence, I decided to broke the locks with my own hands.” He further said that the vice-chancellor should look at such a nuisance in the campus. Meanwhile, ABVP said they were fighting for the rights of the unemployed youth of the state.“In REET, JEN, SI recruitment exam, even after having solid evidence of cheating, many big and influential people being involved in this, the SOG will not be able to put their hands around their neck, so investigation should be done by CBI,” said Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ru-prof-breaks-locks-of-varsity-gate-put-up-due-to-abvp-protest/articleshow/86978515.cms||---

Authorities have cited several loopholes in the statements of the family members as well as “not so normal reaction” to the brutal murder, as the key reasons for questioning the family members. A total of six teams have been formed under the SIT, out of which two teams were checking to ascertain the involvement of an outsider for committing the crime. At the time of going to press, Shinde’s wife Manisha (43), daughter Chaitali (20) and 17-year-old son had already undergone 12 hours of questioning by the SIT headed by crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav. The mother and daughter were being questioned separately, while the minor son, who is currently pursuing law from National Law University (Mumbai), was summoned to a police post in Cidco area for recording his statement. When contacted, Aghav confirmed questioning the trio for about 12 hours, but refused to elaborate further citing “several things related to the case are yet to be verified”. Those privy to the probe said that CCTV footage seized from the area surrounding Sant Tukoba Nagar did not reveal any suspicious movement during the wee hours of Monday when the brutal murder took place. The fact that there was no forceful entry in the house has forced the SIT to question the family. Moreover, SIT is also trying to find answers to the question why the minor son did not wake up others after spotting his father’s body in a pool of blood in the hall and instead stepped out of home to call for an ambulance. The SIT also questioned Chaitali as to why she did not wake her mother and grandparents after spotting his father with brutal injuries and lying in a pool of blood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/professors-brutal-murder-sit-starts-questioning-family/articleshow/86972435.cms||---

Schools have been holding physical classes in the campus on a rotational basis or on alternate days depending on the strength. “In most schools, more than 90% of the students have returned for physical classes. However, we found that there are a few who are still not ready to come to school despite making calls to them and their parents,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school. Another headmaster said that most students have been keen on coming to school as they have not been able to make any significant progress in studies while at home. He added that by next month, things should become more normal. Meanwhile, in private schools, though online classes are also being conducted, most of them are keen on conducting offline classes at least on alternate days. “Private schools are recording around 80-90% attendance. They were asked to hold online classes if students are not coming to school properly. However, only few students take leave. So, most schools have stopped online classes altogether,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/most-schools-in-madurai-see-more-than-90-attendance/articleshow/86978543.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Surat||Garba controversy in Surat: ABVP demands action against cops||SURAT: Demanding action against the police for alleged thrashing of students, around 200 members of Akhil Bhartiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP) including students of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) and others staged dharna at the varsity campus on Tuesday. After a representation to K N Chavda, vice-chancellor of VNSGU, the protesting members blocked the road outside VNSGU campus and then went to submit a memo to the district collector. Later, members also staged dharna at Umra police station. City police commissioner Ajay Tomar has already ordered an inquiry into the incident to be conducted by in-charge deputy commissioner of police zone III, K F Baloliya. On the other hand, the police claim that students have organised garba wherein hundreds of students were participating at the VNSGU campus flouting clear guidelines that do not permit any other garba events except Sheri Garba in residential colonies. Top officials at the varsity claim that they had been allowed to organise garba on the campus for hostel students. However, a large number of girls and boys from outside the campus were found present at the venue. “I allowed the garba event to be held on the campus and police should seek permission before entering the university campus. Even journalists need permission to do anything on campus,” said the Chavda. The VC, however, could not explain who had called up the police to the campus and also why he failed to answer multiple calls from the cops when they tried to contact him on Monday. He claimed that cops could have contacted other university officers if he was not reachable. Police went to the campus at around 7.30 pm on Monday and when they asked students to maintain social distance, it led to a confrontation with ABVP members. “Students can organise cultural events as part of their overall development despite the Covid specific guidelines prohibiting garba events except street garba,” Chavda added.

---||Goa||SAFF Cup: Sunil Chhetri helps India book final spot||India relied on the brilliance of Sunil Chhetri yet again as the seven-time champions defeated Maldives 3-1 to qualify for the SAFF Championship final at the National Stadium in Male on Wednesday. Needing a win to knock out the defending champions, India surged ahead through Manvir Singh (33rd minute) but the hosts – backed by a capacity crowd – equalised through veteran striker Ali Ashfaq’s penalty in the 44th minute. A draw would have been enough for Maldives to qualify for the final but Chhetri had other ideas. The India captain scored twice in the second half (62’ and 72’) to force a win and help his side finish on top of the five-team group ladder with eight points. India will now face second-placed Nepal in the final on Saturday. Chhetri was eager to find the back of the net right from the start and tried an ambitious overhead kick early in the game. He was then denied by the crossbar in the 26th minute when his powerful close-range header from Brandon Fernandes’ free-kick bounced back into play. Like several misses earlier in the championship, this did not look like India’s night until Manvir came up with a strong finish for his first goal of the tournament. It was Lalengmawia Ralte – impressive all through the game -- who started it by winning the ball in midfield and passing it on to Brandon. The India midfielder spotted Manvir’s run and sliced open the defence with a through ball which the striker finished with a powerful shot from inside the box. Maldives equalised just before the change of ends when Hamza Mohamed won a penalty, going down inside the box following a tackle from Pritam Kotal. Ashfaq had missed two chances in the first half but made no mistake from the penalty spot as he sent goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu the wrong way. In the second half, it was time for Chhetri to deliver when it mattered the most. His first was in the 62nd minute when Lalengmawia’s delivery inside the box was neatly chested down by Manvir and the captain hammered it home. India then extended their lead with Chhetri’s brilliance shining through. A free-kick from the right seemed innocuous until the captain outjumped Ali Samooh and found the top corner with a terrific long-range header. This was the first time India scored more than two goals under Igor Stimac, though the Croatian coach’s night was soured with a red card. Stimac will miss the final. Joining him in the stands will be defender Subhasish Bose, who also picked up a double booking late in the game.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/saff-cup-sunil-chhetri-helps-india-book-final-spot/articleshow/87005763.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur jaggery trade stalled||KOLHAPUR: Jaggery farmers in Kolhapur district on Tuesday threatened to shut down the production units after the traders at the agriculture produce markets refused to weigh the jaggery along with the corrugated boxes and pay accordingly. The jaggery trade has been stopped at the Kolhapur APMC due to a standoff between the traders and farmers over the past five days. The farmers bring jaggery in corrugated boxes. Each box has 18 pieces of jaggery, each weighing 1 kg. The farmers want the jaggery to be weighed along with the boxes as the boxes are further used by the traders to store and transport the jaggery. The farmers said if the weight of the box is not added to the bill, they will be at loss. Last week, the farmers approached the district collector’s office. The district authorities made a decision in the favour of the farmers. However, the traders did not turn up for business the next day. The issue reached district guardian minister Satej Patil, who too said that the farmers should be paid for the jaggery along with the boxes. Subsequently, the traders assured to start the trade from Tuesday. However, the standoff continued on Tuesday as well. APMC chairman KP Patil said that if the traders do not agree to the farmers’ demand, the farmers are free to make their own decision. Amit Patil, a jaggery farmer said, “If the traders deny us, we will stop making jaggery. Instead, we will send our produce to the sugar mills.” If the weight of the box is deducted, the farmers face a loss of Rs 150-200 per quintal. Currently, per quintal of jaggery fetches Rs 4,200, which is less given the cost involved in making jaggery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-jaggery-trade-stalled/articleshow/86972485.cms||---

Aba Bagul, leader of Congress in the PMC, said, “The civic body has not followed the due process of law for making these changes. They will cause more harm than good.” The opposing corporators claimed that around 1.75 lakh square feet of land would be available for construction after these change. “The changes on Ahmednagar road will ensure better access to the airport. The old alignment was causing many issues, like parking,” NCP city chief Prashant Jagtap said. BJP’s Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house in the PMC, said, “The changes along the route will help in saving some residential properties.”  Focus on waterlogging PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar on Tuesday said civic staff would visit the places that witnessed waterlogging during the recent rain in the next 10 days to assess the situation and take necessary steps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bjp-ncp-for-change-in-transit-route-alignment/articleshow/86976479.cms||---

Simhadri plant has four 500MW capacity power generation units. The coal requirement for the plant is 8-10 rakes (each rake between 32,000 MT to 37,000 MT), but the plant is receiving only six to eight rakes per day. The plant usually has coal stocks for one week, but now it has stocks for one-two days. Diwakar Kaushik, the Simhadri plant’s chief general manager, told TOI they have not been running the plant at full capacity for the past few days due to coal shortage. “Based on coal availability we are declaring our generation capacity. One unit broke down on Monday and it is likely to be ready by Wednesday evening. We are hoping for the situation to improve in a week or two. Agricultural load would also come down as planting of paddy seeds would be over. With the days getting cooler, domestic load will also come down.

Replying to the concern shared by a student Anurag Tripathi on the medium of language becoming a barrier in learning for students from rural background, Prasadasaid geographical and language boundaries should not deprive students of a level-playing field. “I am told that four institutes will now impart technical education in Hindi. It will be unfortunate if some students are at disadvantage because they understand their mother tongue better than any other language,” he said.

A brainchild of PM Narendra Modi, the Gati Shakti Plan to be launched on Wednesday will offer multi-modal connectivity to more than 1,200 industrial clusters, including two defence corridors across the country. “Any scheme cannot become successful by mere announcement. It requires ‘jan-sahyog’. Your support is needed. You (technically educated students) must come forward, take responsibilities and grab opportunities because employability is the key,” said Prasada. He added, “The Gati Shakti scheme is an infusion of money and thought. Over the next five years when this scheme will roll out, experts will be required for nation building. Opportunity to work for this will come to graduates like you who have domain expertise.”Exhorting students to be ‘atmanirbhar’, Prasada said, “This is what PM thinks and we need to work towards this direction. The aim is to create opportunities and bring in resources that you can use and lead a respectful life.”Assuring students to provide world-class facilities to help them compete globally, Prasada said, “It is not help but opportunities that will help you compete in this world.” The minister, who inaugurated a robotics lab and a centre for micro and nano characterisation facility at AKTU on Tuesday, sought to know the students’ expectations from the government. “Let the vice-chancellor prepare a report on expectations from the minister and government,” said Prasada. Prasada distributed laptops to 10 girl toppers and high rankers of the SC/ST category for State Entrance Examination 2019 as part of the scheme under which overall 200 students are set to get the gadget. Asking students who didn’t get the laptop to not worry, the minister said, “The UP government will provide tablets to all students and those in technical education too.” As many as 11 students who lost their parents to Covid-19, along with three teachers were given compensatory benefits on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/grab-opportunities-aktu-students-told/articleshow/86978614.cms||Isha Jain

Local police, which was probing the disappearance for the last several months -- and without any headway -- cracked the case within a few days after a nudge from the ADG, who formed a special team to deal with it.The ADG, Meerut zone had formed the team after a senior BSF official called him to find the whereabouts of the jawan, Rampal Singh (57).After a probe, it turned out that the two sons of Rampal allegedly killed him and dumped the body in the well. They suspected that he was “keeping an evil eye on his elder daughter-in-law”. An FIR against the two sons and their four friends was registered and they were booked for murder. The younger son and a friend have been arrested.Rampal had come home on March 29, 2021. He had taken off to meet his family members before joining duty in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer. But he never reported to his battalion.According to sources, deceased’s brother Jitendra Singh was the first to approach Augata police station in Bulandshahr to complain about the missing of his brother. He had expressed doubt that his sons may have been involved in his disappearance.“Even the sister and daughter of the jawan had written to police, but nothing had happened. Then his daughter wrote a letter to BSF commandant, who approached ADG Meerut zone to intervene into the matter. This is when the police swung into action,” said an official involved in the investigation.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Bulandshahr, Santosh Singh, however claimed that police were always keenly investigating the matter, but Singh’s sons were under the lens.“His sons had also filed a police complaint about the disappearance of their father on May 29. We were investigating the matter since then,” the SSP said.“After interrogating several people, we started phone tracking. The strange part was that the last location of Rampal on the night of his disappearance was his home, on March 30. Even his son’s phone location was at home while he had told us that he had dropped his father to Hapur. This raised doubts on their statements and when interrogated, they accepted their crime,” said SSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/missing-for-7-months-bsf-jawan-found-murdered-in-a-well-sons-booked/articleshow/86974308.cms||Ishita Mishra

As per rule, the sugar cane mills have to pay the cutters and transporters. Since the last few years, the cutters and transporters would take up to Rs 4,000 per acre from sugar cane farmers to cut the produce and transport it to the mills. If the farmer denies, the cutters refuse to cut the sugar cane. The farmers were fed with this way of exploitation as they do not have money at the time of harvesting and many times, they have to approach local money lenders to take loan at higher rates to pay the sugar cane cutters. Gaikwad, in a letter to the mill operators, has stated that the mills should appoint ombudsman or the grievance redressal officer and make his name and contact details available in every village of the jurisdiction of the mills. “The farmers can complain to the officer of the mill. The officer, after cross-checking the complaint, can ask the cutters and transporters to pay the money back or can cut the amount from their payment to be given by the mills. This practice of economic exploitation of the farmers must be stop.” Gaikwad further states that farmers should not worry about the harvesting as the crushing season is expected to last for four to five months. “Also sugar cane will be harvested for ethanol production,” he said. The sugar cane farmers are happy with the step taken by Gaikwad. “In a sense, it was exploitation to get the sugar cane cut and transported to the mills, without which, we would not be able to get our hard earned income. Sometimes, to avoid paying the cutters, we ourselves cut and transport the sugar cane to the mills,” said Amar Yadav, sugar cane growing farmer from Hatkanangale. Yadav said they expected the mills to take some steps to stop the cutters and transporters from taking the money, but their requests were not heeded to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sugar-commissioner-to-mills-recover-money-from-cutters/articleshow/86972500.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Rs 7 lakh property pinched from DSK’s SB Road bungalow||PUNE: Electronic goods and other property totally worth Rs 6.95 lakh were stolen from jailed developer D S Kulkarni’s (DSK) bungalow off SB Road here on Monday. The developer has been in jail since his arrest in February 2018 in connection with an alleged Rs2,091 crore economic fraud case. The Pune police and the ED have issued notifications on separate dates provisionally attaching Kulkarni’s properties, including his bungalow, under the MPID Act and PMLA, respectively, and are seeking final attachment orders from the respective courts. “The MPID court in Pune is yet to decide the final attachment matter, but the PMLA court in Mumbai has granted the final attachment in favour of the ED,” special public prosecutor Pravin Chavan told TOI on Tuesday. As such, the bungalow is under control of the ED. “We will soon have a dialogue with the ED officials and other agencies to ensure protection of DSK’s seized and sealed,” deputy commissioner of police (EOW) Bhagyashri Navatake told TOI on Tuesday. In April 2020, the EOW had registered five cases with the Hadapsar police relating to theft of electrical appliances, furniture and construction material from another of Kulkarni’s sealed property — the DSK Global Education and Waterfall Residency projects at Phursungi. In the case of Kulkarni’s bungalow, senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure of the Chatushrungi police said no one has visited it in the past two years. “In the last few weeks, people residing in the vicinity heard some noises from the bungalow and informed Kulkarni’s daughter-in-law Bhagyashri Amit Kulkarni, who approached the police with a request to check the premises in order to ascertain if there was a theft,” explained Waghchaure. “We got in touch with the ED officials who visited the bungalow on Monday morning and removed the seal to let Bhagyashri and other family members inspect the premises. It was found that six television sets, CD players, laptops, a digital camera, a geyser, a flour mill, and a silver lamp, among other articles were stolen,” said Waghchaure. According to the police inspector, there are eight entrance gates to the bungalow, which are all sealed and locked. “We suspect the thieves scaled the compound wall from the hillside to enter the bungalow and then broke open the locks on the front door to enter. As of now, it is not known when the theft took place,” said Waghchaure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rs-7l-property-pinched-from-dsks-sb-road-bungalow/articleshow/86976501.cms||Gitesh Shelke

Sub-inspector Sachin Khetmalis of the Kondhwa police said on Tuesday, “The suspects, including two women, visited the police station to file a complaint but before we could attend to them, we received distress calls from two places. So, they were requested to wait.” “The suspects picked up a quarrel with a policewoman and abused her in a foul language. Two policemen intervened in the dispute, but the suspects also attacked them.

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Watch movies in cinemas but no munching popcorn, samosa||NAGPUR: Munching popcorn in a multiplex while being engrossed in a racy thriller will now be a thing of the past, at least for the time being, as the state government has banned food and beverages inside the screening areas. As movie theatres and auditoriums reopen from October 22 in Maharashtra to let patrons in, sadly the popcorn box or other snacks have to stay outside. Sanjay Surana, whose family owns almost two dozen movie theatres in Maharashtra, said there are some points in the SOPs (standard operating procedures) which are illogical. Surana said, “Eating food at the kiosk is allowed, but taking it inside the auditorium, which is just 10 feet away, is banned. This is just one of the illogical clauses in the SOPs by Maharashtra government. Snacking inside the screening area is a part of the entire movie experience.” Food and beverage sale in multiplexes is a high margin revenue stream and only a negligible number of people consume food at the kiosk itself. “Many people might not buy snacks if they realize it can’t be taken inside,” said Surana. On Tuesday evening, district collector issued orders for reopening of cinema halls, theatres, swimming pools (only for athletes) and permitted cultural events in open air areas in Nagpur (rural). Till filing of this report, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had not issued orders for the city. The collector’s orders make it clear that only those adults who have taken both the doses of Covid vaccine will be allowed entry. Also, at least 14 days should have passed since the second dose. For those below 18, entry is allowed without vaccination because no such provision exists for that age group. However, it will be mandatory for such minors to carry a photo ID proof in which the date of birth is mentioned. ‘50% occupancy limit will hurt theatres’Sanjay Surana, whose family owns almost two dozen movie theatres in Maharashtra, said another clause which will hurt movie theatres financially is the 50% occupancy limit. “Buses are running at full capacity, in autorickshaws people are sitting next to each other, planes are full, but, for some reason, you can’t have people sitting next to each other in cinema halls,” said Surana. Manohar Wadhwani, a national-level movie distributor, said this was the first time such a detailed SOP has been issued for the sector. “Right from diagram of the seating plan, to staff vaccination status, to how food menu should be presented to patrons is mentioned in it,” said Wadhwani. But, movie halls aren’t the only ones that are getting hurt. Theatres, which thrive on live interaction with the audience, too rue the 50% seating cap. Sameer Pandit, theatre organizer, said, “Instead of 50% occupancy limit, government should have made complete vaccination mandatory for theatre-goers. If all are fully vaccinated, we can go for 100% occupancy. It’s not feasible to hold a commercial show at 50% occupancy.” He added, it will be financially impossible for Mumbai groups to stage plays in Nagpur, due to the logistics cost and limited revenue. Looking at the situation as a blessing in disguise, theatre veteran Sanjay Bhakre said local groups can cash in on the opportunity. “We are practising for a commercial play, which we plan to launch as soon as theatres open. Theatre-lovers are eager to watch plays. If we bring good content, it will be an opportunity for local talent,” he said. Theatre organizer Ravindra Jadhav said watching play will cost more in coming days. “The present standard ticket rate is around Rs500. With 50% occupancy, it will reach up to Rs700, at least. Everyone is facing financial constraints post-Covid. I am not sure how many will come and attend theatre events,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/50-occupancy-limit-will-hurt-theatres/articleshow/86981116.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Survey on to trace those unvaccinated, prod them for jab||Nagpur: Local health officials have started preparing a list of unvaccinated people in the district, under the state government’s Kavach Kundal initiative in line with the central government’s target of vaccinating 100 crore people by October 15. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) teams are visiting zones which have high number of unvaccinated people. The teams are surveying homes and if any family member is are found unvaccinated, he or she is jabbed on the spot. As per the civic officials, over 4 lakh people are yet to take the first dose in the city alone. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that staff from existing vaccination centres and urban primary health centres (UPHCs) have been deployed in the field. “They are covering areas falling under all the 10 zones. The target is to add 10% more beneficiaries to take city’s achievement to 85%. The teams are spreading out in congested areas where it is easier to survey people as homes are closer to each other. Vaccinators are accompanying the survey team to instantly jab the people on the spot. Joshi said the drive would continue beyond October 15 for some more days to make up for the upcoming festival holidays. The drive is likely to go on till October 20. The vaccination teams have been mobilized after the footfalls at the centres fell drastically. Joshi said, “After this drive, we would try to utilize the voter list to confirm vaccination as all in there are above 18.” The additional municipal commissioner said the response has been good to the door-to-door drive. Asked about hesitancy, Joshi said, “Besides the NMC teams, neighbours too are encouraging the unvaccinated people to take the jab.” Loss of daily wages, possible fever after vaccination and lack of motivation were some of the reasons given for not taking the jab so far. The NMC officials said among the 4 lakh beneficiaries, over 80% are from 18 to 44 age group who are yet to take the first dose. The district health officials too are running the drive under Kavach Kundal. A senior health officer said in some of the rural parts, people are questioning the vaccination as the Covid cases have dipped. “What is the need now when there is no Covid? This is the common question our teams are being asked,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/survey-on-to-trace-those-unvaccinated-prod-them-for-jab/articleshow/86974353.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Will make payment as per FRP in 1 go: Kagal’s Shahu Mill||KOLHAPUR: The Chhatrapati Shahu cooperative sugar factory in Kagal has announced to pay the price of sugar cane equal to the fair and remunerative price fixed by the Union government in single instalment to farmers. Chairman of the factory, Samarjeetsinh Ghatage, announced the decision. He said farmers will be paid Rs 2,993 for per tonne of sugar cane for the crushing season starting from October 15. “Sugar cane farmers have suffered losses due to floods. The government is reluctant to pay the compensation and the lo,ans of the farmers are not getting waived. Therefore, keeping our tradition to pay higher price to the farmers, we have decided to pay equal to the FRP amount and most importantly, it will be paid in lump sum,” she said. Shahu factory has thus become the first among 200-odd sugar mills from the state to announce the purchase price for sugar cane. The announcement by the factory has thus put pressure on operators of other mills to announce what they will pay. Farmers’ leader Raju Shetti has steered campaign against the Union government’s plan to allow mills to pay in three instalments. Union minister Piyush Goyal has stated that there is no such proposal contemplated. State government too had recommended to allow the mills to pay in instalments. Over 50,000 hectares of sugar cane crop has been damaged partially in Kolhapur district alone due to floods in July this year. Ghatage said that the Shahu Factory will crush the partially damaged sugar cane without worrying much about likely drop in recovery rate. This decision too likely to put moral burden on other mills to look after the flood-affected farmers sensitively. The mill’s move is likely raise expectations of the farmers. They now expect other mills to not pay less than the FRP amount. The farmers also expect to get payment in single instalment and not in three instalments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/will-make-payment-as-per-frp-in-1-go-kagals-shahu-mill/articleshow/86972512.cms||---

---||Pune||Safety at home begins with guards from licensed agency||In a four-part series on how citizens can avoid being robbed, cheated and assaulted by people who visit them for house work or are employed to keep them protected on their premises, TOI turns the spotlight on staying safe at home.Starting today, these reports will raise a host of queries on the mechanism to regulate or monitor security guards engaged by individuals and housing societies, their training and approach to effective guarding, how a careful vetting of domestic help and other workers can deter attacks and robberies, and how deployment of technology driven surveillance systems, and web applications can provide security. Housing societies and individuals in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad hire security guards for both day and night duties. The Pune Police insist that this hiring be done from licensed agencies who have to source their team members after character verification, and train their employees in security measures. But, there is a huge grey area where the costs of training and salaries that societies or individuals are willing to pay play a very crucial role. A total of 2,200 licensed private security agencies have been operating in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) since 2005 when the Private Security Agencies Regulation Act (PSARA) was introduced to regulate and monitor the services of security guards employed by individuals, housing societies and other commercial establishments. Many more security agencies thrive illegally and provide security guards at a much cheaper price, which experts in the safety and security industry have said, pose issues for authorities and citizens. Much of the problem _ as people associated with the security industry point out _ can be attributed to reliance on unauthorized agencies which assign men with a dubious past on security duties; the absence of a robust mechanism to conduct regular checks of the agencies and a general apathy towards meeting these requirements. While the police do not maintain separate data on involvement of security guards in crimes, several incidents have been reported in the recent past from across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad wherein security guards were involved in thefts, robberies, molestation and other crimes. Krishnan Venkiteswaran, a member of Anandvan Parisar Forum, said they are a group of housing societies in Kondhwa-NIBM road areas. “We request the societies to hire only licensed private security agencies as they are reliable and their security guards, generally, do not indulge in criminal activities. These agencies do a thorough background check of their employees. Smaller housing societies, with fewer flats and budget constraints, go for the non-registered or illegal private security agencies. But, they compromise their residents’ safety when the security guards are hired from an illegal agency. Such persons may indulge in thefts and other criminal activities on the society’s premises,” he added. Raj Babbar, member of a prominent housing society, said, “Smaller housing societies opt for illegal or non-registered security agencies and may end up paying a price. Security guards, posted with a housing society for a long period get details of the residents and can target a flat or property.” Former additional DGP Rajendra Sonawane said the regulation act has no mechanism to punish a security agency that falters. “Only a nominal fine is imposed. The police have no effective mechanism to monitor the functioning of these agencies. Periodic verification of security guards is needed which is not happening. There is no mechanism to cross-check if an agency is giving training, and what kind of training, to its men,” he added. Illegal agencies thrive only because societies are reluctant to spend more on security guards, Sonawane said. “At times, multiple agencies hire the same security guard, who works on day shift with one and on night shift with another. The kind of self-defence weapon or equipment given to guards is also a matter to be looked into,” he said. Pune’s joint police chief Ravindra Shisve insisted that an annual examination of documents is done, focusing on the deposit of Provident Fund of the security guards. “Also, their accounts are checked. If something fishy is found, an inquiry is ordered against the security agency. If the agency is guilty, its licence is terminated,” he added. Pimpri Chinchwad’s deputy commissioner of police Sudhir Hiremath said the verification of security guards is done at the police station level and is monitored by the assistant commissioners of police of the respective zone. However, another Pimpri Chinchwad police officer conceded that there is hardly any monitoring done at the police station level. “To save money, a person applying for an agency licence, mentions deployment of 20 security guards. Police verification is done only for 20 guards but in reality, the agency deploys 50. This should be checked and verified at the police station, but it is not up to the desired level,” he said. Sachin More, chairman of Police-Private Security Partnership Programme (P4), an umbrella body of 200 private security agencies, said, “We always request housing societies, commercial complexes and industries to hire guards from licensed agencies, but that is not the case. A background check of guards hired from unauthorized agencies always remains a neglected aspect and herein lies the problem.” More said licensed agencies normally undertake a proper background check, including one at the guard’s native place, take photocopies of ID card, educational and other documents and submit a copy to the local police where the guard is assigned work. “Verification is must before appointing a guard,” More added. Licensed agencies provide costly manpower, but to save money, establishments hire guards from illegal/unregistered firms, he said.

Proposals to axe and transplant 1,346 trees were placed before the civic Tree Authority on Tuesday. Of these, the authority approved the felling of 269 trees 24 for the Vidhan Bhavan Metro station in south Mumbai and as many as 245 for two private projects in Lower Parel. The rest of the proposals will be discussed at the next Tree Authority meeting in November. Proposals for hacking more than 200 trees at one location will be sent to the state government, as per an amendment to the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act. As per the amendment, the government will also form the Maharashtra Tree Authority to discuss those projects. The state authority will be responsible for the protection and conservation of trees, including heritage trees. Local tree authorities are also supposed to ensure that projects are not divided into smaller piecemeal proposals to keep the number of trees below the defined threshold. Out of the 1343 trees, 770 trees are to be axed, while 576 are to be transplanted. Metro and rail projects in the city account for the majority of trees on the chopping block. Some proposals have earmarked trees for redevelopment projects across the city. “Shiv Sena only talks about the environment, but in reality they have been allowing thousands of trees to be hacked every year. They stalled the Metro project to save trees; now we don’t know when it will be completed. BMC must come out with a white paper on how many trees they have allowed to be hacked in the last five years,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-1300-trees-on-the-chopping-block-for-infra/articleshow/86978663.cms||---

---||Goa||Stewart brings Steven Gerrard’s winning mentality to Jamshedpur||Greg Stewart could have been playing under Romanian great Gheorghe Hagi at Farul Constanta. Instead, he finds himself at Jamshedpur FC. The striker was part of Steven Gerrard’s Rangers FC squad that won the Scottish Premiership last season, stopping bitter rivals Celtic from doing 10-in-a-row and winning their 55th title. At the end of his two-year contract, there were foreign options, among them a move to Romania where Farul Constanta -- managed by Hagi – were keen. Talks happened, but the move fell through. “For me everything happens for a reason,” Stewart told TOI over a video call from his hotel room where he was undergoing mandatory eight-day quarantine. “These things happen in football. I am here in India and that’s what was meant to be. All my focus is on Jamshedpur.” At 31, Stewart knew he wasn’t getting any younger, so wanted to try something different this season, having played all through his career in UK. It was during this period of uncertainty that Jamshedpur FC coach Owen Coyle dialled his number and the two were looking in the same direction. “We both felt happy, felt it was good for the team. Personally, I knew I could come here and help the team achieve something,” said Stewart. The Scottish striker arrives in India with a big reputation and a Premiership champion’s medal. Rangers were unbeaten in the league, won all their games at home and kept a clean-sheet record. More importantly, with Liverpool FC legend Gerard in the dressing room, there was plenty to learn, both on and off the field. “Working under Steven was a privilege. The coaching staff he brought in, you learn from them as well. Having won a few big trophies from his playing days, he had that winning mentality. He is a top professional and tried to get his players to do the same. “I know Jamshedpur have not made it to the (Indian Super League) playoffs, but this team had a chance last season. I come here from a team that tries to win every single match. I can help the team, and with this mentality, push for a playoff spot to begin with,” said Stewart. At Rangers, the former Dundee and Aberdeen frontman had to change his ways to survive in a champion squad. The top-notch experience has made him better. “When you are at Rangers, there is lot of pressure,” he said. “You are training everyday and obviously the manager was a top player in his time. So, you learn a lot. I feel like I have been a better player from my (two) years at Rangers and I am going to show that on the field this season.” Stewart has to wait to prove himself, possibly in an attacking midfield role with Jamshedpur. His quarantine is just over and it’s not until November 21 that they play their opening game against SC East Bengal. “I am not used to being away from football for so long. It’s been four or five months now. I am just itching to get back,” he said. Last season, Stewart didn’t get enough game time at Rangers. He doesn’t have anyone to blame, certainly not when the team was winning games and marching towards the title. Rangers’ Premiership success helped Stewart live out a dream with his boyhood club. “Obviously it was massive. On a personal note, I have been a Rangers fan and to get to play for your boyhood club, it was something I dreamed of as a kid. We had an amazing season. It was an unbelievable achievement from everyone at the club. “I am not thinking of all this right now. But when I stop playing football, I will look back and say, yes, it was unbelievable. I am still young. I want to experience more thrills and that’s why I came here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stewart-brings-steven-gerrards-winning-mentality-to-jamshedpur/articleshow/87005959.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Delhi||Councillors claim irregularities in survey of vendors||New Delhi: Municipal councillors have alleged “irregularities” in the survey of vendors conducted by town vending committees. The committees are chaired by the zonal deputy commissioner, while members are nominated by Delhi government. On Wednesday, allegations over setting up of illegal tehbazari in Jahangirpuri just a few days before the survey led to a ruckus in the standing committee meeting of North Delhi Municipal Corporation. The committee chairman later ordered a probe and a re-survey of all vendors in the ward. The issue was raised by Mukundpur councillor Ajay Sharma. He alleged that at least 25 tehbazaris were set up a few days before the survey was scheduled on the road opposite his office. “I first approached the Civil Lines zone deputy commissioner and then the north corporation commissioner. But they didn’t take the matter seriously. These vendors were automatically counted in the survey,” claimed Sharma. Sharma further alleged, “These vending sites were allotted to physically challenged people. Though I’m not against helping these people in earning a livelihood, such encroachment of roads is a violation of norms. I suspect these people are being misused for encroaching upon public land and then making money from illegal vending stalls.” Later, Congress councillor from Jahangirpuri Poonam Bagri, who is not a member of the standing committee, entered the meeting hall with a few disabled people who claimed to be vendors. She claimed that the tehbazaris were legal and being run for a long time. “Nobody can deny them their rights and, if required, we will take the matter to the higher authorities,” she said. This led to adjournment of the meeting for some time. Later, standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain asked the Civil Lines zone deputy commissioner Satnam Singh for details. “These hawkers appeared 15 days before the survey and we got them removed with the help of police. However, a day before the survey, some of them returned,” said Singh. “Considering that 757 vendors were surveyed in Jahangirpuri ward alone, a committee has been formed to investigate their validity. At some places, the committee found no vendor existed earlier,” added Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/councillors-claim-irregularities-in-survey-of-vendors/articleshow/87005975.cms||Vibha Sharma

The deceased was identified as Prasannan, a resident of Champakkara. Police suspect that Prasannan allegedly set fire to the house over a financial dispute with the house owner. However, the house owner Suneer, his wife and two children, who were staying on the first floor, escaped unhurt. The fire broke out in the ground floor and the car porch where Suneer, who is into the sale of used furniture, dumped the furniture. The family got trapped in a bathroom on the first floor of the house and they were rescued by the fire and rescue personnel. According to Maradu police, the fire broke out around 6am and neighbours alerted the fire and rescue and police after seeing the flames. Two units each from Tripunithura and Gandhi Nagar fire stations managed to douse the fire after over two hours. “When the team started dousing the fire, we found a man with severe burn injuries lying on the ground near the car porch. We rushed him to the nearby hospital but he succumbed to injuries,” said police sources. The neighbours alerted the team about the family trapped inside the bathroom and they managed to rescue them and douse the fire simultaneously. “We approached the bathroom through the sunshade. We cut the iron rods of the ventilator using a hydraulic cutter and rescued the family. At first, the 14-year-old girl was rescued followed by her mother, 12-year-old boy and then the father,” said a fire and rescue officer. A car that was parked in the porch was fully gutted. The porch and the adjacent room too were destroyed. “We suspect that Prasannan, a lottery vendor, set fire to the house out of vengeance as some witnesses had seen him entering the compound with a fuel can in the morning. We are yet to confirm whether it is self-immolation. A case of unnatural death has been registered,” said police sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/1-dead-after-fire-breaks-out-at-house-in-tripunithura/articleshow/86974401.cms||---
---||Dehradun||BJP goes into huddle post defections in poll bound U’khand||Dehradun: Jolted by the defection of cabinet minister Yashpal Arya and his MLA son to the Congress, that too when the state is just months away from assembly polls, top BJP leaders are all out to placate the disgruntled lot. Yashpal Arya, who was transport minister in state government, was among many prominent Congress leaders, led by former chief minister Vijay Bahuguna, to have crossed over to the saffron party before the 2017 assembly polls. A party source told TOI that the BJP has reached out to another MLA Umesh Sharma Kau -- a turncoat who was earlier with the Congress and is reportedly unhappy with the party functioning.  "We are confident that Kau won’t leave the party. He has some issues with a section of party workers, which are being looked into,” said a senior BJP leader. On October 11, Kau even met senior party leader Anil Baluni and RP Singh, party’s co-in-charge of state affairs, in Delhi. On Yashpal Arya's exit, Manvir Singh Chauhan, BJP Uttarakhand spokesperson, told TOI, "Party always held Yashpal Arya in high esteem, still he chose to leave. No other MLA is going to jump the ship, no matter how hard the Congress tries.” The development is being seen as a big gain for the Congress, say political observers. The father-son duo is expected to strengthen the party in Kumaon region, especially in Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar districts. In another setback to the BJP, forest minister Harak Singh Rawat has refused to contest the polls, leaving the party in a fix.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-goes-into-huddle-post-defections-in-poll-bound-ukhand/articleshow/86974361.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: MSRTC driver ends life; toll mounts to 23 since outbreak||AURANGABAD: Tukaram Sanap, an MSRTC bus driver from Beed depot, committed suicide on Monday evening. With this, the number of suicide cases involving MSRTC employees since the pandemic broke out has increased to 23, claim the workers’ union. The union blames the delay in disbursement of salaries, among other issues, for the employees taking such extreme steps. Ashok Changan, divisional secretary of Maharashtra ST Workers’ Congress, said Sanap could not afford to pay even the monthly electricity bill — which led to the power to his house being cut. “Delay in salary disbursement has become a norm during the pandemic. We got the salary for July in September. This has hit the MSRTC staff hard. It has had an effect on financial liabilities and has invited penalties and actions in many cases,” he said. The workers union pointed to the disparity in pay and perks for the MSRTC staff. “Our last pay rivision had taken place in 2016. We receive DA of only 12% when compared to 28% received by other government employees. The HRA is in the ratio of 8%-16%-24% for other employees as per cities, whereas we get it in the ratio of 7%-14%-21,” added Changan. Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab said there may be other reasons behind the MSRTC employees taking extreme steps besides delay in salary disbursement in some of the cases. “The dip in passenger movement since the outbreak has hit the MSRTC’s earnings with monthly losses mounting to over Rs 400 crore. The state government has already been extending help to disburse salaries. We explored other options too such as scaling up cargo business, CNG conversion of buses and setting up fuel pumps on MSRTC premises to increase revenue,” he said. While expressing solidarity with the staff, Parab said they should be patient as the ST’s financial position is expected to improve. The Maharashtra ST Karmachari Congress has sought the appointment of a full-time chairman for MSRTC. “The transport minister is the ex-officio chairman of MSRTC. As the minister is often loaded with other responsibilities, a separate official, who can devote time exclusively to MSRTC, is needed,” union leader Shrirang Barge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/msrtc-driver-ends-life-toll-mounts-to-23-since-outbreak/articleshow/86972518.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Mumbai||Bombay to Mumbai: Century-old art society changes name||MUMBAI: Best portrait in oil or water colours by a native lady.” “Best portrait of animal life in oil or water colours.” Back in 19th-century Bombay, when Maharajahs patronised the arts and “gate money collections” decided an event’s success, these unique categories marked an important annual awards ceremony whose print advertisements lured elite connoisseurs with the promise of “electric lighting” and English bands. The All-India Annual Arts Exhibition, which began in 1889 to give amateur artists a platform, commands a mention in the early career biographies of legends from S L Haldankar to M F Husain. While the century-old exhibition changed its address this year by moving online in March, its non-profit host, Bombay Art Society, changed its century-old name to Mumbai Art Society recently. If the pandemic forced the former’s transition, the Society’s decision to rechristen itself in September stemmed from “long-standing pressures from social and art circles”. Following CM Uddhav Thackeray’s reminder about this demand during a recent inauguration, the institution so far the only one other than the Bombay high court to retain the erstwhile name of the city chose to shed ‘Bombay’ from its moniker during its annual general meeting on September 29. “We don’t want to obliterate our past though,” says art writer Rajendra, newly-elected president of the institution. “We will continue to use the old name in brackets,” he adds. Formed in 1888 by British art lovers at a time when India was bereft of galleries, the art space quickly gained favour among the city’s beau monde through its exhibition. Attended always by the Governor, the show was held near the start of every year at the Bombay Secretariat in Fort. Later, the non-profit moved to the JJ School of Art, which had been founded in the Year of the Mutiny in 1857. Here, it was often mistaken for a government department without much need for public funding. After the exhibition shifted to Town Hall (Asiatic Society of India), “gate money collections” escalated steadily by a few hundred rupees every year. With their renderings of mountain peaks, fruits, flowers, cherub-faced children, “domestics” and horse-soldiers, English women tended to take home the coveted gold medal in the initial few years, until artist M V Dhurandhar’s win in 1892 emboldened fellow students from JJ School of Art to participate. Soon, artist M F Pithawala pulled off a hat-trick by scoring three golds between 1907 and 1909. Later, when renowned artist Amrita Sher-Gill won the prize, she “was also considered an outsider”, according to a journal brought out during the Society’s centenary year in 1989. “The show was the primary reason behind the foundation of Jehangir Art Gallery in 1952,” reveals Rajendra, citing that the institution’s permanent office at the Gallery came about when the Society’s first Indian president, the art-loving Sir Cowasee Jehangir, requested the government for land to build the gallery. While the Society’s clout waned in the ’70s, with the emergence of other art platforms, PM Narendra Modi inaugurated its art complex at Bandra Reclamation in 2016. Like Jehangir Art Gallery, this arts space was built on government land. Today, the Society, which runs solely on donations, is struggling to pay its annual property tax of Rs 11 lakh. Covid has brought other problems. “Since art galleries were closed for most of the period since the pandemic began, emerging artists bore the brunt of it. Primary sale was affected in a big way,” says Rajendra, who is also the director of India Art Festival. He added that the Society donated Rs 10,000 to struggling artists who had requested financial help. Optimism sustains him though. Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari doubled the governor’s cash prize in their annual exhibition to Rs 50,000 last year, and again this year to Rs 1 lakh. Besides, the Society not only has plans to convert its 500-strong art collection into a “circulating painting library” for corporates who want to decorate their foyers, but also to create a visual arts knowledge centre that will run crash courses for kids and adults alike in mediums ranging from films to animation. A hint of this future can be found in a new category that has made it into the Society’s ongoing online exhibition that marks India’s 75th year of Independence: Video installation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/from-bombay-to-mumbai-century-old-art-society-changes-its-name/articleshow/86978705.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

Maintaining a low-key presence in the ceremony, Priyanka met the aggrieved family members and assured that the Congress will continue to stand by them till justice is delivered. While Priyanka refused to take any question from mediapersons in Lakhimpur Kheri, she took to social media to voice her thoughts. “Our protest will end only when farmers and journalist Raman Kashyapji get the justice they deserve,” Priyanka later tweeted on her social media handle. In Lakhimpur Kheri, she had said: “I have come here to attend the antim ardas… it will not be good to say anything else here.” UP Congress spokesperson Jawed Ahmed Warsi said that the farmers thanked Priyanka Gandhi for supporting them in these trying times. He also cornered the UP government and called it anti-farmer. “The anti-farmer face of BJP was exposed once again when the government tried to stop our leader’s convoy,” he said. “Priyanka's convoy had left Lucknow airport for Lakhimpur at 8 am. Police officials -- at the behest of the BJP government -- stopped vehicles of Congress leaders and workers at various spots and they were not allowed to move ahead. When their convoy was heading to Lakhimpur an attempt was made to divert them to another route,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cong-stir-to-continue-till-farmers-get-justice/articleshow/86978669.cms||Shailvee Sharda

A case is yet to be registered. However, we have sought some details from the RDO and other offices regarding the formalities to be followed while cutting and removing trees from the campus,” said a police officer. Sources said that wood of trees cut down on the campus were removed earlier too and the probe needs to be initiated whether they were authorized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/inquiry-commission-visits-maharajas/articleshow/86974434.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Cases of dengue were higher in the first 10 days of October (97) than in the first fortnight of September (85). The BMC recorded 15 cases of chikungunya in October so far as against seven in September. “The surge of mosquito-borne diseases in monsoons is not unknown. We expect to see a drop now,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. However, a doctor working in a private hospital said that cases of dengue and chikungunya continue to pour into the OPDs. Dengue has emerged as the worst monsoon illness, with a four-time rise in incidence this year (573) as against 2020 when only 129 cases of dengue were registered. There were no cases of chikungunya in the city in 2019 and 2020. Malaria, which is endemic to the city, saw 169 cases in October so far as against 607 in the whole of September. From January onwards, 4,172 cases of malaria have been diagnosed.

---||Kochi||Man pedals to Delhi to mark protest||Panaji: While most people grumble about the steep rise in fuel prices, a 28-year-old man from Palakkad is going to great lengths—2,700km to be exact—to express his displeasure after petrol prices breached the century mark. C Vishnu, a journalist with a cooperative banking periodical, set off on his cycle from his home in Palakkad on a solo ride to Delhi where he hopes to tell members of Parliament that he is unhappy with the fuel prices. He reached Goa on Monday and spoke to a few reporters about his pedalling expedition. “Everywhere I go, people welcome me. People are very pleasant and they accept my act because they face the same problem,” he said. Vishnu’s adventure in the saddle began on September 25 and he hopes to be in Delhi by the first week of November. The long, 700-km ride to Goa has done little to dim the smile on his face or sap his energy, and Vishnu has no problems answering questions and posing for pictures with curious bystanders. “The roads are nice, but the stretch from Margao to Panaji was bad,” he said. He cycles about 80-100km per day, restricting the rides to early morning and evenings. From Goa, he will cycle to Maharashtra, then Gujarat, and hopes to continue cycling till he reaches the national capital. While he has been riding solo, another Keralite based in Goa plans to join him on the expedition. An avid footballer, Vishnu claims that though he is in great shape, he began cycling just two months before he set off. He is the general secretary of the Palakkad district Youth Congress wing and for him, the ride is as much an act of defiance as it is a political statement. “I like cycling. I decided to show my protest against this government—which is very cruelly increasing petrol prices—and also its handling of the farmers’ issues,” said Vishnu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/man-pedals-to-delhi-to-mark-protest/articleshow/86976597.cms||---

The contractor concerned has sought a three-year extension in the contract period from the Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) due to Covid pandemic even though the latter has given a 15-month extension. Smart city CEO Sumant More said they have invited the contractor for talks on the issue and will soon take a call on the issue. The contractor had started parking spaces at 22 location from March 4, 2020, and had received good response. But the NMSCDCL had to stop the parking spaces in the second half of March due to lockdown imposed after the outbreak of Covid-19. The smart city body had fixed the parking rate at Rs 10 per hour for four-wheelers and Rs 5 per hour for two-wheelers. The contractor has spent Rs 25 crore on the parking project. Earlier, apart from extension in the contract period, the contractor had also sought the smart city company for a waiver on royalty to the civic body. The private agency concerned had to pay royalty of Rs 17.5 lakh per month to the civic body. During a board meeting of the smart city held in July, the board of directors had turned down the demand of the contractor for waiver of royalty, but gave a 15-month extension in the contract period. Thereafter, the NMSCDCL had asked the contractor to start the pay-and-park at all the 22 parking spaces from the first half of August, but it did not happen. On the contrary, the contractor urged the smart city company to at least extend the contract period up to three years instead of only 15 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-smart-city-pay-and-park-project-gets-delayed-again/articleshow/86972556.cms||Tushar Pawar

In his complaint, Sanjay Shah, chairman of DBS Realty Pvt Ltd, told the police that he decided to launch a project at Kamlapura village in Waghodiya along with one of the accused Kamlesh Shah, who was an administrator of a large parcel of land owned jointly by 11 people, after the stakeholder evinced interest in the project. A new company was established in Vadodara with Sanjay and three owners Rehmatullah Marediya, Johar Marediya and Ajay Shah as directors of the company. As the project needed huge funds, a Mumbai-based company was made 50% shareholder in the project and its two representatives Divyang Mishra and Chandeshwar Parthi were also made directors in the company. Police said that five accused – Mishra, Parthi, Rehmatullah, Johar and Kamlesh – hatched a plan to make financial gains through illegal means. Going by their plan, the five held a meeting of directors on paper and using stamp paper and forged documents, made a a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the owners. According to the MoU, the company had to give the land back to the owners and the price and other charges were also tampered. “Due to the forgery and the subsequent MoU by keeping the shareholders in dark, the company had to face huge financial losses,” said a police official. Kamlesh has been detained and the police are in process of nabbing other four too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/4-directors-booked-for-cheating-realtor/articleshow/86974780.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Few takers for RTC’s festive special buses||VIJAYAWADA: With poor response from passengers, the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) has downsized its festival special services. Though the APSRTC planned to operate 4,000 special services to clear the Dasara rush that started October 8, the special services operated for only one day. Officials are now expecting the rush only from Thursday, presuming that people may have planned their travel for the weekend as the festival falls on a Friday. The APSRTC has been operating 345 regular services on the Hyderabad route. Preparations were made to run as many as 1,383 buses on the route this year. As educational institutions declared holidays from October 9, the APSRTC anticipated a festive rush from October 8 evening and accordingly planned services. However, contrary to expectations, the occupancy ratio was recorded at 80% even for regular services, leading to withdrawing the plans of special services on subsequent days. Executive director for operations, K S Brahmananda Reddy, said they did not operate special services after observing the traffic. “We are expecting demand to pick up from Thursday as the festival falls on Friday, followed by the weekend. The advanced reservation trend also suggests huge demand on October 14,” he said. The Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC), which is running special services to Andhra Pradesh, is yet to start plying its services. The TSRTC has announced it will collect the regular fare, even for special services. Brahmananda Reddy said the price reduction by TSRTC has no impact on bookings as they are yet to start operating the buses, apart from regular services. He added that the reduction of ticket price for special services of TSRTC buses will not have any impact on APSRTC services, observing that during peak demand, passenger priority will be getting a seat, not the fare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/few-takers-for-rtcs-festive-special-buses/articleshow/86976537.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Devotees face long walks from parking lots, queues||KOLHAPUR: The long walk from the car parking lots to the Chhatrapati Shivaji chowk, where the online darshan passes are checked, and further to the Mahalaxmi temple has been inconveniencing the devotees. The system, however, is unlikely to change soon. Visitors to the Mahalaxmi temple are demanding that the online pass checking counter be shifted to a different location. Vasanti Kulkarni, a devotee from Belagavi, said, “The police asked us to park our vehicle at Shivaji stadium and from there we walked barefoot, in this heat, for almost 1 km to reach the online pass checking booth and then further to the temple. The walking distance is too long. The administration could have arranged for a bus or an electric vehicle facility to drop the visitors to the temple.” Another devotee, Ankita Chougale, said, “There is no parking facility at Chhatrapati Shivaji chowk. My bike was towed by a traffic crane for parking near the online checking counter. I had to pay a fine of Rs 300. Walking from the pass checking counter to the Mahalaxmi temple, that too in a zigzag queue, is an exhausting task.” The district administration has ruled out any possibility of moving the locations stating that a long queue is there to maintain social distancing. As the number of devotees has increased to 1,500 per hour, the darshan line sometimes reaches the Gujari chowk area. The number of visitors will only increase towards the end of the Navaratra festival. Therefore, the online pass checking counter at Chhatrapati Shivaji chowk can’t be shifted now. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the seventh day of Navaratra, the idol of Goddesses Mahalaxmi was showcased in the ‘Indrani Matrika’ form, where the goddess was shown sitting on an elephant. The prayer was performed by the temple priests Soham Munishwar, Sukrut Munishwar and Vidyadhar Munishwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/devotees-face-long-walks-from-parking-lots-queues/articleshow/86972596.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

According to state education department, these teachers have not been relieved of Covid duty. Department says there are around 22,000 teachers in secondary schools but 4,000 are still doing Covid-related work, which has resulted in curriculum loss. A senior official of state education department told TOI, “Attendance is thin as 4,000 teachers are either working at Covid care centres or busy with vaccination drives. We have written to department officials to relieve the teachers as schools have reopened.” It is learnt that a large number of teachers from government-run primary schools have also been deployed on Covid-related work but the exact number is not known. Meanwhile, the number of patients showing up at Covid care centres across the state is declining. Covid care centre, being run at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, hasn’t seen any Covid patient in the past three months. Department said students have returned to school after several months since the outbreak of the pandemic and teachers have this uphill task of making up for the learning loss. Switching from online classes to offline ones, too, is a task. For now, the situation is in control and teachers can be sent back to their respective schools. They can’t be doing Covid duties and taking classes at the same time. Students from rural areas, where internet connectivity was an issue, need special attention. For, they are the ones who have been affected the most due to the pandemic. A majority of them did not have access to smartphones and now they are struggling to write and read. Sohan Singh Mahila, general secretary, state teachers’ association, told TOI, "I don't think that the number of teachers deployed on Covid duty is around 4,000. It should be less as there are hardly any new cases. I don't have the exact figure as most members are busy preparing for association's elections scheduled for next month."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/4k-secondary-class-teachers-unable-to-attend-school-due-to-covid-19-duties/articleshow/86974476.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cut out gender bias in salons, say male beauticians||Mumbai: A couple of months ago, a woman entered Shagun Gupta’s beauty studio at Metro House in south Mumbai, slinked into the chair and demanded: “I want eyebrows like Shilpa Shetty’s.” With the help of a measuring machine, right makeup and matching contours, the woman’s dull eyebrows were lifted and extended till they matched the actress’s seductive eyebrows. The procedure was done under Gupta’s guidance by her male beauticians, including Rakesh Vaghela. This is not the isolated case where male beauticians, hairdressers and makeup artists use their hands and minds to enhance women’s beauty. Cosmetology and beauty business are no longer exclusive domains of the female gender. Female clients have no qualms about handing over their tresses to male hairstylists and face to male beauticians for botox. Therefore, it jarred and left many male beauticians miffed when the news came last week that the Gujarat government had cancelled a recruitment process of beauty and hairdresser professionals because many men had applied for the jobs. “This is discrimination,” said Vaghela. “If men can become chefs, cooks and nurses, why can’t they teach at schools for beauticians and hairdressers? No women whose looks I helped enhance in the last nine years in the field ever complained that they felt uncomfortable with the physical touch.” Gupta asserts that increasingly more men are entering the beauty market and it is unfair to block men from entering an era which is no longer populated alone by females. “Men have a different way of looking at beauty. Except for certain parts, men beauticians work on every part that needs attention,” she explained. Bandra-based hairdresser Savio John Periera said he always wanted to become a hairdresser. “Though I am an engineering graduate and even worked with an airline, my heart was in setting up my own salon. My father initially opposed it as he thought I would end up becoming a hajam (barber), but this is what fascinated me and this is what gives me immense satisfaction,” said Pereira, adding that beauty conscious society has opened up so many jobs for male beauticians too. Makeup artist Cherag Bamboat said: “Many female Bollywood stars have male makeup artists. They are very comfortable working with male beauticians.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cut-out-gender-bias-in-salons-say-male-beauticians/articleshow/86978743.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

The decision was taken by the UP Board of Madrasa Education (UPBME) on Tuesday. These subjects are currently optional, but henceforth, students till the senior secondary level will be taught these subjects on the pattern followed by CBSE. The board also decided to hold the final year examination of Kamil (graduation) and Fazil (postgraduation) students in offline mode from October 25 to October 30. “There was a recurring demand to include modern subjects in the syllabus to fulfill the basic requirements of current times. All students right from the beginning to senior secondary level will be taught these subjects now on CBSE pattern and NCERT books,” said RP Singh, registrar of the newly constituted UP Board of Madrasa Education. The examinations of third year Kamil students and second year Fazil students, about 14,000 to 15,000 in total, will be conducted in offline mode amid Covid protocols, including social distancing, sanitisation and wearing masks.

---||Dehradun||Rebels must realise their mistakes: Rawat||Dehradun: A day after transport minister Yashpal Arya and his MLA son Sanjiv returned to the Congress fold, sparking speculation that more BJP members may follow suit, former CM Harish Rawat on Tuesday said rebels who had tried bringing the party down should realise their sin before making a comeback. Mincing no words, Rawat said the rebels should apoligise as “they had committed a mistake by leaving the party and assure people that they will remain loyal to the party, and work in its favour”. He went on to say, “By apoligising and realising their mistake, they can stop the trend of switching parties before polls.” Rawat, however, said there is no parallel between the situation when Yashpal and Sanjiv quit the party in 2017 and the one when rebels left in 2016. “His issues were different,” said the former CM. When asked if more BJP MLAs will be joining the Congress, he said, “Some BJP legislators are in touch with us. I am not in favour of people changing parties. One needs to see what the BJP has done to the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rebels-must-realise-their-mistakes-rawat/articleshow/86974512.cms||Mohammad Anab

Justice Devan Ramachandran asked the government to respond after considering a petition by a person pointing out that a political flag has been illegally raised in front of his property. A counsel representing the government had told the court that it is on road puramboke. The court said it is irrelevant whether the flag is on private property or on public land if it has been put up without obtaining prior sanction and that putting up a flag in public land illegally would be in violation of Kerala Land Conservancy Act. Asking the government to explain, the court pointed out that flag masts and installations by political parties are very ubiquitous all over the state. Various political entities seem to be installing them as if they do not need any permission to do so, the court said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/high-court-pulls-up-govt-over-flags-in-public-places/articleshow/86976634.cms||---

Every year, the royal family members arrive here in a vintage Maybach and perform the traditional rituals. Last year, due to the Covid outbreak, the celebrations had been called off. Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj, of the Kolhapur royal family, said, “Royal Dasara ritual at the Dasara chowk is famous across the nation and even internationally. Many people from across the state are attracted to the royal celebrations in Kolhapur. Last year, due to the pandemic, the ritual was celebrated in a very low-key manner at the Tulja Bhawani temple at Bhawani mandap. Now, as the Covid count is decreasing and as all the temples in the state have been reopened for devotees, the royal Dasara celebrations will be conducted again at the Dasara chowk ground on Friday evening. All Covid norms will be followed.” “For the Dasara celebrations, the palanquins of goddesses Mahalaxmi and Tulja Bhawani, and Guru Maharaj arrive at the Dasara chowk ground, where the royal family of Kolhapur takes part in the celebrations. The Dasara celebrations are part of the city’s long tradition, history and culture,” added Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj. Before the start of the Navaratra festival, district collector Rahul Rekhawar had issued guidelines for Navaratra and Dasara festivals, which stated that the Dasara celebrations have been called off this year as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/in-kolhapur-royal-celebration-to-returns-to-dasara-chowk/articleshow/86972609.cms||---

People of Uttar Pradesh have rejected their politics of nepotism and corruption,” he said. Singh said that the opposition parties including Congress, SP and BSP are engaging in doing politics over dead bodies. “These leaders are on a political tourism in the state while leaving the Congress ruled states which have become dens of crime, corruption, exploitation against women and Dalits,” he said. Singh said that those who got punished as corrupt and criminals are raising questions on law and order. “Those who encroached the land of farmers, ate ration, subsidies in their name, sold sugar mills, did not even pay the price of sugarcane, are pretending to be farmer friendly,” he said. He said that these leaders are worried about their black money. “People will not bring the opposition parties to power again. People have accepted the leadership of Modi-Yogi who are honest, hard working and work for the welfare of the poor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/people-rejected-sp-rath-yatra-will-not-do-any-good-bjp/articleshow/86978748.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BJP plans campaign blitzkrieg to counter Opposition’s tirade||Lucknow: The BJP is all set to launch a full-blown pre-election campaign blitzkrieg by holding a series of community-based conventions in all 403 assembly seats soon after Dussehra for giving a resounding counter to the incessant tirade of the belligerent opposition, which has been targeting it to thwart its bid of returning to power. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav embarked on ‘Vijay Rath Yatra’ on Tuesday to ‘expose’ the ruling dispensation on governance and development issues while Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been firing salvos at BJP following the arrest of junior home minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish aka ‘Monu Bhaiyya’ in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which two SUVs ploughed through protesting farmers, killing four. Sources said BJP has hammered out the blueprint for rolling out its well-oiled organisational machinery to hold events till January 10, 2020 — just around the time when the election notification is expected to be issued. A senior functinary said the programmes would help the party neutralize the ‘venomous’ and ‘false’ narrative being peddled by the opposition to sabotage BJP’s electoral prospects. Sources said the blitzkrieg would start with the party’s frontal wings of OBCs, youth, women, SC/ST and farmers holding conventions with its various ‘prakoshths’ (organisational cells) also pitching in. The party will also organise conventions for its ‘Panna Pramukhs’ — the grass root functionaries entrusted with the responsibility of marshaling voters. The chain of conventions will be peppered with occasional visits by PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, BJP national president JP Nadda and other top leaders. CM Yogi Adityanath has already charted out a plan to visit all the 80 districts, where the party did not win in 2017 elections, by December 15. Senior leaders said BJP is keeping a track of all the movements and allegations of the opposition and will counter them effectively. SP has planned its ‘Vijay Rath Yatra’ in phases over three months. In each phase, Akhilesh will address public gatherings where he will list the government's failures and paint its rule as suppressive and autocratic.  Rashtriya Lok Dal has also shifted gears with party chief Jayant Chaudhary commencing Jan Ashirwad Yatra to consolidate farmers and Jat voters in the west UP region that encompasses around 125 assembly seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-plans-campaign-blitzkrieg-to-counter-oppositions-tirade/articleshow/86978787.cms||Pankaj Shah

The Telangana Association of United Kingdom (TAUK) celebrated ‘Chenetha’ Bathukamma and Dasara in London. NRIs and Indian community organisations’ representatives from across the UK attended this event. British MPs Virendra Sharma and Seema Malhotra along with Hounslow Mayor Bishnu Bahadur Gurung attended as special guests. TAUK vice-president Shusmuna Reddy said special emphasis was laid on encouraging people to wear handlooms through organising the festivities as this is being promoted by Telangana IT minister KT Rama Rao. Founder of TAUK Anil Kurmachalam said while the events were organised to encourage weavers back home in India and to impress upon the Indian community to wear handlooms this year, the Indian community felt it was also appropriate they thank the NHS and workers. “Without their commitment, coming together with the community to hold celebrations would not have been possible,” he said. At the London Tower Bridge, the artwork which was put up read: “Thank you NHS and key workers.” The Telangana NRI Forum (TeNF) in London also organised Bathukamma and Dasara festivities promoting Telangana arts, including filigree, Siddipet gollabama, Pembarti brass and Nirmal dolls. Rajesh Agarwal, deputy mayor of London, who was the chief guest, applauded the promotion of Indian culture and promotion of the arts. Virendra Sharma, Seema Malhotra and Gurung, who participated in the festivities, lauded the Indian community for keeping alive its traditions and culture, Gampa Venugopal, founder-chairman, TeNF, said. TeNF president Pramod Anthati Goud, while thanking the participants for taking part in the largest Bathukamma festival in Europe, called for the promotion of Telangana arts across Europe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-community-in-uk-celebrates-dasara/articleshow/86976652.cms||---
---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Dawood Ibrahim’s family home to turn into Sanatan school||NAVI MUMBAI: The family home of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim at Mumbake in Ratnagiri district, which has now been purchased by Supreme Court advocate Ajay Srivastava, is likely to be turned into a school. Srivastava (59), who took possession of the house last Friday, says the school will follow “gurukul or madrasa” teaching systems. He said the school will be formed under the Sanatan Dharam Pathshala Trust. “The mansion will now be known as Sri Chitragupta Bhawan. This ideal place will strive to revive gurukul or madrasa culture, wherein children will be imparted with teachings from history,” Srivastava added.  The mansion once served as Dawood’s family holiday home. Dawood’s father, Ibrahim Kaskar, who was an official in the Mumbai crime branch, is said to have built it around 1979-80, when Dawood was fast rising as a criminal. The house now lies in ruins. “People stay away from these properties. The Dawood family used to stay there whenever they came to the village,” said Akbar Duduke, a local resident. The ground-plus-two structure stands on a plot measuring 29,000 square feet. Another land parcel measuring over 27,000 square feet, dotted with alphonso mango trees, is located opposite this. The properties were auctioned by the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act or SAFEMA authorities. “The registration formalities were completed last week, after which I took possession of the properties. The structure will undergo renovation,” said Srivastava. “I was threatened by Chhota Shakeel in 2001 to refrain from making payment after winning the property auction. It’s my constitutional right to participate in a government auction. I am not against any religion,” added the advocate, who had once dug up the pitch at the erstwhile Feroz Shah Kotla ground (now renamed as Arun Jaitley Stadium) in Delhi in 1999 in protest against the India-Pakistan cricket match. Srivastava has also purchased other properties that belonged to Dawood. In connection with one such property, he had even turned up at Dawood’s sister, Haseena Parker’s residence to hand over the court notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-dawoods-family-home-to-turn-into-sanatan-school/articleshow/86978805.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: DoE asks unaided schools not to hike fees for 2021-22||PANAJI: The directorate of education (DoE) has issued a circular asking managements of unaided schools not to hike their fees for the current academic year 2021-22. This is the second consecutive year that the directives are being issued due to the pandemic. “The managements of all unaided primary/secondary/higher secondary schools in the state of Goa are directed to maintain the circular dated August 11, 2021 and not to hike school fees for the current academic year 2021-22,” director of education Bhushan Savaikar has said in a circular. In 2020, DoE had first granted its approval for revised fee structure for unaided schools for the academic year 2020-21. But this saw parents of different schools seeking concessions in view of their income being affected due to the pandemic. This led DoE to issue another circular in July 2020 stating that the fee hike approved in May for unaided schools for 2020-21 has been rolled back. The then director of education Vandana Rao had said that to maintain equality, the government has decided not to permit any fee hike for 2020-21 and to roll back the hike permitted. She said that several complaints were received from parents whose children are studying in unaided schools, and that the directorate discussed the issues with parents and officials of private schools. Following the instructions by DoE, private schools also decided to defer payment of fees for parents on a case-to-case basis. All Goa Government-Recognised Unaided Schools Association (AGGRUSA) had also sought relief from the state government stating that they were rapidly losing enrolment during the pandemic and that smaller private schools were on the verge of closure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/doe-asks-unaided-schools-not-to-hike-fees-for-2021-22/articleshow/86976725.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP assembly polls: Get 30 minority votes from each booth, says BJP||LUCKNOW: With prominent non-BJP parties propping up the symbols of Hindutva in their poll pitch, the BJP has silently launched a campaign to woo minority voters. Unlike previous elections, the BJP workers have been given the target of ensuring support for the party from minority-dominated booths. According to party functionaries, the move is different from previous elections when it remained limited to mere lip service. Party workers up to booth level have been assigned specific targets this time around. As per a rough estimate, out of over 1.63 lakh booths, approximately 50,000 are the ones where minority votes swing results. The presidents of these booths and senior BJP minority cell members have been asked to convince at least 15 voters each from their respective booths to support BJP candidates. Sources told TOI that the directives have been issued by the secretary of UP BJP organization, Sunil Bansal. UP BJP minority cell president Basit Ali, however, claimed that the target to get at least 100 minority votes from each booth has been set this time. “Nearly 30% of the beneficiaries of various schemes, including free ration distribution and houses for all, are from the minority community. The idea is to tap support from these beneficiaries through various outreach programmes,” Ali said. He added that programmes would also be organised to win over intellectuals among Muslims and other minority communities. A senior party leader said earlier the UP BJP minority cell did not have members till booth-level but this time the party has minority cell structure at the grass roots. Of the 50,000 booths identified to be minority-dominated, only 7,000-8,000 booths are yet to be constituted while the remaining have been formed and verified. “This structure formation will help in reaching out to minority youths, women and beneficiaries of the schemes launched by Narendra Modi government at the Centre and Yogi Adityanath government in the state,” Basit Ali said. While the presidents of most of the minority-dominated booths have been identified and entrusted with the target of convincing 15 voters in BJP’s favour, the process to identify senior minority cell members is on. They would also be given the target of ensuring at least 15 votes in favour of the BJP, sources said. Sources said the BJP was making efforts to end the division of votes on the basis of caste and religion. They added that the party was trying to win the support of all, irrespective of caste and religion, in the name of development and public welfare schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/get-30-minority-votes-from-each-booth-bjp/articleshow/86978847.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Pune||Pune: Nal Stop flyover gains pace, MahaMetro eyes Jan finish||PUNE: Regular commuters on Karve Road would be able to use the new flyover at Nal Stop by January if everything goes as planned, Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) said on Tuesday. Work on the flyover had begun in early 2019 as part of the ongoing fully elevated Vanaz-Ramwadi Metro corridor. This will be a two-tier structure, with the Metro train running on the top level (the viaduct) and vehicles on the second deck. MahaMetro said it recently completed constructing the viaduct in this stretch and has shifted its focus to the flyover. The step up in pace comes after Pune Municipal Corporation urged MahaMetro to complete the flyover on priority to ease traffic movement at Nal Stop, which has been hampered for nearly two years. Mayor Muralidhar Mohol said the civic administration has been told to conduct regular reviews of the progress and ensure there were no unnecessary delays. A MahaMetro official said about 50% of the work has been completed on the flyover. “Since the flyover and the Metro viaduct are coming up on the same pillars, we didn’t have to construct separate pillars for the flyover. We have started construction of the arms, which will be followed by the slab. We hope the facility will be ready by January, after which it will be handed over to the civic body,” A MahaMetro official said. The flyover will support uninterrupted bidirectional movement of traffic on Karve Road as the flyover will take the Nal Stop signal out of the equation. The signal will only apply to vehicles that are coming from Law college Road and Mhatre bridge. MahaMetro has barricaded the stretch where the flyover work is under way. Regular commuters said the work should be completed at the earliest to eliminate traffic problems at this key junction, especially during rush hours. Rajesh Sane, who travels on Karve Road daily, said, the barricading occupies a lot more space on the road to enable the flyover work. “There is adequate space for vehicles, but traffic slows down to a craw during rush hours. The work should be completed at the earliest and the road should be maintained properly,” Sane said. Sayali Joshi, a college student, said the road surface has deteriorated during recent rains. “Potholes have developed at Nal Stop chowk and a stretch ahead. The poor road condition further slows down vehicles. Tarring and plugging of potholes should be done on a continuous basis,” Joshi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nal-stop-flyover-gains-pace-mahametro-eyes-jan-finish/articleshow/86976715.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Pune||Pune: Khadki Bazaar road condition worsens due to traffic detour||PUNE: Traffic diversions to enable Metro rail work between Harris Bridge and All Saints Church on the old Pune-Mumbai highway has left a 1.5km stretch in the Khadki Bazaar area riddled with potholes. All vehicles — including heavy containers — going from Pimpri Chinchwad towards CoEP flyover are being diverted via Khadki Bazaar area. “The stretch from Gurdwara Chowk to Holkar Bridge requires immediate repairs,” said Pramod Kumar Singh, chief executive officer of Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB). “MahaMetro had assured us they would maintain the road and repair it if needed,” Singh said. KCB officials said the road was not made to bear many heavy vehicles. “This also causes traffic chaos. Residents of Vishrantwadi, Yerawada, Kalyaninagar, Vimannagar and Kharadi use this road to go to Pimpri Chinchwad. The entire highway traffic that goes to the city also uses this stretch,” an official said. MahaMetro’s general manager (public relations) Hemant Sonawane said they would soon initiate repairs on the stretch. “We couldn’t do so earlier due to rainfall in the past few weeks,” Sonawane said. Another KCB official said the carriageway was also too narrow for daily traffic. “This internal road is very narrow and doesn’t have enough carriageway to accommodate the entire diverted traffic. During peak hours, this leads to jams,” the official said. Heavy vehicles that go to the Ahmednagar highway earlier used to take a diversion from the Central Hatchery crossing on the old Pune-Mumbai highway. However, they too must use the Khadki Bazaar road. “So, the road is often congested, even at midnight,” the official said. Santosh Khare, a resident of the cantonment, said, “Even in a normal situation, the road was chaotic. Now it has become more congested — the commute time has increased by 30 minutes.” Another resident, Satish Sathe, said repairs were the need of the hour. “People often swerve to avoid potholes; this increases the chances of an accident,” Sathe said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/khadki-bazaar-road-condition-worsens-due-to-traffic-detour/articleshow/86976749.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Dehradun||Gave up animal sacrifice, say Doon locals; officials wary||Dehradun: To sensitise locals against animal sacrifice at religious places on the outskirts of the city on Dussehra, district administration is creating awareness through camps, persuading them to give up the practice. Following a PIL filed in 2011, the Nainital HC, had in September, 2012, ordered a ban on animal sacrifice. A similar order was passed by the Delhi HC in 2015. However, it failed to deter locals to do away with the age-old tradition. “The tradition is no longer followed the way it used to be. But there are a few rural pockets, where animal sacrifice still holds significance,” said a senior veterinarian official from district administration. Locals in Nagnath village, where Santla Devi temple is located, believe that sacrificial offerings appease the goddess. “When people’s wishes and prayers are answered, they thank the goddess by sacrificing an animal,” said Subhash Thapa, the village head. Hesitant to speak up, a local on condition of anonymity, said there were a few who performed the ceremony at home, which most villagers said was not true. “It hasn’t happened in years. Not because of the court order but the realisation that the practice is not fair. Now, we only have a small fair and serve meals,” said Vineeta Khatri, a member of village panchayat. Despite locals’ denial, district administration is on alert. Administration, along with officials of Animal Welfare Board and members of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) organised two awareness camps last week at Nagnath village and Kalsi block, urging locals to avoid any such practice. “We interacted with them and made them aware of court’s ruling. In case, anything of the sort happens, offenders will be booked under relevant sections of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,” said Dr SB Pandey, chief veterinarian officer. Rubina Iyer, member, SPCA, said, “We are working on organising a blood camp at Santla Devi temple on Dussehra to keep villagers occupied.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/gave-up-animal-sacrifice-say-doon-locals-officials-wary/articleshow/86974685.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi
---||Pune||Multiplexes across city may reopen in a staggered way||Pune: Multiplexes in the city are likely to reopen in a staggered manner and not all properties may become functional from October 22, the day the Maharashtra government has given them permission to resume operations. The Maharashtra government on Tuesday released standard operating procedures (SOP) on the reopening of multiplexes in the state. One of the new protocols in the SOP is having in place fully vaccinated staffers, which could become a hurdle for some multiplex properties in opening as early as October 22. Prakash Chaphalkar, secretary of the Multiplex Association of India, told TOI, “The 25 multiplexes in Pune and PCMC have already begun preparations to restart operations. They have disinfected the properties and will continue to do so till the reopening and thereafter. Whatever the SOPs mention will be followed.” Chaphalkar, who is also partner in the city-based City Pride Multiplex chains, told TOI that all six branches of City Pride would reopen from October 22. “But we may not immediately open all screens in them, as it is the pre-Diwali period and there may be no major releases till that date,” he said. Neerav Panchamia, chief operating executive of E-Square Leisure Private Limited, told TOI, “Imposing the double vaccination norm for staffers could become a problem and many establishments will have to thus start off with restricted staff numbers. With just 10 days to go for reopening, it will not be an easy task to ensure all the staff are double vaccinated till that time.” Panchamia said since the SOPs also stated that the occupancy of cinemas/theatres/multiplexes would not be more than 50% of their total seating capacity, operations would be commercially unviable for all stakeholders. “But somewhere this would give us a headstart at least,” he said. He sad other aspects of the SOPs were doable, except for the double vaccination clause. “Around 60% of our staff in the properties in Maharashtra are fully vaccinated. The rest of the staffers still have their second dose due dates in the future,” Panchamia said. E-Square may stagger its reopening date by a week to 10 days from October 22, especially because major Bollywood films are likely to be released only around Diwali. E-Square Leisure Private Limited has two owned properties in Pune, operated by Carnival Cinemas, and nine properties across Maharashtra. A source from INOX Leisure Limited said all the five (INOX) properties in the city would open between October 22 and Diwali. A Multiplex Association of India source said, “We had thought that some relaxations would be given to patrons for carrying food inside the cinema hall. But the latest protocols maintain that no food and beverages will be allowed inside the screening areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/multiplexes-across-city-may-reopen-in-a-staggered-way/articleshow/86976763.cms||Neha Madaan

The female students protested holding empty buckets outside the hostel facility. They said they have been experiencing water shortage since the last one week and that it was leading to unhygienic conditions at the hostel. The water supply being received is turbid, affecting around 100 students. Students said they have brought the issue to the notice of the hostel authorities, but the problem has remained unresolved. “Here at the women’s hostel, we have not had sanitary water supply for the past 3-4 days, and it has significantly negatively impacted my health and as well as mental state. I personally have been experiencing nausea, sore throat, and stomach ache. The water coming out is brown from the taps as well as the water purifier,” the complaint written by a student to the hostel authorities reads. The students said that they have been experiencing the shortage on and off since March this year. “There is no clean water here, and hence we are spending a large sum of money on drinking water. I have ISA tomorrow, I have been so focused on how I will manage without clean water. I am unable to study,” wrote the student. Students asked university officials to understand the grave depth of the issue of contaminated water and its impact on students’ health. The students have asked for intervention of the Goa University officials as those incharge of the water supply at the hostel have been unable to address their problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-university-students-protest-water-shortage-at-womens-hostel/articleshow/86976756.cms||---

Around 50 people, including members of the medical fraternity, government officials and common people, participated in the event. President AFoL Dr Sandeep Garg said that arthritis is primarily the disease of joints but with pain and other discomforts this disease affects the entire daily life of an individual. “Everyone should opt for an active lifestyle with regular exercise to prevent it,” he said. Secretary AFoL Dr Sandeep Kapoor said, “Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to relief and pain-free life in arthritis. So consult a doctor if one is suffering from continuous joint pain.” The LDA VC said, “People should make exercise an integral part of living to keep arthritis at bay.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cyclothon-vintage-car-rallies-mark-arthritis-day/articleshow/86978884.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Rajkot||Importing semen from Brazil tough||Rajkot: National Dairy Development Board’s plan to import semen of Brazilian bull is once again facing resistance. Before two years, the proposal was dropped following representation made by indigenous cow breeders who had expressed apprehension that such a move will spoil the Indian breed. NDDB had recently called a meeting where the proposal was once again discussed. “NDDB is mulling the idea to increase milk production. But it will end up spoiling the indigenous breed of cows. If semen from Brazil is introduced in India, it will be a genetic erosion and will destroy purity of India’s original established cattle,” said Ghanshyamji Acharya of Gondal, who is also a member of the National Livestock Mission and was one of the attendees of the meeting. Acharya had vociferously opposed the idea of importing the semen in 2019. According to cow breeders, NDDB should provide technical guidance to Indian cow breeders, purchase bulls from them and do research on various indigenous breeds. Leading breeders of Saurashtra have asked all the breeders associations from across the country to join hands in opposing the move. They are also demanding a national policy against import of frozen semen from European countries. According to them, European breeds cannot survive in Indian climatic conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/importing-semen-from-brazil-tough/articleshow/86974695.cms||---
---||Pune||Rare, tough to spot fungal infection in Covid cured||Pune: After mucormycosis or black fungus, another fungal infection has been detected in four Covid-recovered patients in Pune in the last three months, raising concerns among the health fraternity here. One of the patients, 66-year-old Prabhakar (name changed on request) complained of mild fever and severe lower back pain a month after recovering from Covid-19. He was initially treated conservatively with muscle relaxants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs without relief. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed severe infection-led bone damage to the spinal-discs spaces called spondylodiscitis. A bone biopsy and culture grew aspergillus species — a type of mold (fungus). Medically termed as aspergillus osteomyelitis, the invasive fungal infection is extremely difficult to diagnose as it mimics spinal tuberculosis (TB).This type of fungal infection has so far been detected in mouth cavity of Covid-recovered patients and, in rare cases, in their lungs. “We have diagnosed vertebral osteomyelitis caused by aspergillus fungi species in four Covid-recovered patients in the last three months. Prior to our detection, aspergillus vertebral osteomyelitis had not been documented in post-Covid patients in India,” Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital’s infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag told TOI. The common thread in the four patients diagnosed with the rare condition was that they had severe Covid and were treated steroids to get over the Covid-linked pneumonia and related complications. “Long-term use of corticosteroids may increase the risk of opportunistic infections, depending on the underlying disease being treated and what other drugs are being used,” he said. Prayag had diagnosed the first patient with aspergillus vertebral osteomyelitis three months ago. “We picked up the fourth case this month. All the four patients are still undergoing treatment,” Prayag said. The biggest challenge is to diagnose the condition in time. “Patients present with back pain, fever or sometimes neurological symptoms like difficulty in walking, or tingling and numbness. They often get inappropriately treated for spinal TB,” he said. Infectious disease expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the National Covid Task Force, said, “Aspergillus osteomyelitis is a complication that has been described in immunocompromised patients, including those receiving steroids. Whether Covid itself is a risk factor is unclear as of now and further studies are needed. However, it again reinforces the principle of judiciously using steroids in the management of Covid-19.” On fungal infections targeting the Covid-recovered patients, health experts said a combination of diabetes, Covid and a one-size-fits-all approach to steroid use has caused a surge in invasive fungal infections during the pandemic. Most big hospitals across the country reported invasive fungal infection called mucormycosis, aspergillosis and candida in Covid recovered patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rare-tough-to-spot-fungal-infection-in-covid-cured/articleshow/86976808.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Dehradun||Centre writes to RBI over low circulation of 'visually impaired friendly' coins||Nainital: The Centre has written to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) asking it to ensure that ‘visually impaired friendly’ coins are widely circulated in public after a group of lawyers argued that non-availability of these coins violated rights of blind people under Article 14 of the Constitution. The lawyers had written to the Centre arguing that even though the government issued the notification for these coins in March 2019 and PM Narendra Modi released the series, these coins are available in very limited numbers in the market. In fact, the Rs 20 denomination-coin is so scarce that it is being sold online for nearly 10 times its actual value, said Rohit Dandriyal, one of the advocates who approached the government. The coins, in denomination of Rs 1, Rs 2, Rs 5, Rs 10 and Rs 20, were introduced in March 2019 with several features to help visually impaired people. But they remain in low circulation even two and half years later, said the lawyers in their letter to the Centre. The group also cited Right To Information (RTI) replies received from several banks to show that though they had been supplied these coins by the RBI in the year 2019-20 and 2020-21, they failed to bring them into the market for the common people. The Central Bank of India, according to the letter, failed to circulate nearly half of the Rs 10 coin it received in 2019-20 while the Indian Bank did not circulate any of the Rs 20 coins. “The situation was similar in the next financial year as well when the Indian Bank could circulate only 1% of the Rs 10 coins,” Dandriyal added. A letter was written last week by Rajiv R Singh, deputy secretary (coin) in the ministry of finance to the chief general manager-in-charge of the RBI requesting him to ensure wide circulation of these coins. “These new circulatory coins with inclusive and socially equitable features are minted and supplied to RBI for circulation thereafter. It is therefore requested to RBI to ensure that these visually impaired friendly coins are widely circulated in the public to ensure its availability at ground level,” read the letter dated October 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/centre-writes-to-rbi-over-low-circulation-of-visually-impaired-friendly-coins/articleshow/86974731.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Goa||Goa: Unaided schools oppose education department circular on fees||PANAJI: Unaided schools in the state have raised their objection to the circular issued by the directorate of education (DoE) disallowing private schools from hiking their fees for the academic year 2021-22. The unaided schools’ association has said that the DoE circular goes against the recent Supreme Court judgment on private school fees. “We were surprised to see the circular. Private schools cannot be stopped from effecting their annual fee increase for two years, i.e. 2020-21 and 2021-22. As we are totally dependent on collection of fees from parents and, as we are not getting any aid in any form, the government cannot interfere in the matter,” president of All Goa Government Recognised Unaided Schools Association (AGGRUSA), Vijai Shetti, told TOI. Shetti said the association will be making a representation to the state education secretary and the director of education on Wednesday over the circular. “On October 1, 2021, the Supreme Court passed an order which clearly mentioned that the 15% fee waiver was only for academic year 2020-21 and it does not apply to academic year 2021-22. Also that schools can take necessary legal action against the defaulter parents. The SC order allows schools to bar such students from attending classes or exams, can serve them legal notice of recovery, or file a case against them in the court,” said Shetti. He said that as per the SC order schools can also cooperate with each other by not admitting children unless a full-payment-made certificate is issued from the previous school. “Many parents have still not paid last year’s fee and some of them have admitted their children in other government and aided schools, which is very sad as such parents are defaulters but were given admission by government or aided schools without school leaving or transfer certificate,” said Shetti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unaided-schools-oppose-edu-dept-circular-on-fees/articleshow/86976776.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Sans Covid death cert, only two kids eligible for Rs 2.5k aid||LUCKNOW: Tragedy struck Rajkumari when she lost her husband, Sanjeevan Lal, a daily wage earner, to suspected coronavirus infection earlier this year. While Rajkumari and her five children were trying to come to terms with the harsh reality, rain damaged their makeshift house in Malihabad in September, forcing them to stay on the roadside. As this was not enough, Rajkumari’s eldest child, Pooja (17), is bed-ridden for the last two months with severe typhoid. She had applied for government aid in May but no help has come forth yet. Hit by penury, the children – Pooja, Anit (15), Shivangi (13), Ajit (7) and Ayush (5) – have dropped out of school to take up menial jobs to support their mother. The family is now awaiting government aid and says that it would become tough for them to survive if they do not get help soon. “As per government order, if a family has documentary proof that the breadwinner died of Covid-19, every orphan child will get Rs 4,000 per month financial aid and funding of education up to college level, besides a tablet,” chairperson of women and child welfare department (WCD), Manoj Rai, said. “However, if the head of a family dies due to non-Covid reason or there is no certificate to prove death due to coronaviruss, only two kids per family will get aid. The support to these ‘non-Covid’ victim families will include funding of education till college level and Rs 2,500 per month each to two kids,” he added. “Of nearly 2,500 applications of ‘non-Covid’ orphans received from across UP, about 250 were cleared for immediate financial aid but the government has not sanctioned funds yet. Efforts are on to find a way to help non-Covid families with more than two children,” he said. However, the delay in aid and the two-children norm per family has hit families like that of Rajkumari. Sunita Devi, a homemaker, whose husband Sunit Singh, a small time contractor, died of suspected Covid-19, is living in distress along with her three children. “After officers informed us that only two children will receive government aid, an uncertain future stares at my eldest daughter, Saumya (17), who has to pay fees for admission to BSc course in a private college,” said Sunita, who lives in a rented accommodation in Para. Shashi Pandey, who lost her husband, Vinay, to suspected corona infection, has applied for help under UP Mukhyamantri Bal Vikas Yojana (Samanya) in August for her two children. “I have been running from pillar to post since then but to no avail. I could not pay Rs 40,000 fee for the admission of my daughter, Vanshika, who got a BSc seat in a college. My son, Arjun (15), is a student of class 10,” said Shashi, who lives in a rented accommodation in Shivajipuram. Meanwhile, a few people who have submitted documents certifying that the head of their family died of Covid-19, have also not received aid yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sans-covid-death-cert-only-two-kids-eligible-for-rs-2k-aid/articleshow/86978929.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Delhi||Delhi: 375 body cams for sharper surveillance at Tihar||NEW DELHI: Prison authorities in Delhi have procured 375 body cameras for better surveillance in three prison complexes. On Tuesday, the process to procure the cameras for better jail management came to fruition. “We only had 150 body-worn cameras but now have 375 more. It will help maintain transparency in jail supervision,” a jail officer said. There currently are around 18,000 inmates incarcerated in the 16 jails in Delhi. The Tihar complex alone holds more than 12,000 prisoners. “Most prisoners are lodged in the four bigger jails, that is jails no. 1, 3, 4 and 8/9,” the officer said. “The cameras will be given to warders deployed in the wards of the 16 jails. In every ward, we plan to deploy two-three cameras.” According to the officer, the cameras have good resolution and can record for up to seven hours. “The cameras have a recording system with battery backup of nearly seven hours," the officer disclosed. The officer also explained that though the jails have 7,000 CCTV cameras covering most areas in the three complexes, some portions are still uncovered. It is in these spots that the body cameras will help the jail staff. The officer added that staff conducting checks often face abuse or are even attacked. “The video and audio of such incidents will get recorded and will provide clarity about the person who started the argument while also preventing our staff from being falsely blamed,” the officer said. There have been many instances when prisoners have accused jail officials of beating, abusing and manhandling them. The recent one was the death of gangster Ankit Gujjar in his prison cell, allegedly after being thrashed by jail staff. The cameras will offer digital evidence in such instances. The cameras will also be given to Tamil Nadu Special Police, Indo-Tibetan Border Police and Central Reserve Police Force personnel deployed in the jails. “They provide security at high-risk wards, important prison gates and during checks. They must be given these cameras. It will add to the security arrangements,” the jail officer said. Sandeep Goel, director general (Prisons), told TOI that the prisons were taking steps to ensure safety and security in the three complexes. "Body-worn cameras will bring transparency and will be helpful for security reasons too,” said Goel. “Apart from that, we are also installing three jamming towers in Tihar over the next month and a half.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/375-body-cams-for-sharper-surveillance-at-tihar/articleshow/86978945.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Pune||Pune: Many colleges to wait for order from ministry before restarting||PUNE: Utter confusion reigned on day one of reopening as many colleges chose to remain shut due to lack of orders from the state government and the department of higher education. Fergusson College reopened its gates on Tuesday for students who are fully vaccinated but has decided to shut from Wednesday and continue with online classes till the time orders from the state government as well as Savitribai Phule Pune University is issued. Meanwhile, higher and technical education minister Uday Samant tweeted on Tuesday that a decision on college reopening in the state will be taken in two days. The confusion began after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, also the guardian minister for Pune district, in his review meeting on Covid-19 situation on Friday, permitted reopening of colleges from October 11. However, due to the statewide bandh declared by the MVA on the same day, the reopening was postponed to Tuesday and an order regarding the same was also issued by the Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation on Saturday. But there was no order from the ministry of higher and technical education or from the directorate of higher education giving the go-ahead and the guidelines for reopening. A statement by Savitribai Phule Pune University, to which the majority of the colleges in the district are affiliated to, said, “The current status of vaccination of concerned students, teachers and other staff are being reviewed and colleges are making preparations. In Ahmednagar, Nashik as well as Pune rural areas, discussions are underway with the concerned competent authority regarding permission and preparations are also underway for hostels. Considering the number of students and colleges, further action will be taken as per the instructions from the state government and the directorate of higher education.” Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal of Fergusson College that reopened on Tuesday, said, “We had reopened the college based on the order issued by Pune Municipal Corporation. The response from students on day one was poor. However, we will be closing down the college physically from tomorrow and continue with online education till the time we receive an order from the directorate of higher education regarding the reopening.” Colleges in Pune get many students from outstation and hostels are generally preferred by their parents. Pardeshi said that they are getting many calls from students and parents inquiring about the hostels. “We cannot reopen the hostels without getting an order from the state government about them. We have sharing based rooms and common wash rooms. Hence, till there is a decision on hostels, we cannot reopen them,” he added. Most colleges in the city are preparing for reopening while waiting for instructions from the directorate of higher education and SPPU. Jaya Rajagopalan, principal of St Mira’s College for Girls, said that they were taking this time to prepare for reopening. “We have told students to update their vaccination status and also upload their certificate so that we can cross-verify. Secondly, we are also taking consent letters from them if they are all right with attending offline classes or would like to continue with online classes. We are ensuring that all preparations are done by the time the DHE and the SPPU come out with guidelines for reopening so that we can reopen our college in a phased manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/many-colleges-to-wait-for-order-from-ministry-before-restarting/articleshow/86976839.cms||---

Responding to the query posed to him in D’Sa’s presence after inaugurating a traffic signal at Nuvem, Sawant said, “Babashan will have to take a decision on that. If he wants to contest on BJP ticket, he has to express his wish before the party leadership.” D’Sa was among the 10 Congress legislators who had switched over to BJP in July 2019. Almost all the turncoat MLAs had said that they had joined BJP for the sole purpose of “development” of their constituencies, something which they felt wasn’t possible by staying in the opposition. BJP has negligible presence in Nuvem. D’Sa had also earlier said that most of his supporters were insisting that he contest as an independent in the 2022 polls though he was yet to take any decision in that regard. “Babashan had joined BJP with the objective of bringing development in Nuvem constituency. His objective will be fulfilled shortly as all (proposed) development works in this constituency will soon be completed. Before December 19, all development works in Nuvem will be completed,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-wilfred-should-take-call-on-seeking-bjp-ticket/articleshow/86976819.cms||---

In the case of Rs 2,000 and above, 1.25% is charged from the customer. Many liquor shops owners are collecting extra Rs 5 on every bottle in the district. “Excise officials are not taking any action this as they are accepting bribes from several shop owners”, alleged M Murali, a customer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/15-charge-on-digi-payments-at-liquor-shops/articleshow/86976830.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Lucknow||Yoga & Tharu delicacies to boost Dudhwa ecotourism||Lucknow: If you are planning to visit Dudhwa tiger reserve anytime soon, don’t forget to carry a yoga mat along to rejuvenate and detoxify yourself. The tiger reserve, which will open for tourists from November 1, is set to offer a yoga centre and village tourism facilities to visitors. With focus on boosting ecotourism in the state’s protected areas, many facilities are being upgraded in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. Dudhwa tiger reserve, which is one of the most popular ecotourism spots in the state and draws tourists to see tigers, swamp deer, elephants, rhinos, hundreds of birds and varied wildlife and grasslands, is also set for a revamp. The yoga centre is coming up in an area enclosed by net and barbed wire to secure it from monkeys and other disturbances. A sizable population of Tharu tribals reside inside Dudhwa reserve. Making tourists familiar with the tribe’s culture, food, home, handicrafts and occupation will be another added attraction. Last year, the officers of the reserve had contributed money to let Tharu women cook ‘Tharu thaali’ (Tharu dishes) which had delicacies exclusive to them. “There was not much rush of tourists last year due to the pandemic. This time, we are talking to them (Tharus) to have a permanent arrangement where they also stand to gain out of it,” said director, Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, Sanjay Pathak. “Women might be trained in presentation of food. If we can train 10 of them in presentation skills, it would work. Later, we can give them contract for canteen. There are multiple possibilities,” he said. “The idea is to keep tourists engaged in Dudhwa during daytime as well. Village tourism can go a long way here,” said the director. “It would be a new experience for people who come to forest area seeking a break from the hustle and bustle of urban settings. The administration of the tiger reserve is working to let tourists stay with Tharus in their homes and eat with them,” he said. “All that most of these people would need is a proper toilet. They do not have to change their homes for tourists as kutcha houses are what tourists would like to stay in,” Pathak said. Tourists might be offered the option of staying in original Tharu huts with tribal folks at the time of booking. Those who prefer the option will be allowed to stay in Tharu homes after necessary arrangements are made. Eco-development committees have been set up by the forest department and are represented by local people will be instrumental in speeding up development. Dudhwa has around 66 committees in near-by areas. “We have activated 20 committees, out of which five are in Katarniaghat,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yoga-tharu-delicacies-to-boost-dudhwa-ecotourism/articleshow/86978954.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Pune||Pune: Attractive ‘golu’ displays include traditional and pandemic themes||PUNE: Themes related to the pandemic have inspired golu set-ups in Tamilian households across the city for the second year. Setting up a golu is a tradition in many families during Navaratri, with the dolls and figurines displayed on steps called ‘padi’ being handed down over generations. Each step has a theme, narrating a legend, a typical wedding, village life, gods and goddesses and miniature utensils, and everyday things carved out of soap. An entire cottage industry functions on making these dolls. Families visit each other, neighbours are invited to see the display and women often sing devotional songs together. Jyothi Anand and her daughters, residents of NIBM Road, have set up their golu on goddess Saraswati to highlight a change in education during the pandemic from the classroom to online classes. “My younger daughter completed Std X and the elder one finished school to join college this year, so we felt that it was apt to select the theme of education, the deity of which is Saraswati. The decoration comprises items used for learning such as pencils and books. We also have musical instruments such as the flute and the veena played at our home during auspicious occasions,” she said. A group of women from the community in the area visit each other in the evenings for chanting and to perform rituals during the nine days of the festival, she added. Vaishali Ramachandran, a resident of Baner-Pashan Link Road, has kept in mind the second wave of the pandemic while selecting a subtle theme for her golu. “Many people have faced hardships during the pandemic, which increased during the second wave. So, this year I kept it simple for sensitivity. There is no use of plastic in the decorations and everything has been sourced from around the house itself such as the leaves and so on. The celebration is low-profile and I have only invited a few neighbours over for the haldi-kumkum,” she said. Ramya Vanniyar, a resident of Hadapsar, has set up a golu themed on all things healthy. “The pandemic has made us think about ways to improve our health, physically and mentally. The set-up includes concepts such as foods to eat healthy, sports to stay fit, and so on. We have also represented farmers, who make the food available for the rest of us. We will not be using any sugar or artificial sweeteners. Instead, we will rely on natural, gluten-free ingredients for prasad.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/attractive-golu-displays-include-traditional-pandemic-themes/articleshow/86976920.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The PMC’s immunisation officer, Suryakant Devkar, said they had now sought the vaccination status of students from the colleges. “We need to have the data on students taking the first or the second jab and whether they have got Covishield or Covaxin to avoid any confusion during the drive. We have asked the colleges to submit such relevant information,” he said. Ravindra Binwade, the PMC’s additional commissioner, in a circular on Tuesday asked the colleges to mail the data on students’s vaccination status to punecollegevaccination@gmail.com. He said the special vaccination drive would be conducted under the “vaccine on wheels” initiative. The PCMC commissioner, Rajesh Patil, confirmed they would also be instructing the colleges to send such data to the civic body to organise the special campus vaccination drive. On Tuesday, around 73,628 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district with Covishield and Covaxin doses across over 700 plus vaccination sites. — Piyush Bhusari||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/institutes-told-to-furnish-pupils-vax-status-data/articleshow/86976871.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Questions are being raised as to whether BJP is looking to forge a pre-poll alliance with MGP, however, Dhavalikar said that given the present political situation he does not want any alliance with BJP. When asked if he met Fadnavis to discuss an alliance, Dhavalikar said, “I-PAC’s Prashant Kishor met me, Congress Goa desk incharge Dinesh Gundu Rao met me. BJP functionaries meet me. I had a one-hour-long meeting with TMC’s I-PAC. I meet all of them, and Fadnavis is one of them.” He also said that, as per the MGP party rules, the executive committee’s decision is final. “MGP had committed suicide three times by allying with BJP. Now, no fourth suicide,” he said. When asked if MGP-BJP will have an alliance, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that it would be decided after discussion. In 2007, when MGP joined BJP to topple the chief minister Digambar Kamat-led Congress government, MGP MLAs were disqualified. Later, in 2012, MGP had a pre-poll alliance with BJP and the alliance had won an absolute majority. However, after former CM Manohar Parrikar was elevated as defence minister, MGP had differences with then CM Laxmikant Parsekar and was later dropped from the cabinet. In 2017, after the assembly election results, again MGP supported BJP to form the new coalition government under the leadership of Parrikar, but after his demise, Sawant split MGP. Out of the party’s three MGP MLAs, two joined BJP and Dhavalikar was again dropped from the cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dhavalikar-meets-fadnavis-but-rules-out-tie-up-with-bjp/articleshow/86976916.cms||---

The medicine ward that is running at full capacity and cannot accommodate any more patients, will be the first to shift, followed by the paediatrics, gynaecology wards and OPDs. Health minister Vishwajit Rane last week, while speaking to TOI, had emphasised on the need to shift the functioning from Hospicio to SGDH, and added that it would happen in phases. Authorities are yet to take a decision on whether the Covid-19 casualty at SGDH will continue in future. “As of now, the Covid-19 casualty at SGDH will continue running. Patients can visit to get assessed, collect home isolation kits, check oxygen saturation levels and receive medication, but they will not be admitted in the hospital,” a health official said. The surgery branches will be the last to move into the new building from Hospicio as operation theatres will have to be readied – swabbed and cultures done - before they are used. Shifting of all patients is expected to take a week, but moving the entire Hospicio is expected to take a month. The hospital has old records which it is required to keep for ten years and has to shift its entire MRD section, office, linen department and other equipment. Last year, when the hospital shifted to SGDH, the building was completely empty. This time the hospital is already equipped with a lab that was readied and used for Covid-19, X-ray and ultrasound machines and pharmacy as a result of which the move is expected to be easier than last year. The medicine ward will be the first to shift as it doesn’t require other support service. The TB OPD, STD clinic, testing and counselling for HIV will continue at Hospicio along with a wellness centre. The hospital also planned to bring the district early intervention centre that was moved to Monte back down to Hospicio.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hospicio-to-begin-shifting-operations-to-south-goa-district-hospital-from-today/articleshow/86976891.cms||Lisa Monteiro

But the KCR government has completely neglected this backward district,” Revanth said addressing a huge ‘Vidyarthi Nirudyoga Jung Siren’ public meeting in Amistapur near Mahbubnagar town. Revanth also blamed TRS government for keeping irrigation projects like Jurala, Bima, Nettempadu, Koilsagar, Kalwakurthy, Palamuru-Rangareddy lift irrigation, started by the previous Congress governments, pending, which gave an opportunity to Andhra Pradesh to complain to the Centre terming these projects illegal. “The TRS government did not give jobs but also shut down several existing educational institutions,” Revanth alleged.

---||Dehradun||Cabinet approves increase in salary of UPNL workers, nod to raise in honorarium for ASHA members||Dehradun: In a major respite to ASHA members and Uttarakhand Purva Sainik Kalyan Nigam Limited (UPNL) workers, the Uttarakhand cabinet approved a raise in their monthly salary and honorarium on Tuesday. “The cabinet has decided to raise Rs 1,000 per month as honorarium and Rs 500 as encouragement allowance for ASHA workers. Therefore, they will get a minimum amount of Rs 6,500 per month,” said agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal. At present, the ASHA workers are getting an honorarium of around Rs 5,000 per month. The ASHA workers had been protesting for a raise in their pay for months. For UPNL workers, the cabinet has agreed upon creating two slabs. “The first slab would be created for workers with zero-to-10-year experience. Their salary would be raised by Rs 2,000 per month. Under the second slab created for employees with 10 or more years of experience, a raise of Rs 3,000 per month has been okayed,” said Uniyal. Additionally, to ensure that the UPNL workers are given a raise each year, the cabinet has directed the finance department to prepare a mechanism. “We will act according to a mechanism developed by the finance department. This will help UPNL workers get a raise each year,” he added. Meanwhile, the Pushkar Singh Dhami government increased the honorarium of gram pradhans from Rs 1,500 per month to Rs 3,500 per month on the day. The cabinet also constituted a committee for the procurement and distribution of 3 lakh laptops to students of degree colleges and schools. At present, 1.59 lakh students are enrolled in secondary schools and 1.09 lakh students in state-run degree colleges. “A procurement monitoring committee will look into the finer points of the laptop distribution scheme announced by the chief minister,” added the minister. In another major decision, the cabinet has decided to amend the Motor Vehicle Taxation policy. The amendment aims to increase the permit rate for commercial vehicles entering Uttarakhand. “We will study the taxation policy of Uttar Pradesh and adopt it in the hill state. It has been witnessed that the rates being charged on entry of commercial vehicles in Uttarakhand are far less than what is charged in other states. The cabinet has also approved the minimum support price for paddy procurement at Rs 1,940 per quintal for common variety and Rs 1,960 per quintal for Grade A variety. It was also decided that the capacity of Almora-based Someshwar Hospital will be increased from 30 to 100 beds. After the cabinet meeting, the ministers also discussed the issue of restructuring the fee format of Haldwani and Dehradun medical colleges. “The matter will be taken up in the next cabinet. On the lines of other medical colleges, we are planning to provide respite in fee structure to those medical students of Dehradun Medical College and Haldwani Medical College who are willing to fill the bond to serve in the state after completion of the course. After going through the details, the matter will be taken up in the next cabinet meeting,” added Uniyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cabinet-approves-increase-in-salary-of-upnl-workers-nod-to-raise-in-honorarium-for-asha-members/articleshow/86974826.cms||Kautilya Singh

But during the shardiya navratra of 1858, a relay of 101 cannon balls roared in the premises of the base of East India Company in the capital of Nawabs of Avadh. Every single blow from the Falconet that echoed from the scarred remains of the British Residency was a guard of honour to divinity Durga as she graced the ritualistic puja that followed her akaal bodhan (unscheduled arrival) to the earth. The puja was hosted by Kali Charan Chattopadhyay, a believer who left his roots to come and work in the Royal Court of Avadh under the rule of King Nasiruddin Haider. He was among the few men who ran the affairs at the Tara Wali Kothi. He continued to do his work at the Tara Wali Kothi even as the state of Avadh came under the influence of the British. The Protected remains of the Lucknow Residency Being an employee of the rulers, Kali Babu, as he was commonly known, was tagged as a traitor by the natives who also announced a prize of Rs 5,000 on his head during the war of 1857. Fearing for life, Kali Babu went underground and resurfaced only when the crisis settled down. However, by now, he felt that he could no longer work with the British. In lieu of the offer, he asked the British officers to let him hold the Durga Puja at British Residency. The permission was granted, and the puja was organised. The modern Lucknow owes the culture of sarbojanin durga puja to this incident. The Lucknow Pustakmala Series titled Lucknow Ka Bang Samaj vividly describes the episode of the Durga Puja at residency. “The Durga Puja at Residency Lucknow was noteworthy in several ways. Since an idol of the goddess could not be established, a painting made by a foreign artist was used for the ritualistic ceremonies. Kalicharan Babu himself donned the role of the priest and 101 cannon shells were fired in celebration. The Zamindars, Taluqdars and British officers were invited in the festivities,” wrote the author Madhavi Bandhopadhye. She also noted that people of the city were left in an awe with the incident of British rulers – who were on one hand oppressive towards the locals – had a special place for the Bengali community which was proved by the fact that they not only allowed him to hold the puja but also reverently participated in it. It may be interesting to note that what the British did was nothing unusual to the British as sahabs and meim sahabs attending durga puja in Kolkata was common. An evidence of British same exists in the form of a water colour painting by William Princep made sometime in the decade between 1830s and 1840s. A prized possession of the British Library London the painting depicts Europeans being entertained by dancers and musicians in a splendid Indian house in Calcutta during Durga puja. (See pic) Kalibabu is believed to have played an instrumental role in the establishment of the Kali Bari Temple in the city. The founder Dakshinaranjan Mukhopadhayay – the first Bengali taluqdar of Lucknow – who formed a consortium of Bengali community and roped in Kailash Chandra Chatterjee (who worked in the Military Accounts) who helped in acquiring the land from Military Municipal Committee Lucknow for the temple trust. “On August 18, 1864, the Military Municipal Committee passed a resolution (number 104) and granted plot number 312 in Ghashiyari Mandi to Bengali Community for the installation of a temple of Goddess Kali and for carrying out religious and other charitable activities. The custody of land was taken on September 2, 1864 while the temple was established thereafter,” informs Abhijeet Sarkar, incumbent president of the Temple Trust. In due course of time, the temple became the epicentre of modern education and scores of charitable activities in Lucknow – a culture it nurtures even today.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/101-cannons-roared-for-ma-at-residency/articleshow/86979002.cms||Shailvee Sharda

BAC on Tuesday finalised the business for the session that will commence from October 18. There has been no demand from the opposition for a long session. The government has decided not to reintroduce the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarni Bill, which means that the next government will get the bill. TOI had first reported that the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarni Bill will not be reintroduced in the assembly. Speaker Rajesh Patnekar said that they have received 77 starred questions and 221 unstarred ones, which will be the last one of this assembly. The state government said that they will introduce three government bills. Legislative affairs minister Mauvin Godinho said that it was a very cordial meeting and that everyone was on the same page. “I think everybody is thinking of the forthcoming elections even though it is not declared,” he said. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said this assembly session is just for namesake. Fatorda MLA and GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that the government has decided that the opposition cannot do anything. “I want a 10-day session, but today at the BAC meeting you cannot demand more than a day’s session. You can only go by the business that would be transacted in the session,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/2-day-session-last-before-polls-may-not-have-much-biz/articleshow/86976951.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi Police arrest real-life Bunty & Babli from Agra||NEW DELHI: A seemingly wealthy and indulgent couple visited a south Delhi realtor at Lajpat Nagar on October 6 to purchase a new flat. They introduced themselves as Mehek Jain and Aarav Jain. Hoping to clinch a deal, the realtor sent the couple to see some flats he had in his inventory. He put them in his car, told his assistant to accompany them and sent them on their way. Soon after, Mehek started vomiting and asked the assistant for some water. As he stepped out of the car, the engine revved and the vehicle was soon a speck on the road. The realtor approached the cops. It emerged that a similar case had been reported in Jaipur too. Police set off in pursuit and finally arrested the couple in Agra. Police said the arrested Aarav Jain is actually Kashim Khan, a welder from Jagdishpura in Agra. He fell in love with Mehek from Civil Lines in the city, but their romance took the path trodden by the infamous American couple immortalised in the film Bonnie and Clyde and the fictional Bunty Aur Babli of Bollywood. Duping people was how they financed an adventurous lifestyle. “The incident was reported on October 6 and we registered a case,” said Esha Pandey, DCP (South-East). She added that during surveillance the cops discovered that the duo was staying at a hotel in Paharganj. “A police team visited the hotel and collected the identity details of the accused. They also got Mehek’s mobile phone number and put it under surveillance.” Tracing the location of the mobile phone, it was found active in Agra. Immediately, police teams raided the location and arrested the accused from Kamla Nagar in Agra. The car stolen from Lajpat Nagar was recovered from their possession. “One more car stolen from Rajasthan was also recovered from them,” the DCP said. Police said Khan and Mehek were in a live-in relationship. “They wanted to live a lavish lifestyle but they did not have big earnings,” an officer said. So, police said, they took to stealing cars to earn quick money. “Accused Khan changed his identity to Aarav Jain to avoid being traced. After they had duped the property dealer of his car on October 6, they were searching for customers for the stolen vehicle, but were apprehended by the cops,” the officer said. Police said they did not have any previous criminal record in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-luck-ran-out-for-real-life-bunty-babli/articleshow/86978996.cms||---

The report would be sent to the passenger’s registered mobile number after 24 hours of taking the sample. The sample would be tested at AIIMS, Rishikesh. “Char Dham yatra is receiving a positive response but at the same time, we are leaving no stone unturned to ensure all the Covid protocols are being followed,” said chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami here on Tuesday. The CM also announced that a sum of Rs 40 crore had been transferred as an incentive to 33,297 anganwadi workers through direct benefit transfer. An incentive amount of Rs 12,000 has been given to each anganwadi worker for service during the Covid pandemic. The step was taken after the workers had strongly raised the issue and CM Dhami had assured them to look into the matter. Dhami said, “Anganwadi members risked their lives during Covid-19. They are being rewarded for commendable work during the Covid phase.” The CM claimed that in his 100-day tenure, over 300 decisions relating to public welfare had been taken and soon, a major decision would be taken for the anganwadi workers. “We are making constant efforts to ensure that our schemes and policies reach the remotest locations of the Himalayan state,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/free-covid-test-centre-opens-at-rishikesh-bus-terminal-for-char-dham-pilgrims/articleshow/86974901.cms||Kautilya Singh

Footfall on the first two days has been better than expected, most Bengali cultural associations said. From Old City to Hi-Tec City, Hyderabad is host to close to a 100 pujas. “We don’t have any stalls this year, but we had about 700 visitors on Shashthi (Monday). Our volunteers help maintain Covid-19 protocols,” said Sumit Sen, general secretary of the Hyderabad Bangalee Samity. Abhijit Bhattacharya, vice-president of Bangiya Sanskritik Sangha, added, “We are more relaxed this year, but we’re not allowing more than 25 at a time for darshan. We have lots of food stalls, but the static crowd isn’t more than 200. It’s a continuous flow of people, staying for a while and leaving.” At the Utsab Cultural Association in Gachibowli, joint secretary Indranil Aditya said allotting time slots helped regulate numbers. They have drawn 500 visitors each day, but the ‘pushpanjali’ on Ashtami, Wednesday, may see that number cross 1,000, he said. The association has arranged ‘bhog’, but devotees are not being encouraged to linger after darshan. The ‘pushpanjali’ at the puja organised by Cyberabad Bangali Association is offline as well as online. Popular with techies, the puja drew nearly 5,000 on Shashthi evening and Saptami morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/festivities-caution-unite-as-crowds-return-to-durga-puja/articleshow/86977011.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Traditional performances in Ram’s city fading away||Ayodhya: While the glitzy Ramleela at Laxman Qila powered by tinsel town and techno lights is grabbing millions of eyeballs worldwide, silence looms over Ayodhya’s alleys, which would come alive with traditional Ramleelas enacted by local artistes in the run-up to Dussehra. The decades-old institutions are sinking into oblivion with the Ramleela committees reeling under funds crunch and the pandemic snuffing out key organisers. Bhagwatacharya Smarak Sadan, Rajendra Niwas and Ayodhya Shodh Sansthan were landmark venues, where conventional Ramleelas would once be organised. Elucidating the reasons, Dhanush Dhari Shukla, convener of Ramleela and Durga Puja committee of Ayodhya, said: “Nobody is ready to shoulder expenses of artistes and costumes or conduct painstaking rehearsals, particularly with key organisers dying of Covid-19. This has left the city of Ram with the sole Bollywood-run Ramleela on Saryu banks.” While Rajendra Niwas and Bhagwatacharya Smarak Sadan wear a desolate look, the third venue — Ayodhya Shodh Sansthan — where the government-sponsored Ramleela would be enacted is under construction for the past two years, making it out of bounds. The ambience is vanishing and the enthusiasm of holding Ramleelas in every nook and corner of the holy city is on the wane. While the pandemic wreaked havoc for two years, the change wasn’t overnight. Mahant Jugal Kishor Sharan Shastri, chief priest of Saryu Kunj temple feels the key reason behind the void is the gradual shift towards Durga Puja celebrations at this time of the year. “The traditional rendition of life and times of Lord Rama is losing ground,” he said, hinting at the slow ascent of Shaivism in the seat of Vaishnavas. Ramchandra Tiwari, who once owned a theatre that performed Ramleelas, has an interesting observation. “The popularity of Durga Puja rose with the Ram Temple movement. The reason was simple economics. Organising Durga Puja draws more money and advertising revenue than traditional Ramleelas. Putting up a stage, paying wages to artistes who begin rehearsals months before Dussehra and managing their costumes requires a lot of money. Now, Bollywood is filling this void,” said Tiwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/traditional-performances-in-rams-city-fading-away/articleshow/86979029.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Active Covid cases near all-time low, other viruses show up||PUNE: Covid-19 active cases are inching towards an all-time low in Maharashtra while other types of influenza viruses have started making their presence felt, an indication that the second wave was approaching its end, state disease surveillance officer Pradeep Awate told TOI on Tuesday. “Since we are seeing other types of respiratory viruses in the society currently instead of predominantly SARS-CoV-2, this could be an indication of the second wave approaching its fag end. Other types of respiratory infections are now becoming more apparent, such as influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus,” Awate said. “When a pandemic virus like SARS-CoV-2 spreads and is dominant, it does not let other respiratory viruses dominate,” Awate explained. The health department is regularly surveying severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI), after which this trend was recently witnessed. Maharashtra’s total active cases are also approaching an all-time low mark after May last year. Cases are considered active for 14 days after the symptom onset date. As per a recent analysis by the health department, Maharashtra’s lowest active cases (barring the March to May 2020 period last year) were on February 11, 2021, at 30,265 cases. As of October 12, this number has dropped to 30,525, the second lowest number of active cases after May last year. “We cannot consider active cases in the months of March to May 2020 as being the lowest on technicalities, considering that the first Covid wave had just started then and daily detections were relatively less. Hence, the number of active cases as on February 11 this year are being considered the lowest mark during the both, first and second waves,” he said. The public health department expects the current active cases to drop below the February 11 mark in the next few days, considering an average of over 1,000-3,000 hospital discharges happening per day in Maharashtra. Dr Sanjay Pujari from the ICMR National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid-19 and the director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, told TOI, “When a virus is unable to cause widespread disease because of developing herd immunity in a population, either due to natural infection or vaccine-induced immunity, other viruses circulating in a population will cause proportionately more disease.” Dr Pujari said there were a range of viruses in the human respiratory tract that were competing against one another. “What keeps them from causing infection is the immune response of the host. Going by the sero surveys, if a population is showing a higher immunity against a circulating variant of SARS-CoV-2, other viruses may take over at that point in time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/active-cases-near-all-time-low-other-viruses-show-up/articleshow/86976983.cms||Neha Madaan

However, he said there was no scarcity for coal for power generation in Telangana and there would be no power cuts. “There will not be a single minute power outage in Telangana due to coal short supplies in the country. The state has coal reserves to meet the thermal, power generation for the next 200 years and all thermal power units have been running in the state without any problems. The power utilities have been meeting the demand without any problems,” the minister told the reporters on Tuesday. He said a power circuit was provided around Hyderabad to get supplies from any part of the state. “Even hydel power generation is being continued,” he said. Attacking the BJP government at the Centre, especially referring to the new electricity bill brought by the Centre a few months ago, Jagadish Reddy said the Centre owed an answer to the people on power crisis across the country. He said the BJP government was encroaching upon the state powers on power-related issues, which finally lead to crisis in power sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-power-cuts-in-state-energy-min/articleshow/86977016.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Lawyer accused of misusing charity commissioner’s name||Pune: The Koregaon Park police have registered a case of cheating against a lawyer after a superintendent from the joint charity commissioner’s office lodged a complaint, accusing him of floating a “charity helpline” company and “falsely representing” it as the charity commissioner’s firm. The lawyer told TOI, “I am not aware of such an FIR. I shall be in a position to offer my comments after collecting details of the case.” The lawyer represents a charitable trust owning a prime property on Jangli Maharaj Road. In 2014, the trust had initiated a process before the charity commissioner’s office for its sale. A prominent builder, who had evinced interest in the sale offer, told TOI, “The trust’s lawyer then asked us to deposit Rs3.30 crore in a bank account of the ‘charity helpline’ firm. There was no progress in the sale transaction after we deposited the amount.” The deal failed to come through even after an extension given by the charity commissioner’s office, which later rejected the plea for a second extension. The builder cancelled the deal and sought refund. The lawyer handed him a cheque of Rs5.33 crore (inclusive of interest) with a letter dated February 4, purportedly written by the charity commissioner’s office, towards the refund. The builder said, “We realised that the charity commissioner had passed no order facilitating such refund and on an inquiry with the bank, we found that the helpline firm’s account had been deactivated. We then reported the matter to the charity commissioner’s office.” Joint charity commissioner Sudhir Kumar Bukke told TOI, “We registered the complaint after our officials recorded statements during an inquiry in response to the builder’s complaint that no such letter was issued by our office. The letter is not a part and parcel of our office.” Bukke said, “The lawyer had issued the original cheque to the builder in respect of the property owned by the trust, but the latter has not received the actual amount. A forged covering letter with a copy of the cheque purportedly issued by the superintendent of charity commissioner in Pune was addressed to our head office in Mumbai.” Senior inspector Rajendra Mohite of the Koregaon Park police said, “We shall issue a notice to the lawyer, asking him to join the police investigation. We shall record his statement and take a call on further action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lawyer-accused-of-misusing-charity-commissioners-name/articleshow/86977017.cms||---

Anybody found positive via RAT would be quarantined while negative ones would be allowed to step in. City police, which would extend assistance to NMC teams screening devotees, are also set for a unique experiment this time at Deekshabhoomi to maintain social distancing and manage the anticipated five lakh crowd. With the efforts of city police chief Amitesh Kumar, four cameras with artificial intelligence (AI) are being installed at the entry and exit points of Deekshabhoomi to gauge the footfalls inside the Deekshabhoomi premises during the forthcoming Dharmachakrapravartan diwas. “The cameras would count heads entering and leaving the premises which would help the police to regulate and monitor the crowd. This would be an added technology to help police maintain and monitor social distancing inside,” said Kumar, adding, there would be three-layered security inside Deekshabhoomi. “Deekshabhoomi already has 20 CCTV cameras but an additional 57 would be functional,” said Kumar. Kumar has urged masses to refrain from bringing people aged above 65 and minors to shrines as per the government guidelines. The eight entry and exit points of the city would be screened by the NMC team with police support. “Devotees coming to the city would be screened for vaccine status,” said the CP, adding, use of mask, sanitizers and following social distancing would be strictly enforced in the coming days when Navratri festival would be in top gear and Deekshabhoomi visits too attracting at least five lakhs devotees this year. “Around 2,500 cops would be deployed at Deekshabhoomi where two mobile surveillance vehicles shall be pressed into action too,” he said, adding, even cops on bandobast duty would be individually provided with masks and sanitizers. Kumar said the security bandobast at the Koradi temple is being enhanced from 500 to around 700-750 now with a bigger crowd expected on Ashtami, Navami and Dusshera. “We will also prompt the Zilla Parishad CEO and collector for similar checking of vaccine status at Koradi temple too where the footfalls are expected to swell further,” he said. Though cops have to also deploy around 600 personnel at Dragon Palace for former minister Sulekha Kumbhare’s programme too this week, they are now a relieved lot after the Ravan Dahan at Kasturchand Park has been cancelled as of now. No Ravan Dahan at Kasturchand Park Ravandahan at Kasturchand Park would not be held as the organizer, Sanatan Dharma Yuvak Shangha, stumbled upon a series of permissions that they had to get at the last moment. Though the heritage committee had given the nod, the collector’s office wanted NOCs from other departments too. Prashant Sahni from the group said Ravan Dahan would be now held at Kadbi Chowk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-deploy-six-teams-for-rat-vaccine-check-at-deekshabhoomi/articleshow/86974935.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Mumbai||Poor preschoolers’ virtual attendance declines in Mumbai||MUMBAI: As attendance of higher secondary students in physical classrooms continues to grow a week after reopening, virtual attendance of preschoolers among low-income households in Mumbai and Pune has seen a decline despite high smartphone and internet penetration. A survey on the status of Early Childhood Education (ECE), 18 months into Covid-19, has revealed a drop in virtual enrolment by 30-40%. Around 60% of those who attended regular offline classes pre-pandemic dropped out when it came to online pre-schooling. This even after a structured ‘E-Paathshala’ tech programme was piloted in the surveyed pre-schools by the Rocket Learning NGO between January-June 2021. “Lack of priority within households for education of smaller children on the online platform was a prime reason,” said Nisha Vernekar of Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, an independent think-tank that conducted the study. Parents surveyed were willing to send children to physical pre-schools. The survey found 45% of parents handing over phones to older children for education than to 3-6-year-olds. Fifty-two percent households had less than one device and every three children were sharing two devices. A total of 676 low-income households and 58 pre-school teachers employed in balwadis and pre-schools run by Akanksha Foundation, an NGO, were interviewed between April-June 2021, during the peak of the second wave. While older children studied on their own during online classes, younger ones needed constant monitoring by parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/poor-preschoolers-virtual-attendance-declines-in-mumbai-city/articleshow/86979111.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Fourth century sculpture found in Nalgonda||HYDERABAD: Archaeologists have found a fourth century stone plaque of Mahishasuramardhini of Vishnukundin period in Nalgonda district. The miniature stone plaque of Mahishasuramardhini was reported from the outskirts of Panagal, a temple town in Nalgonda district. E Siva Nagi Reddy, archaeologist, along with D Suryakumar, a Nalgonda-based epigraphist and historian, examined the sculpture in detail. “The plaque was recovered by the farmers of Dandempalli village located on the Panagal-Kattangoor road at a distance of three km from Panagal. They found it some time back while digging a channel for agricultural purpose.  It bears a lot of archaeological and historical significance and represents the Vishnukundin style of art and iconography,” said Nagi Reddy. The plaque carved out of soap stone represents goddess Mahishasuramardhini engaged in slaying the demon Mahishasura in the form of a buffalo. “She is seen trampling the head of the demon with her left hand and twisting its tail and at the same time piercing the trident into its head. The other two arms hold sankhu and chakra. The simple drapery, ornaments and the turban-like headgear clearly reveals the early iconography,” Nagi Reddy said. According to him, a terracotta broken image of Mahishasuramardhini of third century was reported from Veerapuram in Kurnool district and another tiny stone sculpture of the goddess from Keesaragutta. Sriramoju Haragopal, a historian of Kotha Telangana Charitra Brindam, said it belonged to the Vishnukundin period and said that a similar image in a bigger size carved on a boulder was found at Basar temple town. Nagi Reddy said the current find bore a lot of historical significance as it served an indispensable source for the art history of early medieval Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4th-century-sculpture-found-in-nalgonda/articleshow/86977047.cms||---

---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots case: Chargesheet looks like ‘film script’, says Umar Khalid||NEW DELHI: Former JNU student Umar Khalid, arrested under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a northeast Delhi riots case, on Tuesday claimed before a city court that the wish of Delhi Police to “paint every accused with the same brush” crumbled when one saw the chargesheet in FIR 59, which looked like a “film script”. “Do you have the sense of consistency in the chargesheet? No. Did you get statements of witnesses from the group? Where do you get it from? You get it from your mind. Half of it is the fertile imagination of the investigating officer (IO) and scriptwriters of this chargesheet,” senior advocate Trideep Pais submitted before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat during the hearing of Khalid’s bail plea. Khalid’s counsel said there were 17 allegations against Khalid and he would show how they were implausible. Referring to police’s allegations that co-accused Sharjeel Imam created a WhatsApp group on the directions of Khalid, Pais claimed not a single communication or message had been sent by his client. “Being a part of a group is not a crime. There’s not a single witness statement to support that assertion. Opposition to a particular thing can have people from all hues,” said the senior counsel, adding that Imam didn’t seem like a person who would do something on somebody’s dictation. He further submitted, “Ideologically, they are not aligned. They might want to paint me with the same brush, but they don’t have the material to do so… Can we paint these people with one brush? It looks like a film script. It is a bit of a joke.” The counsel said none of the statements of the witnesses showed a conspiracy towards an illegal act in the alleged secret meeting held by the accused persons. “Is chakka jam an offence? Is a meeting to say that our protest will involve chakka jam automatically a criminal conspiracy? Where does it say it’s a crime? This meeting has found itself on every news item, branded as some great conspiracy… None of the witnesses describes the meeting as a secret meeting. The IO forgot while writing the chargesheet that he was not a storyteller, but an officer of the law,” Pais argued. “This is how you want to frame people… How is it constructive? Every assertion has a basis. This doesn’t have a basis,” the senior advocate submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/riot-chargesheet-looks-like-film-script-says-khalid/articleshow/86979113.cms||Usha Das

---||Hyderabad||I am more self-confident now, thanks to writing||I am more self-confident now, thanks to writing By M Charitha At the beginning of the lockdown, I was dismayed, confused and shocked. But gradually I realised that while the lockdown made things quite uncomfortable for many, it also had a lot of positive impacts. It made the environment healthy, gave us a break from our busy schedules and allowed us to spend quality time with our family members and get to know each other better. If I were to pick the one thing that the lockdown helped me inculcate it would be my habit to write. I wrote a lot during that time, and it helped me hone my ability to think while also improving my vocabulary. I also realised that one needs to be passionate to be able to write – it doesn’t come to everyone. And as I wrote more and more it enhanced my self-confidence, speaking skills and interactions with others. Further, apart from attending online classes I also tried to improve my understanding of management and business and even signed up for a course in brand management – aligning business, brand and behaviour. During my leisure time, I indulged in playing card games that I thought enhanced my skills in assessing risks and benefits. I also listened to a lot of music to keep my mind and body at peace and to be calm. Since each of these things has helped me through the lockdown, I hope to be able to continue doing them even in this post-Covid-19 life.

Party leaders and volunteers gathered at Deer Park, with placards and banners expressing opposition to the anti-environmental project. “It is another concoction of the obnoxious desires of state environment minister, Aaditya Thackeray, who has made a habit of treating Mumbai as his personal playground, unbridled by any sense of public responsibility, or environmental welfare,” said the protesting AAP members. Powai lake is home to a rich ecological heritage and a fragile ecosystem, particularly the Indian Marsh Crocodiles, a protected species.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/aaditya-is-childish-for-nod-to-cycle-track-in-mumbai-aap/articleshow/86979202.cms||Vijay Singh

---||Hyderabad||Parking menace chokes city roads, footpaths||Hyderabad: Haphazard parking of vehicles along roads and bylanes, in several areas, is turning into a nightmare for commuters and pedestrians across the city. Even as the traffic police along with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) claim to be imposing penalties and conducting regular drives, a drive through the city reveals that several motorists pay no heed to the rules and park their vehicles not just on the roads but also occupy footpaths showing utter disregard for others’ safety. Tolichowki Circle One such place is the Tolichowki circle. This stretch under the flyover also happens to be the only route for traffic coming from some tourist and residential areas, including Golconda, Seven Tombs, MD Lines and Hakeempet, to reach Rethibowli and Mehdipatnam or towards Gachibowli on the other end. There are also two bus-stops under the Tolichowki flyover due to which commuters have a harrowing time navigating through the busy area. Razia Sultana, who travels daily from Gachibowli to Gulshan Colony at Seven Tombs said, "After getting off the bus at the flyover, I have to take an auto to my house at Gulshan Colony and it is the most difficult task of my day. Just getting off the bus on that road and waiting for an auto feels like a nightmare as there is no place left for people to walk. The entire road is taken over by illegally parked vehicles and street vendors.” Ameerpet At Ameerpet, especially opposite to Elephant House, the entire stretch including the area under the metro pillar is occupied by cars and street vendors. “This road is already narrow. Vehicles and push carts parked in the middle of the road only makes matters worse for commuters to navigate on the stretch that is always congested,” said Gautam Raj, a mobile shop owner at Elephant House. Starting from the temple near Delhi sweet house to the main road after crossing Elephant House, the route is chaotic, especially during peak traffic hours and during festivals despite traffic police stationed near the temple to ensure smooth flow of vehicles. Osmania General Hospital The hospital area is facing severe inconvenience due to its proximity to Begum Bazar, a wholesale market in the city. Those visiting Begum Bazar are seen parking their vehicles haphazardly on the road in front of it. “Not just in front of the hospitals but shoppers often park their vehicles inside the hospital which hampers the movement of ambulances and emergency services,” said Mohammad Ghouse, a medical shop owner near the hospital. To make matters worse, the auto drivers in the area have started using the hospital’s OP building and Quli Qutub Shah building as an auto stand. Chenoy Trade Centre, Park Lane With the parking lots of the busy Park Lane always packed, several people, especially those visiting the Chenoy Trade Centre (CTC), park their vehicles in narrow lanes or on the road obstructing the flow of traffic. “Since it is the go-to destination for gadgets and tech products, the place attracts customers from across the twin cities but does not have adequate parking space. To make matters worse, the road is also occupied street vendors,” said Jagdeesh Kumar, a retail shop owner. It is evident in this area that nearly two decades old market forces have taken over with scant regard for parking space. Similar scenes were witnessed at Jubilee Bus stop area, Borabanda, S R Nagar, Yousufguda, Moosapet, Hussaini Alam, Mahboob Chowk, Motigalli, Khilwat. ‘Please bring violations to our notice’ Incidentally, these parking violations in the city are despite the Town Planning department of GHMC recently removing all encroachments by vehicle owners and street vendors, as they had occupied the road for parking or for keeping their products. When asked for a solution to this recurring problem, Hyderabad traffic ACP P Shanker Yadav said, “In areas where illegal parking is being noticed, we request the public to bring it to the notice of the concerned traffic police station. They will immediately erect a ‘No Parking’ board, monitor the area closely and educate the public by conducting road safety workshops. A fine is also imposed on those violating the rule.” PARKING RULEBOOK DOS AND DON’TS -Do not park any vehicle on the part of a road where traffic is flowing -Do not park in such a place where one does not have a clear view for at least 50 meters in both directions. -Do not park in a place that blocks a vehicle already parked, a sidewalk, crosswalk, pedestrian crossing or road entrance. - Do not park your vehicle on the bus bays or bus stops -Do not park near the public entrance to a hotel, theatre or public hall when it is open to the public. -Do not park near any intersection or a round-about -Do not park the vehicle in unauthorised parking areas. -Park the vehicle on the left side in the direction of the traffic WHEN PULLING OVER TO THE SIDE FOR AN EMERGENCY • Give a signal that you want to pull over and check your mirrors and blind spot to see when the way is clear. • Steer to the side of the road, stopping very close to the curb or edge of the road. • Put on the four-way emergency lights. • Apply handbrakes. BUT DO NOT PARK.. • On a footpath. • Near a traffic crossing, round-about or a turn. • On the main road. • Where your vehicle obstructs traffic. • On the wrong side of the road. • Where parking is prohibited. Several malls, commercial complexes in the city are seen levying a parking fee, in clear violation of prescribed rules. Here’s what the government order on parking fee states: · As per the 2018 order by the Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MAUD), the first 30 minutes of parking at commercial complexes should be free. · From 30 minutes to an hour, a person is exempted from parking fees if they produce a bill of any amount that acts as proof that they have shopped in the respective mall or multiplex. Otherwise, the prescribed parking fee for the duration may be collected. · Above an hour, a person must get free parking if the person produces a bill or movie ticket whose amount is more than the parking fee. · If not, the prescribed parking fee for the said duration must be collected. Parking Ticket Rules · Enforcement, Vigilance and Disaster Management (EVDM) wing of GHMC recently prescribed a format for the parking tickets issued to the customers by malls and multiplexes in the city. · The ticket should have the name and address of the agency along with a mobile number, clearly printed on the tickets. · Parking tickets should be issued even in cases where parking fee is exempted. · If a parking fee is charged, the ticket should be stamped as ‘Paid’ and if exempted, it should be stamped ‘Exempted’. · The ticket format also displays details such as date, vehicle number, serial number, ‘In Time’ & ‘Out Time’, duration of parking, shopping bill amount, besides the signature of in-charge on the front side. · Overleaf, latest parking rules issued by the government in 2018 should be printed. RECENT VIOLATIONS · Last month the Infosys branch at Pocharam on the outskirts of Hyderabad was issued a showcause notice and fined Rs 50,000 by the Pocharam Municipality for allegedly collecting parking fees from its own employees. Parking within office buildings is free under the city’s municipal by-laws. However, the Pocharam branch was collecting Rs 500 per car and Rs 250 to Rs 300 for bikes and scooters from their employees. The showcause notice was issued to Infosys based on a petition filed in the Telangana High Court by Vijay Gopal, a city-based activist. · Earlier this month, the Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) was slapped with a Rs 50,000 fine for collecting parking fees from patients' visitors and attendants. PARKING PENALITIES Offences Section Maximum Penalty Parking of vehicles in such a manner which may pose a risk to other vehicles M.V.Act 122, 177 Rs 200 for two, three, four & six wheelers. Illegal parking on public road at No Parking Boards M.V.Act 122, 177 Rs 1,000 for two, three, four & six wheelers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parking-menace-chokes-city-roads-footpaths/articleshow/86977643.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Steroid overuse infecting joints with implants||HYDERABAD: Heavy use of corticosteroids for treatment of Covid-19 has led to a surge in previously rare side-effect on some patients with implants after joint surgeries. While infection of the periprosthetic joints (implants) has been seen sometimes immediately after surgery, it’s rarely reported years after the operation. Joint replacement surgeons said that they were seeing around 10 such cases each month and attributed it to improper use of corticosteroids during the first wave of the pandemic. “I have seen 16 cases of infections in the last one month, of these 10 are of unexpected nature, meaning unlikely candidates for infection. Except being exposed to Covid-19 and being treated with steroids, they were completely healthy, nondiabetic patients. Also, they did not have a history of lung infections or urinary tract infections, which are likely to cause sepsis (blood infections),” informed Dr Sai Laxman Anne, chief consultant orthopaedic and joint replacement surgeon at KIMS Hospitals. The joints with implants suddenly become infected in some cases as the Covid-19 virus as well as corticosteroids used for treatment decreases immunity. The decreased immunity in turn could lead to bacterial infections which could infect the joints if carried through blood, doctors said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/steroid-overuse-infecting-joints-with-implants/articleshow/86976584.cms||Amrita Didyala

The kingpin of this gang, which used to target victims after scanning their details and grievances on social media, is a BCom dropout. Police said the accused used two applications to make spoof calls. The arrested men have been identified as Anish Khan, the kingpin and a 29-year-old resident of Bulandshahr in UP, and his associates Sahil (23), Vikas Kumar (30), Sandeep Kumar Singh (32) and Harish Tiwari (29). A laptop, seven mobile phones, five ATM cards and a bank passbook have been recovered from them. The forgery came to light when on October 6, a complainant Pooran stated that his credit card was not working and hence, he requested support from the concerned bank through a social media post. “The same day, he received a call from a toll-free number and the caller stated that he was calling regarding the credit card service. As directed by the representative, the complainant followed the instruction, after which an amount of Rs 90,157 was deducted from his credit card. After seeing the message for the amount deduction, the complainant approached the Cyber Cell, Shahdara district and narrated all the facts. A case of cheating was later registered at Farsh Bazar police station,” said a senior officer. Police then analysed the data as provided by the bank and the telecom company, and managed to bust the entire gang. “Their questioning revealed that the gang used to contact on mobile numbers used to lodge complaints with banks on social media. They used to make spoofed calls using ‘X-lite’ and ‘Eyebeam’ apps. They were able to display toll-free numbers of banks on the mobile screen of targeted people. Thereafter, the gang used to transfer the cheated amount to a website—housing.com—and from there, they used to credit the amount in their accounts,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5-dupe-man-of-over-rs90000-by-posing-as-bank-officials/articleshow/86979171.cms||---

Moreover, it is estimated that between 60 to 80 per cent youngsters have already taken both doses of the vaccine. According to the official records of the Telangana medical and health department, 33,200 youngsters in the area have received both first and second doses of Covid-19 vaccines since April. According to Secunderabad Cantonment deputy district medical & health officer Dr H Raj Kumari, awareness of the pandemic and merits of vaccine among youngsters are the key reasons driving high vaccination numbers. “Soon after the Union health ministry opened the vaccination drive to the 18 years and above group, people have actively booked their slots through the app and online. For every 200 persons who come to vaccination centres, over 120 are from the 18 & above group,” Dr Raj Kumari informed. The deputy DMHO said that as per their records, 24,900 from the 45-59 years age group had received their jabs while around 19,500 from the 60 and above group have got their doses during the special vaccination drive in the Cantonment. “The state government’s initiative of mobile vaccine vans has also helped administer doses to senior citizens who cannot move from their homes due to either their age or prolonged illness,” she said. Interestingly, more frontline workers in the Cantonment have received their Covid-19 vaccine than health workers. As many as 3,144 frontline workers have received both the first and second doses of Covid-19 vaccine compared to 1,837 health workers. “While the number of health workers (who have been inoculated) is less compared to other groups, 80 per cent have received the vaccine,” said a health department official. Meanwhile, health staff are conducting tests on those coming in for vaccinations in view of the festive season.  33,200 from the 18-45 group in Secunderabad Cantt have received both first and second doses of Covid-19 vaccines since April.

While 60-65 per cent of the cases are turning up at the orthopaedics desk with complaints of Vitamin D deficiency, 80 per cent are seeking help from neurologists’ over B12 deficiency-induced complications. A sizeable population below the age of 35 are being diagnosed with memory loss and gait disturbances (swaying while walking) owing to vitamins’ deficiency, according to doctors. While these two essential vitamins affect brain, spine, muscle and bone health in a major way, they also can cause permanent damage if they remain deficient for a prolonged period. Vitamin D deficiency is often associated with multiple sclerosis. Its deficiency causes memory disturbances too, but its major harmful impact is osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Patients develop generalised body aches, weakness, joint pains, lower back pain, knee pain, fatigue and muscle pains due to vitamin deficiency. Apart from impacting bones, they also lead to mood alteration, depression, infertility and hormone imbalance. “Around 90 per cent of cases we see in orthopaedic OPD are Vitamin D-deficient. As per the latest research, the ideal time to be in the sun is between 11 am to 2 pm, but a majority of us work in indoor settings,” said Dr Saketh Kolla, consultant joint replacement and regenerative orthopaedic surgeon, Gleneagles Global Hospital. Dr Kolla explained that the fact that Indian skin texture makes conversion of Vitamin D from skin to liver and kidneys six times less, it means that even after one hour of exposure, people can have a deficiency of the vitamin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/young-creaky-city-sees-spurt-in-vitamin-b12-d-deficiencies/articleshow/86976440.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Hyderabad||Even non-vegetarians low on B12||HYDERABAD: Vitamin B12 deficiency is found mostly in vegetarians, but it is now increasingly being seen in people who consume non-vegetarian food too. General physicians and neurologists get between 10-15 such cases each month, hinting at the growing prevalence of the vitamin deficiency among non-vegetarians. B12 is not found in vegetarian food and hence, non-vegetarian food consumption was believed to prevent the deficiency. Most non-vegetarians are taken by surprise when told that they have a Vitamin B12 deficiency. Majority of these people present with nerve irritability, tingling and numbness and sometimes even memory loss. Cases are being seen across age groups, claim doctors. “B12 is a complex vitamin and requires multiple pathways to get absorbed into blood. People with diabetes are often put on metformin, which interferes with absorption. Many with stomach discomfort take PPIs (proton pump inhibitor) or gas tablets for years together. This also interferes with absorption and, even if such people eat non-vegetarian food, they tend to have low levels of the vitamin,” Dr Suma Kandukuri, consultant neurologist, SLG Hospitals, said. In some with inherent genetic disorders, abnormalities prevent absorption of Vitamin B12 and even if they consume it orally, it doesn’t get absorbed. “Factors which adhere to vitamin B12 for better absorption are responsible in some cases. B12 is absorbed through the tongue, stomach and intestine and, if there are factors which inhibit absorption in any of these, there will be a deficiency even if one consumes all food sources of Vitamin B12,” said Dr K Shivaraj, consultant general physician, Kims Hospitals. For such patients, injections are a better option compared to tablets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/even-non-vegetarians-low-on-b12/articleshow/86976503.cms||Amrita Didyala

In 1990, erstwhile Andhra Pradesh had 54 cancer patients per one lakh population but numbers in Telangana and parts of Andhra Pradesh have now risen to 75 cancer patients per one lakh population. “Cancer has been a rising threat with alarming statistics. We must be cautious and concerned, it is estimated that by 2025, there will be 12% rise in cancer cases. It is a matter of concern that the incidence (of cancer) has since risen to 75 per lakh in less than three decades time,” said Telangana governor Dr Tamilisai Soundararajan at the launch of TrueBeam radiotherapy system for advanced cancer treatment at Apollo Hospitals. “In 2020, we saw around 13.25 lakh new cases of cancer in India, with 8.5 lakh deaths due to cancer,” she added. While lung, mouth, oesophagus, stomach and nasopharynx cancers were the most common cancers in men in Telangana and rest of the country, breast, cervix and uterine cancers were the most common cancers in women, according to a recent report from the National Cancer Registry Programme, India. “There is no family in the world off late with someone developing Cancer, many have experienced the pain, which is evident from the statistics of 1 in 8 women in India will have breast cancer,” said Shobana Kamineni, executive vice chairperson of Apollo Hospitals. While Telangana’s average is better than the national average of 95 patients per 1 lakh population, experts cautioned that cases might increase over next few years. “Improper diet, sedentary lifestyle, higher levels of stress, smoking, drinking and obesity in general and in women the impact of late marriages and late childbearing predisposes them to cancers. We are seeing a drastic increase and the numbers are expected to increase exponentially in the coming years,” said Dr P Raghu Ram, director, KIMS-Ushalakshmi Centre for Breast Diseases. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR), Bengaluru recently pointed at a sharp increase in India’s cancer cases, estimating that it could further increase by 12 per cent over the next five years. “Cancer is preventable with modifications in lifestyle and diet. Adopting regular exercise and early detection can nip the disease in formation stage,” said Dr Chinnababu Sunkavalli from Grace Cancer Foundation.

PWD executive engineer Janardhan Bhanuse confirmed that the demand to continue the CCC at MLA Hostel was turned down. The PWD needs the MLA Hostel to make arrangements ahead of the winter session of the legislature which is likely to start from December 15. Traditionally, the agency had been taking up annual repairs and maintenance works two months ahead of the winter session. Last year, the PWD had taken back possession and carried out all works but the winter session was called off in Nagpur due to scare of the UK strain of Covid. As of now, only one patient is admitted at the MLA CCC. The 37 persons who tested positive in the last 10 days have either been shifted to a private hospital or AIIMS Nagpur. NMC has still not stopped institutional quarantine of asymptomatic patients. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said they have been shifting new patients to the civic-hospital IGR at Gandhi Nagar and AIIMS Nagpur. “We have Vanamati, Law College Hostel and the VNIT hostel. We need to check which of them are suitable for patients. Among these options, MLA Hostel was more preferred because of its central location and facilities. Otherwise, new patients would be kept in hospitals,” he said. Since August 25, the NMC had restarted the measure and admitted eligible asymptomatic positive patients at MLA Hostel where it is running a Covid care centre. The patients are tested on the 10th day of the infection and allowed to go home only if they test negative. So far, none of the patients since August 25 had to stay back for more than 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ahead-of-winter-session-mla-hostel-ccc-likely-to-be-shut/articleshow/86975062.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Nagpur||Lessons learnt, teachers adapt faster to hybrid classroom model||Nagpur: As city schools enter their second week of physical reopening, lessons learnt in the previous academic sessions are helping teachers adapt faster to the new hybrid style of teaching. Hybrid, because it is mandatory to conduct online classes for those who prefer to study from home. All schools have adopted the live webcast model, wherein the video feed from a physical classroom is relayed through a mobile phone or laptop camera. This hybrid model mandate was also necessitated by the fact that only 50% of the enrolled students can be called back to classrooms on any given day. Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh) principal Ashnarayan Tiwari said, “In Nagpur we were slightly fortunate as compared to Mumbai, because our schools were operating in physical mode for almost four months before being shut down in the last week of March this year. That classroom experience taught us many things and that’s why we have made a smooth transition this time.” Things like where the teacher must stand while teaching have now become very important. Usually, it’s common for teachers to move around the blackboard and sometimes even traverse the length and breadth of the classroom while teaching, but that’s a strict no-no in online classes. Bhola High School principal Premlata Tiwari said, “If teachers move, they won’t be visible to those attending online. Movement has to be limited, so as to ensure that the teacher is always in the viewfinder’s range.” Former Bengali High School principal Madhu Joseph, who continues to be involved there, said, “Teachers now have to speak louder because audio clarity must be maintained for students attending online. One of the reasons for having to speak loudly is that teachers have to wear masks and this alters their voice level while teaching. These are all things we have learnt from past experiences, and we now find ourselves better equipped to handle them.” Nagpur zilla parishad’s kendra pramukh Kishore Game, who supervises around a dozen schools, said adoption of technology is faster in the younger generation. “For those of our age, it may seem that learning in this hybrid model is uncomfortable but that’s not how the kids look at it. They are extremely comfortable with technology and can also cope with the glitches better as they are able to fill in the blanks at crucial stages,” said Game. He however claimed that every student wanted to be back in classroom. “Their parents are not giving consent so that’s the reason many are still at home,” Game added. Raosaheb Thawre School principal Ashok Gavhankar said, “Right now, physical school is a novelty for kids. They are meeting their friends in the physical sphere after a long time, so it will take a few weeks for this exuberance to settle down.” It’s not as if everything’s hunky dory for students, and teachers accept that it will take some time to adjust. Gavhankar added, “Students’ attention span has decreased because in online classes they could just switch off the camera and wander off. But in classroom, there’s no option but to sit straight. Also, ban on physical activities like sports and assemblies in school are having a psychological impact.” As the number of Covid-19 cases declines steadily, academics hope that the government grants permission for all classes to reopen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lessons-learnt-teachers-adapt-faster-to-hybrid-classroom-model/articleshow/86975077.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Lucknow||Banda: From parched land to a water positive district||The paucity of water in Bundelkhand and subsequent suffering of human race has been the harsh reality of people in the region for long. But this cannot be said for Banda where community and administration joined hands for the cause of water conservation under the Kuan Talab Bachao Abhiyan started in 2019. Most of the handpumps, ponds, and wells in the district were dysfunctional while the community connect to preserve and maintain the shared resource had been lost. Also, groundwater level in the district kept fluctuating with season. The shortage added to water woes of the people who were clueless about their fate as they had no understanding of the problem. Also, the knowledge and sensitivity towards water conservation among people led to household stress, low commercial productivity and overall impaired societal growth. At this juncture, pressure groups knocked the doors of the district administration which was also suffering due to water crisis. In the quest for solution, it was decided that the gap between service providers and community members must be bridged by re-establishing the bond of people with their water bodies. A structured tool of water budgeting using Jal Chaupal model towards democratization of water developed by WaterAid India, an international not for profit organization, was included for use under the campaign by the district administration. In Phase-1 of the campaign, Bhujal Badhao Peyajal Bachao Abhiyaan, which was conducted from January to March 2019, at least 34,732 people participated in Jal Chaupal in 469 gram panchayats directly were made aware about their water budget (demand and supply), rates of groundwater depletion of various strata and changes in rainfall patterns observed by community over last 20 years. This also triggered community action towards shramdaan. To ensure its success, we adopted a collaborative approach and prioritized mass ownership as the fundamental strength, starting off by creating a formal district-level water committee comprising key officials from all water related departments, civil society members and technical water experts. As a result of the one-month long campaign, 2,605 contour trenches have been constructed by community members around 260 wells and 2183 hand pumps across eight blocks and 470 gram panchayats in Banda. These contour trenches have created additional 110001 cubic metres per annum. The efforts were scaled up in the second phase. Success of the phase-1 of the campaign was showcased to people which had a ripple effect. Launched from April-November in 2019 as ‘Kuan Taalab Jiao Abhiyaan’ (Bring life back to ponds and wells campaign), the second phase of the campaign showed startling outcomes, including record increase in the average water table of Banda (increased by 1.34m across Banda) by December 2020, which solved the drinking water crisis of the region. Its impact also showed up in the form of an increment of 18.5% in the agricultural productivity of the place which improved the income generation of local population. Increased groundwater level also impacts climate change with higher water recharge, base-flow, and increased evapo-transpiration under dry conditions and high temperatures. This resulted in better rain cycle. Also, disputes around water used to create law and order challenge in the region but better availability led to a decline on this count. The achievements invited recognition and accolades which reinforced the message. The campaign initiative received awards nationally and internationally including Smart Cities India Awards (2019), Habitat for Humanity India Innovation and Impact Award (2019), Limca Books of Records, Rajat Ki Boonden National Water Award (2020), Elets National Water Innovation Awards (2020), and Jal Prahri Award, among others. The biggest take away from the Banda model of water conservation is its ease of replicability that rests on the fact that empowering communities can do magic.

The cards earlier had embedded chips, but there have been issues with reading the information coded into the chip and adequate number of chip reader machines were also not available with both Delhi Traffic Police and the enforcement wing of the transport department. The QR code-based smart card will enable unification in linking and validating one’s information to smart cards with Sarathi and Vahan, the two web-based databases of all driving licences and vehicle registrations, it said. The department will allow two specific materials for manufacturing these cards — polyvinyl chloride or PVC, or polycarbonate that is slightly more expensive but also more durable. An October 2018 notification of the Union road transport and highways ministry had made changes to both. The new smart card-based DLs and RCs will have chip-based or QR code-based recognition system. At the same time, documents such as DL or RC in electronic formats on DigiLockers and mParivahan were also made valid in place of physical documents and treated at par with original documents. The department said the QR code also had an added advantage of acting as a safety feature on the smart card. The department will be able to retain records and penalties of the DL holder up to 10 years on the Vahan database as soon as a driver or owner’s smart card is confiscated. The new DLs will also help the government in maintaining records of differently-abled drivers, any modifications made to the vehicles, emission standards and the person’s declaration to donate organs etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/qr-code-based-dls-and-rcs-for-more-info-greater-safety/articleshow/86979180.cms||---

A decision to this effect was taken by senior Congress leaders who met here to discuss the strategy for the bypolls. They appointed four to nine-member teams led by an MLA or MLC as incharge and coordinator to each of the five mandals in Huzurabad constituency to lead and coordinate the election campaign. “The TRS has failed to deliver several of its promises in the last seven years. KCR has gone back on several promises. How will BJP seek votes when they are breaking the back of middle class sections by increasing fuel and LPG rates,” said Mahesh Kumar. MLA Seethakka was made incharge and N Rajender Reddy as chief coordinator for the seven-member team for Kamalapur mandal. Former minister and legislator D Sridhar Babu was appointed incharge and former MLA Ch Vijayarama Rao chief coordinator of eight-member team for Jammikunta mandal and town. TPCC working president and Sangareddy MLA T Jagga Reddy was named incharge and ex-MLC K Prem Sagar Rao chief coordinator for eight-member team for Huzurabad mandal and town. MLC T Jeevan Reddy was appointed incharge for Veenavanka mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-appoints-incharges-for-5-mandals-in-huzurabad/articleshow/86977175.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Battleground Huzurabad: 42 in bypoll fray, 19 nominations nixed over errors||HYDERABAD: Sixty-one candidates filed their nominations for entering the electoral fray from Huzurabad constituency, but 19 nominations were rejected by the poll authorities, thanks to several mistakes in the nomination papers. Despite being brought to the notice of the candidates, the mistakes remained not rectified, while some provided information which did not tally with the electoral rolls. Returning officer (RO) Ch Ravinder Reddy listed all the mistakes, errors and non-compliance against the names of those whose nominations were rejected. Among those whose nomination papers have been rejected include three namesakes of former minister and BJP candidate Eatala Rajender. With the rejection of 19 nominations, the rest of the nominations of 42 have been described as valid. The bypolls will be held on October 30. In the instance of Sharagundla Manyam who entered the fray as an independent, names of all 10 proposers did not tally with electoral rolls. The nomination of Buchireddi Abbadi was rejected and it was pointed out that he did not take the affirmation/oath. “The candidate did not submit the prescribed affidavit sworn before an oath commissioner or a first class magistrate or before a notary in spite of being reminded,” the RO said. In the nomination of Kay Rajeshvarir of Indian Praja Congress party, he filled in details of the recognised political party but was not nominated by it. Taher Kamal Khundmiri of AIMIM provided the names of only electors as proposers instead of the required 10. It was found that in most of the nominations, the ‘oath/affirmation’ was not made by the candidates in spite of notices issued to them. There was also an instance where the names of 10 proposers did not tally with the electoral rolls. This was in the case of Eppalapelli Rajendar of All India BC, OBC Party. The nominations of two other Rajendars were also rejected. The similarity of their names with that of Eatala caught everyone’s attention but their nominations did not pass the muster. Essampally Rajendar of New India Party filed his nomination but there were no signatures of the 10 proposers in the nomination papers. Similarly, Emmadi Rajendar, who filed his nomination as a candidate of the Republic Party of India, did not submit the required affidavit in form-26 despite being issued a notice. All the 10 proposers did not sign in part-II of the nomination set, the RO said. Despite filing two nomination sets, the papers of Ande Swamy were rejected after scrutiny because of having only nine proposers and in another one, details of a proposer did not tally with the electoral rolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/16-nominations-rejected-officials-cite-mistakes/articleshow/86977206.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||Eatala Rajender implicating Balka Suman in false case, TRS tells ECI||HYDERABAD: Alleging that BJP candidate Eatala Rajender was trying to implicate TRS MLA Balka Suman in a fake criminal case and resorting to propaganda against TRS apart from violating the model code of conduct, the TRS urged the ECI to initiate action against him. In the complaint to ECI, TRS general secretary Bharat Soma said Rajender tried to implicate Suman in a car-auto accident at Bhimpally-Uppal crossroads in Kamalapur in which the auto driver had died. The car was driven by one Gundepu Tirupathi, who was later arrested. “Neither the car driver nor the victim have any political affiliation. But Rajender resorted to maligning TRS MLA Suman and tried to implicate him,” the TRS general secretary said. The party asked ECI to direct the police to register a criminal case against BJP candidate and impose restrictions on Rajender to prevent him from making false allegations against Suman. In another complaint, TRS said Rajender made false complaints against TRS to create hate among Huzurabad voters. “The BJP nominee said TRS was going to distribute Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 to each voter and was going to give 2 kg meat and Rs 2,000 on the eve of Dasara,” the TRS general secretary said. In a separate complaint, the party alleged BJP workers attempted to murder TRS worker and TRSV leader Nampally Jagan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-implicating-suman-in-false-case-trs-tells-eci/articleshow/86977180.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Dialysis @Rs500-Rs600 to continue, decides NMC||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will continue to facilitate dialysis for kidney patients at the concessional rate of Rs500-Rs600 for six more months. In view of the upcoming municipal elections, BJP-ruled civic body has reportedly rejected the proposal of the administration to increase the charges. The NMC standing committee, headed by Prakash Bhoyar, met on Tuesday and approved the proposal to facilitate dialysis at six private hospitals — Ashwini Dialysis and Kidney Centre, Nephron Kidney Hospital, Bhavani Multispeciality Hospital, Shravan Kidney Institute, Lata Mangeshkar Hospital and Midas Multispeciality — and bear 50% cost. “Dialysis costs around Rs3,000-Rs5,000 in private hospitals. Under the NMC project, patients have to pay Rs500 in case of seronegative and Rs600 in seropositive at private hospitals. Equal amount is being shared by the NMC. This project is being implemented for the last 10 years,” said Bhoyar. “New expression of interest (EoI) was invited in which rates of Rs600 in case of seronegative and Rs700 in seropositive cases were decided. The standing committee has directed to continue with the existing rates for six months. New EoI will be issued thereafter,” he said. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “Over 7,000 patients are taking advantage of the NMC scheme in a year. The patient or relative has to go to NMC’s Mahal Diagnostic Centre where he/she is issued a letter for availing the benefit of the concessional rate dialysis scheme. We are ensuring all equipment, expert doctors and staff for the treatment from private hospitals.” The project was launched on January 16, 2012, in association with Ashwini Dialysis and Kidney Centre in Ramdaspeth. As per suggestion of the Union minister Nitin Gadkari, the project was launched by the then standing committee chairman Sandip Joshi. At that time, the patient was being charged Rs150 and Rs500 was borne by the NMC. In another decision, the standing panel gave powers to municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and concerned officials to take a final call on ending the long-pending legal tussle with Signpost India Pvt Ltd (cartel outdoor). Bhoyar said, “Only instruction from the committee is to take the decision in larger interest of the NMC. There should be no financial loss to the civic body.” The committee also approved work order of Rs92.5 lakh to a private agency for conducting survey to identify new places for hoardings, to study scope for improvement in the existing billboards, suggest offset value of the hoardings, unearth illegal billboards etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dialysis-rs500-rs600-to-continue-decides-nmc/articleshow/86975178.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Kanpur||SP chief Akhilesh Yadav launches Vijay Yatra, aims Uttar Pradesh reconstruction||KANPUR: Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav sounded the bugle for the 2022 state assembly elections by launching the ‘Samajwadi Vijay Yatra’ from Jajmau Ganga bridge here on Tuesday. Khanjachi Nath, born in Jhinjhak in Kanpur Dehat at the time of demonetisation, flagged off the yatra. “This yatra is for saving the ‘Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb' (syncretic fusion of Hindu-Muslim cultures)and ‘navnirman’ (re-construction) of the state. Uttar Pradesh has to be taken on the path of development. This ‘tehzeeb’ is our identity. This journey is to strengthen the people of all religions to live with love and this Vijay Rath will run from Ganga to Yamuna,” he said. “Going by the sea of people and their enthusiasm, it seems that in 2022, Samajwadi Party government will be formed in the state. The BJP government will not come again. Baba, Bull and Bulldozer will all go,” he said. He said that Samajwadi Vijay Rath Yatra, which has come out for the rights and respect of farmers, youth, in its first phase will criss-cross through four districts — Kanpur City, Kanpur Dehat, Hamirpur and Jalaun. Addressing a public meeting organised near Neyveli Lignite power house in Ghatampur, Akhilesh Yadav said that corruption prevails in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule. “Black money did not come back, inflation did not stop. The prices of petrol, diesel, cooking gas and fertilizers, pesticides skyrocketed. Farmers, poor, and youth are all sad. This government is snatching the rights of the poor. Employment prospects have been shattered,” said Akhilesh further. He said the BJP government is engaged in selling national assets. “They (BJP) are also doing a conspiracy to abolish reservation,” he said further. SP national president said that if the Samajwadi government is formed, electricity can also be given to the farmers for free. Irrigation will be free. Akhilesh said, “For the convenience of the public, the SP government had started ambulance service 108, 102, and 100 dial services were started for the prevention of crime and 1090 for women’s safety, they will be further expanded.” “We will win more than 400 seats,” he said and added , “Victory will be of farmers, youth, traders, backwards, dalits and minorities.” Before the start of Rath Yatra in Kanpur, Akhilesh said that this state belongs to the farmers, but the farmers are most humiliated and suffering here. “They were told that the income would be doubled but that too was taken away. Paddy is standing, and farmers are yet to get its price,” he said. He further said farmers were crushed by vehicles at Lakhimpur Kheri. “If BJP is not removed, it will crush the Constitution under tyres,” he said. On being questioned over the beginning of Vijay Rath Yatra from Kanpur, Akhilesh said that Kanpur is an industrial city. “Industry has been ruined under BJP rule. People are suffering from BJP’s mis-governance, injustice, and atrocities. Uttar Pradesh has been betrayed by BJP. The farmer is humiliated. Youth’s job, employment has been snatched away, inflation has increased. That’s why the socialists are going to the people in Vijay Rath, so that the Bharatiya Janata Party is thrown out of power from Uttar Pradesh,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/akhilesh-launches-vijay-yatra-aims-up-reconstruction/articleshow/86979242.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||IPC Section 376E permits death for second conviction: Maharashtra on Shakti Mills gangrapes||MUMBAI: At a death confirmation hearing for three men convicted as repeat offenders in the Shakti Mills gangrape cases of 2013, the state, through its special public prosecutor Deepak Salvi, said that the law amended that year is clear and permits the noose for a “second conviction”. Disagreeing with the interpretation of the law under Section 376E of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which introduced death penalty for a second conviction to a repeat offender of rape as submitted by the convicts’ counsel Yug Chaudhry, Salvi said that only conviction after a conviction is the requirement of law, “sequence and time of the offence is immaterial”. Chaudhry had submitted that the law mandates a prior conviction before the commission of the second offence, for which if convicted, death sentence was contemplated under IPC Section 376 E. It cannot be invoked in a scenario where two crimes have occurred, but tried simultaneously, as in this matter, before the HC, Chaudhry had added. In the hearing before the HC bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and P K Chavan, Salvi, however, referred to and relied on a US court ruling Deal vs United States which had upheld an enhanced punishment for subsequent conviction. The US judgment had said that “present statute does not use the term ‘offence’, and so does not require a criminal act after the first conviction; it merely requires a conviction after the first conviction”. Salvi drew a parallel to language of IPC Section 376E which stipulates: “Whoever has been previously convicted of an offence punishable under Section 376 (rape) ….or Section 376D (gangrape)…and is subsequently convicted of an offence punishable under any of the said sections shall be punished with imprisonment for life which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life, or with death.” A 22-year-old photojournalist was raped in August 2013, at the defunct Shakti Mills compound at Mahalaxmi by five persons, including a minor. A 19-year-old telephone operator too then complained of being gangraped on the same premises. The accused were mostly the same. On March 20, 2014, the sessions judge first held three common accused guilty for the gangrape of the telephone operator and minutes later pronounced them guilty for the gangrape of the photojournalist. The trio was given the death sentence in April 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ipc-section-376e-permits-death-for-second-conviction-maharashtra-state-on-shakti-mills-gangrapes/articleshow/86979300.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Delhi||Coming up: E-cycle docking stations at 80 places in Delhi||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation has completed the tendering process for the installation, maintenance and operation of e-cycle docking stations at 80 locations. It will issue an allotment letter to the concessionaire in the next 60 days for installing the stations at residential areas, parking lots and metro stations and provide solutions for last-mile connectivity soon. The 80 sites were identified after a joint survey carried out by PWD, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and SDMC. The tender had also been published in June but had elicited no bids, forcing SDMC to repeat the process, said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner, remunerative and project cell, SDMC. The project, conceived to encourage use of public transport, was waiting to be implemented for a long time. “Probably due to the Covid pandemic, we did not get responses to the first tender,” said a civic official. “Also, the project needs a big investment because the cost of e-cycles is really high compared with that of the normal cycles. Setting up stations also involves a lot of money.” Some places where these docking stations will come up on priority are Lajpat Nagar, Harkesh Nagar metro station, Greater Kailash I, Rajouri Garden, Green Park, Janakpuri, Hauz Khas, Qutub Minar, AIIMS, Safdarjung, Punjabi Bagh and Tilak Nagar. Unlike cycle stations developed at nine places on the BRT corridor and simultaneously opened for advertisement hoardings, no such facility will be allowed to the concessionaire at these 80 e-bicycle stations. “The concessionaire will earn revenue from user fees,” an official explained. SDMC hopes to earn Rs 4.5 lakh as the monthly rental from these stations. People wanting to use the facility will have to register on SDMC’s app and then hire an e-bike for a maximum of up to 10 hours. The amount will increase at the rate of Rs 10 per hour. Since the docking sites were identified after joint inspection and after analysing the prominent points to provide first and last mile connectivity with public transport, officials said they were expecting no issues when the plan was implemented. The e-cycles are battery-operated, run at a speed of 15-20kmph and have the option of pedals too. “The concessionaire can track the movement and position of e-bicycles via a wireless system that also has real-time monitoring of station occupancy rates,” the official disclosed. At each docking station, 12 bikes can be parked. Spaces for 4-5 other bikes will be kept free at all times to allow people coming from other places in south Delhi to leave the e-bikes. “Based on the response to this facility, we will increase the number of stations,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/coming-up-e-cycle-docking-stns-at-80-places/articleshow/86979225.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Nagpur||School vans and buses face financial doom due to high cost of ‘restarting’ vehicles||NAGPUR: School vans and bus owners say the cost of restarting their operations are so high that only the ones with deep pockets or access to a healthy line of credit can start plying. Putting vehicles back on track means paying costs for repairs, servicing, insurance premiums and taxes which is around Rs 50,000 for a school van and over Rs 1 lakh for a bus. “That kind of money is beyond our means,” said Afsar Khan, president of School Van Owners’ Association. “For the last one year we had either negligible or no income. Our members have lost their vans as creditors took them away. Many of them are now surviving by working as painters or selling vegetables,” he said. For school bus owners, that figure is higher. Samar Jog, member of the School and Staff Bus Owners’ Association, said, “These buses cost around Rs 28 lakh and their upkeep is also quite costly. With zero income since the shutdown earlier this year, we have to think thrice before putting any bus on the road.” Currently, school buses have started plying, but the numbers are very low, said Jog. “In the entire Nagpur district, maybe 25-odd school buses are currently in operation. In pre-Covid era, this figure was around 600. Let that sink in so that everyone can understand what level of crisis we are dealing with,” said Jog. The immediate challenge for both segments of transportation is paying various pending dues before the mandatory fitness certificate is issued. Khan said, “I have members who are earning barely Rs 8,000 per month by selling vegetables and have exhausted their savings. There is no way they can shell out six times that amount just to get their vehicles on road.” Even after vehicles start playing, there are bigger problems said Jog. “Capacity has been curtailed combined with restricted reopening. In the city, only high school is allowed to operate. I had almost eight buses plying this week, with an average of 90 students in it. Is it financially viable to have 10 kids per bus?” asked Jog. Another problem is rising fuel costs. Jog said, “The day (in 2021) lockdown was announced and we stopped our buses, diesel was around Rs 70. Now just seven months later we are restarting and diesel is around Rs 100. So now combine high restarting cost, increased operating costs and 50% reduction in capacity. If this is not a recipe for financial disaster, then what is.” Shortage of trained drivers too is now a reality. “The experienced ones do not want to return to our field because they know schools can be shut down anytime. Their truck driving will continue come what may,” said Jog. Khan said the government can help out by waiving taxes and increasing their fitness test validity. “We have written to everyone, right from the CM to the collector. Since our vehicles were stopped from plying by the government itself, they should increase our fitness validity and also waive applicable taxes till 2022 at least. Such a small support will at least help us to restart our vehicles,” said Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/school-vans-and-buses-face-financial-doom-due-to-high-cost-of-restarting-vehicles/articleshow/86975204.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

He urged the state government and the district administration to allow students from Kasaragod to enter Dakshina Kannada with vaccine certificates and thermal scanning at check posts. “Thousands of students from Kasaragod visit Dakshina Kannada regularly for education purposes. The Karnataka government also has been encouraging students from border districts. Many poor students from Kasaragod depend on colleges in Dakshina Kannada. As per current guidelines, only those who have RT-PCR negative reports are allowed to enter Dakshina Kannada. Since the number of Covid-19 cases is reducing, the district administration should consider allowing students from Kasaragod based on their vaccine status and body temperature,” Ramesh urged. Referring to a recent interaction with students and parents from Manjeshwara taluk in Kasaragod district, Ramesh said many students have complained of pain in the eyes and headache after undergoing RT-PCR tests frequently. They are forced to go to PHCs every week to undergo RT-PCR test, he said adding he has mailed the request to chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, state chief secretary P Ravikumar, minister S Angara, Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel and deputy commissioner KV Rajendra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/exempt-kasaragod-students-from-rt-pcr-test-rule-syndicate-member/articleshow/86975237.cms||---

The accused duo had allegedly demanded Rs36,000 bribe, in the name of PSO of Lathi police station, from a former illicit liquor seller to allow him to continue his illegal activities. Sources informed that the complainant is a resident of Podsa village in Gondpipri tehsil and was earlier involved in illegal liquor business when prohibition was in force in the district. He, however, quit the business and was focusing on farming after the liquor ban was lifted. Constable Ratankar had time and again conducted search at his house accusing him of being involved in the illegal liquor business. Ratankar was allegedly prompting him to continue with the liquor business and sought Rs18,000 per month as bribe for police station officer and himself to allow him to continue the liquor business. He demanded Rs36,000 ‘hafta’ for two months. The complainant paid Rs6,500, but lodged a complaint with ACB Chandrapur. Based on the complaint, ACB DySP Avinash Bhambre laid a trap and caught API Paradkar and constable Ratankar while taking the bribe amount. An offence against both the accused has been registered at Lathi police station, where they used to work, under relevant sections of the anti-corruption law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chanda-api-constable-caught-taking-bribe/articleshow/86973080.cms||Mazhar Ali

Chairperson Shantaram Kolvenkar said the motion moved against vice-chairperson Virendra Dhavlikar was passed by 7-0 votes as the opposition members were absent. Archana Dangui, councillor from Shantinagar ward who was a signatory to the motion also remained absent during the special meeting held to discuss and vote on the no-trust. Eight councillors of the 15-member body, including Archana Dangui, Chandrakala Naik, Venkatesh Naik, Seema Fernandes, Shantaram Kolvenkar, Jaya Sawant, Amina Naik and Geetali Talaulikar had served the notice against Dhavlikar on September 4. Kolvenkar informed that they have forwarded the motion to DMA to decide over the outcome of the meeting. The BJP-led Ponda Nagrik Samiti had rewarded Virendra Dhavlikar with the post of PMC deputy chairperson on October 21 last. Orally it was decided that he would vacate the chair in six months and allow other colleagues an opportunity to become the vice-chairperson. However, he did not vacate the chair for about a year, following which the motion was moved. Dhavlikar had joined BJP-backed Ponda Nagrik Samiti on October 2 after defecting from MGP’s Rising Ponda panel. He was instrumental in ousting councillor Amina Naik by a margin of 8-4 votes on October 13, 2020, from the deputy chairman’s post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/municipal-admin-to-decide-on-ponda-civic-bodys-deputy/articleshow/86977453.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh to push apparel sector to meet export target||LUCKNOW: To increase UP’s exports to Rs 3 lakh crore within the next five years, the state government has identified apparels as a crucial sector which has a massive potential for growth. In a study carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers at the behest of Invest UP, it was found that due to differences in tariff regulations among various countries, India in general and UP in particular, is losing out to countries like Bangladesh, Turkey, and Cambodia. A slew of measures have been proposed to increase UP’s presence in apparel export. These include attempts to renegotiate trade deals with USA, UK, European Union, Canada and Australia. “When several foreign companies were shifting base out of China during Covid pandemic in 2020, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath saw a growth opportunity and proposed improvement in UP’s exports,” he said. “We appointed PWC to study UP’s export pattern in 15 sectors, covering 100 products. A report giving suggestions on way ahead is now ready to help UP’s exports to leapfrog from the current Rs 1.21 lakh crore to Rs 3 lakh crore by 2025-26,” he said. In the apparel sector, for which Gautam Budh Nagar and Kanpur are hubs, PWC has said that there is at least a 10% difference in tariff rates between India and countries like Bangladesh, Turkey, Cambodia etc which make it unfavourable for India to compete with these countries. Due to unfavourable tariff structures, UP loses out to Turkey, UK and Italy, which impose no tariff in export of house coats and similar synthetic fibre clothes to countries like Germany and UK. Similarly, UP’s export of cotton T-shirts to countries like USA, Germany, UK, France and Spain loses out to exports from Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Bangladesh, Turkey, Portugal etc, which have zero tariff. PWC has proposed infrastructural interventions in Gautam Budh Nagar and Kanpur. The measures include setting up of an apparel park in Gautam Budh Nagar, common facility centres, laboratories by testing agencies, design labs and apparel manufacturing training centres, raw material depots and sourcing hubs. “UP already has a ‘Handloom, Powerloom, Silk, Textile and Garmenting Policy of 2017’ which is being used to provide incentives to manufacturers but needs to be publicised more. We are also looking at technology transfer for upgradation of automation in manufacture of raw material and apparel. There is also a need to encourage manufacturers to diversify,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-push-apparel-sector-to-meet-export-target/articleshow/86979333.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Nagpur||Covaxin for kids can help prevent third wave: Doctor||NAGPUR: More than 70 lakh children in Vidarbha in the age group of 2-18 years are now eligible to get the Covaxin jab, which got emergency use approval from the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) on Tuesday. Nagpur district alone has 11 lakh paediatric population eligible for the vaccine. Right from the beginning, Nagpur has played an important role in human trials of Covaxin. Be it for elders or for kids, Nagpur has been a constant trial site for this fully made-in-India vaccine by Bharat Biotech. Senior paediatrician Dr Vasant Khalatkar, who was the principal investigator for the paediatric trials of Covaxin, said that the trials held in Nagpur showed astonishing results in kids. “It’s a pleasant surprise for me that Covaxin has received the emergency use authorization today. In Nagpur, we have tested it on children in the 2-18 years age group. While the vaccine’s safety has been proved already, the efficacy results are also promising,” said Dr Khalatkar. According to him, vaccine for kids will play a pivotal role in bringing life to normalcy. “Everyone is speaking about the probable third wave, which is expected to hit in November and will target children who are the only unvaccinated population segment now. If we roll out the vaccine for kids, we can definitely avoid a third wave,” Khalatkar added. Academy of Paediatrics (AOP), Nagpur president Dr Vijay Dhote said that the government should allow paediatricians to procure and administer the vaccine. “Parents would prefer to get the jab administered from their family paediatrician, rather than going to some centre. Despite schools now being open, many parents are reluctant to send their wards because they are not vaccinated. So, we need to roll out the vaccine drive for kids at the earliest,” said Dr Dhote. Apart from Covaxin, ZyCOV-D, which is a one-of-a-kind DNA vaccine, has also received the similar approval and may be pushed into use to immunize the younger population even before Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covaxin-for-kids-can-help-prevent-third-wave-doc/articleshow/86975241.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Nagpur||NGT rejects plea against Nagzira tree felling||Nagpur: The western zone bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has rejected interlocutory application (IA) filed by Sachin Rangari, secretary of People For Animal (PFA), Bhandara, against illicit tree felling and mining of murrum inside Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR). The NGT has also cautioned the tiger reserves against use of heavy machinery. Rangari had moved the NGT claiming that in March-April 2020, NNTR deployed heavy machinery in the core area of the reserve for excavation of murrum to lay roads and in the process uprooted several trees. He claimed that digging of the pits for excavation has resulted in huge ecological imbalance and loss of biodiversity. Rangari, who is facing charges of extorting money from Koka RFO by lodging complaint of tree felling inside Koka Wildlife Sanctuary in Bhandara, alleged that JCBs, heavy backhoe loader with two tractors had entered the core area of NNTR for excavating murrum and sand. He alleged that officials chose the Covid lockdown period for the excavation so that none would come to know about it. The work went on for 34 days, he added. The issue was widely reported by national and local media, said Rangari. Following complaints to higher-ups, an inquiry was conducted by additional PCCF (wildlife) East, who gave a clean chit to the officials in his report submitted on June 9, 2020. Following this, Rangari moved the NGT and on November 9, 2020 the tribunal ordered constitution of a joint inspection committee. The committee submitted its report on January 21, 2021. In point-by-point answers, the committee said the works were carried out as per the management plan of Nagzira sanctuary approved by the chief wildlife warden on April 1, 2011. On the contrary, the respondent-forest department had admitted that machinery was used for carrying out excavation of murrum sand, repairs of the roads, and to desilt water bodies. The road repair works are done annually and are essential for regular patrolling. On the allegation of uprooting and removal of trees, it has been found that many trees were uprooted and broken as a result of strong winds and torrential rains on May 31, 2020, said the committee. Delivering its order on October 4, 2021, NGT rejected the PFA leader’s application. However, before concluding the case, the NGT judicial member M Sathyanarayanan, and expert member Dr Arun Kumar Verma advised the forest department against use of heavy machinery such as JCB. “Use of JCBs may be avoided as far as possible, though there is nothing wrong in adopting modern technology, but it should not become a routine feature while carrying out such activities. The PCCF (wildlife) must exhibit objective application of mind to need-based requirements and in the event of the requirement, shall take into consideration all relevant aspects and circumstances from the point of view of environment and ecology and shall pass appropriate orders on the use of the said machinery on case to case basis,” said the NGT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngt-rejects-plea-against-nagzira-tree-felling/articleshow/86975247.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) assistant general manager CB Singh said, “The consignment of fresh vegetables sent to UAE on Tuesday marked the revival of green vegetable export from east UP region after Covid second wave.” Several roundtable meetings were held for activation of international flights stuck due to Covid-19, he said adding that now with beginning of flight services the APEDA ensured to resume export of agri produces, especially vegetables from this region. Singh said, the cargo flights for exporting goods and perishable items were available either from Lucknow or Delhi only when international flights were not available from Varanasi in view of Covid-19 and sending consignments via Lucknow and Delhi will increase the cost of transportation. Initially, APEDA focussed on farm producer organisations of Varanasi only but now the produces are being sourced from FPOs in Bhadohi and Prayagraj, he said. From these FPOs, 1MT of fresh okra and 1MT of other vegetables including bitter guard, pointed guard, elephant foot and others were procured and sent by a flight of Air India Express, he added. The agri-export was jolted after the international flights became non-operational, said APEDA officials. As soon as the flight started, APEDA coordinated the shipment, they said adding that APEDA has also started coordinating with exporters for more consignments.  Singh said, till now around 1,000MT of fresh fruits and vegetables and around 10,000 MT regional rice of east UP has been exported. The measures initiated by APEDA led to exploration of new export destinations including Bangladesh, Vietnam and Iran after Dubai and London. The APEDA also ensured exploring the markets in Gulf and London for fresh Banarasi Langda, Dussehri, Chausa and Ramkeda mangoes in 2020. A consignment of 80 MT of black rice produced by farmers of Chandauli was also exported to Australia followed by another consignment sent to Doha (Qatar).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/agri-products-export-resumes-from-east-up/articleshow/86977397.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Now, admissions have touched 202 and the school has students from LKG to grade eight. The school is all set to celebrate its centenary year in January 2022. It has received smart classes and other facilities, which are on par with private schools. Civil engineer Santhosh Kumar, an alumnus, has adopted the school and is responsible for the positive development. Headmaster Narayana Poojary SK said, “Due to the mushrooming of private English medium schools, the demand for government schools was shrinking. We went house to house convincing parents to enrol their wards to our school. But that did not work. Hence, we came up with the idea of starting LKG/UKG classes with the help of Santosh Shetty. He even sponsored the appointment of teachers in 2015.” Since then, there has been no looking back for the school. A lot of developments took place in the last six years. The school started a Kannada-English (bilingual) medium classes with help from Santosh and others. Narayana said teachers were appointed on contract basis and gradually admissions increased. This year, the government has officially given permission to start bilingual medium classes and admissions have reached 202 students. Under CSR funds, MRPL has funded new classrooms. “In another two years, we want to have 400 students in our campus,” said Narayana. Santosh Kumar, managing director of Matha Developers Private Limited, who has adopted the school said the school also gave prominence to agriculture and other activities. “Our aim is to prepare children for the society. So, we are imparting other skills along with academics. I want to help the school by inviting experts from various fields every month. The next project is building washrooms,” he said. The school recently received a vermicompost unit. It boasts of solar and smart-class facilities and has an areca garden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/alumnus-csr-funds-help-revival-of-century-old-govt-school/articleshow/86975348.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Kadam, Geete may be left out of Sena Dussehra rally||MUMBAI: As a fallout of the rift between Shiv Sena leaders Ramdas Kadam and state transport minister Anil Parab, the latter may not be invited for the party’s Dussehra rally on Friday. The party is inviting limited functionaries and leaders to Sion’s Shanmukhananda Hall. This year, Sena will hold its annual rally in the hall, with 50% capacity. The party was keen on a physical rally at Shivaji Park but CM Uddhav Thackeray decided to avoid a mega gathering keeping Covid-19 in mind.Over the last month, audio clips of conversations between Kadam and an associate have gone viral. Kadam is heard expressing happiness reportedly after action taken by authorities over an alleged illegal construction on land owned by Parab in Ratnagiri and Mumbai. Kadam is also heard saying he was planning to meet BJP leaders, including Opposition leader Pravin Darekar and former MP Kirit Somaiya. Kadam denied any rift and said it was an attempt to defame him before Thackeray. Kadam is a member of the legislative council from Mumbai. Senior party leaders have said he may not be renominated when his term ends in January 2022. “Ministers, top party functionaries and the mayor of Mumbai will be invited. Kadam may be dropped as it will not be possible to fit all in the hall,” a senior Sena functionary said. Former Union minister and Sena leader Anant Geete, who recently called NCP chief Sharad Pawar a backstabber, may also not be invited. Sena MP Arvind Sawant said, “Around 1,300 people will be allowed. Uddhavji will address sainiks and the state. I’m not aware if Kadam will be invited or not.” Kadam was a cabinet minister in BJP-Sena government, but was sidelined by Maha Vikas Aghadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kadam-geete-may-be-left-out-of-sena-dasara-rally/articleshow/86979432.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Mosquito invasion still on||AHMEDABAD: It’s almost mid-October and the municipal health department is still grappling with mosquito menace in Ahmedabad. The overall mosquito density in the city has not shown much decline. From a density of 3.48 mosquitoes per room in August, the density came down to 1.88 per room in September which has not been a substantial decrease. The density data for the whole of October is being collected. “Mosquito density should be ideally less than 1 per room. Untimely rain in September and early October as well as the erratic ambient temperature helped mosquitoes to proliferate,” says a senior AMC health official. In August, the AMC found highest average mosquito density per room in Gota, Vejalpur, Jodhpur and Ramol areas — between 3.25 and 5.75 mosquitoes per room. When health officials looked for density of deadly Aedes aegypti, they found in August that it had increased in these areas with densities between 1 and 1.75 per room. “We fear that that the Aedes aegypti mosquito density in October has once again risen to August level. In homes, larvae in stagnant water are found in discarded tyres, plastic cans, unattended garden pots, decorative fountains and even fridge defrost trays. Over the past three weeks, we found that unattended spaces in commercial buildings and factory units on the city’s periphery have become perennial outbreak points for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes,” adds the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mosquito-invasion-still-on/articleshow/86975341.cms||---

---||Delhi||Data shows 30% of NTPC capacity left unused in Delhi in last 15 days||NEW DELHI: Data provided by the central government from September 25 to October 10 reportedly shows that Delhi had no shortage of power in the last 15 days, contrary to the warnings of power minister Satyendar Jain and Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd CEO Ganesh Srinivasan. Generation companies reportedly fully met Delhi’s daily power demand, which touched a peak of 5,349MW on October 5. The consumption, too, peaked at 112.4 million units on that day. It was also seen that Delhi’s discoms were utilising only 70% of state-run NTPC’s generation capacity earmarked for the national capital, leaving 30% surplus. The average gap between NTPC’s capacity allocation and drawal by Delhi’s discoms was pegged at 594MW per day during the period. Delhi’s discoms have an allocation of 756MW from the 840MW Unit-1 of Dadri coal-fired thermal station. However, since November 2020, the discoms have not been scheduling power from this station even when the fixed charge is 97 paise per kWh at normative present Energy Charge Rate is 3.20 Rs/kWh, which is far cheaper than power available on the exchanges or other plants. The power station was set up in Delhi’s proximity as a strategic supplier to the capital. Ironically, while Jain and Srinivasan spoke about “intermittent blackouts” and coal shortage, UP government, which has only 10% allocation from Dadri-1, is scheduling power from the plant to meet its requirement. Srinivasan and Jain had in separate statements over the weekend said “intermittent blackouts were imminent” because power plants feeding Delhi had coal for only “a few days”. It later transpired that Tata Power had shut its 4,000MW imported coal-based power station as it was unable to supply power at the tariff mentioned in the power purchase agreement due to international coal prices tripling. While nearly half of the non-pithead domestic coal-fired plants were running low on fuel, it did not threaten generation as inventories were being replenished daily. The situation was aggravated by a 30% reduction in generation by imported coal-fired plants under PPAs due to high international coal prices, while domestic coal-based power supply had gone up nearly 24% in the first half. The imported coal-based power plants have generated about 25.6 billion units against a programme of 45.7 billion units. “NTPC is making all efforts to ensure availability of coal at all of its power stations for meeting the power requirement of the country. In the first half of financial year 2021-22, NTPC’s generation growth has been over 21% compared with the same period last year,” NTPC said in its statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/data-shows-30-of-ntpc-capacity-left-unused-in-capital-in-last-15-days/articleshow/86977514.cms||Sanjay Dutta

Officials need to be mentally prepared to provide information as the tendency is to deny it on the pretext of maintaining confidentiality, he said. Officials need to understand that once there is a final decision on any subject, nothing remains confidential as it reaches the public domain, Joshi said while speaking at a Conference on ‘Dissemination of information under Section 4 of the Right to Information Act, 2005’. The conference was organised jointly by Goa State Information Commission and Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development (GIPARD) at Old Goa to commemorate RTI Day. State chief information commissioner Adv Vishwas Satarkar underlined the importance of RTI Act towards building transparency in the governance and said that government departments are required to update their websites regularly so that information can be made available in electronic format for the public to access it. State information commissioner Sanjay Dhavlikar said the Goa State Information Commission is working towards speedy disposal of appeals and complaints pending with the commission. Secretary of information and publicity Ravi Dhawan IAS said the government departments have to play a proactive role in disseminating information under Section 4 of the RTI Act by making information available through digital mode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dissemination-of-info-on-govt-decisions-required-to-maintain-transparency-lokayukta/articleshow/86977780.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Responding to TOI’s query from last week, readers write about their experience with illegal breeders and demand that strict rules be put in place to stop this illegal activity…||Pet was not vaccinated Our pet story that was supposed to be a happy one, ended on a very sad note causing us lots of emotional trauma and loss. Instead of guiding us, these greedy people from a posh pet shop in the city sold a very young puppy without vaccination and without the needed paperwork. Within three-four days the Cocker Spaniel puppy was diagnosed with deadly parvovirus. The incubation period of the virus is 7 to 14 days. That clearly proves that our cute little pup already got the virus in the pet shop. Before buying the pet we clearly mentioned to them that it's our first pet and they should guide us properly. But these pet shops are nothing but business houses without any ethics. Untimely the puppy died, and it caused us a lot of mental trauma. My sensitive daughter took months to recover from the horrific episode. So, beware new pet buyers. After all it's not just about the money but also the sufferings of young animals. – Bakliwal Neha Wasn’t a pure breed I brought a Rottweiler puppy for Rs 30,000. At the time of buying, the puppy was two months old. Within two days of me getting the pup home, it took ill. When I took my pet to the doctor, it was diagnosed with the deadly parvovirus. Doctor said that the animal had a poor immune system and, therefore, the virus had attacked so strongly. He also said that the pup was not a pure Rottweiler breed (4 or 5 generation). I tried my level best to safeguard the puppy from the virus but unfortunately it died after seven days of treatment. So, my suggestion to everyone would be not to buy a pet. Just adopt. -- Ritish Gompa Need strict rules The government should regulate the indiscriminate mushrooming of pet breeders. It has become a big business. It should also totally ban the breeding of foreign dogs as they are not suitable for keeping in small houses/apartments. Strict rules need to be put in place to put an end to such illegal activities. -- Kanchiraju Kasinath||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/responding-to-tois-query-from-last-week-readers-write-about-their-experience-with-illegal-breeders-and-demand-that-strict-rules-be-put-in-place-to-stop-this-illegal-activity/articleshow/86977557.cms||---

---||Nagpur||India’s solar power capacity needs to increase, says study||NAGPUR: India’s total installed solar power capacity would need to increase to 5,630 gigawatt (GW) to achieve net-zero target by 2070. Also, the transition to net-zero could cost India 4.1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2070, says an independent study released on Tuesday by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). At present, the country has 100 gigawatt (GW) of installed renewable energy capacity of which solar comprises 40 GW. The government aims to enhance the clean energy capacity to 450 GW by 2030. The first-of-its-kind study titled ‘Implications of a Net-zero Target for India’s Sectoral Energy Transitions and Climate Policy’ also stated that to achieve net-zero by 2070, usage of coal, especially for power generation, would need to peak by 2040 and drop by 99% between 2040 and 2060. “Consumption of crude oil across sectors would also need to peak by 2050 and fall substantially by 90% between 2050 and 2070,” it added. The analysis further found that green hydrogen could contribute 19% of the total energy needs of the industrial sector. “These insights assume that hydrogen would play an integral part in this transition, while carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology would play a negligible role,” the study stated. According to the experts, the findings of the study are pertinent as the recent report by the inter-governmental panel on climate change (IPCC) underscores the criticality of achieving net-zero globally to limit the total rise in temperatures to 1.5-2 degrees in the coming decades. Even though India is yet to commit to a net-zero target, it is the only G20 country to meet its emission reduction commitments made in the Paris Agreement. Stating that at least a thirty-year gap between peaking and net-zero year would be critical for a developing country like India, Vaibhav Chaturvedi, fellow at CEEW, said, “This will ensure a smooth transition by giving policymakers and other stakeholders sufficient time to plan and adapt to a new energy system. Also, as we move towards a net-zero future, energy prices could rise in the short run and workers that are a part of the fossil-fuel economy could lose jobs. Hence, developed countries should offer generous financial and technological support to the developing ones to help them set ambitious goals regarding emission reduction while ensuring a just transition.” In agreement, CEO of CEEW Arunabha Ghosh said, “Equity must be at the heart of the net-zero debate. Developed economies should significantly advance their target of achieving net-zero and not wait till 2050. This will give developing countries room to pursue a just and sustainable energy transition.” She added that India should also co-invest and co-develop new green technologies in partnership with other countries to create new jobs and markets. “Green hydrogen is one such technology that could replace coal in the industrial sector,” said Ghosh. The study also highlights that electric or battery-driven passenger vehicles would comprise 84% of all cars sold in the country. “79% of all trucks would run on battery-electric technology and rest on hydrogen. Households across the country would also have to use electricity as the primary cooking fuel. The share of wind and nuclear energy in India’s electricity generation mix would have to increase to 1792 GW and 225 GW respectively,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/indias-solar-power-capacityneeds-to-increase-says-study/articleshow/86975472.cms||Manka Behl

According to the commuters and residents who take the route on a regular basis, the issue of debris and road restoration persisted for several days before the officials took stock of the matter recently. “We were being forced to take alternate routes as it was becoming very difficult to drive on the road. A few people were risking accidents due to this problem. I am glad the authorities took notice of the news published and finally cleared the debris,” said Masood Ali Quraishi, a citizen reporter who highlighted the issue. Commuters also said that if complaints regarding removal of construction waste and debris of road restoration are not resolved on a priority basis, it can become a very serious problem, especially during rains. “This should have been done several days ago before someone raised a complaint. We are glad that they took note of it at least now,” said Sameer Baig, a resident of Bazaar Ghat. Meanwhile, M Devanand, GHMC chief engineer (maintenance) said, “All government and private agencies including Transco, HMWSSB and BGL have been told to restore roads soon. A few of them which are being taken up by GHMC are also being completed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/debris-cleared-from-road-near-mallepally-mosque/articleshow/86977652.cms||---

Police investigations have revealed that he was living with his partner Heena alias Mehendi Pethani in Ahmedabad. The special team formed to probe the murder took statements of Dixit’s neighbours in Khodiyarnagar on Tuesday. “We inquired if he was staying at some other place in the city before shifting to the apartment where he murdered Heena.

The cops also collected CCTV footage of the area where he was staying. “His neighbours said that they never heard the couple fighting and they mostly kept to themselves. We will be able to get more details once we get custody of Dixit,” the official added. Dixit was arrested three days ago after he admitted to Gandhinagar police that he had murdered Heena. He had abandoned their child at a gaushala in Gandhinagar and left for Uttar Pradesh. The cops had tracked him down after photos of the child went viral on social media.

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra first to have its own wildlife action plan||NAGPUR: In a significant move, Maharashtra on Tuesday passed its own wildlife action plan for10 years, the first state in the country to do so, and cleared the expansion of the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) by 79 sqkm, equivalent to more than 19,500 football fields. After the expansion, which will be done by relocating Karwa village outside the Kolsa range of Tadoba, TATR’s core area will become 704 sq km, more than Pench (430 sq km) and Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (650 sq km). Tadoba will be elevated to 25th position from 31 among the 52 tiger reserves in the country. The state wildlife action plan (SWAP) focuses on wildlife management activities with a long-term perspective. The state board for wildife meeting discussed plans for a rapid strike force among forest guards and a regulator for the SWAP. 240 families agree to shift to give Tadoba’s tigers spaceBesides the expansion of Tadoba, the state board for wildife (SBWL) on Tuesday approved two reports of the expert committees on human-leopard and human-tiger conflict, which will help in conservation and translocation of tigers from Chandrapur district. It was attended, among others, by CM Uddhav Thackeray and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. Sources said the most debated topic was whether wildlife clearance should be granted to MP Birla’s cement plant in Zari-Zamni taluka in Pandharkawda division in Yavatmal. The plant has got forest clearance for 467.5 hectares. “However, as the forest area falls in the tiger corridors of Tadoba, Kanhargaon and Tipeshwar sanctuaries, a section of members opposed it. The project proponents said they have invested crores to set up the plant and the corridor issue came up at a later stage. An expert committee will pay a visit to the area before taking a final decision,” said a source. The extension of Tadoba by shifting Karwa village, which is in the buffer zone, will be the first case in the country where a village will be relocated with people’s voluntary consent. Till now such relocation has been affected only in core areas of tiger reserves. There are around 240 families in the village, facing difficulties as there is no human habitation up to 15 km. The relocation of Karwa will need around Rs 70-75 crore. It will be a win-win for both tigers and humans. There are over 85 tigers in Tadoba’s core and its adjoining landscape and owing to lack of space, man-animal conflict is at its peak. Over 56 persons have died in the state in the last eight months. Of them, 50 alone have died in Chandrapur (35) and neighboring Gadchiroli (15) district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mumbai-240-families-agree-to-shift-to-give-tadobas-tigers-space/articleshow/86979624.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: Girl alleges rape by father, SP, BSP leaders in Lalitpur||JHANSI: A 17-year-old girl in UP’s Lalitpur district lodged a police complaint on Tuesday against 28 persons, including her father and some Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) functionaries along with some of her close relatives, of raping her for the past several years. Based on her complaint, Lalitpur police have filed a first information report (FIR) against 28 persons, including the father of the girl, SP district president Tilak Yadav, SP city president Rajesh Jain Jojhiya, BSP district president Deepak Ahirwar and others under sections 354 (outraging modesty), 376-D (rape), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), and other sections of the IPC and Section 5/6 of POCSO Act. As per the complaint, the girl has alleged that when she was in class 6, her father tried to lure her into a physical relationship by showing her obscene films but she didn’t oblige. Later, her father bought her new clothes and took her for a ride on a motorbike on the pretext of teaching her how to drive. He took her to a desolated farm and raped her while warning her to keep quiet or he would kill her mother. Days later, he took her to a hotel on the way back from her school after making her eat some snacks, probably laced with sedatives. He handed her over to a woman, who made her sit alone inside a room and left. After sometime a man entered the room while she fell unconscious. When she regained consciousness, her clothes and shoes were not in the proper place and she was feeling a severe stomach ache. Later, all this continued with each time a new man raping her in hotel rooms in an inhuman manner. All along she was asked to keep mum or face dire consequences. She further said in her complaint that after a few days, one Tilak Yadav came and raped her in such an inhuman manner as if he wanted to take some revenge. When she objected, Tilak said that it was her father who had brought her to him and that after a few days her mother is also going to come here. With Tilak, his relatives and friends also raped her continuously. The girl has further alleged that on one such occasion when she had visited her maternal uncle’s house, there too she was raped by four of her uncles along with cousins. She was helped by her grandmother, who tried to hush up the incident. She has also alleged that at one point her uncles had tried to sell her off but could not succeed. SP Lalitpur Nikhil Pathak told TOI on Tuesday: “It is a very sensitive case and we are taking it seriously. The medical examination of the victim has been performed and her statement has also been recorded under section 161. On Wednesday, her statement will be recorded in front of a magistrate under section 164 after which further action will be taken.” “We are interrogating the father of the victim. He is a truck operator and it seems that he was soliciting his minor daughter,” he added. Meanwhile SP district president Tilak Yadav has issued a statement on social media, claiming that he and his brothers were being falsely implicated in the case. Others named in the FIR are Raju Yadav, Mahendra Yadav, Arvind Yadav, Prabodh Tiwari, Sonu Samaiya, Mahendra Dubey, Niraj Tiwari, Mahendra Singhai, Komalkant Singhai, Shayama, Pappu, Munna, Akash, Mahak, Bunty, Neetu, Sharad, Manju and some unknown persons.

---||Hyderabad||MAA elections: 11 members of Prakash Raj panel resign||HYDERABAD: The plot thickens in the Telugu film industry. On Tuesday, 11 members of the Prakash Raj panel decided to quit from posts they were elected to in Sunday’s poll to the Movie Artistes Association (MAA). These include eight executive committee members, one executive vice president, a joint secretary and a vice-president. This follows Prakash Raj’s resignation from the primary membership of MAA on Monday after his loss to Manchu Vishnu for the post of president. “We want to give a free hand to Vishnu and his panel to fulfil all the promises they made. If our panel members are there, they might question things that are happening which may not be in in the interest of the association. We do not want to be seen as an impediment,” said actor Srikanth after quitting from executive vice-president post. Others who spoke said a atmosphere of fear has been created in MAA as witnessed during the polling and counting. They said in such a situation when tempers run high, there was scope for more friction. “There was rowdyism during elections. One of our members was assaulted. We have taken a dignified decision not to be part of the elected body though MAA members showed immense trust and got 11 of us elected. It is in the overall interest of the members themselves that our elected members have decided to quit,” Prakash Raj said, adding that there was also no transparency in the counting of votes. Once again bringing to the fore the issue of local/non-local plank that the election was fought on by the Vishnu panel against him, Prakash Raj said he would withdraw his resignation from the primary membership of Movie Artistes Association on one condition. “Change the by-laws to stipulate that a non-Telugu should not contest polls. It will then be clear to everyone that they cannot aspire to contest if they belong to the association but are not Telugus,” he said. Prakash Raj, however, made it clear that there was no proposal to float a rival association to MAA. “But let Vishnu know this: I will seek a report card every month on the progress of the promises that he made,” Prakash Raj said. Others from Prakash panel also said they would question the Vishnu-led panel from outside the committee as they had a responsibility towards members who had reposed their trust in them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/11-members-of-prakash-raj-panel-resign/articleshow/86975550.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Based on preliminary investigations, police suspect one of the three assailants was the victim’s 20-year-old cousin from Pimpri. Police said the cousin was pursuing the girl for a relationship but she had rejected his advances. Deputy commissioner of police (zone V) Namrata Patil told TOI, “The girl had earlier reported the matter to her family and her cousin’s family too. The families had a discussion, following which the girl’s cousin was warned to stay away from her. He nursed a grudge against the girl over this.” Inspector Anita Hiwarkar of the Bibvewadi police said, “The girl, a Class VIII student hailing from the family of a school van driver, had gone to an open plot near Yash Lawns to play kabaddi with other girls. She was standing with five girls at the plot when her cousin and his two aides came there. They parked their motorcycle outside the ground and walked towards the girl.” Hiwarkar said, “The trio told the other girls to leave and took her aside. The cousin and one of his aides attacked her with a chopper and knife, causing grievous wounds on her neck, chest, hands and calf. The attack left her head almost severed. One of the girl’s friend, who tried to intervene, was chased away.” The incident triggered panic and some evening walkers fled from the spot. The assailants later left on the motorcycle. “We have recovered a bag containing three to four sharp weapons and a toy gun, which the assailants used to threaten people,. The main suspect works with a private company,” Hiwarkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-men-stab-girl-14-to-death-at-bibvewadi-her-cousin-is-main-suspect/articleshow/86977712.cms||Gitesh Shelke

The process of razing had been underway over the past two weeks. What is startling is that the AMC’s town development department kept denying that the wooden haveli had anything to do with heritage. The department did not have any information on the building’s Unesco status. When the building was demolished, the AMC’s blue heritage tag hung on its wall. A Kalupur resident, Saumil Rajpara, had recently filed an RTI application with the central zone office regarding the heritage status of the house survey number 4380. That was a two-floor wooden haveli in Doshiwada ni Pol in Kalupur. The AMC’s town development officer (heritage) Vipul Rabari responded in a letter dated September 14 that the municipal corporation has no information on the building. Rajpara had taken pictures of the building and also of the ‘heritage tag’ installed by the AMC and sent them to Rabari. But there was no response. “It’s sad that a listed Unesco heritage building has been demolished right under the nose of the AMC,” Rajpara said. “When a Unesco team comes for an inspection, it will be a huge setback for the city. The city has already lost many listed heritage buildings in Khadia and Kalupur. The AMC should conduct an audit of its own list.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/disowned-by-amc-heritage-haveli-razed/articleshow/86975582.cms||---

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the preparation of coastal management plan relating to the notification by the Centre in 2019 has been delayed because of Covid-19 pandemic as it involves extensive procedures, including conducting public hearings in each district which has a coastal area. He also blamed the previous UDF government for not doing anything regarding the previous notification in 2011. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said that the first notification regarding the coastal regulation management was issued by the Centre in 1991. The notification was revised in 2011, and there were several complaints from all the states, including from Kerala, even regarding the revised notification. It was on the basis of such complaints that the Shailesh Nayak committee visited the state in 2014. The Centre then issued revised notification in 2019 by incorporating several relaxations on the basis of the concerns raised by the states. The Centre, while issuing a revised notification in early 2019, also said that a coastal management plan has to be put in place within six months of issuing the notification, for giving relaxations on the basis of the notification, Satheesan said. But the state government did not complete it not only in six months, but almost two years have been completed since the notification has been issued by the state, he said. “While the state is citing the pandemic for the delay, states like Maharashtra have already submitted the plan to the Centre. Because of this delay, the state is unable to reap the benefits of several relaxations offered in the latest notification,” Satheesan added. These include permission to undertake construction beyond 50 metres from the coastline and permission for undertaking constructions beyond 20m from the coastline in the case of small islands. He said that in the case of the state, salt water is advancing towards the land region in all the rivers flowing towards the west, and the CRZ rules will become applicable till the last point of the high-tide area. “The delay on the part of the government would lead to two-thirds of the state coming under CRZ rules,” Satheesan said. Meanwhile, the chief minister said though the Centre issued the notification on January 18, 2019, the state received the guidelines only in June. A panel led by additional chief secretary (environment) and consisting of experts, including P Z Thomas and P B Sahasranamam, are rectifying the shortcomings in the pre-draft plan prepared by the national centre for the earth science studies (NCESS). After this, public hearings will be conducted in 10 coastal districts, and the suggestions will be compiled and included in the draft plan to be submitted to the technical committee of the Centre. The final plan will be submitted to the Centre by including the recommendations of the technical committee, the CM said. The opposition later staged a walkout, protesting the delay in putting up the plan and the refusal by speaker M B Rajesh in allowing the adjournment motion in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-slammed-over-coastal-mgmt-plan/articleshow/86975629.cms||---
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: 10 teachers in Malegaon suspended for fudging Covid-19 vaccination data||NASHIK: The Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) has suspended 10 municipal school teachers for allegedly showing negligence during Covid vaccination. MMC officials said these teachers were deployed on vaccination duty at a vaccination centre in Sangameshwar area in Malegaon on July 2. They allegedly made entries in the CoWin application about administering vaccines to 13 beneficiaries. In reality, however, none of these beneficiaries had received the vaccine . The health officials came to know about the stock of vaccine vials remaining at the vaccination centre and started an inspection. During inspection, the health department found that 13 beneficiaries, who were registered on the CoWin app, were in fact not administered vaccines. Officials said that some of the beneficiaries, who were not given vaccines, were the teachers on vaccination duty and some of the others were their family members. MMC officials said they examined the online and off-line entries of the beneficiaries and found the discrepancy. “We administered doses to the beneficiaries after they were identified,” added officials. The health department immediately informed the education department of the MMC about the incident. After the official procedure, the education department of MMC took action against 10 teachers by suspending them. The MMC administration has warned of stern action against those showing negligence in vaccination drives. A circular in this connection has been issued by the MMC administration. Malegaon Municipal Corporation had faced reluctance towards Covid vaccination this year. They roped in community workers and religious heads to convince citizens to take the vaccine. Malegaon had been a Covid hotspot earlier and special teams were appointed to focus on bringing the infection under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/10-teachers-suspended-for-fudging-vaccination-data/articleshow/86977808.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court orders Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation to inspect Vejalpur society||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday came down heavily on residents of Shree Bhavani Cooperative Housing Society in Vejalpur over unauthorized construction and ordered the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation to undertake inspection and take action against against encroachers at the earliest and report back to the court. The case involves one Ramila Makwana, who assured the court four years ago that she would demolish construction illegally put up by her family. When the HC ordered the family last week to remove the construction, which cannot be regularised under GDCR rules, AMC officials insisted on the removal and the family approached the HC on Monday. Two women of the family broke down in the courtroom. This led the court to issue the family a stern warning to not indulge in emotional expression to move the court. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati said that the family took everything for granted, including the high court. The judges sent out a clear message to the society, “Crying and wailing before the court hardly matters. It will never weigh, and will not waver the court. The court is expected to follow the law and ask any citizen to comply with the law. The judiciary must not take on the colouration of whatever may be popular at the moment. The high court is a guardian of rights and we have to tell people things that they often don’t like to hear. No man is above the law and no man is below it; nor do we ask for any man’s permission when we ask any man to obey the law. It is demanded as a right and not as a favour.” The high court granted the petitioner one last chance to apply to the AMC for regularization of her house. The court came to know that many houses in the society, which were constructed when the area was not part of AMC, were built in violation of law. The high court expressed shock at the illegal construction and ordered the AMC to undertake a survey and inspection of the society “and if it is found that entire society is unauthorized, action should be taken at the earliest and reported to the court.” The HC made it clear that it should not happen that only one particular house is targeted and others go scot free. “The law will apply to all. If other bungalows are unauthorized, they should be demolished,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-amc-to-inspect-vejalpur-society/articleshow/86975640.cms||---

The transformative steps were part of the Undergraduate Academic Review Committee Report 2020-21 (UGARC 2020-21), which was approved by the IIT-K Senate in its meeting held during October 6-7. Director, IIT-Kanpur, Prof Abhay Karandikar said, “At IIT Kanpur we have always believed in supporting our students through a curriculum that not just enhances their skills but produces 21st century engineers and entrepreneurs who are agile and updated with the latest technological and academic innovations. The revamping of the existing curriculum, introduction of courses relevant to today’s changing world and the revised grading system is in continuation of our steps in this direction and in line with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (2020) of the government.” “A key aspect of the revamp is much needed flexibility to the system enabling it to adapt to the changing academic landscape across the world. We are hopeful that these features will enable IIT Kanpur to be the preferred institute for its programs both nationally and internationally,” he added. IIT Kanpur already offers one of the most flexible academic programs with options of double major, minor and dual degree with option of masters degree in different departments. The revamped curriculum will introduce new degree options, including the honours degree and options of new interdepartmental degree programs. It will also extend the scope of learning to include social-sciences, communication, humanities, economics, management and environment (SCHEME). The core courses will be restructured to give greater flexibility to the core curriculum. Technology will drive teaching and pedagogy to take learning to the next level. Further, the program will also enable counting of designated online courses done by students on MOOC platforms to be counted for credits. The transformational template for undergraduate education will include innovative features such as new opportunities for student exchange across institutions for the masters part of the bachelors-masters dual degree program, direct admission for talented students via globally acclaimed Olympiads, academic credits for approved entrepreneurial activities and learning done in the industry set up, and an exit option degree for those students who want to leave the program in the middle. The existing grading scheme has been made more granular with a fine-grained mechanism of student evaluation. It also envisages more avenues for guidance and counselling with a strong focus on ethics. Also included with the revamp will be ground-breaking reforms in the rules governing termination of undergraduate programs with an exit degree, due to inadequate student performance, in line with recommendations of the National Education Policy (2020). The academic programs and the associated curricula at IIT Kanpur undergoes a comprehensive review every ten years. The present review for the decade beginning in 2020-21 was initiated in November 2018 and was completed in September 2021 after a detailed consultative process involving the various stakeholders including the alumni. The review process began with exhaustive deliberations within a committee comprising 17 members drawn from the various academic departments as well as the student community. This was followed by a round of discussions in the departments, the Senate and an Open House involving the faculty at large as well as the student representatives. The final report, taking into account the feedback received from the departments, the Senate, and the Open House, was placed before the Senate for discussion, where it was subsequently approved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/iit-k-revamps-curriculum-in-line-with-nep/articleshow/86977829.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

Responding to a submission by opposition leader VD Satheesan in this regard, the chief minister said cases can be withdrawn only with the permission of the court, as per Section 321 of the criminal procedure code (CrPC). “It is the courts that have to give permission to withdraw cases. Government has its own limitations since the matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts,” he said, adding that even then, government will complete its procedures at the earliest. On February 26, government had decided to withdraw cases that aren’t criminal in nature and were registered in connection with Sabarimala protests and protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). On the basis of this decision, government had instructed the state police chief, all collectors and district police chiefs to take necessary action in this regard. Satheesan said in the assembly that while government has withdrawn 5,325 cases related to other matters, government is yet to fulfil its commitment on withdrawing cases related to Sabarimala and anti-CAA protests. Satheesan said though government registered 2,636 cases related to Sabarimala protests, none of them were withdrawn. Similarly, while 836 cases were registered related to anti-CAA protests, only 13 cases were withdrawn, he said. Satheesan said the opposition is not demanding that the cases which are criminal in nature should be withdrawn, but those which are related to peaceful protests should be withdrawn at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/panel-to-look-into-sabarimala-anti-caa-protest-cases-cm/articleshow/86975661.cms||---

The doctor told the cops that he was present when the baby was born. Senior police officials involved in the investigation said that on Tuesday, Dixit was taken to Bopal and he showed police the hospital where the baby was born. The cops checked the records of the hospital and the doctor who had delivered the baby identified Dixit as the husband of Pethani and the father of the baby. The baby, now 10 months old, was abandoned near a gaushala in Pethapur in Gandhinagar last Friday. The baby is the child that Dixit and his live-in partner Pethani had decided to have together after much deliberation. After murdering her, Dixit had abandoned the child. Cops said it appeared that Dixit had been taking good care of the baby as he had the baby vaccinated at a clinic, which he showed to the cops. The doctor at the clinic also identified Dixit as the baby’s father. Then Dixit led the cops to the house of Anita Rathod, the aunt of Pethani, where he had dropped Pethani for Janmashtami. The cops said that on Monday they had reconstructed the chain of events culminating in the abandonment of the baby. The cops then mapped what Dixit had done thereafter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dixit-idd-by-doc-who-delivered-baby/articleshow/86975719.cms||---

Although six wards have been identified as dengue hotspots, residents expressed dissatisfaction over the anti-dengue activities by the corporation as fogging and other preventive groundwork are still missing. According to the epidemic situation daily report, Trichy reported four dengue fever cases on October 4 in wards 39 and 44. On October 11, three dengue fever cases were identified in wards 3, 31 and 54. The inpatient fever cases cluster (3 or more cases) rose to 18 in the period between October 6 and October 11, the highest in recent months. While the district accounted to only nine dengue cases as on October 11 last year, the district reported 59 dengue cases during the corresponding period this year. The poor follow-up in expediting the dengue preventive measures have paved the way for the surge. Residents across Srirangam, Palpannai, Karumandapam and Cantonment said that they were neither covered under anti-mosquito fogging drive nor under a synchronised inspection to eliminate dengue source. “Water stagnation due to the recent rainfall is proliferating the mosquito menace and it is intolerable. Our neighbourhood did not witness any sort of preventive measure so far,” Navid Ibrahim Ansar, a resident of Cantonment, said. The residents charged the civic body for failing to combat dengue on time as it is engrossed in the Covid vaccination drive. Corporation officials said that glass bottles and empty coconut shells have served as breeding places for dengue causing Aedes mosquitoes in the city. “We are coordinating with the district health department to initiate suitable preventive measures. Fogging is done in the hotspots for three continuous days,” a health official with the civic body said. Officials added that an open water tank in ward 39 was razed down as part of the source reduction drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dengue-threat-looms-large-in-trichy/articleshow/86977891.cms||Deepak Karthik

It also rejected her anticipatory bail plea, saying it was not maintainable as chargesheet has been filed. “We will challenge the order in the high court,” said Mandakini’s lawyer Mohan Tekavde. ED public prosecutor H S Venegaonkar had opposed any relief on the grounds that repeated undertakings and assurances given to the court were “flouted by accused persons”. Khadse and Mandakini have also sought exemption from appearance before the court on health grounds. Khadse was operated on recently and his lawyer submitted his health report to the court. It is stated that he has been suggested a few weeks’ rest. The court will hear Khadse’s application on October 21. After investigating the illegal purchase of a government plot in MIDC area of Pune five years ago and laundering of the money, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a chargesheet against Khadse, Mandakini, their son-in-law Girish Chaudhari and deputy registrar Ravindra Muley before the special court. It is alleged that on April 28, 2016, Mandakini and Chaudhari entered into a sale deed for a MIDC plot in Pune. They paid Rs 3.8 crore to the descendants of the original owner of the plot and spent Rs 1.4 crore on registration and stamp duty. The stamp duty was paid on Rs 22.8 crore, which was the actual government price of the land in the record, to avoid any legal issues. Muley had helped Khadse’s kin to manipulate the government records. The government had purchased the plot from its original owner in 1981. The descendants disputed the government ownership after demanding compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/midc-land-case-bail-rejected-nbw-against-khadses-wife-in-mumbai/articleshow/86979666.cms||Vijay V Singh

The incident came to light after the girl was admitted to the hospital for delivery. The accused, hailing from Water Tank Road in Dindigul district was arrested by the all women police station (AWPS), Srirangam in Trichy city on Monday. Investigation revealed that the accused, who was in a relationship with the minor girl from Trichy, eloped and married her in Dindigul. They were living as a couple in Dindigul. In the meantime, the girl became pregnant. When she was nine months pregnant, she came to her maternal house in Trichy few days back where she was admitted to the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH). The hospital staff collected her personal details, including the age. When her parents told her she is a minor, the hospital administration passed on the information to Trichy city police. The AWPS, Srirangam inspector Meerabai and her team visited the hospital and took a complaint from the minor girl. The accused was booked under sections of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and remanded in judicial custody. This is the second such incident in recent times. On September 30, the AWPS, Cantonment booked five people and arrested one of them for forcing a 15-year-old minor girl into child marriage. The marriage was held in May 2021 and kept as a secret. The crime came to light when they printed an invitation to conduct a reception for them.

Called the BPaL trial, the combination contains two new anti-TB drugs—bedaquiline and pretomanid—along with antibiotic linezolid.The BPaL trial is led by the Indian Council of Medical Research and will cover 400 to 500 patients across eight centres, including two in Mumbai. The BMC-run Shatabdi Hospital in Govandi and the privately run Sarvodaya Hospital in Ghatkopar are the two trial centres here. A male patient in Shatabdi Hospital became the first on Monday to start on the combination. “The second patient will start the treatment on Wednesday,” said Dr Vikas Oswal, principal investigator of the Mumbai trial. “We doctors are very excited with the new combination because not only does it reduce the number of tablets a patient needs to take daily, it has a 91% successful outcome in MDR-TB failure cases,” said Dr Oswal. Patients need to take only three to four tablets a day for six months; this works out to roughly 700-plus tablets throughout the treatment as against the earlier MDR-TB treatment of 14,600 tablets over two years. A civic hospital doctor said the cure rate for MDR-TB and other extreme resistant cases is still small. “Before the introduction of new drugs bedaquiline and delamanid, we would have 30%-35% success rate among MDR-TB patients. This improved to 75%, and hopefully with the newer combinations such as BPaL, we should hopefully achieve a higher success rate,” the doctor said. The BPaL trial will enrol 50 to 75 at Shatabdi Hospital and they will be followed up for two years after the treatment. The BPaL trial will have one major difference from trials conducted in other countries such as South Africa. “The original combination needed 1,200 mg of linezolid, but we will only use 600mg linezolid tablets,’’ said Dr Oswal. The triacurel will include patients in whom conventional MDR-TB treatment failed or if the patient is medically classified as “pre-extremely drug resistant” cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-trial-to-treat-drug-resistant-tb-cases-in-6-mths-instead-of-18-mths-now-kicks-off/articleshow/86979668.cms||---

The bike rallies are to be taken out division-wise — beginning from Nashik Road on Wednesday. This is the second time during the last two years that the civic administration will be taking out a bike rally, comprising its employees, to make an appeal to people to pay their tax dues. The revenue of NMC through property and water taxes has been badly affected due to the pandemic outbreak during the last 18 months. The NMC administration has also introduced an amnesty scheme for the tax defaulters, but it has yet not yielded good results. Hence, the civic body is worried about the recoveries of the taxes. Civic commissioner Kailas Jadhav has directed the divisional officers of all six divisions to organise bike rallies involving employees from various departments, to spread awareness. Dilip Menkar, divisional officer from Nashik Road division, said we have planned a bike rally in Nashik Road division on Wednesday as per the directive of the municipal commissioner. “Our objective is to create awareness among people about paying taxes to enable the NMC in providing better services to the city residents,” he said. The NMC has set a property tax collection target of Rs 160 crore, but till date they have managed to collect only Rs 81 crore.. Moreover, the NMC has set a water tax collection target of Rs 75 crore, but could collect only Rs 25 crore so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-organise-bike-rallies-to-improve-tax-collection/articleshow/86977926.cms||Tushar Pawar

Uttar Pradesh has to be taken on the path of development. This ‘tehzeeb’ is our identity. This journey is to strengthen the people of all religions to live with love and this Vijay Rath will run from Ganga to Yamuna,” he said. “Going by the sea of people and their enthusiasm, it seems that in 2022, Samajwadi Party government will be formed in the state. The BJP government will not come again. Baba, Bull and Bulldozer will all go,” he said. He said that Samajwadi Vijay Rath Yatra, which has come out for the rights and respect of farmers, youth, in its first phase will criss-cross through four districts — Kanpur City, Kanpur Dehat, Hamirpur and Jalaun. Addressing a public meeting organised near Neyveli Lignite power house in Ghatampur, Akhilesh Yadav said that corruption prevails in the BJP rule. “Black money did not come back, inflation did not stop. The prices of petrol, diesel, cooking gas and fertilizers, pesticides skyrocketed. Farmers, poor, and youth are all sad. This government is snatching the rights of the poor. Employment prospects have been shattered,” said Akhilesh further. SP national president said that if the Samajwadi government is formed, electricity can also be given to the farmers for free. Irrigation will be free. Akhilesh said, “For the convenience of the public, the SP government had started ambulance service 108, 102, and 100 dial services were started for the prevention of crime and 1090 for women’s safety, they will be further expanded.” “We will win more than 400 seats,” he said. Before the start of Rath Yatra in Kanpur, Akhilesh said that this state belongs to the farmers, but the farmers are most humiliated and suffering here. “They were told that the income would be doubled but that too was taken away. Paddy is standing, and farmers are yet to get its price,” he said. He further said farmers were crushed by vehicles at Lakhimpur Kheri. “If BJP is not removed, it will crush the Constitution under tyres,” he said. On being questioned over the beginning of Vijay Rath Yatra from Kanpur, Akhilesh said that Kanpur is an industrial city. “Industry has been ruined under BJP rule. UP has been betrayed by BJP.

Of the 11 panchayat members, Borkar and his wife Sunita were absent for the meeting. In their no-trust motion, the panchs stated that the sarpanch does not take them into confidence in official matters, did not succeed in tackling illegal constructions in Sancoale, and has not been successful in handling his duty as sarpanch. Former sarpanch Girish Pillai said, “People come to us with the hope that their work will be done. If we don’t help them, they won’t vote for us in the future.” Panch Tulsidas Naik said, “We were aware of the misdoings in the panchayat since the past one year, and so we decided to come together and vote Borkar out.” After the no-confidence was passed against Pillai as sarpanch, a panch from the panel supported by Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha was to become the new head. Borkar, who was known to be an arch rival of Dabolim MLA and panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho, joined hands with the legislator and emerged as the sarpanch. Incidently, the panchs backed by Saldanha and Godinho have now come together to vote out Borkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sancoale-sarpanch-voted-out-in-no-trust-motion/articleshow/86978019.cms||---

Residents have sought the Trichy Corporation to close a portion of the weakened tracks and conduct a safety audit and take up the necessary reconstruction work. Hundreds of morning walkers access the recreational space equipped with an open-air gymnasium. Many others, especially children sit on the wall near the canal, which witnesses a copious flow. The worry of the walkers has been confounded by that fact that the Uyyakondan bank tracks have collapsed once due to heavy rains in May 2018. Since it was in the early hours, no one was injured but at least 30m of the stretch had collapsed and fell into the canal. The corporation had reconstructed a portion of the wall and the left old stretch untouched, which has been persistently witnessing caving in incidents for a year now. “The canal is only six feet away from the retaining wall, if the tracks cave in, people will definitely plunge into the water. It is high time the civic body started repair work,” G Ramalingam, a walker said. Corporation commissioner P M N Mujibur Rahuman told TOI that officials will be asked to conduct a study at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cracks-appear-on-walking-track-near-uyyakondan-canal/articleshow/86977894.cms||---

The KRMB meeting on Tuesday resolved to first take over all direct outlets under Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar projects from October 14. On Monday, the GRMB decided to take over Peddavagu in Bhadradri Kothagudem district, which is a common project under its control. “The implementation of gazette notification of July 15 on jurisdiction of KRMB was discussed in the 15th special meeting of the board on Tuesday. All direct outlets (components) from the main reservoirs of Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar projects, which are listed under scheduled II of the notification, may be prioritised by respective state governments for hand over to KRMB by October 14,” KRMB chairman MP Singh said in a statement. Tuesday’s board meeting was attended by Telangana special chief secretary Rajat Kumar and AP irrigation secretary J Shyamal Rao along with respective engineer-in-chiefs of irrigation departments. “The Board should have postponed implementation of gazette notification till final allocations of Krishna water as the Centre had committed to refer Telangana’s request for this to a tribunal. But it has decided to go ahead,” Rajat Kumar told TOI. He said the state government has been asking for 575 tmcft of water in Krishna. “While the state was getting 299 tmcft of total 811 tmcft temporarily for in-basin projects, we need at least another 104 tmcft, which comes to about 50% of total Krishna water,” the special chief secretary said. “Most of the concerns raised by Telangana were agreed to by the KRMB. Both Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam are common projects on Krishna, and Peddavagu is a common project on Godavari,” Rajat Kumar stated. Of the 65 projects listed in the notification, 30 control points including 18 under Nagarjuna Sagar and 12 under Srisailam have been asked by the board. “Both Telangana and AP will decide by GO which assets need to be handed over to the board. Cost of maintenance will be borne by respective governments. Manpower and security would be from Telangana on its projects till final decision,” Rajat Kumar said. Official sources said AP has asked the board to take over power houses on both the projects along with other outlets due to the controversy over power generation by Telangana from Srisailam. But Telangana has opposed the proposal. “Hydel power generation by Telangana is completely legal. We are asking Pothireddypadu and HNSS to be taken over, which was accepted,” the irrigation chief said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/krmb-to-take-over-projects-from-oct-14/articleshow/86980095.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Encounter specialist? What’s that, says VC Sajjanar||HYDERABAD: Senior IPS officer VC Sajjanar said he was neither an ‘encounter specialist’ nor knew its meaning on Tuesday at the end of seven hours of deposition spread over two days before the Supreme Court panel inquiring into the alleged encounter in Chattanpally in 2019 of four accused in Disha rape and murder case. Sajjanar, who was Cyberabad commissioner at the time of the encounter on December 6 last year, was asked 160 questions, including on inconsistencies in police claims, by the SC panel . Quizzed over an affidavit highlighting how the alleged Disha encounter followed a similar pattern to that of accused killed at the time of material recovery in 2008 in Warangal (three acid attack accused were shot) and in 2016 involving naxalites, Sajjanar said, “I was SP of Warangal when the incident happened in 2008. But in 2016, I was not in regular law and order post.” On being asked if he ever issued a statement against media labelling him an encounter specialist, the top cop said he did not, while adding that he did not agree with it. Sajjanar also countered the press statement attributed to cops on the website of a TV channel on November 29, 2019, according to which the accused were arrested in the afternoon at Shadnagar, pointing out that no such statement was issued by police and the one on the website did not have signature or designation of any cop. When shown a video of his press meet at Chattanpally encounter site on December 6 and quizzed, Sajjanar attributed his poor command over Telugu for the mistakes. But when commission members pointed out that he made a similar statement in English during the same press meet, Sajjanar said, “As there was a lot of rush and lot of questions, I erroneously mentioned about the recovery of Disha’s articles.” He, however, maintained that his mistakes in the press meet had not prejudiced the probe into the alleged encounter killings case. The top cop was also caught on the wrong foot on safety locks on the two pistols allegedly snatched by the accused. While the press meet video had him stating that the pistols were unlocked, in his initial statement to SC panel he claimed to have never said that. He attributed the press statement to briefing from Shamshabad DCP. Sajjanar stated that he was unaware that V Surender, IO of rape and murder case, had collected the DNA evidence of the four accused after the alleged encounter. On multiple occasions, Sajjanar reminded the panel that it was DCP Shamshabad, N Prakash Reddy, was the key supervisory officer of the rape and murder case. He also said hat he had not given the permission to keep the accused at the safe house in Mirjaguda and that DCP Shamshabad in consultation with additional DCP (SB) Moinuddin selected the police escorts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/encounter-specialist-whats-that-sajjanar/articleshow/86980098.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Agra||UP polls: Akhilesh & Shivpal launch separate rath yatras||Agra: The Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and his estranged uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav embarked on separate rath yatras across the state on Tuesday, dimming hopes of a possible electoral tie-up. While Yadav launched the ‘Samajwadi Vijay Rath’ from UP’s Kanpur, Shivpal, who heads the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party Lohia (PSPL), kicked off a ‘Samajik Parivartan Yatra’ from Mathura. Shivpal had recently said that he would wait till October 11 for Akhilesh Yadav’s response on an alliance. Shivpal maintained that “possibilities of a tie-up are still open” and said that he has always had blessings of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. Shivpal had parted ways and formed his own party in 2018 following a bitter feud with Akhilesh over who would claim the legacy of Mulayam Singh Yadav and take control of the party. Shivpal's rath showcased photographs of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ram Manohar Lohia besides others. On Tuesday, Shivpal first offered prayers at Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan before starting on his yatra which will be held in seven phases and pass through Agra, Aurraiya and Etawah in the first phase. “The yatra will change the power equation in the state,” he said, adding that all secular parties should “come together at a time when the youth, farmers and women across the state are facing problems at the hands of the Yogi government”. A day earlier, Akhilesh Yadav had taken blessings from his father before embarking on his yatra. Akhilesh’s yatra will travel to Hamirpur and Jalaun in the first phase on October 12 and October 13. Spokesperson of Samajwadi party, Naved Siddqiui told TOI that as per directions issued by the SP chief, only workers, office bearers and former MLAs of the party will attend the yatra in the district concerned and no outsider will take part in it. According to state spokesperson of Samajwadi party, Rajendra Chaudhary, the yatra is considered a lucky charm for the party and whenever Akhilesh Yadav has taken out such yatras, the party has formed the government in the state. “After his 2001 Kranti rath yatra, the party returned to power in 2002 and after he took out a yatra on September 12, 2011, he became the chief minister in 2012,” Chaudhary said, adding that the yatra would help bring a change in the state government, which has been “marred by corruption, lawlessness and incompetence”. Meanwhile, Shivpal’s son, Aditya Yadav, said, “The law and order situation in the state has deteriorated and the Lakhimpur Kheri incident was a perfect example of it.” He added that unemployment has grown manifold and businessmen are continuously facing losses since the pandemic. He said the aim of the yatra is to make people realise how they are being “misguided by the present regime”. The yatra will pass through all the 403 vidhan sabha constituencies and will end on November 27 in Amethi. The participation of senior Congress leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam at Shivpal’s rath yatra also sparked speculations of an alliance between Congress and PSPL. Krishnam declined to comment on the possibility of a tie-up, but said that only two people are working on ground, Priyanka Gandhi and Shivpal Yadav. “I can’t comment on an alliance as of now. Future will decide, but people from the same ideology have to come together to eradicate the present government which is immoral, unconstitutional and undemocratic,” said Krishnam. He added that Akhilesh had failed to meet the expectations of people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-polls-akhilesh-shivpal-launch-separate-rath-yatras/articleshow/86975766.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 3,700 per quintal on Tuesday, which was the highest in the last six months. Earlier, the average wholesale onion price was recorded at the same rate on February 16 this year. The prices have shot up by 151% during the last 24 days, from Rs 1,450 per quintal on September 17 to Rs 3,700 per quintal so far. According to Lasalgaon APMC officials, the supply of onions has reduced by over 50% during last few weeks. The drop in supply as compared to the demand has led to a rise in the average wholesale onion price. “Apart from Maharashtra, the early kharif onion plantation and other onion growing belts like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat have been badly damaged due to the rainfall. This has delayed the arrival of fresh kharif onions,” said Manoj Jain, an onion trader. He also said the supply of summer onions has been exhausted, as most of the farmers have already sold their stored summer onions. “It will take a month for the regular arrival of the fresh onions. The average wholesale onion price will stabilize thereafter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/onion-prices-climb-to-6-month-high-at-lasalgaon/articleshow/86977955.cms||Tushar Pawar

The value-added powder will be sent to the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU) in Coimbatore for marketing. To begin with, the department chose 30 farmers for the project. The income of the farmers is also expected to be enhanced through the initiative. ‘Shepherd’ - Extension programme department of St Joseph’s College has taken up the initiative with fund assistance of Unnath Bharat Abhiyan 2.0 sponsored by the ministry of education, government of India to generate the income of small farmers in five villages through moringa cultivation. The mission of Unnath Bharat Abhiyan is to enable higher education institutions to work with the people of rural India in identifying development challenges and evolving appropriate solutions for accelerating sustainable growth. Around 30 farmers from Yagapudaiyanpatti, Thopupatti, Inam Mathur, Nagamangalam and Sethurapatti in Trichy district have been identified and moringa saplings were distributed to them. Though it is a small initiative, the success of the project would take it to the next level, Rev Fr Berchmans, director of the department, said. “Once the plants start producing matured leaves, we will give the farmers a machine to powder it. Coordinators of our extension department will visit the villages frequently and monitor the growth of the plantation. Once moringa power is ready, we will try all the possible ways to market it in such a way every household would get more income. The work will be entrusted to the self-help groups created in each village,” Berchmans told TOI. If the project is successful, they have plans to export it by joining hands with big players. They have already identified a few potential exporters to execute the project. Authorities from the TNAU, Coimbatore have also promised to buy moringa powder, he said. College secretary Rev Fr Peter said that after the Covid-19 pandemic, people have become health conscious. Since moringa leaves have numerous nutritional benefits, it would not be difficult to market moringa and its by-products, he added. J Mariadoss, 42, a farmer from Inam Mathur said that though they have been raising mMoringa trees, they did not know much about the health benefits and how the earnings would be multiplied when the leaves have been value-added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-college-ropes-in-farmers-to-make-moringa-powder/articleshow/86977928.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||100 new faces for Gujarat assembly polls: BJP president C R Paatil||GANDHINAGAR: Against the backdrop of the state government’s overhaul ahead of the 2022 assembly election, state BJP president C R Paatil said on Tuesday that the BJP will field at least 100 new faces in the polls. Paatil made the statement in a party cadre meeting in Himmatnagar. “Hundred new faces will replace the old ones in the upcoming state assembly election in 2022,” he said. “The sitting MLAs present here need not take this message personally.” Paatil further said: “Nobody should approach me for tickets as this decision has been taken by the higher-ups. If someone is dissatisfied, he should go to Delhi.” Recently the BJP high command changed the entire cabinet in the state, replacing every minister. Vijay Rupani’s chief ministerial chair was given to Bhupendra Patel. Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel was dropped. Citing an instance from last December, Paatil said that the ‘prabhari’ (in-charge) of Amreli district was travelling early one morning and was about 100km into his journey when he saw a party worker on a motorcycle. When the district in-charge asked the worker where he was headed so early in the morning in the cold weather, the worker replied that the page committee details had to be entered into the database. The task was very urgent, the worker said. “The in-charge phoned me and got me to speak to the worker. I called the worker over and had food with him. He was very happy,” said Paatil. The worker came back one day to meet Paatil. “He told me that he has been a committed party worker for over 20 years and needed a favour,” Paatil said. “He told me his son was not getting a job. His son got the job. Will a party worker be left to fend for himself when the government is of the BJP?” Paatil said: “I am saying this to elected representatives, leaders, chairpersons of various bodies, and ministers seated here. Give priority to party workers.” He added: “If there are complaints from party workers, they will be accounted for.” Paatil said that the BJP has been winning because of the workers. The state assembly consists of 182 constituencies. The saffron party holds 112 seats; the opposition Congress, 65; the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP), 2; and the NCP, 1. The lone independent legislator is Jignesh Mevani, who will contest the next election on a Congress ticket. One seat is vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/100-new-faces-for-state-polls-paatil/articleshow/86975767.cms||---

---||Delhi||North Delhi Municipal Corporation won’t lift non-segregated waste from November 1||NEW DELHI: In another attempt to improve their rankings in Swachh Survekshan and ensure strict adherence to Solid Waste Management Bylaws, 2018 on the ground, the corporations have set fresh targets for residents to segregate garbage. Despite the bylaws being notified three years ago, the implementation on the ground is unsatisfactory. North Delhi Municipal Corporation would be imposing a complete ban on collection of non-segregated waste from November 1. The concessionaires have been directed to deploy staff at dhalaos to prevent the public from dumping non-segregated waste and paste red stickers on the premises of people violating the norms. Last month, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) had also announced November 1 as the deadline for segregation of waste for commercial, non-residential, institutional and industrial areas. The penalty amount would range from Rs 500 (for each default) to Rs 1 lakh. For residential areas, a penalty of Rs 200 would start from January 1, 2022. “We are doing an intensive orientation programme for bulk generators, like RWAs and traders’ association. We will take strict action after the deadline lapses,” said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand. Sanjay Goel, north corporation commissioner, has asked the concessionaire to collect only segregated waste from households and shopping establishments to achieve the target of 100% segregation at source after the deadline. “We will start pasting red stickers on the premises of regular defaulters. To minimise violations, officials have been asked to prepare area-specific strategies, including for slums and other settlements, commercial institutions and other non-residential premises,” said Goel. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has set December 31 as the target for 100% waste segregation in 58 wards. “We are currently doing segregation in 37 wards. But the success depends on the efforts of residents,” said an SDMC official. North corporation has launched a month-long sanitation and cleanliness drive for the festive season. To stop waste dumping in the open, there would be regular cleaning of community toilets and public urinals and lifting of garbage at vulnerable points. The drive would be on till November 11. “A nodal officer will be appointed in each zone to help address complaints and grievances related to sanitation and cleanliness. Officials will regularly inspect areas along with area councillors to ensure proper cleanliness, sweeping of roads and markets and cleaning of dhalaos. They will have to submit daily progress reports,” said Goel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-wont-lift-non-segregated-waste-from-nov-1/articleshow/86977986.cms||Vibha Sharma

To facilitate the vaccination of working-class citizens aged 18-44, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation kept vaccination centres open from early morning till late on Tuesday. By 7pm, 1,500 beneficiaries had been vaccinated. The vaccination centres will remain open for these additional hours till Thursday. Amol Mane, KMC’s vaccination nodal officer, said, “Most beneficiaries who turned up early in the morning were young. For the last several days, the turnout was between 1,000 to 1,200 per day. The turnout on Tuesday increased mainly due to the opening of vaccination centres from early morning to late evening hours. We are hopeful of getting a better response as many will know that the vaccination centres were open for additional hours.” At most vaccination centres, at least five to ten beneficiaries were seen even till late in the day. Mane said the final turnout once vaccination for the day ends is likely to be around 1,600-1,800. The turnout in the evening hours was less when compared to the turnout witnessed in earlier in the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmc-gets-good-response-to-early-morning-vax-drive/articleshow/86977985.cms||---

Compared to the normal withdrawal date of September 30, overall withdrawal was extended by nearly a fortnight this year, said India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials. ‘The withdrawal line of the southwest monsoon now passes through Aurangabad and Silvassa,’ the IMD bulletin said. Manorama Mohanty, head of the IMD for the Gujarat region, said this year the state received 703.4mm of rainfall against its long-term average of 692.4mm. “Thus, the state has received 102% of its seasonal rainfall. Region-wise, there is a disparity – Saurashtra and Kutch got 24% excess rain, while the rest of Gujarat was 12% deficient,” she said. District-wise analysis reveals that 20 of the state’s 33 districts received normal rainfall or higher, while 13 districts, primarily in north and central Gujarat, remained slightly deficient. However, the overall deficit reduced considerably due to the excess rain in September, IMD officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-receives-102-of-annual-average/articleshow/86975772.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: SOPs for theatres, multiplexes say no food or drinks inside hall||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Tuesday issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) for reopening of theatres, multiplexes and auditoriums in the state from October 22, saying these establishments will be allowed to operate at a 50% capacity and no food or beverage can be served inside the screening area. The SOPs do not specify any vaccine mandate for movie-goers. Also, since entry into malls is restricted to fully vaccinated individuals and those under 18 years old, entry to multiplexes which are located inside malls will be given on showing a movie ticket. Thus those unvaccinated or partially vaccinated could also enter multiplexes inside malls after showing their tickets at the entrance to the malls and multiplexes. Masks have to be compulsorily worn all the time. The state government has also given its nod for other cultural events to be organised in open-to-air venues or even closed auditoriums from October 22, and SOPs listed out by the state will be applicable to these events also. As per the SOPs, only fully vaccinated (14 days after second dose) staffers like ushers, food handling staff and cleaning staff will be allowed. Other SOPs include sanitising of auditoriums after every screening, staggering of movie timings to avoid crowding, and regular cleaning and disinfection of theatre areas. Theatres and auditoriums were reopened in the state last November after the decline of the first wave and were shut again in March Theatre folk happy a long interval finally set to endThe state government has included additional SOPs for drama auditoriums as there is an element of live performances there. All artistes should be fully vaccinated, and props and frequently touched items should be frequently sanitised, the SOPs state. No guest will be allowed to mingle with performers inside the green room or even on stage. Use of makeup items like brushes and combs should be seperate for each artiste. But although Covid prevention norms for stage plays and cinema theatres are stringent, artistes and backstage workers are relieved they can finally resume work after a long interval. Actor-producer Makarand Deshpande summed up the mood, saying, “It’s a good beginning.” Actor Vijay Patkar, who is president of the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Chitrapat Mahamandal, said, “Shri Ganesh toh hua (It is a welcome start). My dominant feeling is one of happiness that at least after a year-and-a-half of joblessness, our backstage workers, tamasha artistes, can resume earning an income.” Patkar had organised demonstrations urging the state government to reopen theatres for the welfare of artistes and folk performers, especially from mofussil areas, who have fallen on hard times. Yet, Patkar said, it is equally true that “50% occupancy is less than adequate.” “If we allow 50%, we may only get 30% since audiences are still wary. Given the ebbing of the Covid wave, I feel at least 75% occupancy should have been permitted. Compliance norms are stringent too. But we will abide by all rules,” he said. Film trade associations echoed similar feelings. B N Tiwari, president of the Federation of Western India Cine Employees said, “The bottomline is that after 18 months, we are happy theatres can start screening films once again. During the pandemic, film-goers have grown accustomed to watching films on mobile phones and other digital platforms, and this prolonged diversion does not augur well for the medium of cinema. The experience and magic of the silver screen must be revived. We do find the reopening norms extremely strict, especially as crowds elsewhere are not regulated with such zeal. But we have no objection. Let us at least restart business. Moreover, by now, people have adjusted to Covid protocol like masks and sanitisers. And now that malls allow only fully vaccinated visitors, the public is getting used to that also.” Cultural affairs minister Amit Deshmukh said that while the state government wants to open up all sectors and give relief to the people associated with the sectors, it is mandatory for all of them to be responsible and follow all Covid-related guidelines set down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-theatre-folk-happy-a-long-interval-finally-set-to-end/articleshow/86978055.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Ahmedabad||Railways drops Gir track upgrade plan||Ahmedabad: The Indian Railways on Tuesday informed the Gujarat high court that it has at present dropped plans for gauge conversion and electrification of tracks passing through the Gir wildlife sanctuary, as the state government is still waiting for the opinion of the chief wildlife warden on the Railways’ proposal. The railways authority and state government filed affidavits in response to the Gujarat high court’s query about a report submitted by amicus curiae Hemang Shah, taking exception to the track upgrade and laying of oil and gas pipelines through Gir sanctuary and its eco-sensitive zone. The lawyer presented his report and demanded cancellation of development projects in the protected areas in proceedings of a PIL, which the high court had filed suo motu for conservation of Asiatic lions. The Railways stated, “The railway board, after due deliberation has taken a decision vide letter July 31, 2020, that presently, this conversion is not going to be undertaken for MG/NG section.” Since the proposal has been pending with the forest department and state government authorities, the Railways further said that the State Board of Wildlife (SBWL) has imposed 10 conditions for implementation of the gauge conversion project and the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) may impose additional conditions, which have to be complied with before starting work for track upgradation. It also maintained that it is not asking for any additional land in the reserved forest except a 148-hectare area, which was already conferred to it from the beginning and on which the existing metre gauge tracks lie. The state government submitted that it has returned the Railways’ proposal to the deputy conservator of forests and has not forwarded it to NBWL for final approval. “The opinion of the chief wildlife warden has still not been received by the state government,” it said. The state government asserted that no such work is permitted until the final approval is received from the Centre, but the proposal has not been forwarded and was instead returned for reconsideration. With regard to laying of 86.614-km of oil and gas pipelines as proposed by Gujarat State Petronet Ltd, the state government said it may pass through the eco-sensitive zone, but laying such a pipeline is not prohibited. Even the pipeline project is subject to final approval from the Centre after due environment and wildlife clearances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/railways-drops-gir-track-upgrade-plan/articleshow/86975798.cms||---

On Monday, when she was brought to the hospital for routine check-up, the girl’s weight was over 1,600 gm. Doctors said the girl was born preterm in the 27th week of pregnancy under emergency C-section at a private hospital. She was later brought to the civil hospital for treatment in the month of June. Pediatrician Pankaj Gajare of the civil hospital said, “This is the first time that we have successfully treated a child with such less weight at the civil hospital. Earlier, we have treated infants weighing 800 gm and above but not 550 gm. The efforts of all the doctors and nurses for close to three months paid off.” Doctors said that generally, the children with such less weight do not survive due to complications like bleeding in the brain, lungs, as their body parts are not fully developed. The child was given surfactant and kept on Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) for close to three weeks, added Gajare. The girl’s mother, a 28-year-old nurse, works in a private hospital. Her father is a ward boy. Since the mother had developed high blood pressure, the delivery was done in an emergency during the seventh month of pregnancy. The child’s mother has thanked the doctors and said that her prayers and faith in the doctors of the Nashik civil hospital paid off, when everyone was casting doubt over the treatment at the civil hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/docs-at-nashik-civil-hosp-save-girl-born-weighing-550gm/articleshow/86978040.cms||Santosh Sonawane

According to Morbi taluka police station officials, Arvind Charola, a resident of Haripar (Kerala) village in Morbi taluka had borrowed money from these seven moneylenders at different times for the last one year. Even after payment, the lenders are harassing him for additional payment.

In the last eight months, he has already paid Rs 20 lakh but they are still demanding more from him. Later, he borrowed Rs 12 lakh from Narsang Rathod. Till now, he has paid Narsang Rs 8 lakh but he is still demanding Rs 20 lakh more from him,” police said. “Charola borrowed Rs 35 lakh at 3.5 percent interest rate from Harshad Chavda.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cong & SP want naming of chowk after Peres scrapped||Mumbai: The naming of a junction in Kala Ghoda after former Israeli prime minister and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shimon Peres has courted controversy once again. Months after the BMC formally named a chowk after Peres, the Congress and SP have moved a notice of motion saying that the proposal for naming the junction after Peres be reopened and scrapped. The two parties demanded the plaque with Peres’s name be removed as the proposal was “invalid.” The notice of motion, moved by Congress corporator Javed Juneja and SP corporator Rais Shaikh, will be tabled in the general body this month. Juneja said according to a 2010 BMC resolution, names of only Indian nationals who have contributed to the country and Maharashtra can be given to streets and junctions. Similarly, names of institutions can be given to streets and junctions. “The rules state that if the local corporator or NGO suggests the name of an individual or institution is to be given to a street or junction, then these factors (nationality, contribution) have to be verified. So this proposal was passed despite it being in violation of the rules. A proposal for naming a chowk after Peres was rejected in 2018 too,” Juneja said. Shaikh said, “We will urge all parties to reject the proposal.” The BMC said the proposal was presented by then civic chief Praveen Pardeshi and passed by the general body on December 18, 2020. Before that, it was passed by the civic works committee on August 31, 2020, during the lockdown. The request to name the chowk after Perez came from the Federation of Indo-Israel Chamber of Commerce. In 2018, the same proposal, moved by BJP’s Colaba corporator Makarand Narwekar, was rejected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-sp-want-naming-of-chowk-after-peres-scrapped/articleshow/86979676.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The policy is in its final shape and it is being introduced to simplify the procedures like transferring of ownership to the industrial unit managements. “At present, as per the procedures, it will take a minimum 20 years of time for the transfer of ownership. This will be simplified with the new policy,” he said. Rajeeve said it has been decided to set up industrial estates in all districts for which the process of identifying the land has begun. The present policy was to identify 25 acres in villages and 15 acres in urban areas for setting up industrial parks. Since it is not feasible to acquire this much land from both the villages and urban areas, it has been decided to begin industrial estates in much lesser areas. The government will be starting industrial parks in the state only after conducting a feasibility study. The minister also said that there are several outdated laws concerning the industrial sector which have to be either abolished or revised. A bill for this is under the consideration of the present session of the assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/new-land-policy-soon-rajeeve/articleshow/86975789.cms||---

The application will be taken up by the CJM court on October 18. The accused will be connected through video conferencing to put their version before the court. In its application, the CBI has sought permission for a polygraph test of the accused to know the truth with regard to interrogations going on in connection with the said case. On the other hand, the counsel for the accused too moved an application opposing the polygraph test. Anand Giri, Adya Tiwari and Sandeep Tiwari are accused of abetting the suicide of Narendra Giri, then president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), whose body was found hanging from the ceiling of a room in Shri Math Baghambari Gaddi under the limits of Georgetown police station in Prayagraj on September 20, 2021.

An FIR was lodged against the three accused under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at police station Georgetown in Prayagraj. Subsequently, Anand Giri, Adya Tiwari and Sandeep Tiwari were arrested. They were produced before the CJM court on September 22 and remanded to judicial custody for 14 days and sent to jail. Later, on the recommendation of the state government, the investigation of the case was transferred from UP police to the CBI.

---||Delhi||No idol immersion in public places: DPCC||NEW DELHI: Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Tuesday ordered that idol immersion during Durga Puja will not be allowed in public places, including Yamuna river, ponds or ghats. Idol immersion in the Yamuna can attract a fine of Rs 50,000 along with imprisonment of up to six years. Idol immersion rituals may be performed within the home premises in a bucket or container, DPCC said. The order issued by DPCC said National Green Tribunal (NGT) had pronounced various directions in 2015 against any type of immersion in the Yamuna. NGT orders prohibit throwing pooja material or any other material like foodgrain or oil into the river, except on the designated site. DPCC has directed the general public, RWAs and puja samitis to conduct idol immersion within the home premises. It also directed them to remove worship material like flowers and decorating material before immersion of idols and to collect them separately for handing them over to the door-to-door waste collection vehicle. If possible, composting of biodegradable material may be carried out at home, it suggested. As National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) in 2019 prohibited idol immersion in Ganga and its tributaries and violators are required to pay Rs 50,000 as environment compensation, DPCC has directed district magistrate to enforce NMCG’s direction. “It may be noted that the violation of directions issued under Section 33 A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, or the rules made thereunder shall be punishable under Section 41 of the said Act which include imprisonment up to six years and with fine,” said the order. DPCC ordered officials concerned to check the vehicles entering into Delhi carrying prohibited idols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-idol-immersion-in-public-places-dpcc/articleshow/87005251.cms||---

Though the Covid pandemic has taken sheen of the puja spirits and craze among the devotees, the old-timers recall that era of 1960s, 1970s and 1980s when Durga Puja in Patna was known more for classical and light music than for the grand pandals and decorations. Those in the advanced stages of life vividly remember that Durga Puja was a great attraction for the music buffs in Patna and its adjoining areas. They used to wait for the Durga Puja every year to listen to their favourites from Bollywood and enjoy all top celebrities of classical music in the country by hopping from Hardinge Park to Miller School, Gandhi Maidan, Patna Collegiate School, Langartoli, Golghar, Machhhuatoli and Station Road venues throughout the night. However, classical and light music events went on decline with the passage of time since late 1980s, making Durga Puja celebrations a mere ritual for the devotees in Patna. According to octogenarians Tapan Chakraborty and S Guha of Khagaul, famous table player Alla Rakha, sitar maestro Ravi Shankar, shehnai wizard Bismillah Khan, noted singers Kishori Amonkar, Shamshad Begum and Praveen Sultana, violinist V G Jog and other celebrities used to enthral the audience in Patna during Durga Puja. “Noted danseuse Sitara Devi used to be star attractions for all with her magical charms of dance,” the duo recalled. Besides, ghazal singers Anup Jalota and Pankaj Udhas were the artists who took part in the musical programmes for many years during Durga Puja in Patna. Bollywood stars Mahendra Kapoor, Sulakshana Pandit and Manna Dey were also regular to the state capital during Puja, they said, adding that the connoisseurs of classical music were regular visitors to Patna from far off places to enjoy the bliss of the Puja grandeur. With a note of despondency in the voice of music lovers, they, however, genuinely feel that such gala time will never come again in Patna. were the venues for such memorable events in Patna as part of the puja festivity, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/old-timers-in-patna-miss-classical-music-shows-during-puja/articleshow/86974325.cms||Kumod Verma

The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government faced criticism for irregular salaries to MSRTC staff. In 18 months, 26 staff have died by suicide in Maharashtra. The staff have also protested to demand regular salaries. Transport minister Anil Parab said, “A government resolution (GR) was issued today that sanctioned the release of Rs 231.30 crore from Manav Vikas Mission to MSRTC. Under the mission, girl students can travel free from their villages to school. The state government bears the cost for the project. But since 2013-14, the state government has not released payment to MSRTC. Of Rs 428.88 crore pending dues, Rs 197.58 crore was released to MSRTC in May 2021, and the balance Rs 231.30 crore will be released soon. The state transport utility continues to witness a loss of around Rs 400 crore per month during the pandemic due to a drop in passengers, posing an unprecedented financial crisis before MSRTC. The state government provided support in the form of Rs 2,100 crore so MSRTC could pay salaries till June. But even this money got exhausted. Around Rs 300 crore goes towards payment of salaries of MSRTC staff. But despite the drop in Covid-19 cases, there has not been an upsurge in passengers even though 10,000 buses operate in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/festive-bailout-for-93000-st-staff-rs-231cr-for-salary-in-mumbai/articleshow/86979727.cms||Manthank Mehta

Zydus Cadila’s DNA-based needle-less vaccine has got approval for the 12-17 age group, and Bharat Biotech on Tuesday got a step closer with the expert committee recommending emergency use authorisation for Covaxin for the 2-17 age group. Now, only the drug regulator’s approval is awaited. “These approvals and recommendations are fine, but the Centre hasn’t yet released guidelines for vaccinating the paediatric age group,” said a senior doctor. Also, the companies will need time to manufacture doses. “We still don’t know if children will need one or two shots, will the doses be diluted, or vials be smaller,” the doctor added. However, BMC officials said paediatric vaccination could begin as early as a week after the guidelines being released. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the BMC has a huge network of vaccination centres and storage facilities, but “we cannot do anything without central guidelines”. The city has around 500 public and private vaccination centres. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said if the guidelines remain the same as for adults, the process could start soon. “If not, we will need to set up new centres and train our staff before starting any paediatric drive,” he added. A civic doctor said guidelines would have to answer queries such as should paediatric vaccine centres be located within hospitals, where emergency care is at hand, or in neutral places that won’t intimidate the child. While paediatric vaccination has been a subject of debate in India, many countries, including the US and France, have long began vaccinating children over 12 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-on-slow-road-centres-guidelines-not-in-sight-as-30l-minors-wait-in-city/articleshow/86978081.cms||---

SI Yadav not only taught Hindi lessons and poems to children at the primary school, but also interacted with students to increase their interest in studies. The initiative was taken under the initiative program 'Pahal'. Not only Yadav, but cops posted at the office of Inspector General of Police (Prayagraj range) also took part in the noble initiative and spared time to teach underprivileged children at parks and slums. Interestingly, IG KP Singh had himself donned the hat of a teacher last month for the underprivileged children and taught geography and political science to the students of classes 7 and 8. More than 50 children had attended the class for around an hour. Speaking to TOI, the IG said that cops ranking from constables to senior police officials are sparing time to teach various subjects to the poor children on different days. He added that the first initiative was taken by a cop named Ashish Mishra, who is a constable with the Prayagraj range office, and had started teaching the children a few weeks back. Gradually, other policemen of different posts and ranks too joined him and decided to teach the children various subjects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cops-teach-poems-to-underprivileged-kids/articleshow/86978082.cms||---
---||Agra||Suicide of minor: 4 cops suspended, court to monitor case||AGRA: Police in UP’s Etah district on Tuesday suspended four cops, including two sub-inspectors, after a preliminary probe found them guilty of abetting the suicide of a boy (16), who had allegedly shot himself dead after spending three months in jail where he was sent after being tried as an adult. On September 21, soon after coming home on bail, the Class XII student allegedly killed himself, unable to bear the trauma. He had earlier been arrested for "keeping banned drugs". On September 30, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had sought a report from the local police after a TOI report. The rights body had asked Etah police to probe the role of every person involved in the case, including the judge who sent the boy to jail. “Action against the four policemen was taken on the basis of the preliminary investigation into the FIR registered against them,” SSP Etah Udai Shanker Singh said. “On March 9 this year, my son had stepped out to buy pizza. He was arrested,” said his father, a farmer. Police said they recovered 500g of diazepam from him. “He was kept in lockup and beaten up for four days. Police demanded Rs 2 lakh to release him. My son was eventually produced in court, as an adult, and sent to jail under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act on March 12," the father had said. The minor was released on bail because the police could not file a charge-sheet. Humiliated and harassed during his time in prison, he killed himself at home. ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna had ordered an FIR against the policemen based on a complaint by the boy’s father. The four policemen named in the FIR were sub-inspectors Mohit Rana and Shiv Kumar, head constable Upendra Kumar and constable Ravish Kumar, all posted at Kotwali Nagar police station of Etah district. “Following the primary investigation, four policemen, accused of abetment to suicide, have been suspended. It was done to ensure that the ongoing probe in the matter is done impartially," the SSP said. The case against the four policemen was also transferred to the crime branch. Meanwhile, the district and sessions court has accepted a petition by the boy’s father to monitor the probe into the case against the four cops. The court has summoned the investigation officer to come for a hearing along with the case diary on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/suicide-of-minor-4-cops-suspended-court-to-monitor-case/articleshow/86975845.cms||Deepak Lavania

Accordingly, enough care will be taken to avoid any flashy objects or lights, ensure there is no noise nearby, no bursting of crackers and keep participants away from the pachyderms.Foresters say Abhimanyu is their strength. “He is a trouble-shooter and has helped the department in scores of elephant and tiger rescue operations over the past few decades,” said an official.The lead elephant, Abhimanyu, who emerged as the successor to Arjuna, will carry the golden howdah. According to officers, he is well behaved and calm. He would stand near the dais along with two cow elephants during the inauguration when chief minister would offer flowers to the deity. The other elephants would be away from the stage and hence there is no worry in this regard, added the official. An officer said Gopalaswamy is an experienced elephant. “He may have panicked due to the bursting of colourful crackers. He, however, turned around and stood calm without harming anyone. He didn’t run into the crowd. Learning from the Srirangapatna incident, a plan has been prepared for the final day of the Mysuru Dasara procession,” the official added.Approximately in 52-seconds, 21 cannon shots will be fired as the national anthem will be played during the Dasara inauguration. DCF (Wildlife) V Karikalan, in-charge of eight Dasara elephants, said only seven will take part in the procession as Vikrama has gone into musth. To a query, the officer said Abhimanyu, a veteran Dasara elephant, is experienced and capable of remaining peaceful regardless of the situation. “The other four elephants would leave the main area before cannons are fired. It is not a matter of concern as all elephants are obedient and healthy,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/dasara-procession-path-to-be-widened-for-elephants/articleshow/86973658.cms||---

Property registrations in both urban and rural areas are happening, he stated.The realty sector covers over 300 real estate management firms, development services, finances, and businesses dealing with bricks, cement manufacture and fabrication.Adish explained if at all there is a problem in the sector, it may be due to an individual- or developer-related issues, but the overall percentage is less than 1%. The sector provides the best platform for investment if the buyer exercises caution during transactions.Rajeev H V, chairman of Mysuru Urban Development Authority, said the sector is slowly limping back to normalcy. With regard to the auction of premium and intermediate sites, the number of buyers is increasing of late. Pre-pandemic, nearly 80% of the sites were being auctioned, while it is just over 60% now. But it has increased after the second wave of the pandemic, he said.Construction activities have resumed too. In the last six months, about 112 building plan approvals have been made by Mysuru City Corporation (MCC). The number has been promising in the second quarter as 72 sanctions have been given in three months, which is higher compared to the corresponding period in 2020.Previous fiscal, about 299 approvals were given despite Covid. On an average, MCC issues 290 sanctions every year, according to an engineer of MCC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/realty-sector-picking-up-after-2nd-wave/articleshow/86973632.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Dengue’s back: 200 hospital admissions in a week in Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: The number of dengue cases reported at city hospitals continued to rise on Tuesday, as there were 25 new cases. The rise in dengue admissions at government hospitals has affected bed availaability and led to a rise in the demand for platelets. Half of the platelets given at hospitals are for dengue patients. At PGIMER, GMCH and GMSH, over 200 admissions have been reported in the last two weeks. “We are seeing severe dengue cases with the same clinical symptoms as previous years. However, severity has increased,” said an expert with PGIMER. There have 122 dengue admissions at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, since October 4, while PGI has got 27 cases this month. Overall this year, there have been 65 cases reported at PGIMER. Last year, the figure was 100. “There is a surge in October. We got 27 cases in the last 12 days, 30 cases last month, and we expect cases to rise until November,” said a doctor at Postgraduate Insititute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). Dengue serotype keeps on changing, the most common are DEN virus 2 and DEN virus 3. “We are seeing patients with headache, fever, pain in the abdomen, etc. There can be complications if the platelet count starts dipping and there is bleeding. A patient can go into shock and, consequently, other organs like liver and brain can get affected,” said the doctor. The vector-borne virus can occur with or without warning signs. Warning signs include fever, recurrent vomiting which could include 3-4 bouts in a day, bleeding from any site, and pain in abdomen. If platelets decrease without any clinical symptoms, no need to worry,” said a medical specialist at GMCH. He said the symptoms could be confused with influenza but when there is thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), dengue is confirmed. “We are not seeing co-infections with dengue,” he added,||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dengues-back-200-hospital-admissions-in-a-week-in-ut/articleshow/86975901.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Farmer leaders said the protests will grow stronger every day until Union minister Ajay Mishra, whose son Ashish has been accused of killing the farmers and the journalist, is sacked. Around 10am, the Antim Ardas, or final rites, for the four farmers — Lovepreet Singh, Gurwinder Singh, Nachattar Singh and Daljeet Singh — were held at the Kaudiyala Sahib gurdwara. After the ritual, the scene shifted to the protest gathering, where farmer leaders from Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh joined. Posters honouring the four farmers and the journalist, Raman Kashyap, as “martyrs” lined the massive tent under which the protesters gathered. Many farmers, anticipating resistance, had arrived in Kheri late on Monday. Others, who started on Tuesday morning, were stopped at several places along the way, trickling in by afternoon. The district administration had reportedly sent lekhpals to the houses of local farmers to “advise” them to skip the meeting to avoid “law and order” problems, attending farmers said. ADG (Lucknow zone) SN Sabat told TOI that “required forces” had been deployed in the area for security. Earlier in the day, police tried to stop RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary at the Bareilly airport but had to let him go after his supporters staged a blockade. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi arrived at the protest around noon but was not allowed to speak on stage. “It’s a non-political program,” a farmer leader said. On the stage were families of those who died and farmer leaders. “We are not happy with the way the investigation is going. Our protest will continue. The next mahapanchayat will be in Lucknow on October 26,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait told the gathering. “The minister and his son must be lodged in separate barracks in Agra, not in Lakhimpur jail, because they are guilty of murder. The minister must resign and be arrested.” Prominent BKU leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni accused the government of pitting people from one community against another. “The government is trying to play the Hindu-Sikh card. But this is a fight for justice by people across faiths. We will all fight together,” he said. A demand for the minister’s resignation was a recurring concern among all speakers. “The state government has met our demands — the FIR, arresting the minister’s son, handing out compensation and jobs. But there’s one that remains, that the minister be sacked. They said it’s in the hands of the Centre,” Bhartiya Sikh Sangathan president Jasbir Singh Virk said. “He has not even been summoned yet … We will intensify our movement until the minister is sacked.” Farmer leaders also asked why the prime minister had not spoken about the violence. “PM (Narendra) Modi has not uttered a word about this incident. He has shown that not everyone is equal to him,” a farmer leader from Uttarakhand told the gathering. Another, from Punjab, added, “The government is speaking to people jailed in Kashmir, with the Taliban, but not to farmers.” After the meeting, the ashes of the four farmers were handed over to farmer leaders from 75 districts of UP and from each state in India. “The ashes will be immersed in the holy rivers of each of these places,” Tikait said. “The glory of these farmers who attained martyrdom should be shared with people across the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/thousands-gather-for-last-rites-of-farmers-journo-killed-in-kheri-violence/articleshow/86975907.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The stock of coal in most of Mahagenco’s power plants continued to remain enough to last for less than two days, as on Monday. Three power plants, Nashik, Parli and Chandrapur, had coal to last for two full days. Tuesday’s position will be released on Wednesday. As on Sunday, there were plants which had less than one day’s stock. On Tuesday, the least availability was one day’s stock. Koradi had a day’s stock. The Khaparkheda, Paras and Bhuaswal plants had coal enough for a little more than a day. There were sporadic power cuts of 30 to 45 minutes in a few of the localities in the city. MSEDCL — the power distribution company of the state government has ruled out cuts to be due to load shedding. It must be on account of certain technical reasons for specific pockets, said an MSEDCL officer. Meanwhile, the coal stock as on Monday stood at 2.2 lakh tonnes for all the Mahagenco’s power plants as against 1.90 lakh tonnes on Sunday. The situation is expected to gradually improve. This has helped in starting the Bhusawal thermal power plant of the state government utility. Bhusawal generated around 791mw by Tuesday evening, stated figures of the load dispatch centre. Mahagenco gets majority of its coal supply from Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) — the Coal India Limited (CIL) subsidiary based in Nagpur. Sources in WCL said the dispatch to the power sector as on Monday had increased by 7,000 tonnes, taking the total supply to 1.28 lakh tonnes. Out of this, Mahagenco has got 80,000 tonnes. WCL officials maintain that Mahagenco has been getting more than the normal average. According to the load dispatch data maintained online, the state’s production as on Tuesday stood at 14,000 odd mw, and the demand stood at 19751mw. The shortage was met by drawing power form the central grid and open market purchase. Out of this, MSEDCL which supplies to the rest of Maharashtra, except Mumbai, had a demand of over 17,000 odd mw alone According to the official figures of load dispatch. MSEDCL, the distribution arm, has withdrawn 856mw more than its schedule of 14,600 odd mw. Mahagenco is the state government’s power generation company and MSEDCL is the distributor company, the latter brings power to the consumers’ doorstep. If Mahagenco’s own generation was considered as on Tuesday evening then it stood at 5,755mw on gross basis purely from coal fired plants. It was 5,982mw if the gas plants were included too. The private power companies generated 5,530mw out of which Adani’s thermal plant had the highest production of 2,621mw. The coal crisis has affected supplies to industries coming under the non-power sector too. WCL sources said earlier almost 20% of the supply used to go to the non-power sector. Its share has come down to 12%. There is no supply by the railways to non-power units which have to now lift their own coal and transport it by roadways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coal-situation-improves-marginally/articleshow/86975902.cms||Shishir Arya

Karthik is the vice-president of BJP youth wing (Coimbatore north district). He runs a mobile phone shop. He was allotted ‘car’ symbol in the bypoll. At the end of vote counting on Tuesday afternoon, officials declared that Karthik got only one vote. Some media reported that Karthik and his five family members had votes in the same ward, but they did not vote for him. This message went viral on social media with meme creators having a field day. When contacted, Karthik said he contested as an independent and he was not fielded by BJP. “Some political outfits are trying to tarnish the image of our party by connecting the number of votes I polled with my party.” In a video released on social media later, Karthik said he was a new person to ward 9. “My family members and myself don’t have votes in the ward. We have votes in ward number 4. It is wrong to say that my family members didn’t vote for me. I got one vote and I would treat it as a victory for me.

The corporation would roll out ‘Vaccine on wheels’ initiative to identify and vaccinate those who are eligible for their second dose. It plans to achieve cent percentage vaccination in wards or areas where only a few people are left for total vaccination by visiting them at their doorsteps. The civic body has roped in members of civil society and NGOs for logistic support. Health minister Ma Subramanian will inaugurate the initiative on Wednesday. According to the health department data, less than 2 lakh people have not taken even the first dose in the district and most of them are in rural areas. Over 36% have taken their second dose in the district and city limits are better covered in terms of second dose. A senior official from the health department of the corporation said that fever surveillance workers have gathered details of those who are due for their second dose in each ward. Ward number 54 in Ram Nagar has only 350-odd people left for the second dose. While most of the people are expected to be at home for the puja holidays, it would be easy to vaccinate them, the official said. The field level staff have started collecting details of such people by contacting them over phone and knowing the reason for delaying vaccination despite being eligible. “Excluding those who have medical reasons, others will be vaccinated in the coming days by knowing their availability by reaching out to their houses,” an official from the city corporation said. R Raveendran of Namma Kovai said that they are offering logistic support to organize ‘Vaccine on wheels’ as the corporation has planned the whole initiative with their workers. Instead of focusing on each ward, it was decided to work in an area to achieve 100% vaccination, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-corporation-to-roll-out-vaccine-on-wheels-today/articleshow/86978117.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

With the water level in the Idukki reservoir nearing blue alert level of 2390.86ft authorities increased power generation at Moolamattam power plant. The water level at the reservoir was at 2,389.52ft on Tuesday, which is 84.53% of total storage. The red alert level here is at 2397.86ft. “The Central Water Commission has given the permission to maintain the water level till the full reservoir level in flood seasons. The FRL of the dam is 2403ft and at present the water level is 13ft below the FLR. By creating a dynamic flood cushion we can avoid flooding in downstream areas. As of now, there is no need to open the shutters of Idukki dam," said KSEB chief engineer (dam safety and DRIP) Supriya. The water level in the Mullaperiyar dam on Tuesday was at 128.69ft while the maximum storage level is 142ft. Thodupuzha taluk reported the highest rainfall of 106.2mm in the district on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the state counted 2,069 cases and 43 fatalities, taking the total caseload to 65.8 lakh and death toll to 1.4 lakh since the arrival of the novel coronavirus in March last year. Cases in Mumbai continued to hover around 400 for the second consecutive day, mainly due to fewer than the usual 35,000-plus tests being conducted. On Tuesday, the city reported 418 cases and two deaths, taking the total caseload to nearly 7.5 lakh and death toll to 16,164. BMC officials said though Mumbai region has again become the highest contributor to the state’s tally —for months, Pune region registered more Covid cases than Mumbai—there is no reason to worry yet. “We cannot deny that cases have risen in comparison to the period when there were tighter restrictions. The effect of the August 15 decision—allowing Mumbaikars who have completed 14 days after getting fully vaccinated to board local trains—is clear on the city’s Covid tally,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said areas where the cases have risen marginally in comparison to the previous weeks are being studied. “F-North (Matunga), D (Malabar Hill), E (Byculla), HW (Bandra) and A (Colaba) wards are being closely monitored, but the rise in cases is in no way huge,” she said. Meanwhile, active cases in the state dropped to 30,525, but rose in the city to 5,985. Health department officials said it is clear the second wave is ebbing, but it is likely that cases may rise again after the festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-day-after-17-month-low-state-reports-slight-rise-in-cases/articleshow/86978158.cms||---

She directed the district health department, municipal corporation and municipal councils to “actively take up fogging drive to curb mosquito menace.” Chairing the health review and emergency meeting at the District Administrative Complex on Tuesday, the DC ordered monitoring of the speed, duration and movement of fogging vehicles with GPS “GPS-enabled fogging machines must be pressed into service to ensure monitoring of the speed and duration of vehicles in the designated area and locality. We need to extensively monitor fogging during peak time till November 15 to curtail dengue spread. Instead of pressing each fogging vehicle into operation just once a day, they may be used twice. Evening fogging schedules must be prepared,” she said. She also called for regular disinfectant spray across the city, particularly at public places in view of the festive season. Dusting with medicinal powder near drains should be coupled with frequent disinfection activities in densely populated areas, slums and narrow lanes, she said. Two shoulder-mounted machines are being used for fogging in parks, villages and settlements where big machines cannot enter. It is also being used in houses of active dengue patients and their neighbourhood. The DC said that the mosquito responsible for dengue and chikungunya (aedes) breeds only in fresh and clean water and bites only during the day time. “Maximum mosquito breeding is being reported in coolers, tyres, trays of fridges, flower pots and discarded items,” said the DC. She said that the Punjab government has declared “Every Friday-Dry Day.” BOX: Fogging intensified The MC has intensified fogging in all wards of the city. Municipal commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “We have divided the city into four zones to ensure fogging in every nook and corner of the city. Every zone will be catered to by different teams as four teams were formed to ensure fogging in every part of the city.” Mayor Amarjeet Singh Sidhu instructed MC officials to identify high-risk areas. He also directed officials to conduct a survey to check dengue larvae in residential and commercial parts of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fogging-vehicles-to-be-monitored-through-gps-in-mohali/articleshow/86975927.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The herd had nearly 22 elephants, including two calves. Pranjal Kumar had gone to see the elephants with his two friends, Ankit and Gaurav. He reached too close to the herd and an elephant attacked him, suspecting him to be a threat for the calves. Pranjal was grievously injured and rushed to the hospital but he succumbed during treatment. The victim was a resident of Saijania village and the calves in the group attracted the attention. Gaurav, who was under trauma after the incident, said, “We stayed back but Pranjal went too close and suddenly an elephant came out from nowhere and wrapped him in his trunk, slammed him to the ground and trampled him. We were scared and ran away from the spot.” Bagh Mitra Anil Kumar Chauhan told TOI, “We were told that the victim had taken a few photos of the elephants and later attempted to take a selfie and came too close to the herd. Such an incident had never happened in this area. The elephant herd has migrated here since 1989.” Range Officer Mobin Arif told TOI, “We have been advising the locals to stay away from the wild elephants but a group of three youths moved too close to the herd of the elephant and one of them was killed. The elephant herd is continuously moving to and fro between Dudhwa Reserve forests and social forestry area in Mohammadi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/student-20-tries-to-take-selfie-with-a-herd-of-wild-elephants-trampled-to-death/articleshow/86975954.cms||---

The DRI sources disclosed the matter on Monday after interrogating the arrested trio for several hours and forwarded them in judicial custody after production before a Muzaffarpur court. Sources said simultaneous raids were carried out by the DRI teams in Delhi, leading to recovery of smuggled 5.5kg pure gold biscuits. The DRI sleuths also unearthed huge cash transaction in Bhopal from selling the smuggled gold. In Muzaffarpur, sources said the biscuits were of 24 carat gold and were hidden in a specially created box beneath the battery casing in the car’s engine. Sources said the arrested persons had pasted ‘PRESS’ insignia on the car, which has Assam’s registration number, to avoid any suspicion. They said the biscuits seized in Muzaffarpur are suspected to be of Myanmar origin as they were engraved with symbols used in the Myanmar bullion market. “The biscuits are of 100% gold. The action in Delhi and Bhopal was against the same syndicate involved in the Muzaffarpur smuggling,” a source said. “The consignment intercepted in Muzaffarpur was smuggled inside the Indian territory from Moreh (Manipur), which shares the international border with Myanmar. The arrested trio had picked up the consignment from Guwahati. It was to be delivered in Varanasi,” a DRI source said. He said the entire consignment was to be used in the Varanasi bullion market and at some different places. “The follow-up action is going on in Varanasi. Nothing further can be disclosed at present. Names of the arrested trio are being withheld for security reasons. They have smuggled gold on multiple occasions in the past too,” another source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-held-with-35-gold-biscuits-worth-rs2-86cr-in-muzaffarpur/articleshow/86948461.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Inaugurated by corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, the camp featured 21 stalls, and ENT, paediatric, dental, psychiatry, siddha, cardiology, gynaecology, orthopaedics and dermatology specialties. A corporation official said 1,359 people - 752 men and 607 women - had undergone various tests and screenings at the camp. Many of them were diagnosed with early symptoms of tuberculosis and they were referred to hospitals to get X-ray and other tests done. “Five people were found to have ortho problems and they too were referred to hospitals. Four had eye problems and they were referred for cataract procedure.” The official said the beneficiaries had access to free blood check-up, electrocardiography, echocardiography and ultrasonography at the camp. “People, who were diagnosed with health issues, were provided initial treatment and medicines free of cost.” A doctor said the scheme was launched to identify medical issues among the people in the early stages and provide them necessary guidance and treatment. “People often come to hospitals only when their health issues aggravate. By that time, they may have developed many complications.” The camp saw the participation of Dr P Aruna, deputy director of health services, and Dr Sathish Kumar, city health officer. The city is likely to see three similar camps till February 2022, while rural areas would host 36 camps, which would be held from 9am to 4pm at select venues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-unveils-kalaignarin-varumun-kappom-scheme-2256-benefit/articleshow/86978150.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The building was constructed on agricultural land without obtaining prior permission from the department. District town planner Priyam Bhardwaj said they received information regarding the illegal construction of colony, following which he prepared a team and Pinjore range officer Amit Sharma was appointed duty magistrate. He said the team, accompanied by police force, demolished 7 ‘damp proof course’ structures built on the land. He said a large number of villagers tried to oppose the act, but police force helped them in staying away. Bhardwaj said he had also advised villagers to not fall in easy money traps by property dealers to construct illegal colonies or commercial shops on agriculture or reserved land. “Without obtaining permission from the town and country planning department, Haryana, no one can construct any commercial or residential property on any land,” the DTP said. DTP also informed them that such violation could lead to action under Urban Area Act 1975, Peripherry Controlled Area Act 1952 and Controlled Area Act 1963, which could lead to three-year rigorous imprisonment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/7-commercial-buildings-on-agri-land-in-panchkula-demolished/articleshow/86975964.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: NCP ministers want Covid restrictions further relaxed||MUMBAI: At a party meeting presided over by NCP president Sharad Pawar on Tuesday, NCP cabinet members took the view that there should be further relaxation of Covid norms for traders and shops and establishments. “We felt that since intensity of Covid has reduced drastically, existing restrictions should be reduced. NCP leaders will soon meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and press for the proposal,” a senior NCP cabinet member said. The NCP ministers alleged at the meeting that Central agencies were “harassing NCP leaders and their relatives for political reasons.” “The NCP has taken serious note of the gross abuse of Central agencies, and as a political party, we will not take it lightly, we will fight it with full power. We will take on the BJP,” the cabinet member said. Pawar will interact with the media on Wednesday and comment on the series of income-tax raids on NCP leaders and their relatives. According to reports, income-tax sleuths recently searched the premises of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s sisters and his son and a section of their family. Ajit Pawar had expressed strong displeasure over the raids at his sisters’ houses, saying he was hurt. “We are seeing such kind of abuse of power for the first time,” he had claimed. Sharad Pawar reviewed the performance of all cabinet members and thanked the people and traders for participating in the Maharashtra bandh organised on Monday to protest against the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. On the outcome of zilla parishad elections, the meeting saw discussion around how NCP’s strength had grown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncp-ministers-want-restrictions-further-relaxed/articleshow/86978191.cms||---
---||Kochi||25% new Covid cases in Kerala are breakthrough infections||KOCHI: About one-fourth of the daily new Covid cases in the state are breakthrough infections. Of the new cases tested positive daily, about 25-27% infected have had two doses of vaccine, with figures touching almost 30% in the last few days, as per the analysis of new cases in the fortnight. All infections that occur among fully vaccinated people 15 days after the second jab are considered breakthrough infections as per WHO stipulation. Health experts said that it means about 20-25% are breakthrough infections and this is set to increase further as the number of vaccinated people increases. Experts said that the breakthrough infection is especially high among healthcare workers (HCWs). But low hospitalisation rate is a positive sign of the effective vaccine drive. “To understand the dynamics of a progressive vaccination process, let us imagine two buckets. One bucket is filled with water and our task is to gradually empty it out to the other empty bucket. The full bucket represents the unvaccinated population before we start vaccination. As water is poured into the other bucket, it represents vaccinated people. As the vaccinated bucket gets filled, we will have more breakthrough infections. At the same time, the original bucket (unvaccinated) gets more empty. That means, less infections in the unvaccinated group,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, lead researcher of IMA-Kochi’s national survey on post-vaccination symptoms and experiences of healthcare workers in India. He said this is what is happening across the country. “However, even though the total number in this group is increasing, the rate (chance) of infection is still lower in the vaccinated group in Kerala. Also, breakthrough infections are milder than natural infections due to which hospitalisation is also less,” added Dr Jayadevan. Now, with 80% having antibodies, it means that lots of people are naturally infected, and so the distinction between vaccinated and unvaccinated is slowly fading, he said. Incidentally, data from the UK this week shows that the rate of infection is higher among the vaccinated group. This may be because they have been naturally infected and the vaccinated people are engaging in more social activity. Another explanation is that unvaccinated groups in the UK might have acquired some natural immunity that gave them protection. “When we look around, three out of four vaccinated people are safe from infections and hospitalisation and/or death are very minimal in this category,” said state health department’s N C Krishnaprasad, who has been compiling data from the Vaccine Review Report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/25-new-covid-cases-are-breakthrough-infections/articleshow/86976044.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Goa||No cases of foot & mouth disease detected after suspected outbreak||Panaji: All six samples of suspected foot and mouth disease (FMD) that were sent to the Regional Disease Diagnostic Lab (Western Zone), Pune for testing have returned negative, directorate of animal husbandry and veterinary services (AHVS) said. Veterinary officers monitoring the outbreak among cattle in Sanguem said that though the symptoms are the same as that of FMD, it is highly likely that the animals are suffering from foot rot, caused by unhygienic conditions. “No case of FMD has been confirmed till now. Even in the samples sent to Pune, no virus could be isolated. The disease looks to be FMD-like but there is no laboratory confirmation of the same,” said AHVS director, Augostinho Mesquita. He said that the department has detected some cases in the chief minister’s constituency, blood and saliva samples of which have been sent for testing. Results are awaited. As a precautionary measure, he said that dairy farmers must isolate the infected animals and ensure that no unknown person enters the cattle shed to avoid contamination. The infection was detected in 45 animals in two cattle sheds last week leading to apprehension among dairy farmers about livestock mortality. Veterinary officers in charge have urged the dairy farmers to get their animals vaccinated against FMD as a precaution. There are roughly 3,200 cattle in Sanguem owned by approximately 100 dairy farmers. “While FMD is caused due to a virus, the foot rot caused in these animals is bacterial. It could have been caused by mismanagement of the shed, presence of bacteria due to cow dung, softening of hooves owing to the cow dung,” Sanguem veterinary doctor, Saurabh Morajkar said. The symptoms exhibited by the cattle are similar to FMD — high fever, lack of appetite, salivation and worm infestation of the foot. The disease is likely to infect other hooved animals, like buffaloes, goats and pigs. “It is not confirmed yet whether the animals have FMD or not, despite which, dairy farmers must get their cattle vaccinated against the disease. We will start a vaccination drive later this month,” Morajkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-cases-of-foot-mouth-disease-detected-after-suspected-outbreak/articleshow/86978238.cms||Nida Sayed

The shutters of all dams, except Sholayar, were opened following continuous inflow in catchment areas. This aggravated public anxiety as water level in canals, rivers downstream increased rapidly. Control rooms were opened in all seven taluks and district headquarters in the wake of continuous downpour Chalakudy was the worst-affected as water level in Chalakudy River rose after sluice valves of Peringalkuthu dam were opened. KSEB opened them following the release of high quantity of water from Parambikulam and intense rain in catchment areas. According to district authorities, five relief camps were opened in Chalakudy and another was opened in Chavakkad. Officials said 290 people, including 70 children, were shifted from their homes. Revenue minister K Rajan convened an online meet of officials from various departments to review the steps taken to contain the crisis. He assured that adequate amount will be released from disaster mitigation fund for relief operations. Collector Haritha V Kumar, who visited Chalakudy, said steps were taken to ensure safety and health of the people in relief camps. An NDRF team was also sent to Chalakudy. Kumar said water was receding in Chalakudy River in the afternoon. KSEB engineer (in charge of Peringalkuthu dam) Suresh said water level in the dam had reduced by 2m by evening. Discharge from Parambikulam (13,600 cusecs on Monday night) will reduce to 2,000 cusecs on Tuesday evening, he said Deputy collector (disaster management) Madhusoodhanan said night travel in hill ranges was banned for three days as an orange alert was issued. Quarry and sand mining operations have been suspended, he said Shutters of Peechi dam were raised further following a rise in water level. Kumar said water level is being monitored and people staying on the banks of Manali River and the left and right canals of Peechi were asked to remain alert.

---||Nagpur||Cop, who was part of Gadkari’s security team, dismissed from service||Nagpur: Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s former personal security officer (PSO) Rajesh Tomar was dismissed from service by city police chief Amitesh Kumar around a week ago. Tomar, whose younger brother too is in the police department, was placed under suspension for a prolonged period before being removed from service. Sources said Tomar was dismissed due to absence from work over a long period of time. He is also facing an ‘open inquiry’ by the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) for having assests disproportionate to known source(s) of income. The ACB inquiry against Tomar started in February following a complaint. It’s learnt the state ACB was alerted about Tomar’s assets by a relative whose illicit relationship was exposed by the cop after a complaint was lodged at Bajaj Nagar police station. As per the complaint, an official said Tomar owns some property and is also in partnership with a businessman. CP Amitesh Kumar said charges against Tomar were proved during a departmental inquiry. He was also absent from work for a long time. “Tomar’s dismissal came after a thorough departmental inquiry in which charges probed against him were found to be true. He was also absent from duty for a long period,” said Kumar, adding, Tomar’s wealth was under the scanner and is being parallelly probed. “Tomar was discontinued as PSO to the minister more than a year back during the regime of my predecssor after having being in the post for a longer period,” he said. Sources stated Tomar earned trust as PSO to Gadkari before the minister himself raised objections about his alleged activities. According to an official, Gadkari had distanced himself from a few members of his team, including Tomar, after learning about their interference in some work. In another action, Kumar also dismissed head constable Roshan Ugale of Wathoda police station earlier this week following his arrest by Odisha police for possession of 22kg ganja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cop-who-was-part-of-gadkaris-security-team-dismissed-from-service/articleshow/86973264.cms||Soumitra Bose

Hours after farmer leaders told TOI they had handed Bharti over to the police on the day of the killings — and reported in this newspaper — police announced his arrest. Another “absconding accused”, Das, meanwhile, filed a surrender application on Tuesday. In a statement, police identified Bharti as an “accused”. About his arrest, senior prosecution officer SP Yadav told TOI, “Shekhar Bharti was nabbed by the SWAT team of crime branch near Palia bus stand in Kheri district around 7am on Tuesday.” He added, “Bharti was produced in the court of the chief judicial magistrate and sent to 14-day judicial custody. We have moved an application seeking his police remand for 14 days to gather evidence in the case. That application will be heard on Wednesday.” On Tuesday, TOI had reported that farmer leaders were questioning how Bharti could be an “absconding” person when they had got hold of him and handed him over to the police the same day. Two videos purportedly from that day, they had said, show Bharti — one in which he’s questioned by farmers and another in which a cop asks him why he was there. SIT officials declined to comment on the videos. The other person police said they were looking for and was “missing”, Ankit, moved a surrender application in the court of the chief judicial magistrate on Tuesday afternoon. His plea, along with that of another person only identified as Lateef, were moved by lawyers Avdhesh Kumar Singh and Neeraj Verma. Singh is also counsel for Ashish. “The names of Ankit Das and Lateef are not in the FIR but police are conducting raids at their houses and harassing their relatives,” Singh said. “They fear the police may frame them. So, they want to surrender in court. The CJM has asked for a report from Tikunia police station on whether they are wanted in any case. The SHO will submit the report on Wednesday. They are not named in the FIR.” Ankit, a contractor from Lucknow, owns the black Fortuner which was part of the convoy which ran over farmers during a black flag protest at Banbirpur on October 3. Police, meanwhile, took remand of Ashish. He was accompanied by two lawyers, Singh’s associates Muqaddar Giri and Achal Misra. Singh said, “The SIT has prepared a questionnaire. They interrogated him. They may take him to the spot on Wednesday. My associates will accompany him."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-violence-cops-announce-arrest-of-man-handed-over-to-police-whod-gone-missing/articleshow/86975981.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Sai Nagar near Kurichi is one such area, where 80 people are unwilling to take the jab. Health officials haven’t so far succeeded in convincing them to get inoculated. A health official with the city corporation said they were about to wrap up the vaccination drive in some wards, where only a few are left out to take the jab. “A survey is underway to identify the vaccinated and unvaccinated people in each ward, which is divided into small segments based on the population density for the purpose. There are 20 to 30 unvaccinated people in every area of ward 95 (Kurichi), while 80 people are yet to get vaccinated at Sai Nagar.” S Srikala, a resident of Sai Nagar, said she was not aware of the area-wise survey and its results. “Many people in my area have taken the vaccine. There was a vaccination camp in our locality on Monday and many used the chance to get inoculated. However, they (officials) cannot force anyone to take vaccine and it is solely an individual's discretion.” The official said they were taking every possible measure to inoculate them. “Recently, a special camp was conducted exclusively for them, but the response wasn’t encouraging. A few of them said they were waiting for foreign vaccines such as the one made by Pfizer. There are all highly educated people. We are trying to convince them to take a vaccine that is currently available in the country.” He said the residents of nine streets at NP Itteri were also unwilling to take the jab. “It is a slum area. We had conducted 15 vaccination camps there and the response was lukewarm.” Of the 2,500 eligible population here, 502 are yet to take vaccine. Another official said the residents were cooperating with them in most of the wards. “We have vaccinated all the eligible population in ward 11 (Saibaba Colony). We are very close to achieving the target in ward 23 (a part of RS Puram) and 24 (a part of Gandhipuram).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/people-reluctant-to-take-jab-hinder-drive-to-achieve-100-vaccination-in-dist/articleshow/86978179.cms||V Devanathan

About 1.20 crore people in the age group will have to be vaccinated in Jharkhand as and when the central government formally rolls out jabs for the children across the country. Although the state health department is yet to work out the detailed plans for carrying out the vaccination drive citing a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) from the Centre, officials said that these jabs may help in fighting a possible third wave to a large extent. They also added that it will steadily pave way for resumption of proper academics for children in this age group, majority of whom are not being able to study properly in a digitally handicapped state like Jharkhand. “Early start of vaccination for children will not just halt or weaken the expected third wave, it can also help in speedy reopening of schools. In a poor state like Jharkhand, where technology and access to it is a challenge in rural areas, online classes are still a distant dream,” said a senior official of the state health department. Bhuvanesh Pratap Singh, managing director (MD) of the state unit of the National Health Mission (NHM), who is also associated with the preparations for the possible third wave, said that roughly about 1.20 crore in the age group of 2-18 live in the state. “As per the 2011 census, state’s population is 3.25 crore. Of them, 1.80 crore are in adult category. And the rest fall in up to 18 years age group,” he said. As per Covid-19 manual released by the state government in June this year, around 9,000 children below the age of 14 were found Covid-positive. The figures may have increased by now, said sources adding that the rate of infection in children compared to adults was found lower but they are susceptible due to high transmission rate of the virus and vaccination among adults. In East Singhbhum, the district administration’s figures suggest that 2,199 children less than 14 years of age contracted Covid-19 since the outbreak of the virus. Out of them, 1,217 were boys and 982 girls. A boy and a girl died so far. The statewide composite figure wasn’t readily available, but NHM MD said that mortality among children was very less. “The rate of casualty among children in our state luckily has been very nil,” he said. Dr Rajesh Kumar, a noted paediatrician and head of Rani Children Hospital in Ranchi, said that they received several Covid cases among children along with post Covid issues as well during the first and second wave. “Till last month, we had about 150 cases, mostly of post Covid complications, also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS). MIS threatens heart failure, skin and issues of eyes among others if not detected early,” he said, adding that early start of vaccine for children will help in curbing the fatalities. Former secretary of Jamshedpur chapter of the Indian Medical Association, Mrityunjay Singh, said, “The government should now fasten the process of getting the nod of the World Health Organization (WHO) to start vaccination among children.” At a time when the state government has allowed opening of schools from class VI and above, parents are hoping for vaccine for kids soon. D Tarkeshwar, a 42-year-old mechanical engineer and resident of Sidhgora in Jamshedpur, said, “Nod for the use of the vaccine for children above two years is a great thing to happen particularly at a time when third wave fear is not over and schools have resumed physical classes. I have an eight-year-old son."

---||Ranchi||In this Chatra temple, devotees donate eyes made of gold and silver to the diety||Chatra: An ancient temple on Lemboia Pahad in Pathalgada of Chatra attracts devotees, who donate gold and silver eyes to the goddess round the year. But it is during the Navratra that the footfall increases. According to the temple committee members, this pahad (hill) is the place where the left eye of Goddess Sati is said to have fallen. The temple was searched by shepherds for the eye and later it became a major place of worship for people of Jharkhand, Bihar and other states. It has a 5.5-feet-high idol made of blackstone. The goddess has three heads and seven eyes because of which the temple committee and devotees claim that the left eye of Sati had fallen here. Secretary of the temple committee, Basudev Tiwary said, “This hill is important for Hindus as it has a connection to Goddess Sati. There is a reference to this temple in many books. Devotees whose wishes get fulfilled donate gold or silver eyes at the goddess’s feet as a token of gratitude.” During the pre-Covid period, around 500 people used to come daily to offer prayers. “During Navratra, the number doubles. However, due to the pandemic, only about 200-250 have come here since the start of the Navratra. The number will increase on the remaining days of Puja,” an official said. In December last year, thieves had stolen some jewellery and the crown of the goddess. To check the menace, a grand temple will be built where CCTV cameras will be installed, a temple official said. Jitendra Tiwary, a local journalist who is also associated with the temple committee, said though this place is not on the list of ‘shaktipeeths’, its name features in Markandey Puran and Durga Shaptshati. He said they get three to four donations of gold or silver eyes every month. “During Navratra, it increases manifold,” he said, but couldn’t offer the exact figure. “Whatever donation comes, the priest put it in the boxes which are opened afterwards,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-this-chatra-temple-devotees-donate-eyes-made-of-gold-and-silver-to-the-diety/articleshow/86976147.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand aims to double green power target set by Centre||RANCHI: If things move in the right direction, Jharkhand is going to be a hub of green power in the years to come. While the Renewable Power Obligation (RPO) of 2,005 MW comprising 1,995 MW solar power and 10 MW small hydel power set by Niti Aayog seems a mammoth target, the state in its draft policy has chosen a voluntary target of 5,000 MW solar power alone to be achieved as early as possible. As of date, Jharkhand figures towards the bottom in the list of state and union territories in terms of meeting the RPO obligation with over 5,400 million units of cumulative shortfall till 2017-18. Some efforts were made by pushing solar water pumps and roof-top grid connected solar power plants, established on the roof top of government buildings since 2018-19 but the target still remains big in the wake of the fact that the state must convert at least 25% of its net energy consumption to green sources by 2025. Talking to TOI, project head of Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (JREDA), Bijoy Kumar Sinha, said that once the Jharkhand state solar policy 2021 is approved and adopted, there would be no looking back. “Land availability is the biggest challenge for establishment of solar plants because we roughly require 4-5 acre for 1 MW of solar power,” he said, pointing to the fact that the new policy would allow compensation for land thereby encouraging people to opt for solar farms voluntarily. Sinha said that the rate of compensation payable to the land owner would depend upon area, size and other factors so it would be left on the power producers and the land providers to negotiate and decide the rate. The draft policy has fixed three broad project categories — utility scale solar with targeted capacity of 4,000 MWs comprising projects like solar park, floating plants and canal top, distributed solar of 720 MWs comprising rooftop, captive and agriculture besides off-grid solar of 280 MWs capacity which aims at in situ utilisation of the power produced. Solar power network arrangement for re-charging electrical vehicles (EVs) is also a part of the draft document. Sinha said that apart from introducing the concept of compensation/ rental for land lease, the government has decided to give cent percent exemption from stamp duty, conversion charges and court fee for registration of documents relating to lease of land. “Though we have plans to utilise barren government land, the compensation scheme would encourage private individuals to happily use their extra land and earn a few extra money,” he said. Once the land concern is over, the government has plans to incentivise private investment by setting up highly efficient plants by bringing in equipment from foreign countries. “No entry tax shall be levied by the state government on power generation or transmission equipment and building material used for solar power plants. Similarly, 100% SGST exemption would be given for all the inputs required for rooftop solar plants under net metering, solar power projects for captive use, solar pumps or EV charging stations for a period of five years,” Sinha said. The policy would also provide incentive for generation and trading of green power, encourage discoms to purchase the power generated and pave way for Jharkhand state electricity regulatory commission to introduce green tariff for the consumers to encourage overall consumption of clean energy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-aims-to-double-green-power-than-central-target/articleshow/86975965.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

According to reports, smoke billowed out of the company office located on the first floor of the Krishna Apartment at about 8.30 am after which an alarm was raised. District fire officer V K Singh said, “We immediately rushed two fire tenders to the spot but as the fire engulfed the entire apartment, we called another fire tender from the Dhanbad fire station, two from Jharia and one more from Sindri to douse the fire. One BCCL foam tender was also pressed into service to cloak the flames and stop them from spreading to other areas of the apartment.” It took nearly 5 hours for the seven fire tenders to douse the fire. Since people living in other flats of the building were not able to come down because of the thick smoke, the firefighters had to break open glass panes of some flats to help the residents climb down with ladders. “One 80-year-old woman and two toddlers were among those rescued through this route,” Singh said. The actual cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained but prima facie short circuit seems to have started the fire, Singh said, adding that the fire partly damaged a cloth shop located by the side of the insurance office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/narrow-escape-for-30-people-as-fire-engulfs-insurance-firm-office-in-dhanbad/articleshow/86976572.cms||Anil Ashutosh
---||Ranchi||Devotees violate Cov safety norms as pandals open||Ranchi: Even as the festive spirit grips Ranchiites with the start of the Durga Puja, the Covid-safety norms, including social distancing and mask-wearing, remained largely neglected by a vast number of devotees visiting the pandals and the temples on Tuesday. Since morning, a large number of people thronged the temples and the pandals to perform the Saptami rituals. Pradip Babu of Durga Badi Puja Samiti said, “Devotees came to our pandal to worship the deities even though their number is less than the pre-Covid period.” Notably, around 200 pandals have been set up in the city this year. Among the prominent ones are the railway station pandal, RR Sporting Club pandal on Ratu Road, Bakri Bazaar pandal, Durga Badi pandal, OCC Club pandal near Bada Talab, Kokar pandal and the Chandrashekhar Azad pandal on the Mahatma Gandhi Road. In accordance with the government directives, the puja committees have put up barricades around the pandals to allow worship of the deities from a distance. The committees have also arranged for sanitisers and masks at their venues apart from appealing to the devotees to maintain social distancing. Asok Purohit of Bakri Bazaar Puja pandal said the crowd was double than last year in the evening. He added that their number would increase sharply in the coming days. Despite the efforts of the administration and the committees, a large group of devotees are violating the safety norms. For instance, people present at the railway station Puja pandal were seen taking selfies without masks. Expressing the inability to ensure social distancing among the devotees, Purohit said, “The committee members cannot use force to ensure social distancing among devotees, particularly when their number is very large.” Alok Dubey, who is an organizing member of the pandal near the Nepal House, said members of his committee are making frequent announcements through the loudspeaker to maintain social distancing and wear masks. “At the most, we can appeal to the devotees to follow the safety norms,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/devotees-violate-cov-safety-norms-as-pandals-open/articleshow/86975727.cms||Sanjay Sahay

As part of the initiative, the civic body has launched information, education and communication (IEC) activities involving volunteers of the Durga Puja samitis. The puja organisers are informed about the use of the ‘khadya kalash’ for the storage of flowers, bel patra, sindoor (vermillion) and ash from incense sticks. City manager Rajendra Prasad said, “Upon filling up the khadya kalash (a moderate size earthen pot with holes on the surface of the pot) with the waste, it has to be buried. Weeks later, the stuff transforms into compost.” Prasad said the civic body has distributed khadya kalash to all puja samitis with the launch of the IEC drive on Monday. With tonnes of flowers and bel patras generated every day at pandals and temples during Durga Puja, the civic body believes the initiative would substantially stop water bodies from being polluted by waste items. “People tend to throw flowers, bel patras into ponds, lake and rivers. With the use of khadya kalash, the puja waste can be easily stored at the temple or the pandal site to make compost,” he said. Appealing to people to stop dumping the puja paraphernalia, Prasad said, “Sindoor contains chemicals that threaten the flora and fauna. Hence it is advisable to the people to use the earthen pot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/jugsalai-civic-body-kicks-off-eco-friendly-puja-waste-disposal-drive/articleshow/86975771.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||2008 batch college teachers await promotion, writes to guv for help||Ranchi: All India Federation of University and College Teacher’s Organisation (AIFUCTO) has requested Jharkhand Governor Ramesh Bais and the University Grants Commission to intervene and remove the hindrance in promotion of 2008 batch college and university teachers. In a memorandum mailed to the Governor on Sunday, AIFUCTO stated that the faculty members appointed in 2008 have been denied promotion and increase in grade pay since they joined due to a statute gap. The AIFUCTO further stated that the Jharkhand government had neither extended the career advancement scheme beyond December 31, 2008 nor it made any provision for the promotion of teachers. It added that the state government brought a statute effective from August 5 regarding appointment and promotion of university and college teachers based on the UGC regulation 2018. The absence of a statute between December 2008 and August 2021 has prevented the promotion of hundreds of teachers. Dr Rakesh Kumar of Sidhu Kanho Murmu University said, “I joined the service in 2008 with Phd. My academic grade pay should have increased from Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000 after four years and from Rs 7,000 to Rs 8,000 after an additional five years. After three more years, I should have become associate professor with academic grade pay of Rs 9,000. However, I am still at the entry-level post of assistant professor with grade pay of Rs 6,000.” In the memorandum, the AIFUCTO said that the promotion of teachers by the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) violates the autonomy of universities. It added that the system has led to stagnation of career of teachers in Jharkhand. It requested the governor to review the entire promotion process of university and college teachers followed in Jharkhand including the role of JPSC in this matter. AIFUCTO letter was sent in view of the memorandum submitted by the Federation of University Teacher’s Association of Jharkhand, which is affiliated to AIFUCTO, to the Governor’s office on September 5. The letter was signed by 555 college teachers of 2008 batch from different universities of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2008-batch-college-teachers-await-promotion-writes-to-guv-for-help/articleshow/86976020.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The video, which is said to be five days old, has gone viral after which the action has been initiated. The pharmacist, however, said he was burning only empty cartons and not medicines. On Tuesday, civil surgeon Dr S N Singh said he has formed a team to probe the incident against the pharmacist, Shailendra Thakur, who reportedly featured in the video. Sources, however, said medicines including calcium, iron tablets, ORS, syringes, salines and injections administered during pregnancy and at the time of delivery and others were burned. The sources further said the government supplies medicines to all health centres for free distribution to patients, but negligence in distribution results in the expiry of these medicines. Many political party leaders have demanded an inquiry and action against the culprits involved in the burning. They claimed that doctors, instead of doing duty at the health centres, are busy in private practice and the healthcare workers also don’t care about the patients. They even alleged that since doctors prescribe expensive medicines, those supplied by the government for free distribution often crosses the expiry date and are disposed of. “A team has been formed for a thorough probe. In response to the show-cause notice, the pharmacist claimed that he was burning empty cartons and not medicines,” Dr Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/civil-surgeon-orders-probe-after-sadar-hospital-staff-found-burning-medicines/articleshow/86976526.cms||---

Denied information on appointments carried out by university officials, three syndicate members and seven senate members have demanded that the state government should constitute an inquiry committee to probe the recruitments carried out by the varsity. A group of syndicate and senate members first met Inamdar in Vadodara. Inamdar is a government nominated senate member in the university. Later, Inamdar along with the group reached Gandhinagar to meet Vaghani. The MLA in his letter addressed to Gujarat chief minister (CM) Bhupendra Patel has sought strict action against all those responsible for alleged irregularities in the recruitment process. The university had started recruitment process for teaching and non-teaching positions over a year ago. But after complaints of nepotism and favouritism, the state government had issued oral directives to stop the appointment process. In August, MSU once again received nod to go ahead with the recruitments. The process was carried out for vacant posts in select departments and faculties from September 1 to 20. “Of the 100 posts for which the interviews were held only 27 posts were filled up. When syndicate members demanded details of the candidates and their appointments, the officials denied it, indicating that some wrongdoing has happened. I have requested CM and education minister to constitute an inquiry committee and I am sure that they will do the needful,” said Inamdar. “We are demanding that professor Parimal Vyas should be removed as vice-chancellor of MSU and the state government should appoint a pro vice-chancellor and re-start the recruitment process with full transparency,” said syndicate member Hasmuk Vaghela.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/order-probe-into-msu-job-scam-govt-urged/articleshow/86974975.cms||---

It also quashed recommendations made by the Goa commission for ST and SC, and the Goa commission for OBC, favouring reservations. The court held that the recommendations of the two commissions “is quite a serious matter” and should have been rendered with the same level of seriousness. The recommendations of the commission for SC/ST are liable to be set aside because they were made “in an extremely hurried, casual and cavalier manner, without even a semblance of application of mind”, the court said. “The recommendations were made without even issuing any notice to the parties that were likely to be affected or in any case without even bothering to hear the version of the state government or more particularly the deans of GMC and GDC,” the division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar said. Over 100 doctors had challenged the government’s decision to implement reservation for GMC’s PG courses from the academic year 2021-22. The petitioner’s lawyer D Lawande said the state government had decided not to apply reservation policy to PG courses at GMC and that for over 14 years there was no reservation. He said by doing this the state had acted contrary to its own rules. The court stated that the record indicates quite a flurry of activities between February 20, 2020 and May 4, 2020. On February 20, 2020, the president of Gomantak Dhangar Samajonatti Mandal Goa addressed a representation to the chief minister seeking reservation for the dhangar community for PG courses in GMC and GDC. Thereafter on May 4, 2020, the state government took the decision to reserve 41% seats at the PG courses from the academic year 2021-2022. “During these three months, quite hurriedly two complaints were filed before the SC/ST commission and OBC commission, and these two commissions, within hardly two to three days from the receipt of such complaints, made their so-called recommendations to the state government,” the court observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/high-court-strikes-down-govt-order-reserving-41-pg-seats-in-gmc/articleshow/86976567.cms||---

According to the complainant Vinod, his nephew’s wife Padma and her niece Trupti went to play garba in their village on October 10. After few minutes, one of the accused Tara Parmar asked them to leave the venue. They were allegedly told that they cannot join the garba with other villagers. On being insulted, Padma and Trupti left from there. However, Vinod, who was present there, tried calling the sarpanch to intervene but the sarpanch did not hear Vinod. Later, three other accused — Chhatrasinh Parmar, Mukesh Parmar and Lala Parmar — approached Vinod and hurled abuses at him. They got into an altercation as trio told Vinod that women from his community cannot play garba with people from their community. Vinod went to Savli police station and lodged a complaint against Chhatrasinh, Mukesh, Lala and Tara for using obscene words. On Monday, additional forces were deployed at Pilol village to ensure that the situation does not escalate and spread further to neighbouring villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/four-stop-dalit-women-from-playing-garba-held/articleshow/86975025.cms||---

Reservations would leave merit candidates with very few seats, he had said. “The 49 seats are distributed over 20 specialities with each getting anywhere from one seat to seven seats. If we do reservation in this, very few seats would be left for merit candidates,” dean S M Bandekar had said. Pointing out that reservations are given in the all India quota seats, the dean had said that admission for PG courses in GMC was so far conducted without any reservation to SC, ST and OBC category. “Only 3% reservation was given to persons with disabilities from 2011. The selection for PG seats was done purely on merit (NEET-PG) score. This was because post-graduate students deal with all emergencies and patients' lives. So, in order to get quality service, no reservation is kept for any other category as GMC is the single medical college in the state of Goa with a total number of 98 post graduate degree seats of which 50% seats go to the all India category,” he had written.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmc-dean-was-against-quota/articleshow/86976666.cms||---

The order is taking away the constitutional rights of the dalits, SCs and STs,” Chodankar told reporters in the presence of Congress observer P Chidambaram, AICC in-charge of Goa desk Dinesh Gundu Rao, and opposition leader Digambar Kamat. Chodankar charged the government with following the RSS ideology which he said was against dalits, STs and SCs. “This is a deliberate attempt by the government to deprive dalits, ST, SCs of their constitutional rights,” Chodankar said. “The government failed in making necessary changes in the laws (before issuing the notification for reservation). There was no application of mind…the government has intentionally done this. This has exposed the anti-bahujan samaj mentality, attitude and policy of the government at the Centre and in the state. This is not the first time that the government has done this. It is deliberately making some faults so that the courts can subsequently take action (to reverse the moves),” Chodankar said. The fallout of the order, Chodankar said, would facilitate students from outside Goa in taking admissions to post-graduate courses, while depriving Goans of the benefits. Meanwhile, Konkani writer Dilip Borkar joined Congress on Tuesday and was welcomed into the party fold on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-order-exposes-govts-anti-bahujan-samaj-mentality/articleshow/86976708.cms||---

Ali (40), a native of Narowal district in Pakistan’s Punjab, was heading sleeper cells after infiltrating the country in 2004. He was based in J&K between 2009 and 2017. Pakistan’s ISI had used Ashraf in the past to carry out targeted killings and reactivated him to carry out one final strike. The plan, police said, was to cause mass casualties around Dussehra or Diwali, while firing indiscriminately on crowds in markets. DCP Pramod Kushwaha said his team seized the AK-47 rifle, extra magazine, 60 rounds, a hand grenade and two Chinese Star pistols with 50 rounds from Ali’s hideout in Kalindi Kunj. He had rented two places to stay, one in Shashtri Nagar’s C-Block and the second in Turkman Gate. Over the past 17 years, Ali reportedly lived in many states with the assumed Indian identity of Ali Ahmed Noori. An Indian passport and other documents were also seized from him. The operation was carried out by a team led by ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan after an intelligence input was received two months ago suggesting that a suspect heading sleeper cells had been reactivated. “Two teams comprising inspectors Vinod Badola and Ravinder Tyagi and sub-inspectors Sunder Gautam and Yashpal Bhati were tasked to develop information and mount surveillance,” added Kushwaha. After a few weeks, police discovered that a Pakistani national, directed to undertake terror attacks in India, was in the advanced stage of procuring arms and explosives. “When the identity of the terrorist was established, it was revealed that he was an active part of a sleeper cell node that had carried out many attacks and espionage activities in India over several years. He had managed to obtain Indian identities and was living in Delhi under the cover of a peer maulana,” said the deputy commissioner of police. On October 8, an FIR was lodged on the basis of the team’s findings and a manhunt for the suspect broadly located in east Delhi was launched. On October 11, policemen managed to pinpoint his location to Ramesh Park in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar after which a raid was conducted and he was apprehended. “After his interrogation, raids were carried out in and around Trans-Yamuna areas and a large cache of arms and ammunition was seized,” DCP Kushwaha added. Raids are being conducted to locate other members of the sleeper cells. Ali was jointly interrogated by intelligence agencies and the National Investigation Agency. His role in many terrorist activities, including the Delhi High Court blast of 2011, was being probed, sources said. “He is suspected to be involved in many terror strikes in Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of India in the past. Recently, he was tasked by his Pakistani handler to orchestrate terror strikes during the festive season. The seized arms and ammunition were arranged by the Pakistani handler. Further probe is on in this regard,” deputy commissioner of police Kushwaha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-cops-foil-plot-to-unleash-terror-during-festive-season-arrest-pakistani-man/articleshow/86981434.cms||Raj Shekhar

But bringing an end to the issue is proving to be a daunting task. While a long-term solution may take time, round-the-clock drives to keep cattle away from the streets too aren’t yielding desired result as one has to negotiate between bovine animals while driving on the roads. Cattle owners have, however, started ensuring that the animals do not reach the main roads to avoid them getting impounded by the authorities. But it has resulted in a new problem in some pockets of the city where the interior roads are now taken over by the cattle. VMC’s director encroachment removal, security and parks and gardens, Dr Mangesh Jaiswal said that according to rough estimates based on the 2019 livestock census there were around 19,000 bovines in the city. These were being kept by around 2,300 families. At the other end, VMC has not given permission to any person or organization to keep cattle inside the city limits. Jaiswal said that since the VMC adopted the norm of not releasing impounded cattle without registering offences, the number of cattle had not been increasing in the city. “Many persons have stopped keeping cattle in the city and have vacated spaces they used for cattle rearing,” he said. The VMC had started the process of identifying cattle ponds in the city and asking them to apply for licence. Way back in 2015, the VMC officials had also prepared a model law for regulation and restriction of keeping cattle in city limits. This draft was sent to the state government, but nothing was heard about it later. After change of guards at VMC, nobody seems to have bothered about the draft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vmc-faces-uphill-task-of-clearing-roads-of-cattle/articleshow/86975131.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Delhi||Delhi: 32 Tihar Jail officials booked for link with Unitech promoters||NEW DELHI: Crime Branch has filed an FIR under IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act after 32 officials of Tihar Jail were allegedly found hand in gloves with Unitech promoters Ajay and Sanjay Chandra, officials said on Tuesday. Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana has also written to the Union home ministry and the director general of Delhi prisons for taking action. The accused officials are from jail number 7 in Tihar. Their arrests are likely in the coming days, sources said. The Supreme Court had earlier asked Asthana to probe the nexus after taking note of a status report filed by Enforcement Directorate, which highlighted the alleged misuse of Tihar Jail premises by the Chandra brothers. The SC had transferred them to the Arthur Road and Taloja central jails in Mumbai. The police chief submitted a report on September 28 after visiting Mumbai and Tihar jails. On October 6, the apex court granted permission to conduct a full-fledged criminal investigation based on the inquiry conducted by Delhi Police. The court had also directed that the Tihar officials, prima facie found to be complicit, be placed under suspension. It had further directed the home ministry to respond to the suggestions in the report submitted by the commissioner of Delhi Police. Delhi Police had questioned the Unitech promoters lodged in the Mumbai jails. Two deputy commissioners of police and a few other cops had gone to Mumbai along with police commissioner Asthana in connection with the probe. ED’s report elaborated on how the Unitech brothers threatened witnesses apart from operating a free communications network and sending instructions from inside the jail. As per the report, the accused were engaging in illegal activities by flouting the jail manual and also making transfer of assets and dissipating the proceeds of crime from their secret office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/32-tihar-officials-booked-for-link-with-unitech-promoters/articleshow/86977631.cms||---
---||Delhi||NTPC supplying only half of Delhi’s power share, says minister Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: Power minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said NTPC Ltd, the country’s largest producer of electricity, has capped its capacity and asked if it was due to coal shortage or it had been asked by the Centre to do so. If the capacity is reduced further, Delhi may see a power blackout, Jain said. All coal-reliant power plants in Delhi, he pointed out, are non-functional and NTPC Ltd, which has to supply 3,500MW to Delhi under the power purchase agreement, is currently providing only half of it — 1,750MW. Jain claimed NTPC Ltd had halved the production capacity at all plants across the country. “There can be two reasons; first, there is coal shortage, or second, the Centre has told them to do it,” he said. “On one hand, the central government says there is no shortage of coal; on the other hand, they say the responsibility of coal will now be handled by the Union minister,” Jain pointed out. “The Centre should say whether there is a shortage of coal or if it is being done intentionally!” Jain said. The chief ministers of five to six states, he mentioned, have written to the Prime Minister on the issue. “Be it Punjab, Andhra Pradesh or Uttar Pradesh, power cuts are being imposed everywhere except Delhi. The Delhi government is providing 24x7 electricity to the people of Delhi even after buying electricity at higher rates,” he stressed. The minister alleged that Delhi had gas-powered plants but the Centre had stopped giving gas to Delhi at a controlled rate due to which Delhi government had to buy gas at market rates to generate electricity. “This has increased the cost of power generation for the Delhi government. Despite this, there has been no power cut in the capital,” he said. “The Delhi government is being forced to buy electricity at a high price because NTPC is providing only half the agreed electricity to Delhi,” he claimed. The Centre also shared a “fact sheet” on Delhi’s power situation and claimed that the national capital’s electricity demand had been met adequately without any deficit. It said the peak power demand of Delhi was 4,536MW and the energy demand was 96.2 milion units on Sunday. According to the statement, “As per the information received from Delhi discoms, there was no outage on account of power shortage as the required amount of power was supplied to them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ntpc-supplying-only-half-of-citys-power-share-jain/articleshow/86977460.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Delhi||Now, know sources of pollution in Delhi in next 5 days||NEW DELHI: The Decision Support System (DSS), which has been developed by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology-Pune to forecast the sources of local and regional pollution which can impact Delhi’s air, says the contribution of Delhi’s transport is likely to be highest to Delhi’s PM2.5, around 25%, followed by biomass burning at 11%, on Wednesday at 8.30 pm IST. DSS is a numerical model-based framework for identifying sources of particulate matter pollution in Delhi. It forecasts sources of pollution, which can affect Delhi’s PM2.5, for the next 120 hours. The system gives the forecast on the contribution of emissions from Delhi and the surrounding 19 districts of UP and Haryana besides the share of emissions from eight different sectors in Delhi to the city’s air quality. It predicts the share from biomass-burning activities in the neighbouring states to Delhi’s PM 2.5. According to the system, the contributions of local emissions — waste burning, road dust and construction — are likely to be 2.13%, 1.74% and 3.53%, respectively, on Thursday at 8.30pm. With the neighbouring districts having an impact on the air quality of Delhi, the share of Jhajjar is expected to be 8.31% and Rohtak is likely to be 7.54% on Thursday at 8.30 pm. “For 19 neighbouring districts, all sources of emissions have been considered. The contribution of surrounding districts to Delhi’s PM2.5 has been made considering the prevailing wind direction,” said a scientist. Track the pollution level in your cityThe forecast of DDS says the share of biomass burning is likely to be around 10-11% from Wednesday to Friday. “The number of fire counts can vary on present day as compared to the prediction of DSS as the system is based on the algorithm considering the stubble burning scenario of the past 20 years,” said a scientist. Apart from predicting local and non-local fractional contribution to PM2.5 in Delhi over the next 120 hours, DSS gives different scenarios on the impact on Delhi’s air quality if emissions from one sector are reduced by 20%, 40% or 60%. For instance, if the emissions from Delhi transport are reduced by 20%, the air quality is expected to improve by 4.69% on Thursday. Another scenario is of emissions from Rohtak getting reduced by 40% which would lead to air quality improving by 3% on Thursday. Sachin Ghude, scientist and head, air quality forecasting group, IITM, told TOI, “This unique research has made Indian agencies rank ahead of any other operational agencies across the globe that makes air quality forecast.” The scientists said the system highlights the important emission sources responsible for the degraded air quality in Delhi and suggests possible solutions to the policymakers. The system can help agencies concerned to take necessary actions to reduce emissions. “We identified emissions from different sources and from neighbouring districts. We traced them in the model using a tracer approach. The system can forecast the contribution of emissions from eight different sectors from Delhi and neighbouring 19 districts to the air quality of Delhi,” said Gaurav Govardhan, scientist at IITM. He added any person can check the impact of different emissions on the capital’s air at https://ews.tropmet.res.in/dss. Meanwhile, SAFAR, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said on Tuesday, “Delhi’s AQI is in the ‘moderate’ category. Under very dry condition, local dust gets re-suspended leading to high PM10 in addition to meso-scale transport of dust from desert region. This condition is leading to moderate AQI in Delhi, and will keep so for the next three days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/now-know-sources-of-pollution-in-delhi-in-next-5-days/articleshow/86981562.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||India||Denied hall ticket for not paying fee, girl tops state supplementary exam||BENGALURU: A Karnataka farmer’s daughter, who scored 96% in Class 9 but lost her school admission as she couldn’t pay the fees, has topped the state board Class 10 supplementary exam after having to skip the main exam as she was denied a hall ticket. Greeshma Nayak scored 599 out of 625 in the exam, the results of which were declared on Monday. She said she wants to be a doctor. On Tuesday, renowned cardiologist Dr Devi Shetty offered to sponsor Greeshma’s studies. He also sought a mechanism to raise funds for all such students in the future. “I would support anyone who wants to become a doctor. I want her to become a cardiologist. She must commit herself to secure a seat in a government medical college,” Shetty said. “I will work hard to study well in PUC (Plus 2), and get a seat in MBBS,” Greeshma responded. “I believe that every student has the right to study.” In July, after an email from Greeshma, then school education minister S Suresh Kumar had assured her that she would not lose the entire year. GRITTY GIRLNot waiver, sought more time to pay fees: Greeshma’s dadI rushed to her home, consoled her and told her to get ready for the supplementary exam and that I will take the responsibility of ensuring she gets the chance to appear for it. I’m happy that she aced the exam. I congratulate her,” ex-school education minister S Suresh Kumar said. Greeshma took the supplementary exam in September as a fresh candidate. The family lives in Hanumanthapura in Tumakuru district, and Greeshma was enrolled in a residential school in Dakshina Kannada. She was denied a hall ticket for SSLC as she had not paid the class 9 fees and was not officially enrolled in class 10. She had scored 96% in Class 9. Greeshma’s father, Narasimha Murthy, had told TOI he had merely sought more time to pay the fees due to financial difficulties in the pandemic, not a waiver. Greeshma was taught at home by her 19-year-old sister, a BSc agriculture student. “My sister taught me core subjects in front of a board in simulation of classroom experience,” she said. A day after TOI frontpaged Greeshma’s feat in its Bengaluru edition, Shetty said he was moved by her plight. “There has to be a structure. Data on how much money is pending must be announced before students are barred from exam halls. How much can it be? Rs 20 lakh, Rs 30 lakh, or Rs one crore? It’s not difficult to raise. The government need not divulge names or details of the children or their parents. We don’t need to know. Just the amount of school fees pending can be announced. Many of us will be able to pay fees and help these children take final exams.” Shetty said people erroneously think the brightest kids who score highest marks go on to become outstanding doctors. “It’s the kids who have the passion, fire in the belly to learn the skill for 24 hours a day, who go on to change the rules of the game,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/denied-hall-ticket-for-not-paying-fee-girl-tops-state-supplementary-exam/articleshow/86981597.cms||---

But Nehal Sutariya swung to the tunes of garba in his neighbourhood for the first time this year as the government has banned commercial Navratri venues amid Covid-19 concerns. And Nehal said that the experience has been thrilling. “I have always played garba at big venues with my group. I never thought that some day I would be playing sheri garba that usually has a limited crowd. But what fun it has been to play with friends, family and neighbours this year. There is also this feeling of community gathering as we all know each other,” Nehal, an advocate, said. A resident of Sama-Savli Road, Nehal said that sheri garbas are hassle-free and also save a lot of time and energy. Like Nehal, many Barodians are experiencing the joy of sheri garbas for the first time this year. “It’s not just pocket-friendly but also much more fun than playing in huge crowds,” said Nakul Chavda, M S University student. The ban on big venues has led to a sudden increase in the number of people at sheri garbas and Navratri celebrations in residential colonies this year. While some have hired singing troupes to perform, others preferred to play on pre-recorded garbas on the music system. The city hosts some of the biggest sheri garbas near Mandvi, Nyay Mandir, Fatehgunj, Akota and Manjalpur. “Sheri garbas has always been an identity of the cultural capital of Gujarat but many Barodians took to the big venues that offered better music and facilities,” said Bharti Naik, a professional. “So, I have been swirling to the tunes of Sheri Garba and the enjoyment is unparalleled. Even if the big venues host Navratri from next year, I may play in here for some days,” she added. Organisers of sheri garbas too are overwhelmed with the crowd this time. “I never thought our venue would get so many revellers. After the big venues became popular, sheri garbas saw a thin crowd for many years. But after witnessing a large number of revellers at our venue, I recalled the old times when these garbas were the most happening place during Navratri,” said Minesh Shah of Mehta Pol sheri garba.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ban-on-big-venues-makes-revellers-swirl-to-sheri-garba-tunes-this-year/articleshow/86975188.cms||Tushar Tere
