The killing of 45-year-old Shamsuddin Sofi, alias Sham Sofi, coincided with the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arresting five more overground operatives of various outfits as part of a crackdown on Kashmir's terror ecosystem that has supposedly spawned new threats hiding in plain sight. Sofi was part of a group of terrorists cornered by a joint team of the police, the Army's 42 Rashtriya Rifles and CRPF in the Waggad area of Tral, where BJP councillor Rakesh Pandita was killed last June by an offshoot of the proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba. "We launched a cordon-and-search operation in that area after receiving information from Awantipora police about terrorist movement there. The hiding ultras fired at the advancing forces, triggering a gunfight in which one of them was killed. The slain terrorist turned out to be Jaish commander Sofi," a police official said. Sofi, a resident of Satura Tral in Pulwama district, had found his moorings in terrorism as an overground worker providing logistical and other support to Jaish terrorists from Pakistan. He had been arrested in 2004 under the Public Safety Act, but continued his association with Jaish after his release, mainly by way of arranging shelter for terrorists in the Tral area. He joined the Jaish fold as a commander in 2019, carrying out a series of attacks on security forces and civilians, IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said. Sofi, whose brother Nazir used to assist Hizbul Mujahideen till he switched loyalty to Jaish, was also known to radicalise and recruit local youth for the outfit. He is the eighth ultra to be gunned down by security forces in J&K since Monday, when five Army personnel were killed fighting terrorist infiltrators in the frontier district of Poonch in Jammu. Weapons, ammunition and various incriminating material were found at the Tral encounter site, IGP Kumar said. In the day's other counter-terrorism success, a series of raids by the NIA at multiple locations in Srinagar, Budgam, Pulwama and Shopian districts led to the arrest of five overground terror suspects identified as Mohammad Haneef Chiralu, Hafeez, Owais Dar, Mateen Bhat and Arif Farooq Bhat. The agency had picked up four suspects on Tuesday in connection with a plot to carry out attacks in J&K and major Indian cities. The conspiracy involves Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen and Al Badr, an NIA spokesperson said. Several electronic devices and incriminating documents were confiscated during raids on two buildings in Srinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wanted-jaish-commander-shot-in-jk-gunfight-5-held-in-nia-raids-on-terror-caucus/articleshow/87003147.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Infosys’s revenue was up 20.7% to $3.9 billion. In constant currency (which discounts the impact of cross-currency fluctuations), the growth was 19.4%, its fastest in 11 years. Wipro grew as much as 29.5%, to $2.6 billion. In constant currency, it was 28.8%. But a part of that growth came from its acquisitions of UK-based Capco and Australia-based Ampion earlier this calendar year. Wipro’s share on NYSE was up almost 8%. Infosys’s was up 3.4%. Both companies did much better than TCS, which grew by 16.8% in dollar terms, and 15.5% in constant currency. But TCS, which announced results last week, is also a much bigger company. Indian IT services companies are benefiting from the surging demand for digital transformation from enterprises globally. Organisations around the world see digitisation as key to sustainability, a trend that the pandemic sharply accelerated. Infosys’s strong performance and future visibility around its order book encouraged the company to raise its revenue guidance for the second consecutive quarter. For the full year, it now expects revenue to be up 16.5%-17.5%. Three months ago, it had forecast 14%-16%, and at the beginning of the financial year, it had guided for 12-14%, indicating that the business outlook has improved sharply. Salil Parekh, CEO of Infosys, said the company has increased market share and has demonstrated more and more trust with its clients. Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte said the demand environment is very strong “and the pipeline, which is the highest in recent quarters, is a reflection of that.” The company has been witnessing a smart turnaround since Delaporte’s arrival around the middle of last year. Sequentially, the growth this quarter was 8.1%, blowing past its guidance of 5-7%. This was rarely the case in the past few years. Based on the strong demand, Wipro expects to grow between 2% and 4% sequentially in the third quarter, which translates to 27-30% in constant currency when compared to last year. Its annual revenue run-rate surpassed the $10 billion mark. Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) was the top performer for both companies. For Wipro, it grew 43% on constant currency, while the consumer business was up 38%. Wipro’s operating margin was down 100 basis points YoY to 17.8%, mainly due to salary hikes the company gave in September. It also spent more to hire external talent. Infosys’s operating margin declined 1.6% YoY. Infosys CFO Nilanjan Roy said the margin was impacted by compensation increase and because of higher subcontracting expense. “We are working on an aggressive cost optimisation programme to negate some of the headwinds. We are comfortable with our margin guidance of 22-24%,” he said. Infosys’s signed large deals worth $2.1 billion in the last quarter. Parekh said it is a reflection of its strategic focus and the strength of its digital offerings “Our digital business grew 42%, and is now 56% of our overall revenue. Within digital, cloud is growing very fast,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/infosys-wipros-revenues-zoom-over-20-in-quarter-2/articleshow/87003374.cms||---

Infosys’s attrition rose to 20.1%, a 600 basis points increase from 13.9% in the June quarter.“Attrition reflects the huge demand we are seeing and the supply shortage which is to some extent due to lack of mobility in some of the geographies. The supply crunch will continue for a few quarters,” said Infosys COO UB Pravin Rao.Infosys has taken several measures to contain attrition including two compensation increases in January and July this year.Return to office: Rao said that beginning October, Infosys will ask its senior leaders to work out of office once a week and would ask them to undertake interventions with their teams to have a larger population return to work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/infosys-raises-fresher-hiring-target-by-10k/articleshow/87003384.cms||---

Wipro has, on a net basis, added 23,653 people between April and September, compared to 2,357 in the same period last year. The company’s headcount was 221,365 at the end of September.“We will have to make sure the supply side is not a constraint on demand but will have to keep a close focus to drive this agenda,” said Govil, alluding to the voluntary attrition levels, which shot up to 20.5% from 15.5% sequentially. “Attrition will be on a heightened level for the next two to three quarters. Given the opportunities out there and the skill gap, it will not come down immediately,” added Govil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/wipro-to-hike-campus-hiring-to-17k-this-year/articleshow/87003393.cms||Avik Das

---||World||After row with army over new ISI chief, Imran govt says process is on||ISLAMABAD: The process for the appointment of Pakistan’s spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), has been underway after completion of consultations between prime minister Imran Khan and army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, the government announced on Wednesday. On October 6, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), army’s media wing, had announced the name of Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum as the replacement for the outgoing ISI chief, Faiz Hameed. Hameed, according to the ISPR, had been transferred to Peshawar in the northwest as corps commander. Despite the passage of the week after the ISPR announcements, a notification confirming Lt Gen Anjum’s appointment as the new head of the spy agency was not issued by the PM’s office, leading to speculation in Islamabad on the straining civil-military relations. The announcement by the Pakistani government on Wednesday came a day after Khan’s top political aide Amir Dogar claimed that the PM wanted to retain outgoing spymaster Hameed as ISI chief due to the evolving situation in Afghanistan, while the information minister Fawad Chaudhry had stressed that it was the prerogative of the prime minister to appoint the next chief. Chaudhry has now said that consultations between Khan and Bajwa have been completed and the process for the new appointment has begun. Sources confided that later on Wednesday the PM Office received a summary for the appointment of the new ISI chief from the ministry of defence. The government had remained tight-lipped on the issue after the ISPR announcement and finally broke its silence on Tuesday, saying that the PM wanted to retain Hameed. It was followed by a lengthy meeting between the prime minister and the army chief, prompting the government to announce that the issue has been settled. According to government authorities, the appointment of the ISI’s chief has been the prerogative of the prime minister and the defence ministry has to recommend him three names. It’s the PM’s discretion to choose one from them or appoint someone else. Experts in defence matters, however, say the procedure for the appointment of the ISI DG is neither mentioned in the Constitution nor the Army Act, and all past appointments were made as per traditions under which the army chief proposes three names to the prime minister who then makes the final decision. A conversation with senior officials at the ministry of defence revealed that some cracks had emerged in the relationship between the top civil and military leadership in recent weeks over PM’s assertion on retaining the outgoing spymaster. While the PM’s insistence had raised questions about Khan’s possible political motives, the military’s unilateral move by notifying appointment of new spymaster without the PM’s approval had caused a standoff between the two. The top security leadership has also been said to be seriously concerned over PM’s recent claims and comments on critical foreign policy and security matters during interviews with western media outlets. The military that has been fighting the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a proscribed umbrella organisation of over two-dozen terrorist groups, for the past 15 years seems to be unwilling on Khan’s handling of the terrorist outfits. Khan had admitted that he was willing to reconcile with the TTP which had killed thousands of Pakistanis, including kids, women, members of minority communities and civil-military officials among others. He said that his government’s talks with the TTP were part of the reconciliation process and that those who are willing to lay down arms would be pardoned. The offer of amnesty raises questions about the government’s counterterrorism policy. For the top military brass, the reconciliation move would wipe out the gains made by the security forces in the battle against the terrorist outfits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/after-row-with-army-over-new-isi-chief-imran-govt-says-process-is-on/articleshow/87003438.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||Gurgaon||Crowds return to Ramlilas in Gurgaon||Ramlilas have been a staple of Gurgaon's festive season for close to five decades now. Even before the town transformed into the Millennium City, Ramlila committees were entertaining people. Last year, that stopped. Only two of the city’s two dozen Ramlilas staged performances and even they weren't fully open to the public. Well, the doors have reopened this year, even though with limited gathering and COVID-19 protocols in place. And the crowd is back, too. 'Social distancing is encouraged'Shri Durga Ramlila in Jacobpura, the city's oldest Ramlila, has reduced its seating capacity from over 2,000 to just 400. "We have put up enclosures around the Ramlila Ground and boosted security. Only 400 people are allowed and everyone has to get thermal screening done and wear masks. We encourage those people who have had two shots of the vaccine to come but won’t turn anyone away," says Rajkumar Saini, media in-charge of the committee. The artistes and performers say adapting has been challenging but it is getting easier for them. Karan Bakshi, who plays Ram in Jacobpura's Ramlila, says, "It's all about how badly you want to do it. It was tough at first but we have been taking the same precautions in other parts of life so it became easier to do the same during rehearsals too." They do, however, rue not having a full house for their performances. Sameer Tanwar, who plays Lakshman, adds, "As an artiste, you do want a full crowd so when that doesn’t happen, it is disappointing but then we are livestreaming this, so I guess everyone is still watching, even if just from home." A performer at Jacobpura's Shri Durga Ramlila in Gurgaon'No processions this time'The Ramlila committees say that the money they are saving on having smaller gatherings have been utilised in scaling up the shows and modernising their digital interface. Most Ramlilas in the city have moved up from their amateur set-ups for recording the show and gone for professional audio-visual setups. Surinder Khullar from Geeta Bhawan Ramlila says, "We wanted to return in a grand fashion and give the audience a spectacle they'd remember. So what if the crowd is less, the show shouldn't be any less grand. We are livestreaming the show on Facebook and YouTube for others to watch at home." While the organisers claim that they are following social distancing and encouraging everyone to wear masks, the pictures from different Ramlilas in the city paint a different picture'Hope the festive season can bring back lost cheer'"Ramlilas are culturally very significant. It is the time for families to get together and go out for some entertainment and some fun. It is always a good time of the year, so we were definitely missing it. After how this year has been, I hope the festive season can bring back our lost cheer," says Sector 14 resident Anil Rastogi, who went with his family to watch two Ramlilas over the weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/crowds-return-to-ramlilas-in-gurgaon/articleshow/87000726.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur

Kali Mandir, which closes its gates an hour prior to the aarti, is streaming it on a number of online platforms. “This time, we are on a varied number of online platforms; there is no compromise on puja rituals, they are being followed as per the proper norm,” says Prodeep Ganguly, General Secretary of Kali Mandir Society. Ena Pathak Mitra, Puja Secretary from Durga Bari Society, GK-1, shares that along with the staff on duty, volunteers are also ensuring that people attending the puja are following COVID protocols. She adds, “We created our Facebook page last year, and there is a decent amount of engagement that we get on all puja-related posts. All our  aartis and pushapanjalis are being shown live.” Read AlsoMissing Bengali food at Durga Puja pandals?

Jaya Dey, Media & PR Secretary from Jalvayu Vihar Sanskritik Kalyan Samity, Noida, says, “We have a guard at the entrance for temperature checks, sanitisers are kept at most places in the pandal and through announcements, we are constantly reminding people about social distancing. There is no bhog distribution at the premises to avoid crowds, the pre-ordered bhog will reach their respective residence. We are also urging people that they need not come over to the pandal.” A Sajjan, President of Lotus Boulevard Sanskritik Samity, Sector 100, Noida, shares that like previous years, they are maintaining the authenticity of the puja along with following all the COVID protocols. “We have people coming in batches to maintain social distancing and nobody is allowed to enter the pandal if they are without a mask. We are also trying to give back to society by creating opportunities for people who have suffered because of the pandemic. There are a lot of artists who have been out of work amid the pandemic. One of the artists from Tughlakabad was finding it difficult to sustain, so we asked him to create our pandal’s idol. We used to call dhakis from Bengal but this year, we have given a chance to people from here who were originally dhakis but are working somewhere else because of the situation,” he says. Pre-booked slots to attend puja Malay Nandy, Secretary of Bangiya Parishad Durga Puja Committee in Sector 56, Gurgaon, says, “Visitors can enter pandals after booking a slot to avoid gatherings. Once they get a slot, they fill a declaration form giving details about their health and then they get the gate pass. The volunteers at the gate scan the QR code and the scanner helps us keep a check on the number of people at the  pandal.” Amrita Arora Sinha from DLF Phase 5, Gurgaon, adds, "We are celebrating keeping all COVID-safety protocols in place.

---||India||After Ladakh, India-China war of words on Naidu’s Arunachal trip||NEW DELHI: India and China were involved in another verbal slugfest on Wednesday with the former slamming Beijing for opposing Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu’s recent visit to Arunachal Pradesh and underlining that the state is an integral and inalienable part of India. Rejecting remarks by the Chinese foreign ministry on Naidu’s visit, the Indian ministry of external affairs said Indian leaders routinely travelled to Arunachal Pradesh as they do to any other state of India. “Objecting to the visit of Indian leaders to a state of India does not stand to reason and understanding of the Indian people,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. The strong and quick rebuttal also had India recalling that the current situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the western sector of the India-China border areas had been caused by unilateral attempts of the Chinese side to alter the status quo in violation of bilateral agreements. “Therefore, we expect the Chinese side to work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols rather than trying to link unrelated issues,” said the Indian official. Talks between the two countries to resolve the military stand-off in eastern Ladakh seemed to have collapsed earlier this week with both sides blaming each other for the impasse. Claiming Arunachal as a part of south Tibet, China has in the past too objected to visits by Indian leaders there. Earlier in the day, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Beijing firmly opposed the visit by Naidu as it never recognised the “so-called Arunachal Pradesh”. “China’s position on the China-India boundary issue is consistent and clear-cut. The Chinese government has never recognised the ‘so-called Arunachal Pradesh’ established unilaterally and illegally by the Indian side and firmly opposes the Indian leader’s visit to this above-mentioned area,” said Zhao Lijian. He also urged the Indian side to “earnestly respect China’s major concerns, stop taking any action that would complicate and expand the boundary issue, and refrain from undermining mutual trust and bilateral relations. It should instead take real actions to maintain peace and stability in the China-India border area, and help to bring China-India relations back onto the track of sound and steady development,” said the Chinese official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-ladakh-india-china-war-of-words-on-naidus-arunachal-trip/articleshow/87004533.cms||---
---||India||India set to reach 100 crore vaccine doses mark next week||NEW DELHI: India is set to reach yet another milestone next week of administering over 100-crore vaccine doses even as the government plans to involve NGOs and the private sector to mark the achievement and end vaccine hesitancy through spreading awareness. Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday said the country will produce over 28 crore doses in October as it continues to ramp up supplies. In an interaction with reporters, the minister said nearly 73% of the adult population has received a single dose of the jabs and around 29% both doses. Of the 28 crore doses to be available this month, up from more than 22 crore in September, nearly 22 crore will be Covishield and six crore Covaxin. Also, nearly 60 lakh DNA jabs will be produced, he said. Times ViewReaching the 100 crore vaccination mark is cause for celebration. But it’s still a long road before most of the country is double vaccinated. One of the hurdles to this end is vaccine hesitancy, which can hurt the efforts to control Covid-19. A more vigorous campaign, both in the media and on the ground, is needed to win the war against the outbreak.With around 97 crore vaccine doses administered so far, the numbers are expected to reach the 100-crore milestone next week, likely on October 19 or 20, he said. “No other country has matched the speed and scale with which India is carrying out the vaccination drive. Besides, the 100 crore vaccine doses feat will be celebrated across the country to inspire the remaining people to come forward for vaccination,” an official said. Official sources said as of now, the health ministry has no plans to push booster doses as expert opinion on the matter is yet to be sought. They also expressed satisfaction at the overall vaccination programme, saying hardly any state is now complaining about lack of vaccines. “All states have vaccinated over 60% of their population,” an official said. Asked about the status of Covaxin’s acceptance in other countries, an official said the WHO nod for it is expected soon and that over 12 countries have already recognised it. On the political blame-game between the Delhi BJP and AAP government in the capital over curbs on Chhath Puja due to the pandemic, the official said all states have SOPs in place regarding festivities and no politics should be done over this. The Delhi government has written a letter to Mandaviya after the local BJP unit targeted the Arvind Kejriwal-led dispensation over it. “There should not be any controversy over festivals. There are SOPs … even states have their own too. Its compliance should be ensured,” he said. Asked whether the Union government is considering resumption of vaccine exports, official sources said it will be looked at only after the domestic requirement is met. About vaccination of those between 2-18 years, they said DCGI is still reviewing it before taking the final call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-set-to-reach-100-crore-vaccine-doses-mark-next-week/articleshow/87005787.cms||---
---||Business||Centre wrote to states in February to stockpile coal||NEW DELHI: The coal shortage at power plants are of their own making since state utilities and private power plants ignored repeated warnings from the coal and power ministries to begin building up inventories, even as the total generation capacity that was switched off due to low fuel stocks shrank 45% from 11 GW (gigawatts) to 6 GW on improved supplies from Coal India. According to official communications seen by TOI, the coal ministry had shot off letters as early as February 25, asking state utilities and private power producers to lift as per allocations. In one letter, coal secretary Anil Jain had even hinted that if coal was not lifted, fire may break out at Coal India’s pithead stockpiles due to self-ignition, a typical feature of coal. This was followed by a series of letters from power secretary Alok Kumar and additional secretary Vivek Kumar Dewangan to officials of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan — all states that have warned of load-shedding. These letters essentially warned them about rising power demand leading to faster drawdown of fuel stocks and the monsoon impact on mining, which required power plants to build up stocks, and clear dues of Coal India for uninterrupted fuel supply. Coal minister Pralhad Joshi himself wrote to Maharashtra power minister Nitin Raut as recently as September 28, explaining the situation arising from heavy rains in coal-bearing states and assuring of coal supplies through alternative mode. The utilities, however, refused to lift coal adequately because, it appears, they did not anticipate a 12.7% surge in power demand, did not have money or huge outstandings against Coal India and also wanted to avoid "carrying cost" of inventories. For example, Mahagenco on June 15 asked Coal India to reduce despatch. So by the time intense rains in September-end and the beginning of this month disrupted mining and loading operations, power plants were already scraping the bottom for fuel amid a surge in demand as economic activities gathered pace. Now that rains are over and mines have been dewatered, coal supply is gradually exceeding consumption, which will help rebuild fuel stocks at power plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/centre-wrote-to-states-in-february-to-stockpile-coal/articleshow/87006395.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||India||Minister’s son denied bail, SUV owner & man accused of firing in air also arrested||BAREILLY: The chief judicial magistrate (CJM) of Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday denied bail to Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish, accused of murdering four farmers and a journalist during a farmers’ protest on October 3. The special investigation team (SIT) probing the violence made two more arrests on Wednesday — Ashish’s friend Ankit Das, who owns the black Fortuner in the three-car convoy that allegedly ran farmers over that day, and a man identified as Lateef, who was reportedly part of the convoy and fired shots in the air. Ashish Mishra and his aide Ashish Pandey, who were arrested last week, had moved the CJM seeking bail. "We opposed their applications. They were denied bail by chief judicial magistrate Chinta Ram," special prosecution officer S P Yadav told TOI. SIT officials said they are "gathering evidence and arresting people on the basis of what comes up". They questioned Ashish Mishra over the day but he was not taken to the site of the killings. His remand will be over on Friday morning. At one point, he was questioned along with Das, who had moved a surrender application before the CJM on Tuesday but turned himself in to the SIT in Lakhimpur city on Wednesday. The SIT had said it was "looking for" Das, a Lucknow-based contractor who is former Congress MP Akhilesh Das’s nephew and said to be working closely with BJP now. Arrested with Das on Wednesday was Lateef, a resident of Sardhan in Kheri, who had also filed a surrender plea. "Das and Lateef were arrested and produced before the court. They were sent to 14-day judicial custody. The judge heard our application seeking their remand and granted three days," Yadav said. The SIT also produced Shekhar Bharti, the other suspect the investigating team had said it was "on the trail of", and got a three-day remand custody of him as well. Yadav added, "Das’s counsel had filed a separate application saying he suffers from various diseases and has a slipped disc. So, the counsel said, he should be kept in a facility outside jail. He produced a Supreme Court ruling on such instances. Taking this application into account, the judge wrote to the (Lakhimpur Kheri) jail superintendent to consider Das’s special needs." With this, the SIT has arrested six in the case so far — Ashish Mishra, Das, Pandey, Lovekush Rana, Bharti and Lateef. No person who was in the third car of the convoy, a white Scorpio, has been officially identified or arrested yet. Meanwhile, UP law minister Brajesh Pathak met the families of two people in the convoy who died — BJP worker Shubham Mishra and driver Hariom Mishra. The two, along with BJP worker Shyam Sundar, were among eight killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. All three were identified as accused by the SIT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ministers-son-denied-bail-suv-owner-man-accused-of-firing-in-air-also-arrested/articleshow/87006835.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Residents of many areas in Gurugram — sectors 69, 70A and 71 to name a few — are still reeling from daily outages, making them heavily reliant on diesel gensets. What has compounded their problem is that the residents have to shell out Rs 32 to Rs 35 per unit for using these diesel gensets. The RWA of Astaire Garden in Sector 70A said that they receive a message from the discom every morning about power outages from 11am to 6pm. “When there is no power, we are left with no option than to turn on the gensets and pay exorbitant bills,” said Jaswant Rao of the RWA. He also pointed out that there has been no dedicated electricity connection and power is supplied from a shared 11KV feeder line from Ghata in Sector 56. Sector 69 which is three kilometres from Sector 70A reels under a similar crisis. In the backdrop of this power crisis is the delay in the construction of a substation and shared and faulty cables of the existing line of connection. “We were supposed to receive permanent connection from the 220 kV GIS substation in Sector 69, but it has been years and the construction is yet to be finished. Are we responsible for the issues on the part of the government department? Why should we pay the price for their delay?” Rao added. The construction of the substation for these sectors started in 2018 but there has been continuous delay. This time, the delay has been because of the non-arrival of engineers from China. “Parts of the substation have arrived from China. The majority of the work has been completed. Engineers must now come in and connect the pieces. The substation should be completed by December,” said Anil Yadav, superintending engineer of Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HVPN). In addition, the construction of an elevated flyover on Sohna has posed another challenge. “The 220 kV line by HVPN is being shifted to the monopole that is causing power issues to the residents. It will be fixed in a few days,” assured sub-divisional officer of Badshahpur, Hitesh Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/inverter-free-city-is-a-distant-dream-hit-by-outages-daily-rely-on-dg-sets/articleshow/87006917.cms||Sagrika Kissu

The eligible categories include survivors of sexual assault, rape or incest, minors, women with physical disabilities, mentally ill women, including those suffering from retardation and situations where the foetal malformation has substantial risk of being incompatible with life. This category also includes cases where it is assessed that if the child is born, he/she may suffer from physical or mental abnormalities and can be seriously handicapped. The rules create space for women whose cases may be considered where there is change of marital status during the ongoing pregnancy like widowhood and divorce. The eligibility categorisation also includes cases of women with pregnancy in disaster or emergency situations as may be declared by the government. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021 came into force with effect from September 24. The Act amends the 1971 MTP law, which regulates the conditions under which medical termination of pregnancy are to be pursued. The opinion of registered medical practitioner, eligible as per the rules, is required for termination of pregnancy at different gestation ages up to 20 weeks. Opinion of two registered medical practitioners is required beyond 20 weeks till 24 weeks of gestation period. The opinion for medical termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks gestation period will be given by a medical board constituted by respective state governments or UT administrations at approved facilities. Two registered medical practitioners eligible as per the MTP rules will perform the termination of pregnancy based on the decision of the medical board. The rules stipulate that the medical board will have the power to allow or deny termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks of gestation period after due consideration and ensuring that the procedure would be safe for the woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/abortion-limit-raised-from-20-to-24-weeks/articleshow/87007243.cms||---
---||India||Gati Shakti to change ‘sarkari’ perception about development plans: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: The PM Gati Shakti initiative is a major effort to radically alter government functioning and change the perception — which had prevailed for decades — that “sarkari” work spelt poor quality, hurdles and higher costs, PM Narendra Modi said on Wednesday. Launching the GIS-based initiative that brings 16 infrastructure-related central departments on the same platform, the PM said the previous approach to development, marred by wasteful expenditure, amounted to an “insult” of taxpayers’ money. “There was a view that nothing will change, things will be like this only,” he said. He took a swipe at the opposition and critics, saying that some sections have made it a fashion to criticise infrastructure that the country should be proud of, a possible reference to criticism of projects like the Central Vista Redevelopment by a section of political opinion and commentators. Better planning can crucially cut logistical costs and make Indian businesses more competitive. He urged the states to join the initiative and said private businesses will also benefit from the new system. Spelling out several measures taken by his government since 2014, Modi said the big step-up in the spread of optical fibre networks, doubling and electrification of railways, increase in the number of food parks , ambitious plans to reduce turnaround time at ports and making India a big MRO hub for aviation spoke for themselves. Explaining the change in mindset and processes Gati Shakti involves, the PM said the aim of a tech-based platform that provides detailed ground-level information was to ensure elimination of duplication and incomplete planning and execution. The common scenario of industrial parks coming up without adequate thought to connectivity or roads and railway lines not being coordinated can be avoided. “Every department plans for itself. They need to think collectively,” he said. Fixing something that had gone bad takes a lot of effort and the gap between macro-planning and micro-execution is huge, Modi said. The “khich-khich” (friction) between government departments often slowed projects and created avoidable delays. The Centre and states will be able to offer time-lines to investors with greater certainty and generate more employment all around, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gati-shakti-to-change-sarkari-perception-about-development-plans-pm-modi/articleshow/87007286.cms||---

Three social workers who run schools and hostels for tribal students had moved the HC. The case began when the owner of Hotel Moonlight in Padali Barav village applied to transfer his liquor licence to another premises in the urban area of Junnar. After objections from the petitioners, residents, the Shirur MP and other MLAs, the collector in November 2019 rejected the application, citing the school. Justice Kulkarni said the collector’s reasons were given under “apparent political pressure brought on him”. The collector’s comments on the inquiry officer’s March 2019 report said the school’s main entrance was 450m from the restaurant. In August 2019, a new gate was found, northwest of the compound wall, at a distance of 144m and aerially 95m. Under the Bombay Foreign Liquor Rules, a distance of 75m has to be maintained by an establishment from an educational or religious institution. Moreover, another hotel had been operating for over a decade at a distance of 375m with similar licence and the school had not objected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/instil-strong-moral-values-hc-tells-school-allows-bar-nearby/articleshow/87007584.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Hours after the video clip went viral, the party expelled KPCC media coordinator MA Saleem and served a show-cause notice on spokesperson and former MP from Ballari,VS Ugrappa, who has to reply within three days. Shivakumar said: “Neither my party nor I have anything to do with the video. I’m not saying this conversation didn’t take place, but it’s a private talk between two individuals.” Saleem and Ugrappa, in a chat minutes before a scheduled press conference at the KPCC office here on Tuesday, were heard talking about alleged corruption by Shivakumar. Though the microphone in front of them was off, they didn’t realise the television microphones were on. The chat was about recent income-tax department raids on three Karnataka contractors involved in irrigation and highway projects. Shivakumar was the irrigation minister in the Kumaraswamy government. “Earlier, there was a 6-8 percent cut (commission to ministers and officials) but it went up to10-12 percent during Shivakumar's time. If the matter (income-tax raids) is dug deeper, his (Shivakumar) role will also come out,” Saleem tells Ugrappa in the recorded chat. He added that many of Shivakumar’s followers have made huge sums of money. ‘DKS stammers while speaking in public’Mulagund mar's close ( aide Shivaku , ac - - cording to Saleem) is worth Rs 50 crore to Rs 100 crore. Imagine how much (wealth) Shivakumar must have made. He is a collection king,” he said. Saleem also takes a dig at Shivakumar's public speaking, recalling his statement to media where he struggles to pronounce Jallianwala Bagh. “He stammers while speaking in public. I don't know if it is due to low BP or he was drunk. His body language makes people believe he is a drunkard," he says. Ugrappa said he and others made Shivakumar the KPCC president with a lot of effort but he’s not doing much for the party's prospects. After the video went viral late Tuesday night, Ugrappa said Saleem was only saying what BJP leaders have been talking about Shivakumar after the raids. “Shivakumar is a good administrator and has a propeople mindset. His made his wealth through business, not politics," he said. The ruling BJP has found fresh ammunition to attack Congress ahead of the Hangal and Sindgi bypolls. “This is the real face of the Congress. It’s full of filth and their leaders are exposing it," said national general secretary CT Ravi, adding: “I don't think Ugrappa and Saleem are so dumb to speak against their party president. They did it to show Shivakumar in poor light and favour Siddaramaiah."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/congress-netas-accuse-dks-of-graft-one-of-them-expelled/articleshow/87007619.cms||---
---||India||Motor Vehicle Act a welfare measure, needs liberal approach: HC||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that the Motor Vehicles Act is a piece of welfare legislation and a liberal approach is required while dealing with matters under this statute. The court also held that a delay in registration of an FIR in such cases is insignificant — while this factor may be relevant during a criminal trial, it cannot be given much weightage in proceedings for determining compensation under the Act. “An FIR is often lodged in a hurry and it may not contain the minute and precise details of the incident. The FIR can be registered by a person who may not be an eye-witness. It is only during investigation of the case that the police can come to know about the culprit/criminal, who had committed the crime. Merely for the reason that the accused had not been named in the FIR does not result in causing any dent to the prosecution story,” the HC observed. Justice HS Madaan of the HC has passed these orders while disposing of a petition filed by Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd against the compensation awarded by a Palwal-based court for the death of a resident of Palwal district in a vehicle accident. In this case, one Bansi Lal, 26, a resident of Bhiduki village in Haryana had died on October 10, 2015 due to rash and negligent driving by one Gajraj Singh. The family of the deceased filed a claim petition against the driver of the vehicle. Hearing their plea, a claim tribunal in its order of September 4, 2017 ordered the insurance company to pay a compensation of Rs 30,88,172. Aggrieved by this, the insurance company had approached the HC. A separate petition was also filed by the deceased’s family seeking enhancement of compensation. “It has to be kept in mind that the Motor Vehicles Act is a piece of welfare legislation and its purpose is to provide prompt compensation to the persons suffering injuries in a motor vehicular accident or to family members of such persons unfortunately dying in such road mishaps,” Justice HS Madaan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/motor-vehicle-act-a-welfare-measure-needs-liberal-approach-hc/articleshow/87007691.cms||Ajay Sura
---||India||Gandhis, Azad, others meet President, seek Teni’s dismissal||NEW DELHI: Escalating the pressure on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, a Congress delegation on Wednesday petitioned President Ram Nath Kovind and urged him to sack junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni in the “interest of justice” for the farmers who were killed in the incident. A team, led by Rahul Gandhi and comprising Mallikarjun Kharge, Ghulam Nabi Azad, AK Antony and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, told Kovind that a fair probe was not possible until Mishra stayed in the ministry, calling him the “original source of provocation” which culminated in his son allegedly mowing down farmers with his SUV and who is now in custody. The opposition party said Mishra’s own role in the crime is still to be investigated. The Congress leaders also submitted a memorandum to the President, listing out the details of the incident and alleging foul play by the Uttar Pradesh police and BJP government in the state. It mentioned that action was initiated in the case only after Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi took up the matter and visited the victims’ families. Besides seeking the scalp of Mishra, Congress also urged the President that a judicial inquiry by two sitting Supreme Court or high court judges be ordered into the incident that has “scarred the soul of India”. Having made the Kheri violence a campaign and claiming that its pressure led to the case being registered against the minister’s son, Congress has held several protests nationally in the short span. The move to petition the President is seen as another attempt to keep the focus trained on the ministry and BJP. Priyanka Gandhi told reporters that the President assured them that he would take up the matter with the government “today itself”. Congress said the reaction of BJP and the government to the “deliberate murder in broad daylight” had eroded the faith of the people in the system. The memorandum said it was minister Mishra who first threatened the farmers, which is caught on video, and then a few days later, a convoy of cars mowed down farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. It said eyewitnesses had seen the minister’s son in the car. It added police would not dare to fairly investigate the minister’s son when the father is occupying a position of “high influence”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gandhis-azad-others-meet-president-seek-tenis-dismissal/articleshow/87007716.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||In a new worry, Hyderabad hospitals see rise in breakthrough infections||HYDERABAD: In the last one month alone, several hospitals in Hyderabad have reported between 5 and 10 cases of breakthrough infections each. As per WHO guidelines, a breakthrough infection occurs when someone tests positive for Covid-19 a fortnight after taking both vaccine doses. Worried doctors are hinting at the possibility of a further spike in the near future. At present, they estimate that about 10% of all Covid-19 cases comprise patients suffering from breakthrough infections. “This is largely being seen among patients with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, on immune suppressants like cancer patients or organ transplant patients. Although we have had breakthrough infections among some of our doctors, they were very mild,” said Dr Pradeep Panigrahi, medical director, SLG Hospitals.  Doctors, however, maintain that the mortality rate in such cases is still close to negligible. “While vaccination is essential to control the spread of Covid-19, no vaccine is 100% effective and that is why these breakthrough infections happen,” said Dr Nikhil Mathur, chief of medical services at Care Hospitals. He added: “The good thing with these infections so far is that the mortality is negligible and also the hospital stay is brief. Mortality is still largely seen among unvaccinated people at the moment.” Apart from breakthrough infections, hospitals are also reporting cases — about 25% to 30% of all Covid-19 patients — where partially vaccinated individuals have contracted the virus again. The rest, they say, are among vaccine-reluctant individuals who have not taken even a single dose. “There are also some cases where the patient has been infected immediately after taking the second dose, but has not completed the 14-day period after vaccination. These do not fall under breakthrough cases but do come to us in a critical state. This is because they have not yet mounted an adequate immune response,” said Dr Visweswaran Balasubramanian, consultant interventional pulmonologist, Yashoda Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-a-new-worry-city-hosps-see-rise-in-breakthrough-infections/articleshow/87008019.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||India||Kheri violence condemnable, but it’s not isolated case: Sitharaman||BOSTON: The Lakhimpur Kheri violence, in which four farmers were killed, is “absolutely condemnable,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said, emphasising that there are issues of such nature happening in other parts of India equally which should be raised “when they happen and not when it suits others” because there is a BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. Sitharaman, who is on an official visit to the US, was responding to a question during a conversation at Harvard Kennedy School on Tuesday about the killing of four farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri and the arrest of Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister Ajay Mishra. She was asked why there is no word on this from the PM, senior ministers and why there is a “defensive reaction” when somebody asks questions about such things. “No, absolutely not... It’s nice of you to have picked up that one incident which is absolutely condemnable, every one of us say that. Equally there are instances happening elsewhere, is my concern. “India has issues of such nature happening in very many different parts of the country equally. I would like you, and many others who all know India, to raise it at every time when it happens, not just raise it when it suits us because it’s a state where BJP is in power, one of my Cabinet colleague’s son is probably in trouble, and also assume that it’s actually them who did it and not anybody else. Due course of justice will also have a complete inquiry process to establish it,” she said. “And it’s not being defensive about my party or my PM. It’s being defensive about India. I will talk for India, I will talk for justice for the poor. I will not be mocked at. And if it is mocking, I will be defensive to stand up and say ‘Sorry, let’s talk on facts’. That’s my answer for you,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kheri-violence-condemnable-but-its-not-isolated-case-sitharaman/articleshow/87008112.cms||---

The suspect was in custody, police added. "The man used a bow and arrow ... for some of the attacks," police chief Oeyvind Aas told reporters. The police were investigating whether other weapons had also been used, he said. "The man has been apprehended ... from the information we now have, this person carried out these actions alone," Aas added. One of the wounded people was an off-duty police officer. Newspaper VG showed images of an arrow that appeared to be stuck in the wall of a wood-paneled building. The death toll was the worst of any attack in Norway since 2011, when far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people, most of them teenagers at a youth camp The attacks on Wednesday took place over "a large area" of Kongsberg, a municipality of about 28,000 people in southeastern Norway, 68 km (42 miles) from the capital, Oslo. The government said police had launched a large investigation. "The reports coming from Kongsberg tonight are horrifying," Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference. "I understand that many people are afraid, but it's important to emphasise that the police are now in control," she said. Following the attacks, the police directorate said it had ordered officers nationwide to carry firearms. Norwegian police are normally unarmed but officers have access to guns and rifles when needed. "This is an extra precaution. The police have no indication so far that there is a change in the national threat level," the directorate said in a statement. Aas said police would investigate whether the attack amounted to an act of terrorism. Norway's minister of justice and public security, Monica Maeland, has received updates on the attacks and was closely monitoring the situation, the ministry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/man-armed-with-bow-and-arrow-kills-five-people-in-norway-attacks-police-say/articleshow/87008359.cms||---
---||India||‘Developed nations must make deep emission cuts’||NEW DELHI: With India gearing up for the upcoming UN climate conference (COP26) with focus on equity and climate justice as core of its negotiating points, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav on Wednesday sought developed countries to take lead in climate action and go for immediate deep emission cuts keeping in view their historical responsibilities and socio-economic reality of the developing nations. "Need of the hour is a comprehensive set of actions within socio-economic and developmental context to deal with the issue of climate change," said Yadav while addressing a national conference, organised by TERI, ahead of the crucial UN climate meet. The conference, to be held during October 31-November 12 in Glasgow (UK), will see how the world reacts to the recent warning from the IPCC report on possibility of reaching 1.5 degree Celsius of global average temperature rise in next two decades. Clearly reflecting on India's stand in this context, Yadav said, "The recently released report by IPCC has sounded alarm bells louder than ever, and it is a clarion call for the developed countries to undertake immediate deep emission cuts." His remarks, asking rich nations to take deep emission cuts, gave a clear signal of India's intent at a time when the developed nations, led by the US, UK and some EU countries, have been pitching for bringing all big emitters including India and China on board to commit to 'net-zero' target by 2050. Yadav, however, underlined the need for equity while looking for such (mid-century net-zero) options and flagged the importance of finance and technology transfer for the purpose. He said, “Equity and climate justice are touchstones of any global climate response and COP26 should focus on climate finance in scope, scale and speed along with development and transfer of technologies.” Experts at the conference more or less endorsed India's point with a couple of them even seeking developed countries to reach the 'net-zero' goal much before 2050 while others suggested a flexible timeline to reach the target keeping in view countries' respective capabilities and development imperatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/developed-nations-must-make-deep-emission-cuts/articleshow/87008450.cms||Vishwa Mohan

They not only visited different pandals, but also prioritised their health by getting themselves inoculated at the Covid vaccination camps set up by the state health department. According to sources, there are as many as 28 pandals in Patna district with the facility to administer vaccines to the visitors during the Durga Puja celebrations. Besides, health workers have been deputed at 10 pandals to collect samples for Covid testing. Sanjay Kumar Singh, the special secretary of the health department, told this reporter on Wednesday that vaccination camps had been set up at seven pandals in the urban areas of Patna district and one each in every block. Talking about the importance of being immunised, health minister, Mangal Pandey, said, “Since hundreds of people have returned home from different parts of India and other countries to celebrate Durga Puja with their families, we decided to turn pandals into mini vaccination camps. This will help check the spread of Covid-19.” Pandey also urged the revellers to follow Covid safety protocols that include the use of face masks in public places and maintenance of social distancing. Meanwhile, a large number of devotees and different Durga Puja committees hailed the government’s decision. One Anuj Kumar Saxena, who was planning to get the second dose of Covishield after Dussehra, said, “Being fully vaccinated in front of Goddess Durga just felt right. So I did it.” Another devotee, Rameshwar Singh, thanked the government for “such a unique initiative”. “I also prayed to Goddess Durga to wipe out this evil virus from the world.” Santosh Kumar, the convenor of Vijay Vahini Durga Puja Samiti, claimed that vaccine shots had been given to 31 beneficiaries on Saptami and 72 on Ashtami at the Anandpuri-based pandal. “The camp is open for visitors from 9am to 4pm,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccination-camps-at-pandals-attract-quite-a-few-people/articleshow/87000151.cms||Faryal Rumi

With Vested Direct, investors open a free-of-cost, no-minimum-balance savings account with SBM Bank funds. Investors can load funds in Indian rupees that can be converted into dollars to eventually transfer into their Vested account. “Partnering with Vested Finance is in line with both our beliefs — making the challenge of overseas investing seamless for end users. This will enable Indian investors to geographically diversify their portfolios in a smarter manner,” SBM Bank India head (retail & consumer banking) Neeraj Sinha said. While the RBI’s liberalised remittance scheme allows Indians to send up to $250,000 overseas, investing in stocks involved multiple steps with high foreign exchange mark-up and fixed transfer charges with transfers taking up to five days. “We have seen rapidly increasing interest among Indian investors to diversify their portfolios internationally. So far, the biggest bottleneck has been the deposit journey due to high charges and the tedious process,” said Vested Finance co-founder & CEO Viram Shah. He added that the partnership will enable the transfer to be done seamlessly, 100% online and with low fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbms-partner-vested-to-help-indians-buy-us-stocks-online/articleshow/87004555.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Nagpur||SWAP for in-situ breeding of wild buffaloes, saving vultures||Nagpur: Taking up in-situ conservation breeding programme for the wild buffalo for reintroduction to areas like Navegaon National Park, initiating vulture conservation project on the lines of the one in Pinjore in Chandigarh, carrying out an annual security audit of parks, and developing safe grazing lands in areas adjoining villages to reduce conflicts are some of the focus areas of the maiden State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP).The SWAP (2021-30) was approved by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in the 17th State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) meeting on Tuesday. The policy document indicates the guiding principles and priorities that must be translated into action-oriented projects for the conservation of wildlife. The plan is in consonance with the National Wildlife Action Plan (NWAP)-2017-2030.To address the human-animal conflict, the SWAP has asked to develop programmes under various schemes by December 2021 to incentivize cropping patterns around PAs or in high conflict zones by developing safe grazing lands in areas adjoining villages, agricultural land or conflict-prone areas (preferably on community lands) to reduce conflict. It also encourages stall feeding and provides nets for mahua flower collection.The 186-page SWAP has 12 chapters with every chapter mentioning targets to achieve. It lays targeted-oriented action to deal with poaching, conservation of threatened species, wildlife tourism, research, and monitoring, mitigating man-animal conflict among many other things.It lays a detailed outline to go about it and calls to improve the rate of conviction which is just 9.6% at present. It also suggests setting up two wildlife crime control cells (WCCC). One has already been set up in Nagpur and another is in Mumbai. “In the 16th SWBL meeting on December 4, 2020, a few members suggested that there should be a separate state wildlife policy for giving a long-term direction to wildlife conservation. The NWAP pattern was adopted while drafting the SWAP with inclusion of issues pertaining specifically to Maharashtra,” says ex-PCCF NH Kakodkar who took a major initiative to prepare the plan.Since this idea was accepted, various chapters for the SWAP were finalized taking a cue from the NWAP and the requirements of the state. A committee of 4-5 SBWL members was constituted for each of the 12 chapters. The committee was given the freedom to co-opt any other expert member to prepare the first draft. In all, there were 63 committee members and 9 members in the drafting committee including co-opted members.Explaining the rigorous process followed to prepare SWAP, Kakodkar said, “A WhatsApp group was formed for sharing important updates and faster communication. Each chapter was discussed on a daily basis. Subject matter specialists were also invited to participate in the discussions and their inputs were noted.”WHAT IS THE SWAP ALL ABOUTI-Wildlife Health Management* Establish the Maharashtra Wildlife Health Centre by Developing WRTC, Gorewada, as a Wildlife Health Management Centre* Establish a well-equipped disease diagnostic laboratory for the analysis of the wild animal samples* Develop a repository of samples from the wild at Gorewada for understanding disease dynamics* Develop a network of hospitals and rescue centres* Create a regular cadre of wildlife veterinarians in the forest department at the district-levelII-Management of Tourism* Develop new destinations and well-dispersed eco-lodges to conduct ecotourism and adventure activities* Regulate and restrict tourism in ecologically vulnerable and fragile sites such as breeding areas of wildlife, nesting colonies, erosion-prone locations* Record potential environmental and social impacts of every ecotourism activity at the planning stage and develop mitigation plans accordingly* Phase out all existing ecotourism-related residential facilities outside the PAs and sensitive and vulnerable forest areas* Develop a draft MoU to be used between the private operators and the Gram Sabha wherever CFRs have been recognizedIII- Conservation Awareness & Outreach* Develop and strengthen low-cost Nature Education Centres & Nature Interpretation Centres* Revive the National Green Corps (NGC) and involve them in various outreach activities of the forest departmentIV-People’s Participation in Conservation* Extend the scope of existing schemes of people’s participation beyond PAs in ESZs, buffer and corridors* Prepare a comprehensive micro plan of each village that is within or on the fringes of PAs* Conduct periodic meetings with villagers to clear their doubts about various schemes* Use local folk-arts and traditional beliefs for conservation awarenessV-Strengthening Research & Monitoring* Revamp & reorganize the existing research wing of the department* Set up wildlife research and information cell in PCCF office* Study the effect of forest fragmentation on species diversity and impact of major land use* Undertake impact analysis of mining, dams, hydroelectric projects and linear infrastructure on wildlife habitatVI-Ensuring Sustained Funding* Set up a mechanism for levying a green cess or green tax* Consolidate wildlife/tiger corridors through land acquisition in identified areas through the user agencies* Prepare project proposals for seeking funding support from the private sector for wildlife management* Recommend the NPVs of forestland to be diverted in wildlife corridors/PAs* Promote alternative cropping patterns in wildlife conflict areasVII-Strengthening PA Network* Identify potential areas around tiger reserves, so as to achieve the possibility of having an 800-1,000 sqkm area* Prepare proposals for declaring new PAs as per scientific and objective criteria and ecological importance* Relocate and voluntarily resettle villages from PAs to provide sufficient inviolate forest areas* Expedite the expansion of the existing smaller PAs* Expedite the preparation of the zonal master plans* Upgrade the existing wildlife administrative setup||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/swap-for-in-situ-breeding-of-wild-buffaloes-saving-vultures/articleshow/87000797.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Business||3 PSU non-life insurers start reducing branches||MUMBAI: Public sector non-life insurance companies have begun a restructuring exercise of shrinking their branch network in a bid to reduce costs and improve finances. Overall, three weak PSU insurers — National Insurance, Oriental Insurance and United India — are targeting around 25% office rationalisation through mergers and closures. The rationalisation plan is moving ahead even as the government has introduced legislation to facilitate the privatisation of state-owned general insurance companies. The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act — or GIBN Act — amendment was notified on August 18. The amendment states that on and from the date on which the central government ceases to control any specified insurer, after the commencement of the GIBN Act, the provisions of this Act shall cease to apply in respect of that specified insurer. Following the Budget announcement to sell one PSU non-life insurer, the finance minister said that employee interests would be protected and that privatisation was not going to end up as selling for closure. The officers’ association in the non-life companies has petitioned the government, asking it to not sell the companies but to merge the three non-life companies to strengthen them. Some senior PSU officials feel that a merger with New India Assurance might be the only option as standalone companies may not be attractive to investors. “Merger and rationalisation of the three weak PSUs — National, Oriental and United India — makes sense. The public issue of the merged entity should, if at all, be taken up well after the merger process is completed and the merged entity becomes stable and profitable,” said sector regulator Irdai’s former member K K Srinivasan. He added that the government should also not be in a hurry to disinvest any more of its stake in New India Assurance and GIC Re. National Insurance reported a loss of Rs 2,751 crore for FY21, according to its public disclosures. The company’s solvency margin ratio to required solvency margin had shrunk to 0.12 as against the mandated 1.5. Oriental Insurance had a loss of Rs 1,498 crore and a solvency ratio of 0.92. United India reported a loss of Rs 300 crore and a solvency ratio of 0.7. The three PSU insurers have total offices of over 5,200, which have shrunk from 6,001 in March 2021. The officers’ association has said that a merger of the three PSUs would end unhealthy competition and bring in economies of scale. “By following a process of appropriate merger and consolidation of existing offices, we could achieve the objective of the economy of scale with the resultant operating offices having a much bigger average size than the corresponding existing office,” the National Confederation of General Insurance Officers Association had said in their representation to Niti Aayog in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/3-psu-non-life-insurers-start-reducing-branches/articleshow/87004364.cms||---

The police have also recovered a chopper and a knife, used to execute the killing, from the possession of one of the minors. This was apart from the sharp weapons and a toy gun the police had recovered from a bag found at the scene of crime. The victim had sustained 44 stab wounds on face, neck, chest, hands and calf. A police officer on Wednesday said the girl’s head was almost severed from her body due to the assault. “We have cracked the case with the main suspect’s arrest and detention of the three minors,” city police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said. DCP (Zone V) Namrata Patil said, “The 21-year-old main suspect (name withheld), who is the girl’s cousin, manages a snack centre in Pimpri, where the three minor aides, aged between 15 and 17 years, were working with him. Overall circumstances point to a pre-planned murder. The girl had consistently rejected the main suspect’s overtures for a relationship and their families too had warned the main suspect to stay away from the girl. He nursed a grudge over this and ended up committing the crime.” The officer said, “Two of the minor suspects were nabbed from the Bibvewadi area late Tuesday night, while the third minor had driven back to Ravet on the motorcycle. The main suspect had used the bike to reach the crime scene. Our team detained the third minor from Ravet.” He added,“The Bharati Vidyapeeth police detained the main suspect during the early hours of Wednesday when he was found wandering around aimlessly and was questioned by two residents. The main suspect then admitted to the police that he had murdered the girl following which, a team from the Bibvewadi police came and arrested him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/prime-suspect-in-bibvewadi-girls-murder-arrested-3-aides-detained/articleshow/87005407.cms||---

The injured woman has been identified as Aarti Devi alias Mona, 34. Police said she has been in the modelling industry for the last one and a half years. They said Aarti also had been the finalist at a state level fashion show organised last year. The woman along with her family lived on rent in the house of one Umesh Sah.

Her husband was inside the room while Aarti’s daughter had opened the gates so that she could park her two-wheeler inside when the criminals fired from behind. “An empty cartridge of 7.65mm was recovered from the spot,” he said. The SHO said Suman has lodged an FIR against unknown persons in connection with the incident. “He could not say anything about the reason behind the incident. Aarti is yet to be quizzed. Nothing has surfaced so far,” he said. Kumar said the incident might have been linked to her professional life. He said investigation is on and police are looking for the CCTV camera footages to identify the criminals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-shot-at-in-ashiana-nagar/articleshow/86999762.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Goa||Prasad Gaonkar extends support to TMC, likely to join party after term ends||PANAJI: In a fresh setback for Congress in Sanguem, independent MLA Prasad Gaonkar announced his support for the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) and indicated that he would contest the 2022 assembly election on the TMC ticket. Gaonkar’s brother Sandesh and his supporters, who had joined the party in July, resigned from Congress and joined TMC in the presence of former Congress MLA Luizinho Faleiro and TMC MP Derek O’Brien. The development marks a fresh headache for Congress which was rebuilding itself in Sanguem constituency and in Goa. Recently, Congress office-bearer and deputy sarpanch of Netravali panchayat, Abhijit Desai, who was seen as an aspirant in the coming polls, joined Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Desai was in contention for the Sanguem ticket, but left Congress after indications that Gaonkar would contest the elections on a Congress ticket. “I will join TMC officially once my term in office comes to an end. My supporters and elected members of panchayat are joining TMC today,” said Gaonkar. Gaonkar claimed that West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is the only one with the “courage and power” to oust the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. Gaonkar won the 2017 elections from Sanguem and lent his support to the Manohar Parrikar led coalition government. However, after Parrikar’s death, Gaonkar had a fallout with present chief minister Pramod Sawant in October 2020 and withdrew his support. Asked about his decision to distance himself from Congress and embrace TMC, Gaonkar said that Congress had been unable to harness the anti-incumbancy building up against the BJP government in Goa and appeared to be in disarray. “There is an anti-incumbancy in Goa, there was one last time in 2017 also, but the opportunity that is there for Congress to grab, they haven’t been able to do so. I have been watching them for the last two to three months,” said Gaonkar. When asked if he would contest the 2022 polls as a TMC candidate, Gaonkar said that the decision would be made after discussions with TMC office bearers and his supporters. Meanwhile, Faleiro said that TMC would be inducting many woman into the party by Dussehra. “One of the most important objectives of the Trinamool Congress is women empowerment. As many as 41% of representatives in TMC are women and we will try and do the same in Goa,” said Faleiro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gaonkar-extends-support-to-tmc-likely-to-join-party-after-term-ends/articleshow/87005396.cms||---

Quoting data of the outpatients department (OPD) at JLNMCH, head of psychiatry department, Dr Ashok Kumar Bhagat, said there was nearly 20% addition in patients with mental health issues since the Covid outbreak. “People from cross sections of society were either sitting idle or working from home during the lockdown. Again, loss of job and uncertainty about future took many to depression, nervousness, mental stress and trauma, along with phobia and behavioural changes,” said Dr Bhagat, adding that limited social interactions further aggravated the problem. People’s obsession with frequent washing of hands, neurotic disorders such as fearing to venture out for work, fear to use public transport were the main reasons behind 20% increase in mental health issues in recent times, Dr Bhagat said, adding that students were more worried about their career, business communities were losing business opportunities and even marriage hiccups added to the stressful conditions. Dr Gaurav, associate professor at psychiatry department of JLNMCH, said the pandemic had an impact on the mental health of adults, adolescents and children in different ways. Acknowledging the issues related to mental health problems cropping up more after the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Sandeep Lal, president of the local chapter of IMA and head of forensic medicine and toxicology at JLNMCH, said several socioeconomic factors have added to the mental woes of people. “Meditation, yoga, physical workout and exercises besides medicines (if needed) can help,” Dr Lal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/increase-in-cases-of-mental-health-during-pandemic/articleshow/87000667.cms||Kumar Rajesh

They will also provide technical support, ensure availability of the required equipment, and impart training to the teachers. According to sources, the labs will initially be developed in 50 government schools, including seven in Patna district.

Additional chief secretary (education), Sanjay Kumar, told this newspaper on Wednesday that experts from the IIT-P would help the government set up science labs in all the 9,360 secondary and higher secondary schools. “The Directorate of Secondary Education is already working on the plan. After Dussehra, we will sign an agreement with the IIT-P in this regard,” he added. Earlier, the education department used to transfer money to the principals for setting up labs in their respective schools, but “many of them did not know what was needed in a physics or a chemistry lab”. “The IIT-P experts will also train the science teachers of government schools,” Sanjay said.

---||Visakhapatnam||GVMC to widen scope of biomining initiative||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), which has already commenced biomining on 25 acres at its Kapuluppada dumping yard, is planning to extend the move to another 33 acres. The GVMC will utilise funds under the 15th Finance Commission for the initiative. Bioremediation of four lakh metric tonnes of waste accumulated on these 33 acres is expected to cost the civic body’s exchequer about Rs 36 crore. The GVMC will issue tenders next week. After completion of bioremediation at the yard, the GVMC plans to convert 14 acres into a green lung space/park. The civic body took up biomining on the 25-acre land about two years ago to extract nearly 2.5 lakh metric tonnes of waste and to convert it into compost and other useful products. According to GVMC officials, about 70% of the works have been completed as of date. The corporation is spending Rs 21 crore on this project. Spread on an extent of 100 acres, the Kapuluppada dumping yard has been receiving garbage from all quarters of the city for the last two decades. The waste dumped so far has filled more than half of its total area. According to the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, local authorities should investigate and analyse all old open and existing operational dumpsites for their potential of biomining and bioremediation. If there is no scope for biomining, the dumpsite shall be scientifically capped as per landfill capping norms to prevent further damage to the environment. The corporation recently conducted a trial run of its 15 MW waste-to-energy plant that is under construction at the Kapuluppada dumping yard. The plant is expected to come into operation over the next few months. Once the plant is operationalised, the civic body has to supply about 900 metric tonnes of garbage a day to the plant. As the city is currently generating about 1,100 metric tonnes of waste a day, the energy plant is expected to greatly reduce burden on the landfill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-to-widen-scope-of-biomining-initiative/articleshow/87001025.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Delhi||Dussehra: Norms not clear, sound effects may replace crackers in Delhi||NEW DELHI: With just a day left for Dussehra, many Ramlila organisers in the city are playing it safe, having either given up the idea of setting aflame the effigies of Ravana, Kumbhkaran and Meghnath or keeping the traditional event a muted affair. The Nav Shri Keshav Ramleela Committee of Rohini, as initially planned, held only the kavi sammelan on October 13 and the staging of the Ramayana in three hours on October 14. Pushpendra Rastogi, committee chairman, said, “We applied for permission to erect the giant effigies, but did not get approval. So, there will be no Ravana dahan on Dussehra.” With restrictions on fireworks, the Luv Kush Ramlila Committee has cleverly decided to opt for sound effects in the background while the effigies of Ravana, Kumbhkaran and Meghnath burn. “We have received permission to set the effigies afire, but unlike traditionally, we cannot have firecrackers inside the giants. We have also had to reduce the heights of the effigies from the normal 130-140 feet to 35 feet,” said Arjun Kumar, secretary of the organising committee. “There will be no other celebration beyond this. done.” At Kashmere Gate, the Shri Navyuvak Ramlila Committee has similarly reduced the height of the effigies from 50 ft to 15 ft this time. “We got permission for the event very late but somehow managed to make arrangements to continue with the tradition. We will paste posters depicting Covid, dengue and chikungunya on the effigies of Ravana, Kumbhkaran and Meghnath and pray these diseases disappear forever,” said Avtar Singh, a former mayor and general secretary of Shri Navyuvak Ramlila Committee. Some organisers have had to make big compromises. Sri Ramlila Committee, Indraprastha did not get permission for its original venue and is holding the event at Ipex Bhawan at ITO in a space accommodating just 200 people taking social distancing into consideration. Its treasurer, Promod Aggarwal, said, “We will have a digital Ravana dahan. For the convenience of people, we have installed two huge LED screens inside and outside the venue. There will be sound effects also, so public on the stretch can participate in the celebrations.” Dwarka Shriramlila Committee cancelled altogether its plans both to stage the Ramlila and to hold the traditional burning of the effigies on October 15. Rajesh Gahlot, former MLA and member of Dwarka Shriramlila Committee, explained, “With fireworks and big gatherings disallowed, there was no point in spending time and money on arrangements."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/norms-not-clear-sound-effects-may-replace-crackers/articleshow/87005413.cms||Vibha Sharma

A base is being constructed to hold the heavy lantern being made from stones brought from Rajasthan. When asked about the reason to install such a huge lantern, RJD MLC Sunil Kumar Singh said, “This is the symbol of our party. It was this lantern which had brought light into the lives of the poor and suppressed in Bihar. Hence, we decided to showcase it in such a way to reflect the strength and power of our party and people of Bihar.” Meanwhile, preparations are in full swing to welcome RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who is expected to reach Patna on October 22 or 23. “Lalu is scheduled to address one rally each at Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur tentatively on October 25 and 27, respectively ,” a senior RJD leader said. Byelection is scheduled in both the assembly constituencies on October 30. Lalu’s younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav left for Delhi on Tuesday for a final discussion on the rally dates. RJD sources said a new room has been constructed for Lalu on the ground floor of the official bungalow allotted to his wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi, keeping in mind any emergency medical aid needed for him. Earlier, Lalu used to stay on the first floor, but climbing stairs will not be possible for him because of his health conditions. Though RJD workers and leaders are happy for Lalu’s presence in the state on the eve of the byelection, all will not get the opportunity to meet him in person as doctors have advised him to maintain health protocol. “He is susceptible to infection,” said an MLA. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said even the news of Lalu’s arrival has raised the energy level of the party workers. “We will try to ensure that his health does not get compromised,” added Gagan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/6-tonne-lantern-to-greet-visitors-at-rjd-state-hq/articleshow/86999649.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The carmaker’s stock hit circuit-breakers before closing over 21% higher at Rs 510 on the NSE, its highest level in over four years. Market players said investors cheered the deal as it would unlock value for Tata Motors’s EV business, which will be hived off into a new subsidiary. Even as the Tata Group stocks hogged the limelight, the sensex and Nifty gained for the fifth day in a row and touched new highs on Wednesday supported by auto, power and metal stocks. The sensex closed 453 points (or 0.8%) higher at 60,737, while the broader Nifty gained 170 points (over 0.9%) to end at 18,162. The BSE’s market capitalisation too hit a fresh high at Rs 273 lakh crore, rising by Rs 2.5 lakh crore on Wednesday, of which Rs 62,000 crore came from the Tata Group stocks alone. Tata Chemicals and Tata Power too saw their stocks rally over 15% on the NSE and close at fresh 52-week highs, while Tata Investment Corp ended about 14% higher. The surge in the Tata stocks came even as market heavyweight TCS closed flat and Tata Steel gained marginally. Tata Motors has rallied 53% in October on factors such as strong performance by luxury arm Jaguar Land Rover and reports about taking over Ford India’s plants. The House of Tatas, India’s largest group by revenue, is also the largest wealth-creator for shareholders this year. The market capitalisation of the listed Tata companies has grown by over Rs 7.4 lakh crore in 2021 to about Rs 23.4 lakh crore. In October alone, Tata Group’s market capitalisation has risen by over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, nearly half of which has been contributed by Tata Motors. Recent developments like the successful bid for Air India and deals inked by Tata Power to set up EV-charging infrastructure have created tailwinds and strong demand for Tata Group stocks, according to market analysts. “Tata Chemicals is a major producer of EV batteries, Tata Power is gaining from excess demand for electricity amid coal shortage. The positive sentiment of Tata Group is also boosting other stocks like Tata Teleservices,” said Manoj Dalmia, founder and chairman of brokerage firm Proficient Equities. The overall market sentiment too was positive on Wednesday because of macro-economic and global factors including easing retail inflation and China’s order to steel mills to cut production till March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-surge-for-tata-stocks-sensex-at-new-peak-too/articleshow/87004488.cms||Aseem Gujar
---||Patna||Durga Puja: A source of livelihood for lots of people||PATNA: Durga Puja happens to be one of the most sought-after events in the city as it not only gives joy to devotees, but also serves as a source of livelihood to a lot of people engaged in different professions. A number of seasonal jobs are generated during the weeklong celebrations. Hence, small workers, petty businessmen, and artisans all pin their hopes and rely on this one time of the year to earn money and support their families financially. Right from idol makers and clay modellers to decorators, hawkers, vendors, cloth dealers, tailors, florists, grocers, and priests, a vast manpower is involved in the Puja celebrations. Last year, the festival was a low-key affair owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, with the commencement of Navaratra in full swing this time, all these marginal workers and businessmen are elated. “By God’s grace I sold toys worth Rs 4,000 on Saptami due to increased footfalls,” Sonu, a toy seller, told this reporter on Wednesday. Idol makers also earned well during Navaratra. “The office-bearers of different committees organizing Durga Puja this year approached us for making idols of different sizes. As our entire family is engaged in this business, we supplied 10 idols,” said Suresh Pandit of Kumhar Toli in west Patna. According to an estimate, more than 2,000 idols of Goddess Durga were sold in the city this year. Makeshift food stalls are also doing brisk business by tempting the passers-by with their mouthwatering ‘chaats’, ‘gol gappas’, and sweets. Raushan, a vendor of Kadamkuan locality, claimed that he would make a profit of at least Rs 25,000 from his food stall this year. Besides, restaurants and confectioneries are witnessing an increase in their income with the rush of visitors. Some reputed restaurants have also announced discounts on various items till October 17. As most Puja committees had decided to distribute ready-made packets of ‘bhog’ and ‘prasad’ for three consecutive days amid the pandemic, they hired the services of professional caterers for the purpose. Besides, the pandal makers, some of whom have been hired from Jharkhand and West Bengal, have made a considerable income. Social scientist, Nawal Kishore Chaudhary, said Durga Puja had transformed a lot in the last few decades. “It is no longer a traditional Puja, but a professionally-managed event with a mix of tradition, enjoyment, and food,” he added. He also appreciated the fact that the festival provided livelihood, albeit temporarily, to a large number of people working in the unorganized sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/durga-puja-a-source-of-livelihood-for-lots-of-people/articleshow/87000452.cms||B K Mishra

---||Business||Chip shortage inflates smartphone prices||CHENNAI: Global supply chain constraints and shortage of chips and other electronic components is weighing heavily on consumers’ pockets this festive season. Even as e-commerce platforms woo consumers with cashbacks, EMIs and trade-in campaigns, analysts and industry officials say prices of many mass-market phone models currently being sold are 8-10% high. The festive season is also a preferred time for smartphone brands to launch flagships, but that hasn’t happened this year either. IDC’s associate research manager Upasana Joshi said that average selling prices (ASPs) of smartphones is up from $155-163 to around $180 in recent quarters, partly due to rising cost for OEMs and more 5G models in the picture. “However, e-commerce sales are going strong this year despite the ‘Shradh’ season as platforms offer upfront discounts and exchange programmes,” she said. Prices are up 5-10% on certain models due to rising component prices, but brands are finding ways to be competitive by re-launching models with new chipsets, tweaking accessories that come with the phone, and through various promotions, Counterpoint Research analyst Prachir Singh said. Counterpoint found in an analysis that some smartphone OEMs and vendors are receiving only around 70% of requests placed for key components, “and the situation seems to be getting worse as we move through Q3 2021”. The firm has lowered its shipment forecast for 2021 to 6% growth compared to 9% projected earlier. An executive with a price-comparison site also said that mass models from brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Realme have recorded increases in the range of Rs 500-1,000 (around 10%). Xiaomi officials told TOI it took proactive steps to ramp up local manufacturing capabilities earlier this year to beat global supply chain issues. “Despite the new changes, we will continue on our promise of maintaining only a 5% profit margin on hardware and optimise our costs such that we can offer the best price we can to the consumers,” a company spokesperson said. The brand has sold over two million smartphones in just four days of the festive sale across channels, it added. Analysts say the components’ shortage is not likely to abate until the second half of 2022 and will turn into a crisis for the smartphone industry then, translating into longer wait times and increased retail prices for consumers. Semiconductor chips have been in short supply and component prices on the rise in the past year for various reasons, including factory closures globally due to the Covid pandemic, container shortages, increasing shipping costs, and sharp rise in demand for automobiles and consumer electronics due to pent-up demand. Apple CEO Tim Cook had warned in July that supply constraints will affect sales of the iPhone as well as the iPad. Shortages aren’t there in the high-powered processors, but in computer chips that carry out functions such as driving displays or enabling audio, Cook had said then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/chip-shortage-inflates-smartphone-prices/articleshow/87003528.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

As against a demand of 19,700MW odd from afternoon to evening on Tuesday, it was in the range of 20,800 to 20,140 MW on Wednesday as TOI checked the state level dispatch centre data from time to time.The state’s generation was over 14,300 MW. When checked on Tuesday evening, it was almost the same. The figures included electricity produced by sources other than Mahagenco’s thermal and gas plants.Mahagenco’s production from its own coal fired plants has also remained at 5,600 to 5,800 MW maintaining the same level. The private plants also produced over 5,000 MW of power.WCL sources said the company has been able to maintain an average of 1.53 lakh tons since last two days. This is more than the same period last year when it was in the range of 1.15 lakh tons in a day. The output is expected to be eventually taken to 2 lakh tons.RB Goenka, former director in MSEB holding company, said a demand of 20,000 MW and above is normal during festive times. As against this, a generation of 5,000 to 6,000 MW is much lower than the installed capacity of over 13,000 MW.Goenka said the crisis is also due to mismanagement. The coal stock could have been maintained earlier but the lifting was not regular in the earlier months.Mahagenco’s poor track record of payment of dues to WCL is also one of the reasons for hiccups in supply, said sources.Apart from WCL, Mahagenco gets its supply from other CIL subsidiaries like Southeastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), and Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL), apart from Singreni Collieries Limited, an independent entity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mahagenco-units-begin-production-state-demand-still-high/articleshow/87000760.cms||Shishir Arya

City’s casting and forging units supply various engineering products to multiple industries across the country, has already cut production by 30 percent. Incidentally, even after the pandemic induced lockdown brought the industry to its knees, it bounced back and was rearing to march ahead when coal crisis came as another body blow to the industry, particularly, the foundry of cast iron products which are largely dependant on coal or electricity for fuel. Nearly 50 percent foundry in Rajkot are still dependent upon coal. Foundry makes cast iron products that require 1,440 degree temperature for melting iron ore to make products that are used in building materials, submersible pumps, auto parts and a number of other machineries. The casting industry itself too uses coal as fuel. The fuel cost is around 40 percent of the total raw material cost. A meeting of Rajkot engineering was held last week where it was decided to increase price as well as restrict credit to 30 days from the earlier 45 to 60 days. After the meeting, the association sent out a circular to its members stating: “Increase in cost will not save the foundry and other industries but definitely such industries are on the verge of closure and it will affect the production cost. Particularly it will increase unemployment due to the closure of the industries.” According to industry sources, prices of raw materials like pig iron, coal, silicon, magnesium, graphite, and scrap increased by 80 percent since July 2020. Majority of the workers in casting and foundry are migrant labourers. Paresh Vasani, president of Rajkot Engineering Association (REA) said “In casting and forging there is a steep rise in raw material of casting forging. The coal price reached to Rs 54.50 per kg from Rs 26. The production cost increased in a way that we have to suffer a loss even if we are going to execute the existing orders. This is an extraordinary situation where we are making losses by just continuing production.” Parth Ganatra, vice president of Rajkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry said, “There are many units which are giving three days off in a week and many more units are mulling 20 to 30 days of Diwali vacation. Rise in coal prices in the last three-four months is a mortal blow for the industry and this is the high time units have to think about turning to solar energy.” Industrialist Brijesh Dudhagara said, “We don’t have orders currently because buyers can’t afford to pay more. This is Diwali time and we don’t want to spoil the festival for our employees. But if the situation continues many units won’t open after Diwali vacation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/high-raw-material-coal-prices-push-rajkots-engg-sector-to-the-brink/articleshow/87003148.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Business||RIL says it was in talks to merge media business with Zee||MUMBAI: Reliance Industries (RIL) said on Wednesday it had shown interest to merge its media business with Zee Entertainment Enterprises but dropped the plan over differences between the company’s founders and its largest shareholder, Invesco. RIL’s interest in Zee came out in the open after Invesco revealed it facilitated talks between the Indian conglomerate and the company’s founders. The American fund named RIL after Zee disclosed that Invesco had approached the promoters with a proposal to merge the company with certain entities owned by an unnamed “large” Indian group. RIL said Zee founders — Punit Goenka and family — had demanded an option to raise their stake in the merged entity through subscription of warrants, but the American fund did not agree. Invesco was of the view that the founders could always increase their share in the merged entity through market purchases. “We ... have never resorted to any hostile transactions,” RIL said. “We regret being drawn into the dispute between Zee and Invesco.” RIL’s media and entertainment play is through Viacom18 Media, a 51:49 joint venture between TV18 Broadcast and US-based Viacom. Viacom18 Media operates a host of entertainment channels such as Colors, MTV, Comedy Central, VH1 and Nickelodeon. The JV also deals with film production and content syndication. Invesco said the potential transaction proposed by Reliance (the ‘strategic group’ referenced but not identified in the October 12, 2021 communication from Zee) was negotiated by and between Goenka and others associated with Zee’s promoter family. “The role of Invesco, as Zee’s single-largest shareholder, was to help facilitate that potential transaction and nothing more,” the fund said. RIL confirmed that Invesco had assisted in arranging discussions with Zee’s founders and made a “broad proposal” to merge its media properties with Zee at “fair valuations”. Zee had rejected RIL’s offer over valuation concerns and said that it would result in a loss to shareholders. The recent statements and clarifications are the latest in the growing bitter spat between Invesco and Zee after the former called for a board reshuffle, including the ouster of MD Goenka. Zee had alleged that Invesco is trying to take over the company in a “clandestine manner” even as it is in merger talks with Sony Pictures Networks. “The recent interest of Sony, as well as the previous interest of Reliance, should be a reminder to all Zee shareholders of the enormous value that lies in this company, much in contrast to its dismal performance under the current leadership and board over the last few years,” Invesco said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-says-it-was-in-talks-to-merge-media-biz-with-zee/articleshow/87004626.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Goa||First implement freebies in Delhi, Cong tells AAP||Margao: State Congress president Girish Chodankar on Wednesday threw a gauntlet at AAP to implement its offer of freebies and doles first in Delhi, where the party has its government, before giving such assurances to Goans in Goa. He was referring to AAP’s promises of free electricity and water, and doles for unemployed, if it forms the government in Goa next year. “This is a challenge to AAP. First implement the formula of freebies in Delhi, prove your achievements, and only then give those assurances to Goans,” Chodankar said, addressing a press conference at the party’s South Goa district office, held to welcome several prominent former AAP workers into Congress.  He accused AAP of fooling Goans by promising freebies and doles. Elvis Gomes, the former bureaucrat who recently joined Congress after his brief dalliance with AAP, said that the entry of new political parties into Goa was aimed at helping BJP come to office. “The roots of some of these people are in BJP; we have seen this closely. People left that party when they realised that this was not the right direction,” Gomes, who was AAP’s chief ministerial candidate in the 2017 polls, said. Stating that AAP has forsaken its fight over Jan Lokpal and its participation in the India Against Corruption movement that propelled it to office, Gomes said AAP “fooled millions of people” and pushed Anna Hazare, who led the anti-corruption crusade, into irrelevance. Gomes further credited party observer, former Union finance minister P Chidambaram, with instilling a sense of confidence among party workers by interacting with them and clearing all their doubts and fears.

---||Mumbai||PMLA case: ED seeks dismissal of Anil Deshmukh’s quashing plea||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday sought dismissal of a quashing petition filed by former state home minister Anil Deshmukh who had challenged the summons issued and the proceedings against him in connection with a money-laundering case. The ED told Bombay high court that under the guise of quashing the plea, Deshmukh is actually seeking pre-arrest bail protection. Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi said there is no ground shown by Deshmukh that there is malice in fact or law. He said the HC’s power to quash cannot be used in this case as there was neither any reason to exercise it nor any occasion as argued by Deshmukh’s counsel Vikram Chaudhri. Lekhi added that the central agency, in fact, has the power to summon Deshmukh to seek his answers on the evidence collected in its probe against him and it is well within the provision of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, and its power to request his personal appearance. The ED said it is only exercising its right to investigate.Responding to Deshmukh’s allegation of political vendetta against him, Lekhi questioned what or against whom he is making the allegations. How could a statutory authority’s legal action be termed or treated by him as political vendetta, he asked, and said that Deshmukh has “miserably failed” to make out any such case as alleged by him. The ED counsel also added that the probe was at an initial stage and no relief can be granted as sought to Deshmukh and his entire petition is “misconceived”. Lekhi said all judgments relied on by Deshmukh’s lawyers, in fact, help the ED’s case. Lekhi said the stage of Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) has long gone and searches and seizures were conducted at Deshmukh’s residence as well and other arrests have been and hence, his request for ECIR copy is only to delay the investigation. The division bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal, after hearing both sides, reserved the quashing petition for orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pmla-case-ed-seeks-dismissal-of-deshmukhs-quashing-plea-in-mumbai/articleshow/87007763.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Affidavit now mandatory for possession certificate||Thiruvananthapuram: The government has made it mandatory for citizens to submit an affidavit in a prescribed format along with the application while seeking a possession certificate from village offices. The possession certificate includes the details of land, its type and nature, survey number, block number and ownership. Land revenue commissioner K Biju has issued a circular in this regard to all district collectors, on the basis of a high court order. The court had ordered that while applying for a possession certificate, the applicant should also submit an affidavit regarding the land for which the possession certificate is being sought, on whether the title for land was received from the government for the applicant or his predecessors who owned the land. The high court had on July 29 last year, directed the government to issue possession certificates to citizens by mentioning the nature of land, whether it has been assigned for a specific purpose under the Kerala Land Assignment Act, 1960, or not. The court had also directed the principal secretary (local self-government) to insist all local authorities to verify the nature of the land as mentioned in the possession certificate before issuing the building permit. On the basis of this order the government had on December 2 issued an order giving directions in this regard. However, an individual had approached the high court claiming that this government order is not being implemented in reality. Earlier, the high court had made it mandatory for revenue authorities to also mention the purpose for which the land is being assigned in eight villages in Idukki that includes Chinnakkanal, Kanan Devan Hills, Santhanpara, Vellathooval, Anavilasam, Pallivasal, Aanaviratty and Bison Valley. Only on the basis of a no-objection certificate from the revenue department can any construction be undertaken in these eight villages. This was done as there were several cases being reported from these villages that the land assigned for farming were being used for construction purposes. In the case of the eight villages in Idukki, the government is considering providing some relaxation to small-time constructions by relaxing the stringent rules on land titles. In June this year, revenue minister K Rajan had said in the assembly that the relaxation is under consideration and a larger consultation is required regarding amending the existing rules. The special rules, 1993, and the land assignment rules, 1964, impose restrictions on the awarded land saying that the land can be used only for farming, housing, beneficial enjoyment and setting up shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/affidavit-now-mandatory-for-possession-certificate/articleshow/87005511.cms||KP Saikiran

Additional chief secretary, department of energy, Subodh Agarwal who met Union coal secretary nil Kumar Jain and also environment secretary R P Gupta said that the discussions were fruitful and the centre assured to increase coal supply and also expedite the environment clearance for the second phase of PKCL mines. Agarwal said the supplied had fallen to 10-11 rakes per day but now that will go up to 20 rakes. Each rake of coal contains 4000 tonne coal. As per Agarwal, four rakes each from Coal India’s two subsidiaries NCL and SECL have been dispatched. Earlier, SECL used to supply only one rake. Similarly, from the joint venture coal field of RVUNL and Adani (PKCL), the state will receive 12 rakes. “With the rise in coal supply, the power situation in the state will improve further,” added Agarwal. As per a seniopr RVUNL official, the thermal power plants in the state require 20 rakes coal daily for at least 20 days to bring power generation to the normal level to meet the demand of the people. Besides, Agarwal met environment secretary R P Gupta and sought quick approval for the second phase mining of PKCL coal mines. The second phase of PKCL mine has not been able to take off because of the pending environment clearance for the 1136 hectare land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-to-get-20-coal-rakes-claims-energy-secretary/articleshow/87005457.cms||---

In a letter to chief secretary Niranjan Arya on August 18, Union power secretary Alok Kumar said, “We are witnessing a sharp increase in demand for electricity as the economy is opening up throughout the country. As coal-based thermal power plants share most of the demands, states need to ensure that there is sufficient coal stock available at the power stations.” He reminded the chief secretary that “Coal stock at TPPs (thermal power plants) is depleting at a fast rate. As on August 15, 2021, average coal stock available in the country at plant level is of 18.5MT only which is sufficient for only nine days. This is a matter of concern.” He further said at a meeting of the coal supply related issues on August 16, 2021 with senior officials of coal and railways, “It was informed that outstanding dues against RRVUNL (Rajasthan) as on July 31 was Rs 853 crore. If dues were not cleared, they will not be able to supply coal.” The letter further said railways had informed that MDO (mine developer and operator) of the captive coal mine of RRUVNL is not booking railways rakes as they are not being paid. He asked the chief secretary to direct the concerned authorities to clear the outstanding dues of coal companies on top priority which will ensure that adequate coal supply is available for the upcoming months for uninterrupted supply of electricity. Union Power secretary again in another letter on September 1 asked the chief secretary to clear the outstanding dues. However, the state government the other day claimed that there was no delay in payment at any stage. Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Limited (RVUNL)) has paid the entire dues of Rs 393 crore in August 2021 itself to National Coalfields Ltd (NCL). Similarly, the state government claimed that under the fuel supply agreement from September 2021, the company is being paid in advance for the supply of coal regularly. An advance payment of Rs 228 crore has been made to NCL from September1 to October 8. That means the state had paid only part of the dues of Rs 853 crore. Besides, advance payment made only after the crisis aggravated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-authorities-ignored-warning-by-centre-on-coal-crisis-reveals-letter/articleshow/87005477.cms||Joychen Joseph

The boat club was started in the second half of December last year. Initially, the boat club registered a footfall of around 700 people per day on weekends and 400 people per day on weekdays. But the boat club was shut down on April 3 due to the second wave of the pandemic. But after the easing out of the Covid restrictions, the board club resumed operations around two months ago and now the footfall has increased upto pre-Covid stage. The boat club project is the brainchild of district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal and was conceptualized and brought to effect by him during his earlier stint between 2009 and 2014. The MTDC had bought the boats at that time. The project, however, could not see the light of the day then owing to objections from a section of nature lovers and thereafter the BJP government came to power. The project gained momentum after Bhujbal became the district guardian minister again and the project was launched in December last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/footfall-at-mtdc-boat-club-up-to-pre-covid-times/articleshow/86972206.cms||Tushar Pawar

Earlier, Jodhpur discom was getting 1200MW from the wind sources which now has come down to 45MW.Due to the change in weather in the state, the wind speed has become slow. The maximum average temperature of Jaisalmer in October is around 38.6 degree Celsius and wind speed is only 6 kmph. The windmill fans are not getting enough speed to rotate and generate power.According to the sources the present demand of Jodhpur discom is around 900 lakh units, but availability is only 734 lakh units. To compensate 166 lakh units, power cuts are being done. In the past, Jodhpur discom tried to purchase power from the open market but the price it it wanted was not offered by the private companies. Jodhpur discom is getting 2200MW from solar energy without any reduction.Barmer zone chief engineer Sanjay Vajpayee said that reduction in availability of power has been going on for the last few days. He said high temperature and heat have reduced generation capacity of wind mills.Jodhpur discom from Friday decided to start load shedding.

Justice Devan Ramachandran issued the directive after considering a case filed by a rape survivor alleging that the station house officer and a civil police officer of Thrikkakkara police station are harassing her along with the accused and that she has now gone into hiding to protect herself. The court said in the order that even though there are specific guidelines, circulars, and orders issued by various authorities, they are not being implemented effectively. In the order, the court said, “Since the State of Kerala is on the party array, I am of the firm opinion that the issue must be answered by them also, as to how the mandate of protection of sexual attack victims should be effectively implemented because this is a matter that cuts at the root of the societal response to such grievous attacks and offences.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/how-can-rape-survivors-be-protected-hc-asks-govt/articleshow/87005576.cms||---

Earlier, a meeting was held between civic officials and tower company representatives in this regard. The standing committee of the civic body finalised the new rates on Wednesday, which would be implemented after the House gives approval. “In order to improve facilities for citizens, we have announced the new rates in the proposal. Cellular operators/telecom service providers will now have to pay a fee of Rs 3 lakh for 5 years for rooftop towers, ground-based towers and ground-based masts irrespective of sharing. According to the previous proposal, they were supposed to pay Rs 5 lakh for 5 years,” said leader of the House Chhail Bihari Goswami. Further, for up to 12 metre-height pole sites, a fee of Rs 25,000 has been fixed per operator for a period of 5 years. In case the height exceeds 12 metres, the operator will have to pay a fee fixed for installation of mobile towers, which is Rs 3 lakh for 5 years. Besides this, in case of towers/poles installed without permission before January 21, the permission fee will be charged for the period prior to January 30, 2017 as per the applicable rates.

Sandeep Goel, Director General (Prisons) said they had received a letter from Delhi Police with names of 32 jail officials who had been prima facie complicit during the inquiry “Of the 32 personnel, 30 are regular employees, while two are contractual staff (one data entry operator and one nursing orderly),” the DG said. According to the authority, it has acted against 30 jail officials and placed them under suspension. It is also terminating the services of the two contractual employees. Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana had written to the Union ministry of home affairs and the director general of Delhi Prisons to act in this regard. The Supreme Court had earlier asked Asthana to probe the nexus after taking note of a status report filed by the Enforcement Directorate, which highlighted certain disturbing facts relating to the way in which the premises of Central Jail Tihar had been misused by the Chandra brothers. The SC had transferred both the brothers from Central Jail Tihar to Arthur Road and Taloja Central Jail in Mumbai. The police chief had submitted a report in this regard on September 28 after visiting Mumbai and Tihar Jail in connection with the probe. On October 6, the SC granted permission to conduct a full-fledged criminal investigation in the matter based on the inquiry conducted by Delhi Police. It had also directed the officials of Tihar Jail to be placed under suspension and the Union home ministry to respond to the suggestions that were contained in the report submitted by Asthana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unitech-case-30-jail-officials-suspended/articleshow/87005589.cms||---
---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Most Navratri, Durga Puja rituals peak today||MUMBAI: As the Navratri festival draws to a close on Dussehra on Friday, a cluster of important rituals such as Navratri Havan and Kumari Puja will unfold at Devi mandals and Durga Puja pandals on Thursday. The buoyant ritual of Sindoor Khela and Ravan Dahan will cap the final flourish on Vijayadashami. The Bengali community arrived for Sandhi Puja in full finery at 11.30pm on Wednesday, albeit in smaller numbers than previous years. This vital ceremony marks the cusp of Ashtami and Navami. The ritual came to life in Kandivli where the Krishti Durga Pujo is housed in a village set-up. “Our mandap has been built around the banyan tree giving a hut-like look. Accordingly, the idol bears a village look. The pandal is located at Shogun Hall because organising the event at our regular open-air venue would make it difficult to maintain Covid protocols,” said spokesman Arindam Dasgupta. Krishti will not host celebrity performers but instead organise in-house programmes to champion young talent. The HRCWA (Hillside Residents Cultural & Welfare Association) Puja at Thakur Village in Kandivli (East) has shifted to a smaller clubhouse. The organisers thoughtfully announce the menu a day before, and members arrive to pick up parcels the following day. Joint secretary Sumantra Mitra said, “We cannot invite people for food indoors, but we make sure they do not miss the delectable fish fry, khichdi, fried rice, chicken pakoda and egg roll.” HRCWA has deepened its focus on corporate-driven social initiatives. Mitra said, “We have devised a vocational training programme named ‘Hridan’ for underprivileged youth, especially girls. Our programme ‘Own Your Garden’ involves creating green spaces with potted plants along the footpath with neighbouring societies. We also gathered 100 rundown bicycles, repaired them and donated them to villagers in Malshej Ghat in two jeeps provided by Mahindra.” HRCWA has called off Sindoor Khela owing to Covid. In Navi Mumbai, the 25-year-old Durga Puja of the Koparkhairane Bengali Association at Shetkari Samaj Mandir permits only those visitors who have taken both doses of the Covid vaccine, said secretary Piu Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-most-navratri-durga-puja-rituals-peak-today/articleshow/87011430.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Cornered by police, fugitive shoots & kills self in Kotputli||JAIPUR: A 22-year-old fugitive died after he allegedly shot himself after a police team cornered him in Kotputli late on Tuesday night. Roop Chand alias Sukkha was a resident of Khetri in Jhunjhunu district. He was carrying a reward of Rs 5,000 and accused in serious offences, including a murder case. According to Jaipur (rural) SP Shankar Dutt Sharma, the accused was carrying an illegal weapon (desi katta). He said that a patrol party had received a tip-off that some suspects were travelling from Bansur to Kotputli in an SUV. Weapon recovered from the possession of the accused on WednesdayPolice set up barricades for checking vehicles on the Bansur road when they found that the vehicle was heading towards Chaturbhuj village through a dirt road. A police team followed the suspects and found that they had abandoned their vehicle near Nangal Panditpura and fled into nearby farms. Police laid an outer cordon around the farms while another team began looking for the suspects with torch lights. Police said that Sukkha opened fire at them when he found that the armed cops had circled his hideout. Several cops swarmed the spot where the gunshot was heard. One team reportedly stumbled upon the accused who was lying motionless. Officials claimed that they recovered a weapon near the body of the accused. Kotputli DSP Dinesh Kumar Yadav said the accused was on the run after he had recently shot dead a liquor businessman. “He was under our scanner for the past several weeks now. On Tuesday, we had specific information that the accused was on the way to Kotputli,” he said. Police said that Sukkha’s aides had fled from the area and they were looking for them. Police summoned an ambulance and took Sukkha to the hospital where he was declared dead. Officials informed their counterparts in Jhunjhunu and the body was handed over to the family after post-mortem. “Besides murder, he was also involved in serious offences like loot and robbery. We have learned that a total of four FIRs were registered against him in Jhunjhunu district,” an officer said. Sharma said that the district police had started ‘Operation Highway' across highways that cut through their jurisdictions to search suspicious eateries that have become shelter grounds for criminals. “It was during such an operation that we learned about the movements of suspects in the region,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cornered-by-police-fugitiveshoots-kills-self-in-kotputli/articleshow/87005657.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Builder told to give Rs 1 lakh payout to IIT-Bombay prof, wife for mental pain||MUMBAI: The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has directed a Borivli builder to pay a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for mental pain and agony to an IIT-B professor and his wife, who had booked a Rs 75-lakh flat in the builder’s project in 2013. The builder was also directed to hand over possession of the 1,070 sq ft flat in Saffire project at Magathane, hand over another flat of the same dimensions in that locality to the complainants or refund the Rs 23 lakh paid for the flat in 2013, along with 18% interest pa. Complainants Dr Dinesh Kabra and Nitika Kabra entered into an MoU with Amogh Enterprises and Rajaram Manjavkar in 2013, for the sale of the flat and the complainants paid around Rs 23 lakh. The promoters had agreed to hand over the flat within three-and-a-half years. The complainants, represented by advocate Dharmendra Damani, said the promoters did not start construction even after five years of the agreement. Therefore, the complainants issued a termination notice in 2018 and told the promoters to cancel the MoU, and refund the amount along with interest. But the promoters did not comply with the notice and assured possession in due course. Subsequently, as no construction was carried out and possession was not given, the complainants filed a complaint. D R Shirasao, presiding judicial member of the commission, in an order on October 30, directed the promoters to hand over the flat within three months of passing of the order. The order stated that if the promoters could not hand over possession, the promoter was directed to hand over another flat of the same dimensions in that locality. The order also stated a third alternative: If the promoters cannot hand over any flat, they would have to refund the amount paid by the complainants along with 18% interest pa. The presiding judicial member directed the promoters to pay a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for mental pain and agony, besides cost of Rs20,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-builder-told-to-give-rs-1l-payout-to-iit-b-prof-wife-for-mental-pain/articleshow/87005651.cms||Sanjeev Devasia
---||Delhi||Delhi cops probe blasts from the past||NEW DELHI: Ashraf Ali, a Pakistani national arrested on Monday over terror charges, has reportedly identified a suspect in the 2011 Delhi High Court blasts case. The suspect, Ghulam Sarvar, is also a Pakistani national, sources say. He allegedly fled to Pakistan after the blast, which had led to the deaths of 15 people. Sarwar, Ali claimed, was infiltrated into India through the same channel as him. It is also being probed whether Ali had a role in a blast in Ramgarh in Jammu in 2009. A BSF DIG was killed in action when terrorists triggered an explosive at the spot along the international border. This came up while police were corroborating Ali’s claims of being involved in incidents of brutalising soldiers in the Valley a decade ago. Sources said Ali’s claims pointed towards some incidents in which jawans had been beheaded during an ambush. Details were being collected from the respective police stations in J&K, an investigator confirmed. Ali had shifted from Delhi to J&K in 2009 and remained there till 2017. If found involved, the tip-off with intelligence agencies that he was also an IED expert would turn out to be true, said an investigator. DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha is learnt to have formed a special team led by ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan to probe the foreign visits taken by Ali in the past. His passport analysis revealed that Ali went to Thailand to meet his ISI handlers after which he was directed to shift back to Delhi and lie low till further orders. Questioned about his visit to Thailand, Ali told police that he had joined a Pakistan-based NGO called Dawat-e-Islami and had gone there for organisation-related work. He also visited Saudi Arabia in 2013, which he claimed was for Haj. Police have also found evidence of his frequent visits to Nepal, which Ali was not able to explain. The two phones seized from Ali have been sent for forensic analysis and data retrieval. Ali is being jointly questioned by multiple intelligence agencies, including National Investigation Agency. After the arrest of the terrorist, a huge cache of arms and ammunition, including an AK-47 assault rifle, ammunition and a hand grenade were seized from his hideout in Kalindi Kunj. The forensic analysis would help police establish the identity of the entity that had sent the coordinates of the location where the weapons had been buried on the instructions of Ali’s handler. Ali, a native of Narowal district in Pakistan’s Punjab, was heading the sleeper cell nodes after infiltrating the country in 2004. Police are conducting raids to locate other members of the sleeper cells.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-probe-blasts-from-the-past/articleshow/87005702.cms||Raj Shekhar

According to district administration officials, the festival will be conducted in association with district tourism promotion council (DTPC), Kanchiyar and Ayyappancovil panchayats, KSEB and forest department. Meanwhile, the forest department raised objections for conducting it inside the Idukki wildlife sanctuary.

The court asked the Mathura district jail to provide the report of Rahman, 26, who has been advised surgical intervention by experts from AIIMS Delhi, in next hearing. The court’s directions were issued after the jail authorities told it that the accused will be sent for the treatment when the expenditure is made available by the authorities. The next hearing is scheduled on November 8. Rahman, a PhD scholar at Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, was arrested last year with Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan and two others on the way to Hathras to meet the gang-rape victim’s family. Later, the Enforcement Directorate had started investigating money laundering charges against them. The counsel for the accused said in the court that the applicant is suffering from life threatening disease and continuous illness may cause serious threat to his life. Therefore, the court may issue appropriate directions for providing necessary medical treatment to the applicant and the jail authorities be directed to furnish the report of the treatment being provided to him before the court. According to district jail authorities, they have submitted the demand of expenditure to the director general of police/inspector general, Prison Administration and Reform Services, UP on October 10 and as soon as they get the approval, Rahman will be sent to the AIIMS Delhi for surgery. The authorities told the court that AIIMS experts have asked for Rs. 2lakh and 10 units of blood for surgery of Rahman for Aortic Regurgitation disease. Rahman was being taken to the PMLA court for a hearing when he got sick on September 22. He was taken to a community health centre, from where he was sent to the district hospital in Agra and then to SN Medical College in the same city. The doctors there referred him to a higher centre — SGPGI (Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences) in Lucknow or AIIMS in Delhi. But authorities took him back to jail instead. Later, he was taken to AIIMS for an expert opinion and was advised surgery by the doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hathras-case-pmla-court-seeks-report-on-treatment-being-given-to-phd-scholar/articleshow/87000950.cms||---

---||Mumbai||BMC halts food truck distribution, Shiv Sena netas miffed||MUMBAI: In a setback for a chunk of Shiv Sena corporators, the BMC has stayed the distribution of food trucks as freebies ahead of the 2022 civic elections. The BMC’s planning department recently issued a circular directing all wards to not distribute any food trucks bought from civic funds citing the lack of a comprehensive policy for food trucks in the city. TimesViewAt a time when BMC is facing a cash crunch, it is surprising to see that corporators are going on a spending spree, using funds for distributing freebies like computers and food trucks. The BMC must first focus on providing basic amenities like good roads and open spaces. If at any items are distributed, it must ensure distribution is regulated and monitored. Food trucks must not be distributed unless a well thoughtout policy is rolled out.Stating that food trucks are part of a citywide policy, the circular said: “This policy deals with the civic health, encroachment and road departments as well as Mumbai Police and traffic police, so there is a need for a comprehensive policy by taking inputs from all these departments...and place a draft policy before the civic group leaders and general body.” BMC officials said close to a dozen corporators, mostly from Shiv Sena, had put in requests for distributing food trucks bought from BMC funds. In February, the BMC had cleared a proposal for buying 30 food and vegetable trucks worth Rs 5 crore for distribution in Shiv Sena corporator Yashwant Jadhav’s E ward in Byculla. Jadhav said they have been distributing food trucks for two years. “There is a detailed list of items that can be given by the BMC, which includes food trucks. Corporators are free to take as many food trucks as they want based on money available in the budget and their requirement,” he said. “The circular is violating corporators’ rights. They should have allowed distribution of the already ordered food trucks and implemented the circular from next year. This circular is bad in law and arbitrary.” But SP corporator Rais Shaikh welcomed the circular. “Food trucks should only be distributed after a detailed policy is approved. We are in favour of a food truck policy, but there should not be any arbitrary distribution,” he said. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra concurred. “If there is a circular to stop distribution due to lack of a policy then the 30 food trucks already distributed in Byculla by the Sena should be taken back till a formal policy is approved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-halts-food-truck-distribution-sena-netas-miffed/articleshow/87005693.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Agra||UP: Family alleges negligence after pregnant woman die at ‘medical centre’ in Etah||AGRA: A 24-year-old pregnant woman succumbed during treatment at an "unauthorised" nursing home in Kailashganj locality under the Kotwali Nagar police limits of Etah district on Tuesday. The chief medical officer (CMO) has ordered a probe. Police have registered an FIR after a complaint from the patient's husband. Her family alleged that she was not given proper treatment at the district women’s hospital where she was brought on Monday evening. Sachin Gupta, the woman's husband, said, “My wife Puja Gupta was pregnant and had labour pain on Monday. We took her to the district women’s hospital. No doctor came to see her." He added, "We later took her to a nearby private hospital. Here, my wife delivered a baby girl. Staffers handed us the baby, but didn’t allow us to meet the mother. We were told that she was critical and required an emergency surgery. She died on Tuesday. The newborn baby is also serious. We've admitted her to another hospital.” According to sources, the "unauthorised centre" was issued a notice by the health department last year. But, no follow up action was taken. On Wednesday, CMO of Etah Umesh Tripathi said, “A probe has been ordered. The private nursing home was operating in a residential area. Primary investigation revealed that the nursing home was not registered with the health department. It has been sealed.” SHO of Kotwali Nagar DN Mishra said, “The body has been sent for postmortem. No doctor or paramedic was found at the centre. An FIR has been registered against Anu Upadhyaya who was running the centre under IPC section 304A (causing death by negligence). The accused is still at large.” The state government had recently ordered the health department to take strict action against all such "medical centres".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/family-alleges-negligence-after-pregnant-woman-die-at-medical-centre/articleshow/87001034.cms||---

As part of it, the power utilities want to go the extra mile to convince the Union government to direct the coal ministry and the ways to allot 20 coal rakes to thermal stations in the state without power purchase agreements or coal linkages, on emergency basis. According to an official statement, the APGenco’s thermal plants received on average 24,000 tonnes of coal a day in September against the requirement of 70,000 tonnes. This was recently increased to 40,000 tonnes at the request of the state government. The shortage in coal production across the country for the last two years, steep rise in coal prices in the international market, and the recent surge in grid demand in Andhra Pradesh have led to power supply crunch. Officials said the spot power purchase rates have touched an all-time high of Rs 20 per unit compared to the earlier average cost of Rs 4 to Rs 5 due to the increasing gap between demand and supply arising from the coal deficit. At the same time, the average power demand surged to 190 million units a day in October, against the 160 MU in the corresponding period last year. The APGenco plants are currently generating only 2,300 MW to 2,500 MW thermal power against their total installed capacity of 5,010 MW due to coal shortage. While Krishnapatnam and Dr Narla Tata Rao Thermal Power Stations are being operated at reduced capacity, some units of Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant have been shut down. Andhra Pradesh has an installed capacity of around 18,533 MW, out of which 8,075 MW is solar and wind generators. However, they do not serve the purpose of base load power due to their inherent variable nature. State energy minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy said the state government is taking all measures to overcome the coal supply crisis and the consequent reduction in power generation. “This is purely temporary. We will definitely overcome this crisis with the support of the government and consumers. The ultimate goal of government and power utilities is to protect the interest of consumers and work for sustainability of the economy,” said Srinivasa Reddy. On the other hand, gas supply is available for generating only 100 MW out of the total installed capacity of 908 MW. The Hinduja National Power Corporation Limited’s 1,400 MW thermal power plant is sub-judice in the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/power-utilities-gear-up-to-meet-challenges/articleshow/87001063.cms||---

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Greens demand complete revamp of Wayanad projects||KOZHIKODE: Greens have demanded complete overhaul of the Wayanad package announced by the state government saying that the government should drop those projects which would not contribute to the sustainable development of the hill district. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had announced a Rs 7000-cr development package for Wayanad to be implemented over the next five years. Wayanad Prakrithi Samrakshana Samithi (WPSS) said in a letter to the chief minister and the state planning board that the package announced for the eco-restoration and revival of the agriculture sector and economy of the district is being scuttled by earmarking huge sums for projects like tunnel road and for tourism and road projects. They said that many of the draft projects which are part of the package would exacerbate the ongoing environmental destruction of the district’s fragile landscape. They demanded that half of the outlay of the package should be earmarked for the ecological restoration of the district and for the revival of agriculture and protection of water and land resources. “Also people’s representatives, experts and public workers are being sidelined in drawing up the projects of the package which is being scuttled by officials and retired bureaucrats,” WPSS president N Badusha said adding that the draft projects would only lead to destruction of the district. He said that many of the projects currently included in the package were not in sync with the call given by United Nations to draw up sustainable development goals in the next decade focusing on ecological restoration and to address the challenges posed by climate change. WPSS office-bearers said that of the tribal communities who make up for around 20% of the total population of the district, 3,000 families are landless. “While there are around two lakh acres of land which has been illegally kept under possession by large firms, there is no mention in the package about landless and homeless people in the district. Those who have prepared the projects seem to have been guided by the notion that distribution of livestock and poultry holds the key to tribal development,” they said. It is unfortunate that Rs 1,000 crore is earmarked for uncontrolled tourism development in the district, which is damaging the ecology of the district and also adversely affecting peaceful life of tribespeople, WPSS said. They added that while Wayanad which has been a top hotspot of human wildlife conflict in the country, only Rs 100 crore has been earmarked for conflict mitigation and added that at least Rs 1,000 crore should be allotted for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/greens-demand-complete-revamp-of-wayanad-projects/articleshow/87005791.cms||---

Blaming Mohammad Ali Jinnah for the Partition, Jawad said, “In 1947, Jinnah made the biggest mistake of partitioning the country. If there was no Partition, there would have been 60 crore Muslims in India and no political party would have dared to point fingers at them.” Jawad said political parties had failed to do anything for the Muslim community. “Congress, SP, BSP have done nothing for Muslims even though Congress ruled the country for 55 years. BJP also wants to keep only the majority community happy,” he said. The cleric was visiting the family of a 40-year-old farmer who died mysteriously during a police raid in his village of Thitki. Saharanpur police had picked up Mohd Zeeshan following allegations of cow slaughter on September 5 and later claimed that he had accidentally shot himself in the leg while trying to flee and “died out of fear”. His wife had alleged in a police complaint that Zishan was beaten to death by police.

The court also pointed out that there was “nothing except the statement of the accused and the co-accused” to link them with contraband. The NCB had arrested Sameer Khan in July 2021 alleging he invested funds in drug trafficking along with arrested British national, Karan Sejnani. A chargesheet was filed before the special court. Hearing Khan’s bail application, the court released him in September. The order was released to the media on Tuesday. ‘No material to prove the role of min’s son-in-law’A special court while granting bail to NCP minister Nawab Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan said rigors of Section 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, which pertains to offences cognizable and non-bailable, are not attracted in his case. Of 194 kg drugs seized, active constituents of cannabis were found in 1.2 kg which puts the quantity of contraband in the ‘intermediate’ category. NCB opposed the bail saying Sameer was part of a syndicate and involved in dealing, peddling and consumption of drugs. NCB said it has challenged the bail order in the Bombay high court. The special court said the NCB complaint says contraband seized at Rampur in UP was 194.6 kg but the panchnama mentions 189 kg. The panchnama was not part of the chargesheet. The judge questioned “this particular aspect” and its bearing on the conduct of the investigating machinery. “…reason for not incorporating the said panchnama is till date is not answered,” the judge said. The special court also pointed out that there was “nothing except the statement of the accused and the co-accused” to link them with the recovery of contraband. Apart from this, no material to prove the role of the accused has been “placed on record by the prosecution,” the court said. The recovered contraband, as per the chemical analysis report, cannot be held “under the ambit of commercial quantity,” the order said. The order said the compliances required under Section 37 is to ensure “that a person ... has an opportunity to defend himself.” Non-compliance with mandatory provisions for search, seizure and arrest as envisaged in the Act result in vitiation of such search, the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-material-to-prove-the-role-of-mins-son-in-law/articleshow/87005789.cms||Vijay V Singh

The RLD chief, who was in Hathras to address a farmers’ rally in Sadabad, a Jat belt in the district, paid tribute to farmers who died in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. He appealed to people to "snatch power from the guilty through votes" and called it the “best possible revenge for the atrocities on farmers”. Chaudhary added that the BJP was indulging in “caste politics”. Referring to the UP government’s decision to set up a state university in the name of Jat king Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, he said, “Did they ever visit the Prem Mahavidyalaya in Mathura which is in a dilapidated state?” The ruler had given up his own residence in Mathura in 1909 so that Prem Mahavidyalaya, touted as the country's first polytechnic, could come up on the land. The RLD leader alleged that 8,300 people were booked under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act since the Narendra Modi government came to power. “There is UAPA in the country against terrorist activities, but the conviction rate is only 2% against terrorists. However, anyone can be booked under this Act, if they raise their voice against the government,” he said, adding that some journalists who were on the way to cover Hathras incident were booked under the Act. “Everyone knows the truth but they are still behind bars,” he said. Atiq-ur-Rahman, a 26-year-old PhD scholar was arrested last year with Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan and two others while he was on the way to Hathras to meet the Dalit gang-rape victim’s family. They were charged with sedition and under the UAPA. Chaudhary promised that grants for farmers would be doubled — from the current Rs 6,000 annually to Rs 12,000 — if RLD was voted to power. He said the grant to the farmers will be given under a scheme which would be named after Chaudhary Charan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/no-tie-up-with-cong-for-2022-polls-but-talks-on-with-sp-rld-chief/articleshow/87001109.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Clad in their best, women took out colourful processions carrying Bathukamma in many parts of the city. They placed their Bathukammas at the center, danced around them with synchronising claps and steps while singing folk songs. While many colonies had set up plastic ponds in the locality for the immersing Bathukammas, several women were also seen heading to the nearest water body to set the flower stacks afloat. “Floral decoration, dance, music and food stalls are part of our Bathukamma and Dussehra celebration,” said Mithilesh Kumar Singh, vice-president, Rajapushpa Atria Owners Welfare Association. Singh said that tens of women from the society have been taking part in the Bathukamma celebration daily and added that ‘visarjan’ of Bathukamma is being done at a makeshift plastic pond in the society. Likewise, in the Vidyanagar colony in Chandanagar, scores of women were seen taking part in Bathukamma celebrations after puja on Wednesday night. “Every year, I make it a point to take part in Bathukamma celebrations in the colony and pray not just for the well-being of my family, but also of all the residents in the colony,” said K Lakshmi, a resident of the colony. Instead of going to Tank Bund or any other place in the city, denizens seem to have preferred to celebrate the festival in their locality this year owing to Covid-19 fear. “We thought it is best to celebrate the festival in the colony. Looks like many are of the same opinion,” said Vinay V, a resident of Miyapur. Although the Telangana government announced that Saddula Bathukamma, will be celebrated on Wednesday, few colonies, however, have decided to celebrate the final day of the Bathukamma festival on Thursday. “We will be celebrating Saddula Bathukamma tomorrow as Bathukamma is a nine-day festival,” said P Ranjith Kumar, member, Matrusri Nagar’s cultural committee. He said that on an average about 250-300 women have been taking part in the Bathukamma celebration everyday. “At least another 300 have been taking part in puja daily,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/saddula-bathukamma-blooms-on-grand-finale/articleshow/87003475.cms||---

Police learnt of the killing when they got a call from a resident about a body lying on the road and disrupting traffic movement. TimesViewAn incident of lynching in the national capital is both a cause for alarm as well as a matter of collective shame. Killer mobs cannot be allowed to have a free run in the name of vigilantism. All involved in the act need to be apprehended immediately to ensure that the common citizen retains faith in law and order.Eyewitnesses told police that Gagandeep, 28, was suspected by his attackers of entering their huts and stealing their mobiles. They tied him to a pole and beat him brutally. The six accused, arrested within eight hours of the crime, were identified by police as Munna,19, Jaldhar Kewat, 45, Shukkar Kewat, 48, Kishan Yadav, 41, Ramesh Kumar, 19, and Kamal Kumar, 22. According to cops, after receiving the call around 10.30am, they went to probe & were told the body had rolled to the middle of the road from its perch on a ledge. No cellphone recovered from lynching victimPolice later identified the deceased as 28-year-old Gagandeep, who earlier worked as a van driver but was unemployed at present. Apparently, a man had tried to revive the man, but got no response. The man then summoned his relatives and informed the cops. Parvinder Singh, deputy commissioner of police (Outer), said, “In her statement to police, Jyoti, sister-in-law of the deceased, Gagandeep, said he had been beaten by some men and died during the assault. Based on her statement, a case of murder has been registered.” During the interrogation of the arrested men, they disclosed that Munna had screamed at Gagandeep, accusing him of being a thief, and the rest of the men had set upon him. The police officer said no mobile phone, stolen or otherwise, was recovered from the deceased. Sobbing and trying hard to control her emotions, Jyoti told TOI, “Why did they kill him? His entire body was blue so he must have been thrashed badly. First, he was not a thief and even if I suppose he was, can people just beat and kill anyone in this manner? They tied him to a pole and thrashed him. Then they threw his body near the drain.” Jyoti said that police should investigate all angles related to her brother-in-law’s death, adding that there must have been more than the six arrested men involved.

---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: Gandhi Hill planetarium revival on cards||VIJAYAWADA: Better days are in store for the planetarium located at Gandhi Hill here as the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) is planning to ink an MoU with reputed Planetary Society to develop it. City planetarium is the second oldest planetarium in the country after the one in Kolkata. It was established in 1971 and students from various parts of the state used to visit it and attend the daily special shows. Gandhi Hill Society used to undertake the maintenance work at the planetarium and arrange special programmes during solar and lunar eclipses. But it started to lose sheen around 2005 and was closed down in 2016 after the lens got damaged. The society which planned to import the lens could not do so. Meanwhile, VMC took charge of Gandhi Hill development and established greenery and children's parks. Civic body held talks with BM Birla Science Center in Hyderabad seeking a facelift to the planetarium. Venkateswara Reddy, executive engineer of VMC who is monitoring the development and renovation works of planetarium said, "We are planning to develop Gandhi Hill as a major tourism destination. Planetarium is a very important element in it. We had talks with some reputed science centres and will give a new shape to it soon. The commissioner is regularly monitoring and inspecting the works." Jana Vignana Vedika (JVV), Vijayawada Science Society and other organisations have welcomed the move. "Children should be educated about space and planetary movements. Unfortunately, the planetarium in city remains shut for years. Hope VMC will restore it soon and offer a variety of activities related to science and technology," said M Satya, activist of JVV.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/gandhi-hill-planetarium-revival-on-cards/articleshow/87001148.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Delhi||India-China: Tale of missed opportunities||The challenge from China now confronting India is “huge” because the Indian strategic establishment missed opportunities in adopting “a singularly realistic approach” to it in the past, fighter pilot-turned military historian and strategic commentator Air Vice Marshal Arjun Subramaniam (retd) said on Wednesday. Discussing his latest book titled ‘Full Spectrum: India’s Wars, 1972-2020’ at a Times Litfest session with TOI’s Suneel Sinha, Subramaniam said India should have pressed home its advantage after the Nathu La clash in 1967 or the Sumdorong Chu face-off in 1986-87 to move towards a border settlement with China. “There were missed opportunities even after 1986-87. Instead of consolidating and building military capabilities as well as border infrastructure, we got taken in by the smokescreen created by China. The host of border agreements came to naught in 2020 (when Chinese troops made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh),” he said. Though the China challenge is “up and running”, the analyst said he was not “so despondent or pessimistic” as several other commentators. Noting that the Indian armed forces were now in a strong position along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control, he said, “I don’t think the Chinese can try too much mischief without being willing to accept attrition.” Subramaniam said China is more responsible vis-à-vis Pakistan, which often displays tendencies of “unpredictable and irrational behavior” dictated by deep-rooted animosity towards India. Indian policy-makers need to get serious about reflecting on intellectual and economic investment in the instrument of hard power. “I am not suggesting an uncalibrated or unbridled investment in hard power. I am just saying that in India’s rise, hard power needs to be a factor that has to be openly calculated and expressed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/india-china-tale-of-missed-opportunities/articleshow/87005856.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat agrees to Tata’s revised power tariff||AHMEDABAD: With load shedding looming as power projects shut down or work at lower capacity due to coal supply problems, the Gujarat government has decided to buy power from Tata Power’s Mundra project at a higher tariff, Rs 4.5 per unit, for one month. A senior Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd official said that the state government on Wednesday agreed to buy 1,800MW, generated from imported coal, from Tata Power’s subsidiary Gujarat Coastal Power Ltd (CGPL) on a short-term basis. The government is also in talks with Adani Power and Essar Gujarat Power Ltd to restart supply from their units, also run on imported coal, the details of which are being worked out, the official said. Both companies have entered power purchase agreements with GUVNL for supply of 1,000MW each. The decision comes when the state government’s bill for power from the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX), the country’s power trading platform, has soared to Rs 1,244 crore for the first thirteen days of October. In comparison, the government bought power worth Rs 1,035 crore from the exchange for all of September, according IEX data. Gujarat, a power surplus state, was forced to buy power from the exchange from the last few months leading to a surge in prices that went as high as Rs 15 per unit. “Tata Power will restart supply at its full capacity of 4,000MW in the next few days from its Mundra plant. This will ease prices on the exchange as Gujarat’s dependence on power from it will go down greatly,” said a state government official. A Tata Power official declined to comment on the matter. Tata Power’s subsidiary Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd (CGPL), Adani Power Mundra Ltd (APMuL) and Essar Gujarat Power Ltd have stopped power supply to Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd over the last one and half months citing the steep increase in prices of imported coal over the last few months, which have made their plants unviable. These companies supply 3,800MW to GUVNL for which they entered power purchase agreements. “Companies who have plants running on imported coal say that coal prices are presently $180 and higher, and the government should remove the $90 ceiling for reimbursing coal costs as a temporary solution. Petitions have been filed before Gujarat Energy Regulatory Commission for this,” said another government official in know of the matter. Adani Power, which stopped its 1,000MW power supply recently, has among other reasons also cited unpaid dues by GUVNL despite a Central Electricity Regulatory Committee (CERC) order, industry sources said. Adani Power and Essar Power officials declined to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-agrees-to-tatas-revised-power-tariff/articleshow/87003590.cms||Maulik Pathak

Rounak Naik, Waze’s advocate, sought an opportunity to object to DCB CID’s application. Special NIA court Judge A T Wankhede said it would be considered at the appropriate stage, if required. Waze was recently shifted to Taloja prison hospital after the court rejected his application for ‘house arrest/custody’ for post-operation recovery. Waze has also petitioned the Bombay HC with his plea for house custody. The HC is likely to hear it next week. At a separate hearing in connection with his bail application, Naik argued he was kept in illegal detention for three days, post the chargesheet being filed and that the chargesheet in Antilia bomb scare case was “incomplete”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-seeks-reply-in-waze-custody-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/87007460.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Coming home in December: Last call of jawan killed in Poonch||BAREILLY: Saraj Singh had made two calls to his family on Sunday. The first was to his mother, Paramjeet, who has been unwell with a heart condition. He wanted to check on her. The other was to his wife, Ranjeet, to tell her he’d be home in December. Hours after that last conversation, Saraj, 26, died in a gunfight with militants at Surankote in Poonch. He was among five Army men who lost their lives. Saraj’s body was brought to the Army base in Shahjahanpur on a special plane on Wednesday evening. He will be cremated on Thursday morning. UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced a compensation of Rs 50 lakh for his family. Shahjahanpur DM Indra Vikram Singh and SSP S Anand met his family at their Banda home on Wednesday and said a road would be named after him. “For his incredible display of courage,” Singh said. “The government has also announced a government job for his kin.” Born to a Sikh farmer family, Saraj was the youngest of three brothers. His eldest brother Sukhweer was the first in the family to join the Army. Saraj was barely a teenager then. Soon, his other brother, Gurpreet, did as well. Saraj was inspired. “He would run for hours to prepare for the physical test. He would keep watching (2013 Bollywood film) ‘Bhaag Milkha Bhaag’ over and over. He said it motivated him,” his friend Kuljeet Singh said. In 2016, he made it. Deployed with the 16 Rashtriya Rifles, his first posting was at Firozpur Cantonment in Punjab. The one at Surankote was his second. “He was his mother’s pampered boy. He was very close to her and would call her every day,” his father Vichattar Singh, 56, said. “On Monday, when he didn’t call, she was anxious. And we didn’t know how to tell her.” Paramjeet was finally told on Tuesday evening. She had last met her son in June. Her son Sukhweer was worried. “I fear for my mother. She is not well. All of us are in immense pain that we will never see him again,” he told TOI. “He sacrificed himself for our country.” Farmer unions staged candle marches through Shahjahanpur on Wednesday. His wife was inconsolable. They had been married in October last year. “My daughter-in-law was at her parents’ place in Hardoi. She came home after she got the news. She is in shock,” Vichittar said. Ranjeet, incomprehensible through tears, said, “We spoke on Sunday night. He said we would talk again on Monday. The call never came."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/coming-home-in-dec-jawan-saraj-singh-told-wife-hrs-before-dying-in-poonch-gunfight/articleshow/87001177.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

For schools where the tuition fee is less than Rs 13,000, the students will have to pay the lower amount, sources further said. The hike in fees comes after a gap of nine years. The Gujarat Self-Financed School Management Association had proposed to raise the fees to Rs 30,000 per annum however their proposal was overlooked by the government. There are close to 1,15,000 seats for RTE admissions in the state. This year about 68,944 candidates have been given admission under the Act after holding two rounds of admissions. Under RTE Act, 25% seats in self-financed schools are reserved for poor children. In the second round, out of 6,051 students who were shortlisted, 4,167 candidates confirmed their admission.

The court’s observations came while directing removal of unauthorised hawkers and vendors in Connaught Place. It also gave a stern warning to the officers of New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) and Delhi Police, who have jurisdiction over the area, to ensure strict compliance with orders and scheme approved by the Supreme Court on unauthorised encroachments. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the law had to prevail and it could not allow the city to be taken over by illegal encroachers or vendors. “There should be zero tolerance shown to them and all unauthorised hawkers and vendors should be removed with bag and baggage,” the bench said. It directed the chairman and NDMC executive engineers concerned, the DCP and SHO of the local police station to remain present before the court on November 18. “Status reports should be filed by NDMC and Delhi Police about the steps taken by them not only to remove the encroachment, but to ensure illegal encroachers and vendors do not return, and the area was kept clean. NDMC should have permanent boards in the entire Rajiv Chowk and Indira Chowk areas displaying no hawking and no vending zone, the bench said. The court’s order came on a plea by New Delhi Traders’ Association seeking directions to the authorities to ensure illegal hawking and squatting or vending activities in “No Hawking” and “No Vending” areas of CP and Connaught Circus stop permanently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/failure-to-remove-illegal-hawkers-hurts-right-to-life-says-hc/articleshow/87005933.cms||---

Education minister Jitu Vaghani recently chaired a meeting to address the issues of students facing difficulties in understanding courses of various subjects due to online education. Speaking to mediapersons on Wednesday, Vaghani said, “The government has received wide-scale feedback that due to online education, school students are facing issues in understanding lessons. Many students could not get online education in rural areas also. To help all such students, we have formed an expert committee who will study issues faced by the students due to online education.” “The government has allowed offline education for students of Class 6 and above, and the government is considering opening classroom education for Classes 1 to 5 as well.

The special investigation team (SIT) probing the violence made two more arrests on Wednesday — Ashish’s friend Ankit Das, who owns a black Fortuner in the three-car convoy that allegedly ran farmers over that day, and a man identified as Lateef, who was reportedly part of the convoy and fired shots in the air. Ashish Mishra and his aide Ashish Pandey, who was arrested last week, had moved the CJM seeking bail. “We opposed their applications. They were denied bail by chief judicial magistrate Chinta Ram,” special prosecution officer SP Yadav told TOI. SIT officials said they are “gathering evidence and arresting people on the basis of what comes up.” They questioned Ashish Mishra over the day but he was not taken to the site of the killings. His remand will be over on Friday morning. At one point, he was questioned along with Das, who had moved a surrender application before the CJM on Tuesday but turned himself in to the SIT in Lakhimpur city on Wednesday. The SIT had said it was “looking for” Das, a Lucknow-based contractor who is former Congress MP Akhilesh Das’s nephew and said to be working closely with BJP now. Arrested with Das on Wednesday was Lateef, a resident of Sardhan in Kheri, who had also filed a surrender plea. “Das and Lateef were arrested and produced before the court. They were sent to 14-day judicial custody. The judge heard our application seeking their remand and granted three days,” Yadav said. The SIT also produced Shekhar Bharti, the other suspect the investigating team had said it was “on the trail of”, and got a three-day remand custody of him as well after seeking a 14-day remand. Yadav added, “Das’s counsel had filed a separate application saying he suffers from various diseases and has a slipped disc. So, the counsel said, he should be kept in a facility outside jail. He produced a Supreme Court ruling on such instances. Taking this application into account, the judge wrote to the (Lakhimpur Kheri) jail superintendent to consider Das’s special needs.” With this, the SIT has arrested six in the case so far — Ashish Mishra, Das, Pandey, Lovekush Rana, Bharti and Lateef. No person who was in the third car of the convoy, a white Scorpio, has been officially identified or arrested yet. Meanwhile, UP law minister Brajesh Pathak met the families of two people in the convoy who died — BJP worker Shubham Mishra and driver Hariom Mishra. He is the first senior BJP politician to do so. The two of them, along with BJP worker Shyam Sundar, were among eight killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. All three were identified as accused by the SIT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/union-mins-son-denied-bail-in-kheri-violence-case/articleshow/87001231.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The state said former Maharashtra DGP Subodh Jaiswal was directly connected to police transfers, and now that he was heading CBI, it would be in the interest of justice and for fair probe, to not have CBI probe the FIR.

The state will be represented by ex-advocate general Darius Khambatta.

---||Mumbai||The once dying art of calligraphy is on the path of revival||MUMBAI: Several burqa-clad women and a lone man cram into a tiny classroom on the ground floor of a shopping complex in Jogeshwari (W). Their ustad or teacher, 58-year-old Mehmood Ahmed Shaikh keeps a keen eye on the practice pages kept before the students, watching like a hawk. Dipping the nib of a pen made from dry, hollow, thin bamboo sticks into an ink pot, the teacher explains: “Calligraphy requires patience. It trains you to have focus and concentration.” Thanks to committed master calligraphers like Shaikh, the ancient art of khatati or calligraphy is in revival mode. The craft which received a massive jolt due to the arrival of digital typography has found new friends, sometimes even from unexpected counters. The art of Urdu and Arabic calligraphy are on revival mode and now attract many passionate practitioners. “Main zehni sukoon ke liye seekh raha hoon (I am learning it (calligraphy) for mental peace),” says management graduate, Mansoor Ali. Beginning in 2019, Shaikh’s Alfaz (words) Classes of Calligraphy runs in two batches weekly with over a dozen students, most of them women, in each batch. “Before the pandemic, it was twice a week. Once the student numbers increase, we will make it twice a week again,” says Shaikh whose father Abdul Haque was a master calligrapher who had distinguished himself in preparing copies of the Quran. Lokhandwala-based homemaker Shahida Shaikh always wanted to have good handwriting. “I am fascinated by the way Quranic verses are written. Now that my children have grown up (one son is a pilot with an airline while the other is a trainee pilot) I am learning the art that I always wanted to,” exults Shahida, writing a curvaceous letter on a white sheet. While Shahida was drawn to the art out of fascination for the Quranic words. Ghatkopar resident Mangesh Naik, an engineer, was drawn to calligraphy because of his friends. “I would get struck by the sacred frames that hung in the homes of my Muslim friends. I met Ustadji (Mehmood Shaikh) at a festival of Indian calligraphers —Califest—a couple of years ago at Nehru Centre and decided to become his disciple,” he says. In fact, there is a growing interest among non-Muslims to learn calligraphy. Aslam Kiratpuri, master calligrapher of ‘nastaliq school’, who also teaches a certificate course in Urdu calligraphy at Mumbai University, says that out of 30 students in his class, seven are non-Muslims. “The non-Muslim students are more diligent and dedicated. They have surprised me with the kind of perfection they possess in the art,” Kiratpuri says, especially mentioning Ramanuj Shastry. He had begun learning Urdu and was fascinated by calligraphy. One day he found that Mumbai University had introduced a calligraphy course and he joined it. In a social media post, Shastry showered praises for his Ustad (Kiratpuri): “It was a privilege to listen to a true master expound on calligraphy and a delight to watch him work. Eternal gratitude to Ustad sahab for his generosity, encouragement and precious gift of calligraphy. It has been a source of much joy and serene contentment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-the-once-dying-art-of-calligraphy-is-on-the-path-of-revival/articleshow/87006002.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

The project is expected to generate employment for families residing in the island. Officials said that infrastructure development for the project has been completed. “The responsible tourism wing of the department has given an initial round of training to villagers. Most of the works on a floating tourism facilitation centre have been completed. Now, we have to do some interior designing. Once the project gets rolling, all the 50 families residing in the island can earn a living through responsible tourism,” an official with the district tourism promotion council (DTPC) said. The project envisages tourists visiting the island to enjoy the village life and have villagers’ cuisines. They can engage in fishing, pot making, weaving hampers, making handicrafts, tapping palms etc. “Tourists can also have food from the island. We will be giving training for islanders to host tourists. Residents who want to prepare various dishes for the tourists will also be trained. They will have to register with the food safety department for the purpose by paying Rs 100,” the official added. Moreover, artists from the island will get an opportunity to perform before the tourists. Residents can also sell their products to tourists.

Devotees thronged the temple to get a glimpse of the deity who is worshipped in the avatar of Goddess Mahalakshmi. The temple has been observing the tradition of decorating the Goddess with gold and cash for a while on a particular day during navarati, almost since the temple was built. However, it picked up pace in the last two decades with the offerings of cash and gold increasing manifold. Navarati utsava committee chairman Chamarti Sridhar said the deity was garlanded and adorned with about 5 kg gold and silver and currency notes of various denominations, including foreign notes. “The decoration was done after special prayers in the early morning,” said Sridhar. Devasthanam association president P Venkata Chandrasekhar and secretary D Balaji Kumar said the devotees feel it will bring them good luck if their gold and cash are offered to the Goddess on the occasion of ‘Devi Navaratri Ustavalu’. “It is firmly believed that it will improve their businesses and fortune. The tradition has been going on for several years. We will return the cash and gold to the devotees later,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/deity-decked-with-rs-5-crore-gold-cash/articleshow/87001398.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Fire safety: Gujarat HC wants time-bound action||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court insisted on Wednesday that the authorities act in a time-bound manner for compliance of fire safety norms and prioritise areas for the purpose of implementation. After a hearing on the issue, the bench of Justice N V Anjaria and Justice A P Thaker said, “The court also expects the authorities to act in a time-bound manner as the compliance of fire safety norms is an issue which cannot be delayed, in view of the directions of the apex court and further in view that it involves life and safety of people at large including class of patients and students.” The judges asked the state government about its priority areas for enforcement of fire safety measures and inquired if it considers focusing on municipal corporation areas first because chances of accidents occurring are higher in these areas. In response to the court’s query, the state government submitted that it has prioritised implementation in hospitals and schools, and is alive to the issue that these laws should be implemented as early and effectively as possible. This was discussed during the hearing on a PIL filed by petitioner advocate Amit Panchal seeking proper enforcement of the Fire Safety Act and demanding action against the culprits in the fire tragedy in Shrey Hospital, where eight Covid-19 patients lost their lives in August 2020. Advocate Panchal pointed out from the state urban development department’s affidavit that the government’s survey revealed that nearly 48% of total hospitals across the state do not have valid building use permission, and the government believes that the scale of violation is equal among residential buildings. The advocate general conceded to this by saying, “It is a horrifying figure.” The petitioner complained of sluggish pace in enforcement of fire safety norms and BU permission on part of the authorities. He also drew court’s attention to the fact that as many as 2,456 high rise buildings in the city of Ahmedabad still do not have fire NOC. The court has posted further hearing on October 28. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the issue of fire safety issue in Covid facilities and regarding BU permission in hospitals on October 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fire-safety-hc-wants-time-bound-action/articleshow/87003868.cms||---

This was resolved at a meeting of school trustees, owners and management officials held on Wednesday. School representatives plan to meet the state government authorities in this regard very soon, said a person present at the meeting. “The authorities should regularize buildings or premises from which schools are run by clearing the pending fines or penalties. For those who do not have BU permits, impact fees should be paid,” said Bhaskar Patel, president of Gujarat State School Management Association president. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’ fire and emergency services department last month issued closure notices to more than 260 schools in the city for violation of fire safety rules. Recently, the AMC has begun cracking down on schools not complying with fire safety rules, and has sealed many of them. A large number of these schools are run from rented premises, and the schools need to ensure that all necessary permissions including BU permits are in place for the installation of fire safety equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/let-erring-schools-pay-impact-fees/articleshow/87003867.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Air cargo: Talk of delay, action promised||AHMEDABAD: Since last Friday, only one x-ray machine for scanning cargo parcels has been operational at the Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex (AACC), according to some airlines. Two machines are usually available. A section of airlines handling cargo through passenger and freight aircraft from the AACC has alleged that international shipments are being delayed. These airlines say that they and the traders shipping the consignments are facing losses. “With only one scanner operational, the turnaround time for clearing shipments for loading them into aircraft has increased,” said a source on the condition of anonymity. “On Friday, a shipment was missed. Having two machines makes clearing the cargo for loading quicker.” The source added: “While traders will have to bear additional warehousing costs, airlines will lose business.” The source said that the machine currently deployed is not operating with the required efficiency. “Therefore, there’s an urgent requirement for two efficient machines to help clear cargo rapidly,” the source said. AACC officials, however, have denied that any shipment was missed. “Two x-ray machines at the AACC are very much operational,” said a senior AACC official. “While one is being used by airlines directly, the other is dedicated for shipments directed by a certain agent.” The official added: “Therefore, airlines handling the cargo through the agent are able to clear the shipments through the second machine.” The official went on to say: “While the turnaround time has slightly increased, not a single shipment has been missed.” The official said: “Meanwhile, we are working to make another spare machine operational soon.” Other AACC sources also said that no shipment was missed. They said a dispute had erupted between two airlines over handling their respective cargo on priority. Typically, shipments are handled between 5pm and 5am, which is the peak hour of operations of the air cargo complex. According to AACC estimates, 130 tonnes of export cargo and 45 tonnes of import cargo are typically handled daily. “The challenge is that 85% of the total cargo is handled in a short span which is causing bottlenecks,” a senior AACC official stated. Adani cargo hub awaits operationalizing A new cargo terminal was recently set up by Adani Airports at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad. The new terminal has been conceived to expand the international cargo handling capacity at the city airport. Sources at the airport confirmed that approvals for operationalizing the terminal from various ministries and the aviation regulator are pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/air-cargo-talk-of-delay-action-promised/articleshow/87003759.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Narendra Dabholkar case trial scheduled from October 29||PUNE: Special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi on Wednesday submitted a list of 32 witnesses to a special UAPA court for examination during the trial in the August 20, 2013, murder of veteran rationalist Narendra Dabholkar. The trial is to commence from October 29, as per an initial programme for two months finalised by the court. Special judge SR Navander, hearing the case, was expected to pass an order on whether to hold the trial from a dedicated facility inside the Yerawada central jail in view of the crowding concern or from the Ashoka hall at the district and sessions court premises. The judge, however, told the representing lawyers that Ashoka hall did not seem to be a feasible option. The trial can begin with examination of formal witnesses from the existing courtroom in the old building with restricted attendance of people, lawyers and the media. On October 29, the court will start with the examination of an inquest panchanama witness, followed by another witness who accompanied the police party during a search of the flat where Dabholkar would stay during his visits to Pune. Subsequent trial proceedings have been fixed for November 13, 20 and 27, besides, December 4, 11, 18 and 19. After the court proceedings on Wednesday, Suryavanshi told TOI, “Our list contains names of some very important witnesses, including eye witnesses, but we won’t elaborate any further at this stage.” Prime accused and ‘Sanatan Sanstha activist’ Virendrasinh Tawde, besides Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar — accused of opening fire at Dabholkar — were produced via videoconferencing mode from the Yerawada jail. Another accused Vikram Bhave, who is out on bail granted by the high court, was physically present, while the fifth accused Sanjiv Punalekar, a Mumbai lawyer, secured exemption from hearing. Defence lawyer Suvarna Avhad said the accused have still not received a CD of Dabholkar’s postmortem procedure. Similarly, they haven’t yet got the X-ray plates and photos of the body. She said the defence had already applied for these documents. Suryavanshi brought to the court’s notice that the case was initially probed by the Pune police before the CBI took it over in May 2014. “We will verify which agency has these documents and make a statement accordingly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dabholkar-case-trial-scheduled-from-october-29/articleshow/87007517.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Prepare to pay more for gold this season||AHMEDABAD: Are you planning to buy gold during this festive season? Be prepared to shell out extra as gold prices are rallying ahead of run up to the season, with good sales expected. Backed by robust demand and tracing the international rally, gold prices have risen by Rs 1,400 per 10g in ten days. Prices of the yellow metal prices rose from Rs 47,600 on September 30 to Rs 49,000 on Wednesday. Haresh Acharya, national director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA), said, “Gold prices have rallied over the past three days in the international market. Moreover, the rupee depreciated against the US dollar due to which the effective price of gold in the Indian market is high. Demand has also shown an increase in the domestic market ahead of the festival season, which may also propel prices up. However, we expect gold prices to remain in the current range and don’t foresee a surge in the near future and clearly, people have accepted this price and are making purchases.” Jewellery demand has picked up well since Navratri and is expected to grow, on account of muhurats such as Dussehra, Pushya Nakshatra, Dhanteras, Diwali and New Year. Manoj Soni, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller, said, “Over the past two months, demand for gold jewellery has surged. Due to the pandemic, many weddings were postponed last year and were deferred to this year, which is propelling demand for jewellery. At least 50% of purchases are being made in exchange for old gold and the rest are through cash, card and cheque.” “The ratio of people buying jewellery through exchange is usually 20%. However, after the pandemic hit, many people who deferred weddings and similar functions bought gold bars as an investment and and are now exchanging them for jewellery,” said Soni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prepare-to-pay-more-for-gold-this-season/articleshow/87003865.cms||Niyati Parikh

A meeting was held recently between officials of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and SVPI authorities, where the decision to resume the service was taken. Municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar said, “We noticed that a number of flyers on arrival have to walk some distance to get a taxi. Some even walk up to the Taj hotel with their luggage. Thus the bus service will be resumed shortly.” Top AMC officials confirmed that some 15 buses will be deployed on the 19-km route. AMC estimates show that 9,000 passengers transit from SVPI airport and the shuttle bus service will be handy for flyers to transit to various parts of the city. The bus will run from Iskcon Crossroads to RTO Circle to the airport. The drop-off point at the airport will be near the domestic departures area, and the pick-up point will be close to the arrivals area of the domestic terminal. A ticket counter will be set up in the airport arrivals area. AMC has this time consolidated routes and passengers can avail of the bus service at a cost of Rs 50, which can be paid in cash or through digital payments or even using the Jan Mitra card. The shuttle bus service will operate from 6am to 11pm and will run every 30 minutes. The number of passengers is further expected to go up, as the Union ministry of civil aviation has given approval to airlines to operate domestic flights at 100% capacity from Monday, October 18. All the buses deployed for the shuttle service are part of the new electric bus fleet of the BRTS. In June 2017, the bus service had been launched covering a 22-km route from Karnavati Club to SVPI. The service shut some 16 months later in October 2018, due to underutilization. Sources said that in anticipation of the festive season passenger rush and expected resumption of international flights, the service has been restarted at an appropriate time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/airport-shuttle-bus-service-to-restart-soon/articleshow/87003849.cms||Niyati Parikh

Sadly, things are not the same anymore as Covid has catapulted the future of artists, especially effigy makers, with many struggling to make ends meet. Many say in 2019, 29 effigies of the Ravana clan were made. But this time, their number has come down to less than 15. Due to inflation and the pandemic, effigy committees are fearing a bleak future. Almora is credited with starting Ramlila in Kumaon. For many decades, only Ravana's effigy was made and burnt here. Over the years, the number of effigies increased. Different effigy committees of the city make the effigies of Ravana, Kumbhakarna, Meghnad, Ahiravan, Tadka, Khar Dushan, Trisara, Devantaka, Narantaka and Malyavant. But around this time, members of each committee come together to make the effigies. The process also piques the interest of children who also try their hand at effigy making. With Covid restrictions in place, last year, no effigy was made, except that of Ravana. Ravi Goyal and Raman Verma of Ravana's effigy committee say they would spend Rs 10,000-12,000 on an effigy but this time the expenditure has gone up 20 to 25 per cent. Ankur Bisht, who is making an effigy of Kalkasur, says the effigy will cost him around Rs 20,000, while last time, he spent Rs 17,000. Narrating his ordeal, Gaurav, Krishna and Sumit, who are making effigies of Lavanasura in Johri Bazar, say Covid has plunged them into financial crisis, which will take them years to tide over. In Laxmi Bhandar Hookah Club, the mere formality of making a small-size effigy of Tadka is on. Also, there won’t be the effigies of Meghnad and Kumbhakarna this year, said Tribhunav Giri Maharaj, member of Laxmi Bhandar Hookah Club.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-casts-shadow-on-effigy-makers-business-in-almora-only-15-to-go-up-in-flames-this-dussehra/articleshow/87001559.cms||---

So, those up to 35 years of age can apply for government jobs. The relaxation has been given keeping in mind the Covid pandemic and will be in force until August 31, 2022. A government statement said that a number of competitive exams could not be held because of the pandemic and the step has been taken to ensure that people get a fair shot at bagging government jobs. Government spokesperson and education minister Jitu Vaghani said that a candidate in the general category can apply for a government job until the age of 35 in cases where graduation is the criterion. “Until next August, the maximum age limit will be 36 years for this category,” Vaghani said. He added that for government jobs where education qualification is less than graduation, the maximum age limit for applying has been relaxed from the existing 33 years to 34 years. In case of candidates from scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribes, other backward castes (OBC) and economically weaker sections (EWS), the age limit has been relaxed from 40 years to 41 years in graduate category and from 38 years to 39 years in the category where education qualification is less than graduation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/age-limit-extended-for-govt-job-seekers/articleshow/87003862.cms||---

Scared and sad at the same time, they avoided stepping out. Wearing masks and carrying santisers, this year, they finally got the chance to see the performance,” said Kumar, a resident of officer’s colony, Race Course. With the threat of possible third wave of Covid looming large, the family is treading with caution. Like Kumars, there are several other families who are trying to come to terms with the new normal. “I am a schoolteacher and my daughter had been asking me to bring her here for the past two days. We both have the next few days off so I didn’t see any harm in coming out. If we get time, I might take her to see the effigy burning as well,” said Madhulika Verma, another visitor at to Race Course, Dharampur Ramlila ground. For organisers, the turnout has been much higher than anticipated. “We never expected such a huge turnout, given the situation. This time, we have only one tea stall, unlike previous years, when there used to be food stalls and toy shops as well. We are still seeing an average of around 600 people every day, which is a higher than what we expected. We are taking all necessary precautions and following all government guidelines,” said Babita, one of the Ramlila organisers. The committees also believe that they will see good crowd strength on Dussehra as well. “This year, the location has been shifted from Parade ground to a schoolground. Instead of a two-day affair, it is going to be a one-day event. It’s a long weekend and we expect a good turnout on Friday,” said Santosh Nagpal, media coordinator, Dussehra committee, Bannu Biradari. According to the latest guidelines, organisers are not required to take permission from district administration. “However, it is mandatory that every event sticks to the 50% capacity rule. Our (administration and police) teams will remain on alert to ensure that the guidelines are not flouted,” said city magistrate Kusum Chauhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/footfall-much-higher-than-anticipated-claim-ramlila-organisers/articleshow/87001580.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The BJP has also warned to disrupt supply from the KPCL to Karnataka by targeting railway siding if the demands were not fulfilled. The agitators dug up a trench on the road leading to the mine blocking movement of vehicles. There were repeated altercations between the cops and agitators, as the police tried to stall the digging of the trench. BJP leaders warned the cops from the makeshift stage that they will be responsible for the consequences if they tried to obstruct digging of the road or dissuade the agitators. Mungantiwar said KPCL has not fulfilled the long pending demands of the PAPs despite repeated petitions. “The company has not carried out rehabilitation of Chek Baranj and Baranj Mokasa villages, denied minimum wages to the workers,” he said. “Moreover, KPCL has not paid salaries to the workers for the last 10 months,” Mungantiwar claimed. “The company has not returned to the PAPs 50% of the land or its compensation at Rs4 lakh per acre as it had committed in the agreement with the state government in 2016,” said the BJP leader. “The PAPs have run out of patience and hence we have closed down the mine. The road blockade will continue till October 28. We will erect a pandal on the road and 100 villagers, accompanied by senior BJP leaders, will camp there for the next 15 days,” said Mungantiwar. Failure on part of the company in fulfilling the demands of the PAPs will lead to further intensified agitation, he said and warned of stalling coal dispatch to Karnataka. Mungantiwar also said that Chek Baranj road leading to the mine is owned by zilla parishad. BJP-led ZP will pass a resolution in its general body meeting on Monday denying permission to use this road for heavy transportation. “It is our land. It is our road. It is our coal. We have allowed you to carry out mining activity in national interest. But you cannot continue it at the cost of lives of our people,” he said. BJP district president Deorao Bhongale, ZP president Sandhya Gurnule and city president Dr Mangesh Gulwade led thousands of villagers from the project affected villages to the agitation site, where heavy police deployment was ensured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-netas-lead-paps-block-road-to-kpcl-coal-mine-in-chanda/articleshow/87021015.cms||Mazhar Ali

Projects being implemented by various agencies like Cochin Smart Mission Ltd (CSML) and tourism department are lagging behind schedule thereby affecting the infrastructure development of the area. Additional chief secretary V Venu, who is in charge of tourism, on Monday convened a meeting of various stakeholders to expedite the development projects in Fort Kochi. Various projects being implemented by the CSML, including renovation of roads, beautification of beach, etc. remain incomplete, the works were started years ago though. “The work on roads, beautification of Fort Kochi beach, etc. has registered very little progress. CSML could carry out beautification works only in certain areas of the beach. So, the chief secretary has asked CSML to expedite works,” said Antony Kureethra, opposition leader, Kochi corporation. Similarly, the tourism department is still unable to start the renovation of Chinese nets even after seven years since starting the project. “It was in 2014 that the government gave administrative sanction for renovation of Chinese nets. Teak wood is required for the project. We got approval from the forest department for felling teak just before the onset of Covid-19. The trees couldn’t be cut due to various hurdles caused by the pandemic. Now, we need fresh permission from the forest department as the previous nod became outdated,” an official with the tourism department said. “At the meeting convened by the additional chief secretary, it has been decided to make high level intervention for securing forest department’s approval for felling teaks,” the official said. Though there had been 18 Chinese nets, which is considered as the signature of Kochi, now there is only 11. Even the existing 11 nets are under the threat of destruction. The government gave administrative sanction for constructing a toilet complex in Fort Kochi in 2019. Work on the project is yet to be started. “We got the technical sanction for the project only in 2020. Kitco has been selected as the implementing agency. The land identified for constructing toilet complex falls in CRZ area. So, we are exploring the possibilities of renovating an old toilet complex near Folklore theatre,” officials associated with the project said. Despite the tourism department and Cochin Heritage Conservation Society deploying 24 workers and two supervisors for cleaning the beach, the area still remains untidy. “Our workers clean the beach properly. We clean the walkways and other areas,” an official with the Cochin Heritage Conservation Society said. “But, in the case of sea weeds, we are helpless. We are unable to remove the see weeds. Unlike other beaches in the state, Fort Kochi beach is located near the estuary. So, waves would deposit the sea weeds from Vembanad backwaters in the beach. A few days ago, we along with the students of a city college removed the sea weeds. But the very next day we could see fresh deposit of sea weeds in the beach,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/delay-in-implementing-projects-impedes-devpt-of-fort-kochi/articleshow/87003904.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Since the March 2020 lockdown when schools were shut, foodgrain packets are being distributed to students instead of the cooked food. Though schools in rural parts reopened for classes 5-8, cooked food is not being served. In urban areas too, students of class 8 who are attending physical classes are getting foodgrain packets. The procedure on reopening schools discourages lunch breaks. With foodgrain packets, students will get packets of rice, pearl millet (bajra), sorghum (jowar), finger millet (nachani) and soyabean-rich nutrition bars. The state director of primary education Dattatray Jagtap has directed schools to draw up a list of students and place orders. Over 1.12 crore students are enrolled for the meal scheme. In Mumbai, there are over 7.50 lakh student are beneficiaries. The nutrition bars will be provided to students five days a week. The e-tender to manufacture bars has been awarded to Jalna-based Divya SRJ Foods. Class 1-5 students will get packets with bars of 120gm of each millet. For class 6-8 students, it will be 240gm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nutrition-bars-with-mid-day-meal-for-public-school-pupils/articleshow/87007524.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Kochi||Cusat to study impact of ocean noise pollution||KOCHI: The department of electronics at Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) started collaborating with Sony Corporation to develop an intelligent acoustic sensor node network to study marine habitats. The collaboration is part of Sony’s Sensing Solution University Program, which is designed to build partnerships with university research groups that develop innovative and useful ways of using various sensors and micro-controllers from Sony and other companies. A MoU regarding the same has been handed over virtually between Cusat and Sony during a videoconference held on Wednesday. The meet was attended by Cusat vice-chancellor K N Madhusoodanan, pro vice-chancellor P G Sankaran and electronics department head M H Supriya. The project is to develop the sensor network to help fill the gap in the global efforts to collect, monitor and analyze acoustic noise pollution in the ocean and understand its threat on marine habitats. The system helps to intelligently monitor the acoustic landscape of the ocean with near-zero human intervention. Once the network is developed, it will be deployed on the seafloor or semi-buoyant platforms across large regions of the ocean which can monitor marine habitats. Cusat said that the increased human activities in the ocean accounts for underwater noise pollution and changes in the acoustic noise landscape of the ocean severely affect marine habitats. It is noticed that the ambient background noise interferes with the sense of hearing of marine mammals, making it harder for them to hunt, navigate and communicate, eventually leading to extinction. At present the marine environment is very noisy, and most of the noise is manmade. “There is a need to monitor the acoustic ambience of the ocean for mitigating the effect of noise pollution on the marine habitat. Marine mammals have developed their hearing for many reasons such as navigation, communication, and foraging. Some animals use echolocation to determine the distance from objects including prey and predators. For instance, dolphins use sonar clicks when they confront an object to determine its location. Noise trauma also damages the hearing and long exposure can often cause permanent dumbness. Mammals often avoid noisy areas, which can be a problem if these locations are important feeding or breeding grounds,” said a Cusat statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cusat-to-study-impact-of-ocean-noise-pollution/articleshow/87003930.cms||---

The ministers had taken their oaths on September 16 and had been functioning without staff. According to sources, this led to a governance problem, as official communications between departments are made through personal assistants and personal secretaries of ministers. Sources said this led to a situation where files were piling up in various departments. A general administration department notification said the salaries and perks of these staffers will remain the same as at their earlier postings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ministers-get-personal-secys/articleshow/87003908.cms||---

The student, who was a resident doctor at Shardaben Hospital in March this year when the complaint was filed, told the anti-ragging committee of the University Grants Commission (UGC) on Wednesday that she was not aware of any such incident nor did she have any idea as to who could have complained on her behalf. Dr Cherry Shah, dean of NHL Municipal Medical College, said that a meeting of the anti-ragging committee was held on Wednesday to investigate the matter. “We called the person in whose name the complaint was filed. She said she did not file any such complaint and we told the UGC’s anti-ragging committee this,” said Shah. According to the complaint, a third-year resident doctor at Shardaben Hospital was abused by a senior resident doctor, who misbehaved and insulted her in front of nurses and others at the hospital. Questions are being raised about the identity of the complainant who has accused the senior resident doctor of misconduct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nhl-medico-says-she-didnt-complain-of-ragging/articleshow/87003932.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||4 get bail in Gujarat’s 1st ‘love jihad’ case||AHMEDABAD: Nearly four months after the first complaint under the newly enacted ‘love jihad’ laws was filed at Gotri police station in Vadodara, the four accused persons — the victim’s husband, the priest who solemnized the marriage and two persons who stood witness to the marriage — were granted bail by the Gujarat high court on Wednesday. During a hearing on Tuesday, Justice I J Vora said he was thinking of granting bail to the accused husband Sameer Qureshi, the priest Islamuddin Shaikh and two witnesses to the marriage, Naushad Shaikh and Irshad Shaikh. The judge commented that the cleric and two witnesses appeared innocent in this case, but were behind bars for long. On Wednesday, the judge granted bail to all four of them. The accused’s lawyer said they will be released after a copy of the court order is made available. The FIR was lodged on June 17, two days after the Gujarat assembly amended the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act and inserted sections making religious conversion by interfaith marriage a punishable offence. The victim first levelled allegations of forced conversion and then went on to level charges of rape, sodomy and caste atrocity. There are eight accused persons in this case, of whom seven were arrested. The courts had granted bail to the husband’s parents and sister. All seven accused and the victim herself moved the high court in August seeking quashing of the charges and requesting bail as well. The victim alleged that police officials were “overzealous” and inserted the offence punishable under anti-conversion laws into her complaint. The cops, on the other hand, refuted the allegations and asserted that the victim herself had levelled the charges by way of a written complaint. There is one more accused in this case, Meher Malek, who has been charged with abetment. She had also approached the court to get the charges against her quashed.  The HC stayed police from taking coercive action against her and from filing a chargesheet against her until the court passes further orders, said her advocate, Hitesh Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/4-get-bail-in-gujs-1st-love-jihad-case/articleshow/87003944.cms||---

At Mumbai airport these days, weekend domestic passenger numbers have been growing steadily. In October, Mumbai airport handled an average of over 53,000 passengers per day on weekdays and over 59,000 passengers per day on weekends, registering a 12% rise in weekend domestic passenger traffic. The corresponding weekday versus weekend increase for the month of September was 7%. In the first 10 days of September, the city airport handled 4.8 lakh domestic passengers, according to data shared by Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL). The number went up to 5.6 lakh in the first 10 days of October, a jump of about 17% in passenger traffic. The total number of domestic flights soared from 3,800 in the said period in September to 4,400 in October, a 15% rise. With the onset of the festive season, passenger crowds at Mumbai airport terminal-2 (T2) swelled last Friday which saw long serpentine queues at the security gates. A large majority of morning flights departed late and many passengers missed their flights as they failed to reach the boarding gates on time. The good news is that terminal 1 reopened for flights on Wednesday with GoFirst moving all its domestic operations there. The better news is that from September 1 to 10, IndiGo, Air India and Vistara were the top three airlines—all three carriers operate out of T2, that is. But this month, the top three so far are IndiGo, GoFirst and Air India. The airlines carried a total of 4.4 lakh passengers, including 75,700 passengers of GoFirst, which will now fly out of terminal 1. The passenger numbers are set to rise in airports across India in the coming weeks, with the civil aviation ministry permitting airlines to operate to their full capacity from October 18. Currently, airlines have been allowed to operate upto 85% of their capacity. Last year, when domestic-flights restarted in May after a two-month lockdown, flights to airports like Lucknow, Patna were in high demand, apart from Delhi. The most popular routes now are those to metros. Not surprisingly, Delhi was the top destination both months for Mumbai airport arrival and departure passengers. In September, Bengaluru was the second most popular destination for passengers on flights arriving into Mumbai, while Goa was the second busiest destination for passengers departing from the city. In October, Goa took the slot as the second most preferred destination for both arrival and departure passengers, followed by Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/weekend-flyer-footfall-at-mumbai-airport-rises-12-over-weekdays/articleshow/87006206.cms||Manju V

---||Goa||Ignore comparisons. I want to keep scoring for India, says captain Sunil Chhetri||Panaji: First things first. Sunil Chhetri is not going anywhere, not at least for the next few years. At 37, the India striker is not getting any younger, but judging from his two goals against Maldives on Wednesday night that took his international goal tally to 79 – two more than Pele's and just one less than Lionel Messi's – he’s not slowing down either. There’s still a lot of work to do. For one, the captain wants to win the SAFF Championship on Saturday, and when 2023 comes, wants to compete with the best at the Asian Cup in China. “For at least a few years, Sunil Chhetri is not going anywhere," the India captain said on Thursday. “The immediate goal is to qualify for the Asian Cup. This is something that is very close to my heart. I know our performances have not given the country a lot of hope, but that’s the bare minimum we should do. We must qualify for Asian Cup and rub shoulders with the best in Asia.” Chhetri’s brace against Maldives in a must-win game for India on Wednesday took his count to 79. Ahead of him among active players are two of the greatest – Lionel Messi (80) and Cristiano Ronaldo (115). Comparisons with the multiple Ballon d'Or winners are unfair, but nobody can ignore Chhetri’s longevity, consistency and the sheer number of goals that he continues to score. “As far as comparisons are concerned, everyone knows there is no comparison whatsoever,” Chhetri told TOI. “I am happy that I can score for my country. It makes the fans happy too. I will keep doing it till my last game. But there is nothing much (to the goals and comparisons). Ignore it.” The Indian captain has scored in nine out of India’s last ten victories in all competitions. Manvir Singh was also on target against Maldives, scoring his first competitive goal in more than a dozen matches. The contrast is evident, though it’s not entirely Manvir’s fault “Manvir is a beast, talented and hungry. For every physical test -- strength, stamina and speed – he’s in the top three. You see the fluctuation (in his game) because he plays as the fifth right-sided player for ATK Mohun Bagan. They play a different game and he has a different role. For the national team, there is a switch,” said Chhetri. It’s not just Manvir that gives Chhetri hope for the future. In his own words, there’s Rahim Ali, Anirudh Thapa (‘if you talk of goals, I will put my money on him’) Liston Colaco and KP Rahul, though none of them are first-choice for their clubs. So where is the one who is going to succeed him as India's top striker? “That might not be enough,” he said. “We don’t need one Sunil Chhetri. We will need better players. Whatever we have now, we need to do better. Don’t worry, we will get better players than me. That’s the hope and I know we will get there and that is my dream.” Carry on Sunil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ignore-comparisons-i-want-to-keep-scoring-for-india-says-captain-sunil-chhetri/articleshow/87029956.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The move is to prevent dropout, address language barrier and other issues being faced by the students. The authorities have already held a meeting and will finalize the module by November. They will start implementing the module from January next year. Health and social justice department will also be part of preparing the module. “We will prepare the module after holding discussions with NGOs working for the welfare of guest workers and those who study about migration. These children have to study in a different language other than their mother tongue. They have to take extra effort to get good grades compared to local students. The module will look into how we can support the students in such circumstances. Besides, we will also impart psycho-social support to the students,” said Aswathy K Raj, district urban coordinator, Out of the School, a wing of SSK. Once the module is ready, training will be given to the education volunteers. A survey conducted in August this year found that 900 children of guest workers in Ernakulam were not studying in schools. They were later made to attend education centres to equip them to attend classes according to their age and academic standard. The authorities opened additional 21 centres to accommodate these students. The official lamented the dearth of fund to provide refreshment to students at the centres. Education volunteers are trying to rope in local bodies to provide fund or food. Out of around 11,000 migrant students in the state, around 5,000 are in Ernakulam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ssk-prepares-teaching-module-for-migrant-kids/articleshow/87003980.cms||---

The water supply line will cover Navrangpura, Paldi, Naranpura, Vadaj, and Sabarmati fall under AMC’s West Zone while areas like Khadia, Dariapur, Shahpur, Jamalpur and Shahibaug fall under its Central Zone. One of the primary reasons for installing this water pipeline is that a large section of West Zone is anticipating large urban projects. This includes Sabarmati ashram redevelopment, the bullet train station, multi-crore sports complex and the cricket stadium, that will pump adrenaline into the real estate sector in this zone. Also water distribution lines in these areas are more than three-decade old. “At present, there is one water supply pipeline of 800mm diameter which caters to needs of Central Zone and West Zone. This pipeline supplies water from AMC’s Kotarpur water plant. The areas falling in the Central Zone have been facing issues like low pressure. We have planned to lay a new water pipeline of 1,600mm diameter in the West Zone which will supply water from Kotarpur waterworks plant to Chandkheda,” an AMC official said. He said that the cost of the new pipeline will be around Rs 77 crore. “The civic body has invited bids for the same and the work is likely to be completed within 15 months after the bidding and selection of private firms,” the official said. He said that the new pipeline is of larger diameter and will decrease load on the existing pipeline, thus solving water pressure issues in the areas under Central and West zones. The official said that the civic body has planned a 200 million litre per day (MLD) capacity water treatment plant at Raska, a 600 MLD plant in Jaspur and a 1,150 MLD plant at Kotarpur. Apart from this construction of a new 300MLD plant at Kotarpur is complete and it will be dedicated to public soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-to-lay-9-15km-pipeline-to-solve-water-supply-issues/articleshow/87003974.cms||---

As Mohan who directed 11 films with Venu in the lead role, including the state award winning ‘Vidaparayum Munpe’, recalled the great actor, it assumed the proportion of revelation of the sorts. “Hadn’t two of the members of the national film awards jury remained tight-lipped, Venu would have bagged Bharat award for his performance in the movie, ‘Mangalam Nerunnu’,” Mohan, who directed the movie, said. Paul, the screenwriter of ‘Vidaparayum Munpe’, was of the opinion that Venu had conquered the summits of recognition from the audience and film fraternity. “Once we were flying from Thiruvananthapuram to Madras. Actor Shivaji Ganeshan boarded from Madurai. Then, Venu told me he wanted to make an acquaintance with Shivaji. Venu had been just a few years into acting. So, I discouraged him by saying that Shivaji wouldn’t even reply to him. But he was not ready to give in. As soon as the passengers were allowed to unfasten the seat belt, he rushed to Shivaji,” Paul narrates the story of two great personalities of Indian cinema meeting. “When Venu introduced himself as a small-time actor who is a big fan of Shivaji, the latter told him that Venu is a great actor and he is a great fan of Venu. Venu didn’t need a recognition bigger than the applause given by the great Shivaji,” Paul said. According to Lal Jose, Venu was like liquid which assumes the shape of the vessel which holds it. “With slight changes in mannerism, he would become an altogether different person in the wink of an eye,” he said. A three-day Nedumudi Venu film festival was also launched on the occasion. Kerala Kalapeedom director Kaladharan, BJP leader C G Rajagopal, Fr Jacob Palakkappilly, Fr Anil Philip and Fr Thomas Puthussery spoke at the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/meet-held-to-commemorate-venu-film-festival-launched/articleshow/87003946.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The extension of validity is currently applicable for those documents which had their expiry date from February 1, 2020. In a communication to the transporters’ organisations, the ministry said, “It’s clarified that this is the last such extension and no further extension in this regard will be given by the central government.” This means even if some states or UTs notify such extension for more period — like Delhi has extended the validity period till November-end — those having expired documents may face action in case they are caught outside that particular state or UT since there is no central notification, which is applicable across the country. The ministry said, “States and UTs have also been advised to complete the pending services in mission mode and in a time-bound manner to achieve this.” It said states have been advised to put extra resources to complete the processes relating to the pending cases of renewal and reissue of various documents of fitness, permits, RCs and DLs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-extension-of-driving-licence-validity-vehicle-papers-beyond-october-31/articleshow/87008882.cms||---

From causing damage to the infrastructure to waterlogging, schools have been heavily battered. Most of the classes are not safe and are now being held in the open. According to locals, the 60-year-old building of the Government Inter College (GIC) Sald, which is located on the outskirts of Uttarkashi, is in bad shape and may collapse at any time. “Due to this, teachers have to conduct classes on open ground. During rains, it is not possible to sit out. So, around 200 students have to sit under leaking roofs in constant threat of a mishap,” said Tanuja Negi, local panchayat member of Sald. She added, "On the demand of local villagers, the government gave its nod for the construction of a new building in 2010. After spending around Rs 98 lakh, the work is yet to complete." Another such school is GIC Kandara in Pauri. Bushes here have grown so much that it has led to the fear of wild animals on its premises. “Many of the locals have seen two leopards near the school campus last week. This has led to fear among the students. We are sending the students back to their homes now. The bushes around the school have grown rapidly and are yet to be trimmed. Also, tall bushes increase the threat from wildfire,” said CS Nautiyal, principal of GIC Kandara. Nautiyal added, “Due to this year's heavy monsoon, some of our walls have started leaking and this affects the school’s infrastructure.” The condition of Government Primary School Gaila, a village located in Munsyari near Pithoragarh, is no different. “After the landslide in Gaila village, the school developed some cracks on the floor and its roof,” said Debendra Sarogi, a teacher. He added, “When we reopened after the Covid lockdown, we held classes in the open as the rooms were not at all safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/many-govt-schools-in-hills-in-poor-shape-post-monsoon/articleshow/87001746.cms||Prem Punetha

The fact that the man was seen holding a boomerang in his hand was significant. Boomerangs are weapons used by ancient humans in Africa and the aborigines in Australia. After that it was used in southern Tamil Nadu, more so in Madurai region, Gandhirajan said. Hence, it can be understood that like the early men in Africa, the early Tamils also used the boomerang as their hunting weapon. Boomerangs are seen in museums in Madurai, Ramanathapuram and Pudukottai. It was a weapon that was banned during the British rule. History has it that they destroyed over 1,500 boomerangs in the south of Tamil Nadu in the 18th century AD. Chieftains Marudupandhiar brothers are said to have been skilled users of the boomerangs. Now, this hero stone is proof that it was used a lot even 400 years ago, he said.Though this is not the first hero stone to be found with a boomerang since others were found near Karumathur and Thirumangalam earlier, it is still a very significant discovery, Gandhirajan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/400-yr-old-hero-stone-with-man-holding-boomerang-found-near-usilampatti/articleshow/87003985.cms||---

This year’s supply was much less than last year, with only 100 tonnes of flowers arriving in the market on Wednesday. President of the Madurai Meenakshi Flower market association, S Ramachandran said that the real impact of Covid could be seen through the supply to the flower market on an important day like the Ayudha puja, when not less than 500 tonnes were brought to the market during the pre-Covid times. The market was shifted in mid-July due to overcrowding during the festival and it reopened on October 9.The uncertainty that has continued to prevail ever since the pandemic struck, where the traders in the flower market have been shifted back and forth from their own market premises to other places, can be seen by the dip in supply to the market, he said. Also, the closure of the temples has discouraged flower farmers, which resulted in low supplies, he said.Thangapandian, a farmer from Eliyarpathi says that the maintenance of jasmine farms costs many thousands of rupees per acre, as labour has become expensive. “The demand also went down, so we were apprehensive in maintaining the farms and investing in them,” he said.Sangamitra R, who had come to the market said that the flower market on pre-festival days was something that she did not want miss. “It would be good if some measures were taken to regularise the crowds,” she added.Five tonnes of jasmines arrived in the flower market, compared to about 50 tonnes which usually comes to the market in this season. The other flowers collectively amounted to about 95 tonnes. A kg of jasmine sold for Rs 700, Mullai for Rs 600, pitchi for Rs 500, chrysanthemum Rs 200, button rose Rs 200, arali Rs 600, lotus Rs 20 per bud and marikolundu for Rs 120 per kilogram.Meanwhile, traders at the market have urged the district administration to open the back entrance, as it could help reduce the crowds drastically and also benefit the traders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/low-supply-covid-19-impact-flower-prices-in-madurai-mkt/articleshow/87004013.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: In this unique Ramlila, young women play Ram, Lakshman||LUCKNOW: The courtyard of Ramlila ground in Mahanagar is filled with young girls trying on their paper costumes, fixing each other’s jewellery and clicking pictures. You cannot know who is playing which character until you listen to them rehearsing their lines. As soon as their director comes in to inform them that they are ready to begin the show, all girls chant a unified ‘Jai Shri Ram’ before the final act. The 15-20 female artists—aged 12 to 40 years—are part of the unique Mahanagar Ramlilawhich takes pride in being the only Ramleela in the city where all major characters are female. From Ram, Lakshman, Sita, to Bharat and Shatrughan, all prominent roles are played by young girls in the four-day show which begins from Tuesday. Anushikha Joshi, who has been playing Ram for two years, said that her association with the character has led to changes in her personality. “Though I have been a part of Ramlila for the past two years, I have been performing since the age of 6. Each character you play leaves something with you. Lord Ram’s character has made me more patient and more calm,” says Anushikha, adding that she has grown up watching her father playing the role of Dashrath, and feels lucky to have been chosen for the role of Ram. “My father says that a good performer is one who listens to everyone patiently while rehearsing and improves with the advice of seniors. I try to follow this,” she added. Like the love between brothers Ram and Lakshman, Anushikha (20) and Srishti (19), who play them, also share a cordial relationship. “We are like one big family. I always had a secret desire to act. I feel blessed to do it by playing these mythological figures,” added Srishti. Another unique factor of this Ramlila is the Lohumi family, where all the members, including two children, play different characters. Yashi (16) plays Sita and Falguni (12) plays Shatrughan, while their parents play the role of Janak and Janak Patni. The sisters say their interest in Indian culture and classical singing prompted them to take part in the Ramlila. “We started with playing minor characters when we joined five years ago. Now, the roles have changed and I’m playing Sita, while my sister is playing Shatrughan and Gauri Ma,” added Yashi. Committee president Lalit Mohan Joshi said, “Ever since the committee was formed in 1968, we have included both genders. However, only a few women took part because of which men played female characters too. Gradually, women and young girls started joining in and now, we have more female artists than male. All our major characters, except Ravan, are played by females.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-this-unique-ramlila-young-women-play-ram-lakshman/articleshow/87006302.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra offers Rs 10,000 crore relief to farmers who lost crop||MUMBAI: A compensation package of Rs 10,000 crore was approved by the state cabinet on Wednesday for farmers who suffered crop loss due to heavy rain between June and October this year. The compensation being offered by the state is higher than that offered by the Centre under National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF). While the state has declared Rs 10,000 a hectare for non-irrigated land, the amount is Rs 6,800 as per Centre’s norms. Also, the state pays Rs 15,000 relief a hectare for irrigated land, for which the Centre offers Rs 13,500. For perennial crops, relief of Rs 25,000 will be paid. A farmer is eligible to get compensation for up to two hectares. Monetary relief announced by the state is higher than the prescribed norms under the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF), said officials. The state government started offering higher compensation from 2019 when cyclone Nisarg ravaged coastal districts. This monsoon, over 55 lakh hectares of cropped area — nearly 40% of the total in the state — were damaged in heavy rain triggered by cyclone Gulab in September. Most of the affected land is from Marathwadathat lost over 20 lakh hectares. State agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse said that the state has decided to help farmers without awaiting the Centre’s decision. “This decision will benefit farmers who have been severely affected due to the natural disasters,” said Bhuse. Officials said that a similar package of Rs 11,500 crore was announced by the state in August after the heavy damage caused in the coastal districts, especially Raigad and Ratnagiri. Officials said that a major part of this package was kept for immediate assistance and long- term mitigation measures. “This Rs 10,000 crore that the government has announced will include the crop assistance package that was announced in August,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-offers-rs-10k-cr-relief-to-farmers-who-lost-crop/articleshow/87007546.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Lucknow||UP: Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav seeks blessings of Phoolan Devi's mother||KANPUR: On the second day of the first phase of his ‘Vijay Yatra’, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday called on the mother of late MP Phoolan Devi in Kalpi area of Jalaun district. Soon after addressing a public meeting in Kalpi, Akhilesh broke the security cordon and met Mula Devi, mother of ex-MP Phoolan Devi and sought her blessings after kissing her hands. Phoolan’s mother blessed Akhilesh to form the government with full majority in the state. Phoolan Devi’s mother had come to attend Akhilesh’s public meeting in Jalaun’s Kalpi all the way from her native village Sheikhpur Gudha. She was accompanied by village head Ram Babu Nishad. Akhilesh inquired about her well being and promised all possible help if SP forms government next year. She then moved towards Akhilesh and kissed his forehead. “God should give such a son (Akhilesh) to everyone. It is my last wish that Akhilesh once again becomes UP CM,” Mula Devi told reporters. Village head Ram Babu Nishad said Akhilesh also assured them that a CBI inquiry into Phoolan’s murder case would be recommended if SP comes to power. In the public meeting organised in Hamirpur’s Kurara, Akhilesh attacked the Centre and the state government, and raised the issues of Lakhimpur Kheri, farmers, inflation, youth and unemployment. “Farmers are agitating for the withdrawal of three agricultural laws, so they are now being crushed under jeeps. If given a chance again, the people of BJP will also crush the Constitution,” he said. Taking a jibe at the government’s policy of running bulldozers, Akhilesh said in 2022 elections, the public is ready to bulldoze the BJP through its votes. “This time the people of Bundelkhand are going to handle the steering of the bulldozer themselves,” he said. He said that this government only has expertise in changing the name and stalling the work. “The country’s resources are being sold. Aeroplanes have been sold, deals to sell airports and ports have been done. Job opportunities are being scrapped. He said that inflation has reached an all time high under the rule of those who promised to double the income of farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-seeks-blessings-of-phoolans-mother/articleshow/87006350.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The first year Master of Engineering student had to keep her calm as she battled against the smear campaign by her close contestant Revathi Muthu Vadivu, 42, the widow of three-time panchayat president Ganesan. Ganesan had defeated Sharukala’s father C Ravi Subramanian, 55, a farmer, by a margin of more than 500 votes in the local body polls 10 years ago. “The opponent’s camp, banking on sympathy votes, campaigned that I am studying in Coimbatore, and that people will be affected if I get married and settle elsewhere. They campaigned that I am not vocal and people will have to pass a ferocious dog in our village to meet me,” she told TOI. “They announced it through loudspeakers in the village where I was campaigning. Their lies got my nerve, but I was advised not to retaliate. People stood by my side, believing that they could trust an educated girl, they saw me as their granddaughter and daughter and helped me win the election by a margin of nearly 1,000 votes. I secured 3,336 of the nearly 6,600 votes polled,” she said. Her first initiative would be to bring drinking water supply to all the 23 villages and hamlets through Jal Jeevan mission as getting water is their major challenge. She also wants to renovate the library, parks, community halls and other public amenities in the panchayat, which is one of the biggest panchayats in the state. “I am planning a campaign to enlighten students on various government scholarships to pursue higher education,” she said. The BE electronics and communication graduate was given a free seat for ME in VLSI as a recognition of her leadership qualities as a student association representative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/engg-student-22-to-head-vengadampatti-panchayat/articleshow/87004079.cms||M K Ananth
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra moves Bombay HC for special probe team in CBI’s case against Anil Deshmukh||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Wednesday petitioned Bombay high court to constitute a special investigation team (SIT) to probe a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case under Prevention of Corruption Act and conspiracy against former home minister Anil Deshmukh and others over allegations of transfer of police officers for money. The state said former Maharashtra director general of police Subodh Jaiswal, who was ex-officio member of the police establishment board, was directly connected to police transfers, and now that he was heading CBI, it would be in the interest of fairness and justice, and for a fair probe, to not have CBI investigate the FIR. The FIR was the one CBI had registered on April 21 based on a preliminary enquiry into a complaint by city advocate Jaishri Patil, based on a letter and allegations of “corrupt malpractice” made by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh in March 2021. The state’s petition mentions that summons have been issued by CBI to state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and DGP Sanjay Pandey, who it had earlier asked to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the letter by Singh, and who had after Singh’s quashing petition before Bombay HC, recused himself from the enquiry. The petition does not challenge the summons issued to the duo. The state will be represented by former advocate general Darius Khambatta. On Wednesday its junior special counsel Ranbir Singh mentioned the matter from an early hearing before a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal. The bench said it would hear it next week, after the five-day holiday. CBI had issued summons to both for the third time in the case and told them to appear at the agency's Mumbai office. The state also requested that the investigation by the SIT may then be monitored by either HC or a retired high court judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-seeks-sit-for-graft-probe-against-deshmukh/articleshow/87007556.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Thane||Mumbai Metropolitan Region: CNG rises by Rs 2.97 per kg, piped gas by Rs 1.26 per unit||MUMBAI: The price of compressed natural gas (CNG) will be increased by Rs 2.97 per kg, including taxes, while the rate of piped cooking gas will go up by Rs 1.26 per unit from Thursday. It will be the second increase in a month for the two categories of fuel, with CNG going up by an unprecedented Rs 5.56 per kg and piped gas by Rs 3.53 per unit in October. Revised prices inclusive of all taxes of CNG in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region will be Rs 57.54 per kg, while the piped gas rates will escalate to Rs 33.93 per unit (slab 1) and Rs 39.53 per unit (slab 2) respectively. This year, it will be the fourth increase for consumers in the city, Thane, Kalyan, Vasai-Virar and Navi Mumbai. For CNG, the total rise this year has been Rs 9.64 per kg. Earlier in February, the price of CNG was raised by Rs 1.50 per kg while domestic PNG increased by 95 paise per unit. Subsequently, on July 13, the price of CNG went up by Rs 2.58 per kg while cooking gas went up by 55 paise per unit. On October 4, the rise for CNG was Rs 2.59 per kg and for cooking gas, Rs 2.27 per unit. Mahanagar Gas Limited spokesperson Neera Asthana-Phate said: “The selling price of domestically produced natural gas has been increased by 62% by the Indian government with effect from October 1. Further, regassified LNG prices are at historically high levels. This combination has resulted in a significant increase in the cost of gas being procured by MGL. Being a customer focused company, MGL has always tried to maintain price stability for its CNG and domestic PNG customers. However, since the increase in gas price is very high, MGL had decided to progressively recover such increase in gas cost. Accordingly, the company is constrained to further increase the basic price of CNG and piped gas.” CNG vehicle numbers have now touched eight lakh in the Mumbai region. With the growing number of CNG cars and other vehicles, MGL plans to increase its CNG outlets from 272 to 372 in coming months. Automobile companies too have increased their production of CNG vehicles this year, with at least three lakh new cars being manufactured by two leading companies in 2021-22, said sources. An MGL official said: “After the fresh hikes, CNG continues to offer attractive savings of about 64% and 43% as compared to petrol and diesel respectively at current price levels in Mumbai. Also, the domestic piped gas provided by us offers 33% saving as compared to current price of domestic LPG while delivering convenience, safety, reliability and environmental friendliness to consumers.” MGL officials said there were over 17 lakh households which had piped gas connections in MMR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-cng-rises-by-rs-2-97-per-kg-piped-gas-by-rs-1-26-per-unit/articleshow/87009387.cms||Somit Sen

However, in October, when their salary was to be finalized to be paid, the university only wanted to give the old salary without hike,” said A T Senthamarai Kannan, treasurer, Madurai Kamaraj, Manonmaniam Sundaranar, Mother Teresa and Alagappa University Teachers’ Association (MUTA). The MUTA has also offered its support to the protest.Further, the non-teaching staff on consolidated pay at MKU College are also facing the same issue. If no action is taken, the employees will intensify their protest by October 20.Meanwhile, university officials stated that they can only take any action after consulting with the principal secretary to the government (higher education department), D Karthikeyan.

---||Madurai||Footboard travel is back as schools open||Madurai: With schools reopening for Classes IX to XII after more than a year, the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) buses again started witnessing crowds, and students travelling on footboards clinging onto the buses have become a common sight.At many bus stops close to schools, students can be seen rushing to get on the buses after school hours and travelling on footboards risking their lives. “The problem is that we cannot monitor students outside the school. Also, students who come from long distances have only a limited number of buses, which if they miss, they’ll be late for school so they tend to travel on footboard. Either the transport officials or traffic police must take steps to curb this practice,” said the headmaster of an aided higher secondary school in Madurai.Another reason for the sudden increase in the number of students travelling on buses is the fact that the state government has announced that school students can travel for free in regular TNSTC buses.“With already women also allowed to travel for free, the crowds in TNSTC normal buses has increased since the schools reopening. Even if bus drivers or conductors scold the students, they pay no attention. Schools must take responsibility against students travelling on footboards. The number of buses must be increased or free travel must be allowed in other state-run buses too,” said A Kanagasundar, Madurai district secretary, CITU.Meanwhile, the Madurai district Child Welfare Committee (CWC) has taken note of the issue. “There must not be any loss of life because of footboard travel. Further, if schools reopen for Class I to VIII, there will be even more crowding. We will hence be bringing this issue to the attention of the district collector and work on resolving the same,” said B Pandiarajan, a CWC member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/footboard-travel-is-back-as-schools-open/articleshow/87004113.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The smaller parties have given tickets to rebels of the main parties promised dent in their vote bank. The polling will be held on October 30. In Dhariawad, the smaller parties – BTP, BSP, CPI and Nota combined secured 8% votes in a contest where BJP candidate Goutan Lal Meena secured 12% more votes than the Congress candidate Nagraj in 2018. “The trend of sympathy wave for winning polls goes with the closest relative in case the elected representative has died. Here BJP has experimented by fielding another candidate, Khet Singh making them afresh for him. In event of any close contest, the eight per cent votes which had gone to the smaller parties and are likely to increase in the upcoming polls to play a vital role,” said Piyush Pandya, an expert on tribal area politics based in Banswara. A total of seven candidates are in the fray in Dhariawad with Congress, BJP, BTP, CPI, Bahujan Mukti Party and two indepents candidates.

---||Lucknow||UP is emerging economy of country, best in security: CM Yogi Adityanath||GORAKHPUR: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Wednesday that Uttar Pradesh is changing and is the emerging economy of the country now. After inaugurating the Mahant Avaidyanath Mahavidyalaya at Jungle Kaudia block in Gorakhpur district, the CM said, “Uttar Pradesh is changing and is now the emerging economy of the country. UP is number 1 in implementation of 44 schemes in the country. It has the best investment opportunities.” “We all have to work together to establish our state as the leading economy of the country,” he added. Yogi also unveiled a 12-foot bronze statue of Mahant Avaidyanath and launched the monogram of the college. We arrested the spread of Covid-19 and are now able to celebrate festivals, but still need to be careful and follow Covid protocols, the CM said. “The security environment in the state is now the best in the country. Over the last four years, 30,000 policewomen are ensuring the safety of women and girls in the state,” he said. Attacking the opposition, Yogi said, “During previous governments, roads were narrow, power supply was erratic, poor did not get ration and women were insecure. All this has changed.” “When work is done with good intentions, results are also good. Earlier, farmers’ produce was not purchased but now there are several purchase centres and farmers are getting price of their produce and government is sending payment directly in their accounts,” he added. Under the guidance of PM Modi, Gorakhpur is becoming a hub of education and health services, Yogi said. “Within a month, the AIIMS will be inaugurated by PM Modi, and an Ayush University is being established in Gorakhpur,” he added. Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, minister Neelima Katiyar, MPs and MLAs were also present. Sharma said when CM Yogi was fighting corona in the state, the opposition leaders were sitting in AC rooms playing twitter-twitter. The CM endured the pain of his father’s death and continued working for the people. UP was earlier known for copying during board exam but the government stopped all the malpractices, he said. Criminals and mafia fear CM Yogi and are surrendering themselves while pleading for forgiveness, Sharma added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-is-emerging-economy-of-country-best-in-security-cm/articleshow/87006410.cms||---

For this, the government has sought a database of students enrolled in state universities, associated colleges, polytechnics and industrial training institutes (ITIs). The scheme launched ahead of 2022 assembly elections is aimed at empowering the youth digitally, more so, after the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic forced education to move online. The industrial development department, in a communique to higher education department, technical education department, vocational education department, skill development and medical education department, has asked to provide a database of the beneficiaries for free tablets and smartphones. According to the prescribed format, educational institutions have to provide 26-point details about the students like name, parent’s name, birth date, Aadhar number, address, district, native state and also the academic information like the name of the university, name, level and year of the course and subjects opted by him/her. The scheme targeting young voters aged between 18 and 25 would cover one-crore beneficiaries. There are around 41 lakh students enrolled in higher education institutions and nearly 4 lakh studying in technical colleges, polytechnics and ITIs. Officials said extensive data is required before the distribution of free tablets and smartphones begins. Creation of a web portal is in process for selection of students in the first and subsequent phases, and for procurement and monitoring of the facility. “Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will decide which students will get tablets and who will get smartphones. Once we have the database, the process of selection will be started,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-to-create-web-portal-for-distribution-of-tablets/articleshow/87006451.cms||Isha Jain

In a tweet, tagging a police officer raping a Dalit woman after barging into her house at Shiv in Barmer district, said, “State is in the stranglehold of criminals. The police guards are raping the Dalit woman, because they know; the chief is weak; he is only trying to save his chair and hide his failures.” The opposition BJP had also hit out at the government after a Dalit youth was beaten to death in Hanumangrh district. On October 7, a man was beaten to death in Prempura town of Hanumangarh over his alleged love affair. Police have so far arrested seven people. The constant attack on the government invited sharp reaction from the chief minister. "Such foolish people have become their (BJP) office-bearers, who don't even have sense on how to react to an incident. Nobody has gone to the house of the dead. They are sitting here and want to remain in news," Gehlot said. He further said, "It is for the first time that I am seeing leaders who are becoming chief ministerial candidates and talking such stupid things, and are asking why Priyanka Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi is not coming to Rajasthan?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/poonia-targets-cm-over-rising-crimes/articleshow/87006456.cms||---

The collector acted within 45 minutes of her desperate appeal for a shelter during the weekly grievance day meet held on Monday. It may be a usual weekly grievance redressal meeting for the 300-odd petitioners at the Karur collector office, except for Chandra and her wheelchair-ridden son. Her genuine appeal with the collector got her a house. Posting it in his Twitter handle, Karur collector narrated the turn of events. The woman petitioned the collector by 11.30am stating that her landlord asked her to vacate the rented house as she could not pay the rent. She also pointed out the unwillingness of other landlords to give her a house citing her penury and the health issue of her son. Giving audience to the woman, the collector decided to provide her with a site and a house, which will be constructed in three months under the rural housing scheme for free. The collector said that while the woman started moving away, it struck him that unoccupied houses were lying vacant with TNUHDB at Gandhigram. After checking with the officials in the board, the collector called up the managing director of TNUHDB Govind Mantri and got an order sanctioned, which would usually take several months to process. The sanction order was issued to Chandra at 12.25pm, said the collector. Further inquiry brought to light that the woman could not afford to pay the beneficiary contribution of Rs 1.92 lakh, which the collector promised to pay from his discretionary fund. At 4pm, Chandra and her son moved to the new house allotted for them. Stating that the woman was overwhelmed with joy, the collector tweeted it that one may ask whether the collector could afford to help everyone in this manner. “Well, one can only say that real time decisions aren’t easy and such moments need to be cherished. If one can make the weak and underprivileged happy through your decision, it is the right one,” he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/karur-collector-allots-house-to-woman-son-in-despair/articleshow/87004190.cms||---

---||Varanasi||Uttar Pradesh is an emergingeconomy in country, says Yogi||Gorakhpur: Lauding the steps taken for development in the state after 2017, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said Uttar Pradesh is an emerging economy in the country. “Uttar Pradesh is changing and is now an emerging economy in the country. In about 44 schemes in the country, UP is number 1. The state has the best investment in the world and we all have to work jointly to establish the economy among the leading economies in the country,” he said after inaugurating the Mahant Avaidyanath Mahavidyalaya in Jungle Kaudia area of Gorakhpur district. Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma and minister of state Neelma Katiyar along with several MPs and MLAs of the area were also present on the occasion. Yogi also unveiled the 12-foot bronze statue of Mahant Avaidyanath and inaugurated the monogram of the college. The chief minister said that the environment of security in the state is the best in the country. “Earlier, there were only 10,000 policewomen among three lakh police forces in the state. But, during the last four years, 30,000 women have been added to the force and they are guaranteeing safety for women and girls in the state,” he said. The CM claimed that the state has successfully checked Covid-19 pandemic which is ensuring peaceful festivals. “In the past during festivals curfew was imposed, but now even coronavirus has gone away. Earlier, during festivals corona infection was at its peak but we have successfully prevented its spread. However, one needs to be careful so that the corona doesn’t return,” he said. Attacking the opposition, Yogi said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has brought development in the state. “During the previous governments roads were not wide like at present, power supply was not smooth, poor were not getting ration like now and there was no guarantee of security to women, businessmen and to elite families as it is now. I remember that in 1998, I gave Rs 10 lakh out of Rs 1 crore MP Fund for power supply in a village and now each village is getting power supply. The fertilizer plant which was closed in 1990 will be ready within a month, farmers will get fertilizer at a low rate and people will get jobs,” he added. “When work is done with good intention, the result is also good. Earlier, farmer’s produce were not purchased but now farmers are getting the price of their produce at several purchase centres. The government is sending the payment directly into the accounts of farmers,” he said. He said under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gorakhpur is becoming a hub of education and health services. “Within a month, AIIMS will be inaugurated by PM Modi. In Gorakhpur, Ayush University is being established, we have Mahayogi Vishvavidyalaya and Sainik School, ITI, two inter colleges in Campierganj and a polytechnic in Sahjanwa. Not only this, sugar is successfully being produced at Pipraich sugar mill,” the CM said. The chief minister said that Gorakshpeeth has presented the practical aspect of worship and the temple is not limited to only puja. “In 1965 Gorakshpeeth established the first college for girls. It later donated for the establishment of Gorakhpur University and in 50s Gortakshpeeth opened an inter college. At present, more than 50,000 students are studying in four dozen educational institutes of Gorakshpeeth’s Maharana Pratap Siksha Parishad.” Yogi said that Mahant Avaidyanath was a four times MP and five times MLA from the area and had close relations with Jungle Kaudia. “The college under his name will certainly lay the foundation of overall development in the area,” he added. While describing the facilities in the college, he said that there is an auditorium and wrestling hall. He also said that the government is motivating sportsmen with cash awards and described India’s achievements in the Tokyo Olympics. Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma said that “when CM Yogi was fighting with corona in the state, leaders of the opposition party were playing ‘twitter-twitter’ in their AC rooms”. He also described how the CM endured the pain of his father’s death and continued working for the people. Sharma said that under the Yogi government, the state which was earlier known for copying during Board exams, presented an example of ‘no-copy exams’. He also said that “the mafia in the Yogi regime are scared and after coming from jail plead for forgiveness. Minister of state for higher education Neelima Katiyar said that in 2017, CM Yogi made a resolution for change in the system which is turning out to be true now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/uttar-pradesh-is-an-emergingeconomy-in-country-says-yogi/articleshow/87004234.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Pollution in Hussainsagar spiked due to Ganesh immersions, fell soon after: PCB||HYDERABAD: The Ganesh immersions last month did lead to a spike in pollution levels in the Hussain Sagar Lake, show data shared by the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) on Wednesday. However, the report is quick to add that these levels dropped back to normal soon afterwards, thanks to the heavy rainfall that the city received during those days. “Due to heavy rainfall Hussain Sagar Lake received storm water from all the parts of the city. This resulted in dilution of pollutants thereby restoring the condition of the lake to normal after the immersion,” said J Sumati, environmental scientist with TSPCB, while reiterating the rise in chemical content in the water during idol immersion. While the board did not share any specific data on these increased levels, its report admitted to the count of total dissolved solids (TDS) being high at all six locations where it was measured — two places around NTR Park, near Lumbini Park, Necklace Road, near Leepakshi Handicrafts and near the Buddha statue. The TDS, which indicates the level of harmful contaminants in water, had “increased drastically” at Necklace Road, the report added. The chemical oxygen demand (COD indicates the level of pollution by organic matter) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD indicates level of oxygen in water; lower the purer) levels too had seen “minimum increase”, during and after immersion. Incidentally, to protect the lake from further pollution along with all the lakes in Hyderabad, the Telangana high court had issued an order banning the immersion of Plaster-of-Paris (PoP) idols in the water body, right ahead of the festival. It even directed that the state to only use baby ponds already constructed by the GHMC for this purpose. However, citing that the last minute ban would cause hardship to thousands of devotees, the state approached Supreme Court, asking it to allow PoP idol immersions for just this year. Eventually, the apex court green-lit the immersion of PoP idols, but only for the “one last time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pollution-in-hussainsagar-spiked-due-toganesh-immersions-fell-soon-after-pcb/articleshow/87004124.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Surat||VNSGU’s VC washes hands off thrashing row||SURAT: The garba event that led to a clash between police and members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has landed the officials of the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) in trouble. On Wednesday, VNSGU vice-chancellor K N Chavda claimed that some of the university officials proposed to hold a one-day garba event. “I was not told by the organizing team that police have denied permission for the event,” Chavda said adding that he was not informed that it was going to be a big-scale function. Some of the organizing team members had gone to seek permission from police at Umra police station. But cops refused to give permission, citing government notification that barred such events. The government authorities have allowed only sheri garbas while prohibiting big garba events. Violating the notification, a mega event was organized right in front of Chavda’s official residence. Chavda went to meet the city police commissioner Ajay Tomar to discuss the issue on Wednesday, two days of the drama unfolded. City’s senior police officials told Chavda that he cannot allow any garba event that violates public notification of government even within the varsity campus. Earlier VNSGU registrar Jaydeep Chaudhary had submitted a written letter to police demanding legal actions against cops who entered the varsity campus without the permission of the VC. In a statement to media on Tuesday, Chavda too claimed that police should have sought permission before entering the campus. However, as more details are coming out, the university top bosses are realizing that they were kept in the dark about many things. Chavda claimed that the garba event was organised for hostel students but preliminary police investigation revealed that majority of the participants were from outside the campus. Majority of those who reached Umra police station to hold a protest on Monday night were neither residents of VNSGU hostel nor its students. Questions are also being raised about who paid for the high-tech sound system and light decoration for the event which was attended by more than 600 people. ABVP claimed that some cops, who were drunk, abused students and tried to crush them under their vehicle at the venue. But a woman police sub inspector was among the team that first reached the venue. A viral video shows that her along with other cops peacefully explaining the rules to students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vnsgus-vc-washes-hands-off-thrashing-row/articleshow/87003621.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad offers 1-year break to chase startup aspirations||HYDERABAD: Engineering students studying in colleges affiliated with Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTUH) will now be able to take a break of up to one year to pursue their entrepreneurial projects as part of a break-study policy being implemented from this academic year. Following the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, JNTUH’s academic senate recently cleared the break-study policy that enables students to pursue entrepreneurship while studying. Earlier, students had to study for four consecutive years before they pursue entrepreneurship. “Students will be given an option to take a break at the end of second and third year to pursue their entrepreneurial aspirations. They can either pursue research and work in the industry or utilise the break period to work on their own company, product or designs,” said JNTUH registrar Manzoor Hussain. As per the policy, only students who have successfully cleared all the subjects in the first four semesters will be eligible to take a break to pursue research work or entrepreneurship. “Students having backlogs or poor attendance will not be eligible under the break-study policy. They will have to submit sufficient evidence about the research or entrepreneurial work that they are taking up to be able to take a break from academics,” said Hussain. The JNTUH registrar added that students taking a break will have to come back and pursue remaining semesters to be able to get their degree certificates at the end of the course. This policy will be extended to all affiliated colleges who would have to send a list of all such students to the university vice-chancellor for approval. The move by the university to introduce this policy comes months after the varsity launched the university startup initiative under which students are allowed to work on prototypes, case study reports, projects on open-ended problems right from first year to earn credits equivalent to a mini-project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jntuh-offers-1-yr-break-to-chase-startup-aspirations/articleshow/87003882.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Lucknow||Botched Kisan Samman Nidhi beneficiary list irks UP chief secretary||LUCKNOW: The UP government has sounded an alarm over callousness in physical verification of farmers under Centre’s flagship PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme, entailing an annual financial aid of Rs 6,000 to each of 2.81 crore small and marginal farmers in UP. In a strongly-worded missive sent to district magistrates on Wednesday, chief secretary R K Tewari said, “faulty” physical verification of beneficiaries has resulted in many farmers being shown “dead or unqualified” to receive benefits of the scheme, which was flagged off by PM Narendra Modi in February 2019 from Gorakhpur, political backyard of CM Yogi Adityanath. “These farmers are now registering complaints with the state government,” Tewari said in the letter, which, significantly, has also been marked to the Union agriculture and farmer welfare ministry. Tewari said, physical verification of as many 5% beneficiaries was done in a faulty manner in 2019-20. This got doubled in 2020-21, when physical verification of 10% beneficiaries turned out to be faulty. The letter, however, did not disclose total number of farmers deprived of scheme benefits. The chief secretary, not surprisingly, has asked DMs to fix responsibility on officials responsible for callousness, besides initiating action against them. The development assumes significance in the backdrop of ruling BJP facing Opposition’s fury over ongoing farmers’ protest against new farm laws. ‘ The Lakhimpur incident allegedly involving junior home minister Ajay Mishra’s son has turned to be a tipping point of the raging controversy. Tewari further noted the state government has also been receiving complaints from various districts on farmers’ grievances not being taken on a “qualitative” basis — neither online nor offline — which was a “cause of grave concern”.  He said, farmers are approaching the state government on Integrated Grievances Redress System (IGRS), a portal aimed at ensuring transparency and accountability of government departments or through other means at the highest possible government level. As per the mechanism set by the state government, a district-level committee under chairmanship of respective DMs has to take up complaints pertaining to farmers, who seek financial assistance under the scheme. Reiterating state government’s instructions, Tewari directed complaint redressal committees in different districts should work “actively” and dispose of complaints online on a “timely basis”. He directed the DM to review disposal of farmers’ complaints on a fortnight basis, besides conducting random checks to ensure the exercise is being done in a “satisfactory and qualitative” manner. Also, he said, the grievance redressal committee should also be activated for offline complaints and a control room set up for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/botched-kisan-samman-nidhi-beneficiary-list-irks-chief-secy/articleshow/87006528.cms||Pankaj Shah

Police removed the stalls of hawkers at the bus shelters in TVS tollgate at Mannarpuram and at Jamal Mohammed College on Pudukkottai Road. The action comes following the intervention of the commissioner of police, Trichy city, G Karthikeyan. “To start with, the encroachments in front of the two bus shelters have been removed. In coordination with Trichy Corporation, the eviction drive at the remaining bus shelters will also take place,” Karthikeyan told TOI. On Wednesday, the police removed the encroachments and cleaned the bus shelters that were littered due to the misuse over the years. Traffic police officials said that the encroachments in front of the shelters forced the passengers to wait outside thus providing lesser space to the buses to stop nearby. A senior police officer said that the buses stop in the middle of the road instead of stopping near the bus shelter causing traffic jam in major roads. Police have warned that action will be taken in case anyone continues to block public places. With Diwali round the corner, police plans to regulate the traffic at major junctions to ensure hassle-free movement of the people in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/encroachments-blocking-bus-shelters-in-trichy-removed/articleshow/87004193.cms||---

As per experts, numbers of such patients are increasing every year in Telangana — considered a diabetes capital of India — as well as in other states. With awareness over impact of diabetes on retinopathy still very little, most cases get detected late. “Diabetes is one of the two silent diseases of the eye — other being glaucoma — which can lead to slow blindness and by the time a patient realises, he/she could have lost 90 per cent vision, said co-founder and director of Maxivision Eye Hospital, Dr Kasu Prasad Reddy. He added that if a patient comes to the doctor after this, they can only save the remaining 10 per cent vision. “It is therefore important that everyone, especially diabetes patients, go for yearly check-ups,” Dr Kasu Prasad said “While India is the diabetes capital of the world, Hyderabad is the diabetes capital of India. As per global studies, 80 per cent of those who get diabetes, will develop diabetic retinopathy. Unfortunately, the attitude we see among patients is that of denial of diabetes. As a result when asked to get an eye check-up, they tend to ignore it,” said consultant diabetologist and preventive medicine at Apollo Hospitals, Dr Ashish Chauhan.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Drop in testing a concern despite dip in Covid cases||HYDERABAD: While the number of Covid-19 cases in the state has been declining, it has also been observed that daily testing too has been seeing a dip. The number of tests conducted per day has not crossed the 50,000-mark over the last few days which has officials concerned. While the health department typically conducts 52,000-54,000 tests per day, the number could vary substantially over the course of a month. Despite the fact that the state has the capacity to conduct over one lakh tests every day, it has conducted only around 40,000 tests every day over the past few days. Daily Covid-19 testing had reached the one-lakh-mark for the first time on April 8 following orders by the high court to increase testing. The trend continued over the next few months with over one lakh tests being conducted almost every day. During the peak of the second wave, the state was conducting around two lakh tests a day. The number of tests has been observed to dip drastically on Sundays and public holidays. The high court has once again instructed the government to conduct at least 50,000 tests per day irrespective of the number of Covid-19 cases.  According to officials, there is no shortage of testing centres or kits and they are prepared to follow the court’s guidelines too. However, while the court has directed the state to test anyone showing symptoms, officials said that many people are not coming forward for testing despite experiencing symptoms.  “As the number of cases is decreasing, people are taking things lightly. Some are even buying medicines straight from pharmacies when self-medication is extremely risky,” said a senior health official .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drop-in-testing-a-concern-despite-dip-in-covid-cases/articleshow/87003963.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: ‘No water meters for domestic consumers’||AURANGABAD: Even as the Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Limited (ASCDCL) has decided to fit meters for commercial water connections within the municipal limits, there are no immediate plans to fit such devices to residential connections, the authorities concerned said on Wednesday. Imran Khan, the assistant project manager with the ASCDCL, said the proposal for fitting water meters to residential connections could be considered once the new water supply scheme for Aurangabad gets laid. “The smart meters to be introduced in Aurangabad for water connections will avoid wastage of water and ensure smooth recovery of dues. To begin with, the ASCDCL has considered only commercial connections for fitting such meters on an experimental basis,” he said. While the local civic body, as per past records, has a note of 2,600 commercial connections in Aurangabad, the ASCDCL authorities said the actual number could be much more. “It is estimated that Aurangabad has around 5,000 commercial connections — including hotels, restaurants, lodges, shops and other commercial establishments. The local civic body is expected to carry out zone-wise survey of all such connections before embarking upon the work of fitting of meters,” Khan said. Notably, an experiment of fitting water meters for residential connections had met with stiff opposition from a large section of corporators in past even though such devices are advocated by experts to ensure judicious use of water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-water-meters-for-domestic-consumers/articleshow/86999770.cms||---

The woman, along with her two accomplices, attempted to extort Rs 5 lakh from the man. Keshod police said that Pradeep Pala, a resident of Maliya-Hatina village of Junagadh district, lodged a complaint against 42-year-old Jyoti Lohana, Sikandar and Imtiyaz under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 120B (criminal conspiracy, 386 (Extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt), and 387 (Whoever, in order to committing of extortion, puts or attempts to put any person in fear of death or of grievous hurt to that person or to any other) among others. Pala owns a jewellery shop in Maliya-Hatina village and his family lives in Ahmedabad. He had been living in Ahmedabad but returned to his native village post lockdown. “Twenty years ago, Pala was in a relationship with his neighbour Lohana. Back then, Pala was married while Lohana was still single. Later, Lohana too got married and moved to Keshod town and that was the end of their relationship. Three months ago, Pala received a call from Lohana after which they regularly talked with each other over phone,” a police official said. Soon, Lohana insisted on meeting but Pala was reluctant, the cops said. However, on Lohana’s insistence, Pala agreed to meet her on Tuesday as he was visiting Keshod town for some work. Pala went to meet Lohana in Pallavi Nagar in Keshod. Lohana came to receive Pala near her residence and later took him to her home. After some time Sikandar and Imtiyaz entered the home and started abusing Pala and also thrashed him. “Lohana also stripped her blouse and one of the accused started shooting them on a mobile phone. Then, Sikandar and Imtiyaz threatened Pala that if he did not give Rs 5 lakh to them, they would upload the video on social media. They also threatened to frame him in a rape case. After the incident Pala approached us and lodged his complaint,” a police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/woman-tries-to-extort-ex-boyfriend-held/articleshow/87003309.cms||---

There are 19 functions in UMS that empowers the university and college administrators to manage admissions, student records, faculty attendance, fees, assignments among others. Student-related functions would help in keeping track of the students during their term in the university or college. These functions would enable students to know about their payment due for colleges, hostels and other entities. Overall, the UMS is aimed at reducing workload and enhance productivity with smooth communication and data security. “Once fully implemented, UMS will help in ease of operations and functionality, better communication, student, faculty and other staff attendance monitoring, implementation of university almanac and ease of payments, finance and tracking dues and spends,” said OU vice-chancellor Professor D Ravinder.  UMS will be a single window solution for faculty to maintain curriculum vitae and set up class and teaching schedules and their management too. “The launch and implementation of UMS and eOffice by university administration is a transformative step which is going to ensure greater transparency and accountability, save time and reduce unnecessary paper work. The quick response time and disposability of files will usher in new chapter in university administration,” said Telangana commissioner of collegiate education, Navin Mittal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ou-introduces-mgmt-system-for-paperless-admin-ops/articleshow/87003926.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Karnataka couple teams up international scientists to study dancing frogs||Mangaluru/ Bengaluru: Along with eight other researchers, Dr Gururaja KV, a batrachologist at the Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design and Technology, and his wife Dr Priti Gururaja, studied the foot flagging behaviour among frogs in the Western Ghats, a paper on which ‘A Common Endocrine Signature Marks the Convergent Evolution of An Elaborate Dance Display in Frogs’ was published in the October edition of ‘American Naturalist’. However, what has made the two scientists achievement more noteworthy is that the couple decided to publish the abstract of the research paper in Kannada. Their objective was to infuse into Kannada scientific terms, which will make it easy for the common public to discuss complex concepts. Furthermore, the couple hopes it encourages other scientists to publish entire papers in Kannada. “This is an attempt to reach out to a wider audience. There may not be equivalent terms for many of the English words in the scientific paper in Kannada. By publishing the abstract in Kannada, we are hoping to introduce the public to a vocabulary that can be used in common parlance. We are also hoping that this helps people overcome their hesitation to publish their papers in Kannada. The primary objective of research is that it must reach the people, and they mist understand the rich biodiversity in their own backyard, and the Western Ghats,” said Gururaja. Nigel K Anderson, Eric R Schuppe, Lisa A Mangiamele, Juan Carlos Cusi Martinez, Rudolf von, Doris Preininger and Matthew J Fuxjager were the other researchers involved in the study. The team tried to ascertain what triggered foot flagging among the frogs, wherein the male frog arches and rotates its back foot in the air, an unmistakable visual sign. The paper lends a new dimension towards explaining this action among frogs. “We have tried to analyse this habit among frog species across the globe,” said Gururaja, whose wife Priti works at the Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru. The team of experts examined the Kottigehar Dancing Frog, the scientific name of which is Micrixalus Kottigeharensis. He pointed out that there were around 24 species of dancing frogs in the Western Ghats. “We are now aware that frogs across 18 species exhibit the foot flagging habit. In India, the male frogs engage in this habit to defend their territory from other intruding males, while the female specimens do it to cover their egg clutches in a slow-flowing stream. For our study, we considered only the male frogs. This is a 12-year-long collaborative effort with Dr Doris Preininger from the University of Vienna. We undertook the study after obtaining permission from the National Biodiversity Authority and the forest department in Karnataka,” Gururaja added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/karnataka-couple-teams-up-international-scientists-to-study-dancing-frogs/articleshow/87003232.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The accused has been identified as Sandeep Bhosale — a resident of Gurhal village in Nilanga tehsil of district. Superintendent of police Nikhil Pingale told TOI, “The man took loan of Rs 5,000 from a private money lender, who was constantly asking for the amount to be repaid. Bhosale claimed he took the loan for fulfilling the basic needs at home, as during lockdown he could not get any work.” As the suspect was unable to repay the loan, he decided to rob a elderly woman from the village. The accused kept an eye on the movement of the deceased — Sheshabai Dudhwate, who used to work at a farm — and decided to target her. On October 6, the accused reached the farm with a sharp-edged weapon and before she could understand anything, Bhosale attacked her and slit her throat. The accused, during interrogation, confessed to robbing two gold chains totally weighing about 15 grams. The accused kept these gold chains as security and took a loan of Rs 10,000 from a relative and repaid the loan he took from the private money lender. Pingale said some of the workers, who were working in the neighbouring farms heard something, but failed to see the accused. Nilanga police station’s inspector Balkrushna Shejal said initially it was a blind murder case as neither victim’s family nor the police had any clue about the suspect as well as motive behind the murder. The accused was arrested and is currently under police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/latur-man-arrested-on-charge-of-killing-80-yr-old/articleshow/86999809.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Hyderabad||Isolated populations & ethnic groups at high risk of infection, reveals Hyderabad based CCMB||HYDERABAD: Isolated populations and ethnic groups in India are at a higher risk of infection from Covid-19, reveals an international research study in which scientists from the city-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) have participated. India has several isolated populations and ethnic groups, particularly those living in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and in deep forests of the mainland. Senior CCMB scientist Dr K Thangaraj, who is also the director of the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), along with Prof Gyaneshwer Chaubey of Banaras Hindu University (BHU), and researchers from other institutes have found that since isolated populations and smaller communities carry long DNA segments, they are likely to be at a higher risk of infection from the novel coronavirus. The researchers have deduced it from the severe impact Covid-19 had on indigenous groups in Brazil. These groups had a higher rate of infection with twice the death rate than normal populations. Many indigenous communities in many countries are now on the verge of extinction thanks to the pandemic. “India is home to several indigenous and smaller communities including Andaman islanders, who are living in isolation for tens of thousands of years. We have investigated high-density genomic data of more than 1,600 individuals from 227 ethnic populations.  We found high frequency of contiguous lengths of homozygous genes (long gene segments) among Onge and Jarawa of Andamans and a few more populations, who are in isolation and follow a strict endogamy, making them highly susceptible for Covid-19 infection,” said Dr Thangaraj. As part of the study, the team also assessed the ACE2 gene variants that make individuals susceptible for Covid-19. Jarawa and Onge populations were found to have high frequency of these mutations. “There have been some speculations on the effect of Covid-19 among isolated populations. However, for the first time, we have used genomic data to assess the risk of the pandemic on small and isolated populations,” said Prof Chaubey. Researchers from Amrita University and Calcutta University apart from those in Saudi Arabia and the United States were also part of the research. Dr Vinay Kumar Nandicoori, director of CCMB, said the study has suggested the need for a high priority protection and care for the isolated populations||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/isolated-populations-ethnic-groups-at-high-risk-of-infection/articleshow/87004051.cms||Syed Akbar

Sources said the Union minister of state for finance, Bhagwat Karad, facilitated the meeting. The bank has been operating under all-inclusive directions from the RBI At the meeting, the administrator of the Rupee Bank, Sudhir Pandit, informed the RBI officials about the current fiscal situation of the bank, which, he said, has been generating profits for the past few years, with no large-scale concerns, except a negative net worth. Pandit added that a resolution of the bank, a merger with a larger bank or a revival process, is essential to maintain the interests of large depositors, who represent a small portion of the number of depositors but hold around half the total deposits of the bank, nearly all of whom are senior citizens. The Rupee Bank has been operating under all-inclusive directions from the RBI since 2013, after years of stress and mounting NPAs. Earlier this year, the RBI rejected a mutual proposal for a merger of the bank with the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank, with the bank's administrators aiming to either revive the bank or merge it with another large bank. In August, the RBI had extended the validity of the all-inclusive directions licence under which the stressed Rupee Cooperative Bank operates through to the end of November, but the bank’s administrators had then said they still wanted a definitive solution for its future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/administrators-of-rupee-bank-meet-rbi-admin/articleshow/87004224.cms||---

Police have formed half-a-dozen teams, including four to probe an insider angle, while the remaining two are exploring involvement of an outsider in Shinde’s brutal murder that took place in his bungalow loacated in the Sant Tukoba Nagar of N-2, Cidco in the early hours of Monday. An officer, who is a part of the SIT, said all three family members — wife, daughter and son of the deceased — are being questioned separately, but we are yet to make any breakthrough. Crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav, who is currently heading the SIT, said there are some unanswered questions, and our team is taking all out efforts to crack the case. While assistant inspector Ajabsingh Jarwal said they are yet to get desired cooperation from the family members. Another officer said despite several loopholes in their version, each of the three members are sticking to their own version. Police sources said their priority is to find if any suspect had made a friendly entry or it was purely an insider’s job. Moreover, police also suspect that the crime scene was disturbed and blood stains were cleaned before the arrival of police tea,. Police are also questioning the alleged abnormal behaviour of Shinde’s children, who did not bother to wake up their mother or grandparents, and instead stepped out to go to the police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sit-stunned-over-non-cooperation-from-deceaseds-kin/articleshow/86999850.cms||---
---||Trichy||Withdraw Niti Aayog’s proposals on sugarcane price: Farmers||Trichy: Following stiff opposition from cane farmers against the recommendations by the Niti Aayog allowing sugar mills to pay the fair and remunerative price (FRP) price in three instalments, Union minister Piyush Goyal has assured that the existing sugarcane Act will be followed. Bharatiya Kisan Sangam which opposed the recommendations vehemently has appealed to the respective state governments to take steps so that farmers would get their dues without delay. As per the Sugarcane (Control) Order 1966, sugar mills should pay the sugarcane FRP to the farmers within 14 days after the cane was cut. If the time limit was violated, the mills should pay 15% interest, farmers said. However, Niti Aayog, in its March 2020 report, had recommended payment of FRP in three instalments. That is 60% within 14 days of sugarcane delivery, 20% within next two weeks and the rest within another one month or upon sale of sugar, whichever is earlier. Secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said that the Niti Aayog had taken the recommendations without consulting farmers.“Before taking a decision that would create a big impact among the farming community, the Niti Aayog should have consulted all the stakeholders. That has not happened. Union minister writes to one particular state stating that the recommendations would not be implemented, instead of issuing proper announcement that would be fit to the entire country,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/withdraw-niti-aayogs-proposals-on-sugarcane-price-farmers/articleshow/87004242.cms||---

Earlier this June, around 40 gatekeepers were terminated without prior intimation. However, following various representations made by the rail users, the service term of the gatekeepers has been extended, officials said. A circular sent to all the general managers of zonal railways by the ministry of railways dated October 12, 2021, had stated that the proposals sent by some zonal railways for the extension of engagement of ex-servicemen on a contract basis for a further period of one year beyond May 2021, were considered by the board.As per the decision taken by the board, the respective zonal railways are instructed that engagement should be made in the category of gateman with the stipulation that such engagement is restricted to an actual number of gatemen already engaged or 50% of vacancy whichever is less. It was also emphasized that the engagement should be phased out gradually over the course of the year as regular employees become available from new appointments. It may be noted that Nagapattinam MP M Selvaraj met chief minister M K Stalin on Tuesday and handed over a memorandum urging him to take steps to appoint required gatekeepers in the section which would pave way to operate more passenger trains. Due to the shortage of gatekeepers, only one passenger train is being operated on the section. Meanwhile, functionaries from the Federation of Tiruvarur-Karaikudi Broad Gauge Line Users Association and Thanjavur District Railway Users’ Association expressed happiness over the railway board’s announcement. They requested the authorities to deploy ex-servicemen in the Tiruvarur-Karaikudi section and also urged to restore normal train services in that section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rb-extends-contract-of-ex-servicemen-at-level-crossings/articleshow/87004261.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai colleges may open after Diwali as online exams on||MUMBAI: While the state government has finally announced reopening of college campuses, institutes will take it easy, take stock on how many students are vaccinated, and delay reopening campuses as online exams are on or about to commence in a few days. Most colleges will look at starting in-person learning on campus only after Diwali, thus allowing students and parents to tide over the festive season over fears of an increase in Covid cases. Currently, colleges which have reopened their junior section are seeing skeletal attendance of 15%-20%, with mostly students from the nearby areas walking in due to train travel concerns as well as Covid fears among parents. The trend, said principals, would be similar for senior students. Principal Rajendra Shinde of St Xavier’s College said degree college exams are currently on and they would not like to disturb the momentum. “We will follow the government guidelines and start calling students after the Diwali vacation,” he said. Some principals have raised concerns over the discrepancies in orders for junior and degree colleges. “Is vaccination not important for junior college students? The government has said full vaccination is mandatory for degree college students. Also, there is no mention of calling 100% teachers, like was the case in junior colleges,” said one. Shobhana Vasudevan, principal, Podar College, said the college would soon float a form and check vaccination details of their student population. “We feel, to start with, we will follow a hybrid model and that will transition slowly into a full physical college. We are all waiting for the campus to resume fully and even our students are missing the buzz of campus life.” Krutika Desai, in-charge principal, Mithibai College, said even before the state announced the opening of colleges, they had sent out a survey to students asking for information on vaccination. “Once we get the details, we will take a call on how to call them for practicals and whom to call, when and how. We will however start with the hybrid mode. As we have smart boards, it should not be difficult.” Parag Ajgaonkar, principal, N M College, said the college would take a stock of vaccinated students. “Even when we took consent from parents before starting junior colleges, merely 15% gave it and currently about 10% are coming in,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-colleges-may-open-after-diwali-as-online-exams-on/articleshow/87007581.cms||---

The minister further said that the electricity behemoth was also not in a financial position to clear the arrears for the power it has purchased from the NTPC. Sharma made the statement while appealing to the power employees to end their agitation in the wake of festive season. The junior engineers of the UPPCL have been up in arms demanding removal of anomalies in their salary structure. The agitation turned further aggressive after a senior official in the finance department questioned the higher wages being given to the power employee. Sharma said that the employee should speak to the authorities to get their grudges addressed, instead of taking an agitation course. The revelation comes at a time when a looming coal shortage threatens to disrupt the power supply even as the Centre and the state government attempt to step up efforts to stem the crisis. Sources in UPPCL said that a host of state-owned power plants were facing a severe coal shortage as a result their operations were not carried out in full load conditions. Till the time of filing this report, UP’s own power generation was to the tune of 1837 Mw. As against a coal requirement of 15500 MT in Parichha power plant having a total install capacity of 1140 Mw, the power plant was receiving 5400 MT. Likewise, 610 Mw Harduaganj required 9000 MT, against which a supply of 3800 MT was made. Only two days ago, CM Yogi Adityanath asked the UPPCL to ensure uninterrupted power supply between 6 pm and 7 am in view of the festival of Navratri, Durga Pooja and Dussehra. He had also asked the power officials to coordinate with the Centre and Coal India Limited to resolve the crisis. Sharma said that the state government had the responsibility to provide power to the different areas as per schedule. He maintained that a regular power supply had to be ensured despite the financial burden which has come to stare at UPPCL. The minister said that the various distribution companies had incurred heavy losses in the aftermath of the epidemic when economic activities stalled. “The debts of the corporation have been increasing over a period of time,” he said, reiterating that the corporation was having accumulated losses mounting to over Rs 90,000 crore. The minister said that the corporation was also constrained in paying salaries to the employee on time, given the poor power situation. “The employee must rethink their decision of staging agitation seeking wage revision,” he said, urging the employee to call off their stir and contribute towards providing a smooth power supply to the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/not-enough-funds-to-pay-for-ntpc-arrears-coal-min/articleshow/87006676.cms||Pankaj Shah

Soon after addressing a public meeting in Kalpi, Akhilesh broke the security cordon and met Mula Devi, mother of ex-MP Phoolan Devi and sought her blessings after kissing her hands. Phoolan’s mother blessed Akhilesh to form the government with full majority in the state. In the public meeting organised in Hamirpur’s Kurara, Akhilesh attacked the Centre and the state government, and raised the issues of Lakhimpur Kheri, farmers, inflation, youth and unemployment. “Farmers are agitating for the withdrawal of three agricultural laws, so they are now being crushed under jeeps. If given a chance again, the people of BJP will also crush the Constitution,” he said. Taking a jibe at the government’s policy of running bulldozers, Akhilesh said that in the 2022 elections, the public is ready to bulldoze the BJP through its votes. “This time the people of Bundelkhand are going to handle the steering of the bulldozer themselves,” he said. He said that this government only has expertise in changing the name and stalling the work. “The country’s resources are being sold. Aeroplanes have been sold, deals to sell airports and ports have been done. Job opportunities are being scrapped. He said that inflation has reached an all time high under the rule of those who promised to double the income of farmers,” he said. Diesel and petrol prices have crossed Rs 100 mark, said Akhilesh and added, “Theft is also being done in the sack of DAP manure.” He asked the farmers whether their income had doubled or not, the answer was no. Raising the issue of Anna Pratha of Bundelkhand, Akhilesh said that the government has bungled billions of money in the name of Anna Pratha and even today the farmers of Bundelkhand are unable to take more than one yield. “That’s why poverty is prevailing here. They (BJP) also took lands of farmers in the name of Defence Corridor,” he said. He added, “They also made a false promise of providing employment in the name of setting up ammunition and missile factories and the reality is in front of everyone. “Their words have merely become ‘sutli- bombs’.” He said that during the Samajwadi Party regime, the ‘mandis’ were formed for the welfare of the farmers. “Again the work of making the farmers happy would be done by forming the government so that the country is not dependent on the supply of food grains from abroad.” Taking a jibe at the chief minister, he further said that he is ‘chilamjeevi’, and does not know anything. “For four-and-a-half years, which kind of tablets he was giving to the public, that now they are going around beating drums of distributing tablets. They only like two things, a bull and a bulldozer,” he said. After the formation of the SP government in the state, full care will be taken of the farmers, youth and women here. Crop insurance will be given to farmers, employment to youth and triple pension to women, he claimed. He said that instead of providing facilities to the people in the epidemic, people were seen running for oxygen or for beds, but in this hour of disaster, 102 and 108 ambulances run by the Samajwadi government worked to transport people to the hospital. The government, which advised the unemployed to sell ‘pakoras’, also hiked mustard oil to Rs 250 a litre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/akhilesh-seeks-blessings-of-phoolan-devis-mother-in-kalpi/articleshow/87004295.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The ride started from the Mahadwar gate at 9.30 pm and took the Mahadwar - Gujari - Bhawani Mandap - Mirajkar Tikti - Binkhambi Ganesh mandir route to reach back the temple premises. As the palanquin was brought out of the temple on the occasion of ‘ashtami’ (eighth day of Navratra), a huge crowd had gathered along the nagar-pradakshina route. Shivraj Naikawde, the secretary of the Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti, said, "The online bookings for 'ashtami' were full and there was a lot of rush at the temple. Around 24,000 devotees had booked online darshan passes for Wednesday. On Thursday, on the occasion of ‘navami', the temple will remain open from 9am onwards." Like every year, a ‘shalu’ (saree) from the Tirupati Balaji Devasthan, Andhra Pradesh, will arrive here on Thursday for the Goddess Mahalaxmi. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the idol of Goddess Mahalaxmi was showcased in the ‘Mahishasura Mardini’ form, where the goddess was shown slaying the demon Mahishasura. The rituals were performed by temple priests Arun Munishwar, Mayur Munishwar, Soham Munishwar and Sukrut Munishwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mahalaxmis-palanquin-taken-out-on-wednesday/articleshow/86999923.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Sambhajiraje said that no one from the government has taken steps to address the concerns of the Maratha students and youths after the Supreme Court struck down the reservation. “I wrote several letters to the government. Nobody from the government came forward. The demands are basic — the Maratha students should be given benefits given to the students belonging to other backward classes (OBCs), and they should get financial support to start their own businesses. I must admit some work has been done with regards to the SARTHI institute. However, it is not sufficient. Every time we are given the excuse of Covid to defer the decisions. Now, the community has become restless and we are planning to resume my statewide tour after October 25. I will visit the remaining districts such as Ahmednagar, Beed, Jalna and also visit some districts in Vidharbha. If the state government still ignores the demands, I will sit on a dharna at Azad Maidan,” he said. Sambhajiraje said that the state government is also apathetic to the demand of students preparing for MPSC exams of relaxing the age limit by two years. “The state government had cancelled exams for two years citing the pandemic. It is the duty of the government to grant an age relaxation to all categories of students. Also, the government has not worked out a solution to the problem of appointment letters to the students who had qualified the exam but have their appointments stuck due to the reservation issue,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sambhajiraje-to-resume-state-tour-after-oct-25/articleshow/86999922.cms||---

A team of CBI on late Tuesday evening visited his Barra house and handed over the copy of the FIR to Sanjeet’s father Chaman Lal. After staying at Sanjeet’s house for a while, the team members left telling the family members that they are going to meet the police commissioner. Sanjeet’s father Chaman Lal, however, alleged that the police could not gather strong evidence against the accused, as a result of which all the accused were released on bail. In the CBI investigation, everyone should be questioned and justice should be done. CBI Lucknow branch deputy SP Harveer Singh Sachan is investigating the matter. To recall, 28-year-old lab technician Sanjeet Yadav, who was kidnapped in Barra area on June 22, had been murdered by his abductors. According to the police, the kidnappers had dumped his body in the Pandu river. Earlier, Sanjeet’s family had alleged that it was when he was kidnapped on June 22, they were also asked by the police to arrange a ransom of Rs 30 lakh and hand it over to the kidnappers. They claimed that they threw a bag containing the cash from the top of a flyover as instructed in the presence of police, but the latter could not prevent the kidnappers from escaping with the bag and also failed to get back Sanjeet. The police had arrested five accused including a woman in this connection and all efforts to search Sanjeet’s body have till date proved futile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cbi-begins-probe-into-cityssanjeet-yadav-murder-case/articleshow/87004328.cms||---

---||Delhi||Police give a breather to eateries on health licence||New Delhi: An amendment has been made by Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana to the standing order for grant and renewal of registration certificates for running eateries. Now, police can grant or renew registration certificates without waiting for the health trade licence from the municipal corporations. Earlier, having a valid trade licence from the civic bodies was a must for applicants to obtain a registration certificate. “An applicant should be in possession of a valid trade licence from the civic bodies (municipal corporations, New Delhi Municipal Council or Delhi Cantonment Board). The applicant shall upload or email the health trade licence on the unified portal for licensing of eating, lodging or boarding establishments in Delhi within 60 days from grant or renewal of registration certificate issued by the licensing authority,” the amendment stated. The commissioner’s amendment to the standing order further stated, “The licensing unit will grant or renew the licence after obtaining required clearances from Delhi Fire Service, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and other agencies without waiting for a health trade licence from the civic bodies.” Apart from the applicant, even the civic body would have to upload the health trade licence on the unified portal. A senior officer explained that the unified portal was a single-window system for applying for a licence for an eating and lodging establishment. The application would be processed by different agencies, like Delhi Police, civic bodies, Delhi Fire Service and DPCC. Meanwhile, to reduce the burden on applicants and licence holders, Delhi Police, from the financial year 2021-22, has started granting licences and registration certificates for three years to eateries and guesthouses. “Earlier, licences were granted or renewed for one year,” the officer said. Talking to TOI, joint commissioner of police (licensing) Dr OP Mishra said that several steps had been taken to ensure ease of doing business and to bring transparency. “Our initiatives have provided relief to people,” he added. The licensing unit has also adopted the principle of management by exception, through which a majority of licence holders would be given all possible assistance within the ambit of law and only cases that deviate from the normal would be taken up for in-depth scrutiny.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-give-a-breather-to-eateries-on-health-licence/articleshow/87030253.cms||Abhay Singh

These districts include Siddharthnagar, Bahraich, Sonbhadra, Shravasti, Fatehpur, Chitrakoot and Chandauli. “There are 112 districts from across the country which are part of NITI Aayog’s ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ Programme and are assessed on the basis of progress made across 49 key performance indicators under five broad socio-economic themes like health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development, and infrastructure,” a government official said. The districts are monitored on a real-time basis through a dashboard maintained by Niti Aayog. “The delta ranking signifies the efforts undertaken by the state government and the respective district magistrates to improve the condition of underdeveloped districts),” the government spokesperson said. “Fatehpur, working on the standards set by the NITI Aayog, has achieved second spot in the field of development in the country. It was followed by Siddharthnagar (third), Sonbhadra (fourth), Chitrakoot (fifth), Bahraich (seventh), Shravasti (eighth) and Chandauli (ninth),” the government spokesperson said. He added that among these eight districts, Chitrakoot and Bahraich excelled as per NITI Aayog’s standards. As a result, NITI Aayog has allocated an additional budget for development works in these districts. “In overall delta rankings, Chitrakoot has secured fifth position in the country on parameters like education, health and nutrition,” he said. The Aspirational Districts Programme was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January 2018 as part of the government’s efforts to raise the living standards of citizens and ensure inclusive growth for all, the spokesperson said, adding that the programme aims at development of backward districts in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/7-up-cities-in-niti-aayogs-list-of-top-10-aspirational-districts/articleshow/87006742.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Degree colleges can reopen on October 20 with over 50% students||MUMBAI: A year-and-a-half into the pandemic, degree college campuses in the state will finally reopen for physical classes on October 20. Higher and technical education minister Uday Samant announced on Wednesday that fully vaccinated students can attend classes. For students below 18 years of age, vaccination is not mandatory, said the government’s resolution issued on Wednesday evening. While colleges in the state can reopen with 50% capacity or more, the decision to start classes in Mumbai will be taken by the university in consultation with the BMC. As the main mode of transport in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is the local train, the state will write to the chief secretary, seeking permission for under-18 students to travel. Although permission has been given for offline classes from Std 8 to 12, few colleges in the city have managed to start their junior colleges due to commuting constraints. Samant said, “Colleges and universities can call 50% students or more after consulting with the local administration.” Univs, colleges must conduct vax camps for students: MinHigher and technical education minister Uday Samant on Tuesday said in regions with less or declining Covid cases, university administrations can call more than 50% students from October 20. Regions where the total number of Covid cases are on the higher side and are likely to increase, the decision to start physical classes can be taken by local corporations, he added. “For students above 18 years who have not received both the doses, universities and colleges must take the initiative to hold vaccination camps with help from local district officials,” he said. University administrations can also arrange special drives in cities for unvaccinated students, like the one conducted for women. Vaccinating teaching and non-teaching staff should be done on a priority basis, he said. “Based on the Covid situation and third wave fears, different districts and universities can come out with different standard operating procedures (SOPs). It need not be uniform. For students who will not be able to attend classes, colleges should continue with compulsory online classes,” said Samant. The resolution mentioned the state is also allowing hostels to reopen in phases and that the director of higher and technical education should take necessary action after reviewing the condition of hostels. The government has been relaxing lockdown norms as cases have been steady in most regions. Schools and junior colleges were allowed to start physical classes from October 4. In Mumbai, though, very few junior colleges have managed to reopen. Principals said parents have not been giving consent as children were not eligible for vaccines and many are also facing commuting problems. Most colleges may consider reopening after Diwali, starting first with practicals as they did with junior colleges. The GR is also silent on attendance of teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/univs-colleges-must-conduct-vax-camps-for-students-in-mumbai-min/articleshow/87007600.cms||Yogita Rao

From August 15, the city police made the ‘no helmet no petrol’ rule compulsory at the petrol pumps. Under this rule, petrol pump owners or operators have been barred from selling fuel to two-wheeler riders arriving at the petrol pumps without wearing a helmet. This concept of police commissioner Deepak Pandey has paid off as at least seven or eight of 10 bikers have started using helmets. Meanwhile, from September 9 the police also started taking action against bikers without a helmet on the streets. Motorists found riding their two-wheelers without helmets were sent to the Children’s Traffic Education Park, where they are counselled for 90 minutes about the importance of wearing helmets and following traffic rules. Office-bearers of the Children’s Traffic Education Park operated by Nashik First organisation said close to 2,200 bikers have been counselled in a month’s time, including 200 women. Assistant commissioner of police (Traffic) Sitaram Gaikwad said the ‘no helmet no petrol’ rule implemented from August 14 and the counselling programme led to a huge change on the streets with nearly 90% bikers now found wearing helmets. Pandey said a few more activities will be planned in the near future like appealing to heads of government departments, educational institutes and even garage owners, etc to not entertain bikers without helmets in their premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2200-negligent-bikers-counselled-in-one-month/articleshow/86999960.cms||Santosh Sonawane

For several months now, a negative RT-PCR report has been mandatory to enter Karnataka primarily due to the high number of Covid cases in Maharashtra and Goa. “I have written to the state government seeking an exemption from the negative RT-PCR reports. However, we have still not received any directions in this case. The number of Covid cases in the Belagavi district has reduced and the beneficiary turnout at the vaccination sites has also increased. The state government will take a final call in this matter. As of now, negative RT-PCR for visitors coming in from Maharashtra and Goa is still mandatory,” said Hiremath. People living in the border areas will get a much-needed relief if the requirement of a negative RT-PCR report is ruled out. People in the border areas of Kolhapur (Maharashtra) and Belagavi (Karnataka) districts are facing hardships as they have to cross the state borders daily for their day to day requirements. Mahesh Desai, a vegetable trader from Kagal, said, “I travel to Gadhinglaj and Sankeshwar markets regularly for business purposes. Carrying a negative RT-PCR report every time is difficult, hence, I am forced to take a long route via internal village roads to reach Gadhinglaj to avoid checkposts. The decision should have been taken long back as cases in the Kolhapur district and the border areas have been low in the last two months."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/rt-pcr-ve-report-to-enter-karnataka-likely-to-go/articleshow/86999967.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

This angered residents, who claimed the civic body had failed to provide adequate vaccines to people, many of whom had to travel to Mumbai and neighbouring districts to get vaccinated. Dhole, who took over as commissioner in March 2021, was credited with containing the spread of Covid-19. Dhole was felicitated by Maharashtra governor B S Koshyari for his efforts in tackling Covid-19 on October 8. The order stated that fully vaccinated patients had a better recovery rate. The order mentioned that the fear of a third wave was looming and vaccination was the only solution. The civic chief urged people above 18 to get vaccinated. Dhole did not respond to calls. Anybody violating the order will be booked under IPC Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Section 51 (b) of Disaster Management Act (refuses to comply with any direction given by or on behalf of the Central Government or the State Government...) and Epidemic Act.

Officials said a detailed presentation on the IT interface and data-capturing was made before officials and representatives from private sector on Wednesday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the scheme. TOI has learnt that implementation of the scheme will also be monitored at three levels, including at the level of an apex panel headed by cabinet secretary. “One of the key focus areas will be monitoring of the progress and resolving issues as there is a strict timeline for the plan’s execution. Currently, the biggest challenge is to bridge the gap and complete the missing link between different infrastructure projects. The data and details fed by all agencies in the system will be crucial. There is also a focus to bring states on board,” said an official. As the multi-modal connectivity plan will focus on shifting from “disjointed planning” to “integrated planning” of centrally-sponsored infrastructure projects, officials don’t rule out the government also right-sizing plans to meet the requirement. Though the government hasn’t specified the size of the programme in financial terms, it will subsume the Rs 110 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline, which was launched by the PM in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gati-shakti-it-interface-to-store-infrastructure-projects-data/articleshow/87008967.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Roadways’ employee unions to hold strike on Oct 27||Jaipur: The state roadways employees will go on one-day strike on October 27 under an umberella platform claiming that dues of nearly 20,000 employees and pensioners have been getting delayed for over three years which has become a regular occurrence. Apart from this, on October 25 and 26, protests will be conducted across the state. Various associations of roadways employees along with pensioners had come together and agitated in planned phases from July onwards. M L Yadav, president, Rajasthan state roadways employees union, told TOI, "The roadways department gets a financial grant from the state government using which we are given our salaries which get delayed inevitably. Some sort of solution needs to be found because all of us are dependent on our salaries and pensions to run our households. We had been hoping that the government would pay heed to our demands but despite the peaceful protests, nothing has been done except for false promises. This is the reason that now we will go on strike on October 27. We have already informed the corporation officials regarding the same." He further added that delay of at least a fortnight in paying salaries has become a regular occurrence for past few years and the government needs to find a permanent solution as the department has no money of its own. There are around 14,000 employees and approximately 5,000 pensioners of the roadways department who are affected by the delayed dues. Almost two months back, the state transport minister had sent a proposal to the government to convert the Rajasthan roadways corporation into a department cause of the continuous losses sustained by it over the years. According to the proposal, the corporation should be converted to a department so that the salaries of the employees and pensions along with the benefits of the retired staff can be paid in a timely manner which are usually released after a delay of at least one month.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Inkel warned for MCH work delay||Thiruvananthapuram: The Infrastructure Kerala Limited (Inkel) which is the special purpose vehicle (SPV) for undertaking the Rs 717.29 crore development works at medical college hospital (MCH) here has been warned against the inordinate delay in completing the project. The government has asked it to complete the work at the earliest in a time-bound manner, health minister Veena George said in the assembly on Tuesday. Replying to a calling attention motion in this regard by Kadakampally Surendran who criticised the SPV for the delay, the minister said at this pace, the Rs 717 crore worth developmental works that have been envisaged in four phases will not end even during the present tenure of the LDF government. He said Ray Constructions, the construction company based in Mumbai, was supposed to complete the first phase of the project worth Rs 58.37 crore in August last year. While development of six roads, two over bridges and two multi-level car parking were supposed to be completed in the first phase, only four roads and two over bridges that too partially, have been completed till now. He said while Inkel is going at this slow pace, another construction being undertaken by Uralungal Labour Contract Service Society (ULCSS) that is undertaking works worth Rs 169 crore for the RCC in the medical college campus, has almost completed the work. “Some of the retired IAS officers have been maintaining Inkel for their personal gains like their salary and other perks. The government should consider removing Inkel as the SPV,” he said. The health minister, meanwhile, said the government will consider taking such extreme steps if they are not able to deliver even after the latest deadline offered to the company. The minister added the company has agreed to increase the pace of construction by increasing the number of labourers and the works are expected to be completed by March 2022. She further said the government has already initiated several other developmental steps in the first and the biggest medical college in the state. The new ICU that has been set up at the cost of Rs 34.64 crore, new 106 posts that have been sanctioned, a new super-speciality block, linear accelerators and CT stimulators for cancer treatment, etc are some of the new additions in the medical college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/inkel-warned-for-mch-work-delay/articleshow/86975293.cms||---

Education minister Govind Singh took to social media to announce that the schools will now remain closed from October 27 to November 7. The Directorate of Secondary Education had earlier notified that schools will remain closed for only three days from November 4 instead of mid-term holidays for 10-15 days. The decision was taken considering the fact that students had to face learning losses due to the covid-induced lockdowns. However, the government school teachers threatened to go on a state-wide protest on October 14 if the mid-term holidays were not declared. A group of government teachers staged a protest at chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s constituency on Wednesday demanding holidays. Narayan Singh Sisodia, president of Rajasthan Shikshak Evam Panchayati Raj Karamchari Sangh, said, "This is a welcoming step for teachers. We understand that students didn’t come to school but we have been fulfilling our duties every day. So, we deserve to have a break and celebrate festival with our family.” "We respect the decision of the state government to renotify the holidays," said Sisodia. An official at the education department, on condition of anonymity, said, "We agree that teachers came to school, but the learning loses that the students faced all these months cannot be compensated. The order was a good decision, but vote bank is more important."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/govt-schools-to-be-closed-from-oct-27-to-nov-7-for-diwali/articleshow/87015262.cms||---
---||Delhi||A palm-shaped idea emerging for Delhi-NCR||NEW DELHI: The shape of the National Capital Region (NCR) may become somewhat like a “palm” if the consensus among four member-states of the region gets formal approval for delineation of the area. It is being proposed that an area with a radius of 100km from Rajghat would become the main NCR while linear towns along the transport nodes such RRTS, Expressways and Highways falling under the current boundary would also come under the region. “It won’t be a circular area for sure. The aim is to leave the areas falling between the major transport nodes beyond the proposed 100 km radius for other activities such as farming. We have proposed to bring the towns along the transport corridors under the national capital region only to ensure that there is planning and regulated development. There has been over expansion of the NCR in recent years,” said a government official. Sources said while originally the plan for NCR was to cover an area with radius of around 100 km from the centre of Delhi when the first delineation proposal was made in early 1970s, by 2018 this radius increased to almost 130-140 km. A comparative analysis of the past and current Regional Plans shows that the NCR area increased by almost 61% between 2011 and 2018 as a substantial portion of Haryana was added to the region. Official documents show that at the beginning of 2021 Regional plan, the total area of Haryana in NCR was 13,413 sq km, but by 2018, this swelled to 25,327 sq km. On the other hand, the addition of areas in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh was less. There was no change in the NCT of Delhi as NCR covered the entire national capital. “The expansion of NCR was less prior to 2011. One of the main reasons why the participating states wanted more areas to be added was to get the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) connectivities and the other interest was to get loan from the NCRPB at low interest rate for infrastructure projects. Now it’s high time we plan for right-sizing the NCR and stop further expansion. The government must finalise the new delineation proposal quickly,” said a source. He added that there was also a perception that the property prices would increase once an area is notified under the NCR. An official from the urban affairs ministry said they will incorporate the proposal for fresh delineation in the Draft Regional Plan 2041 and after considering the suggestions and objections, it will take the decision. But some of the planners told TOI that the delineation has to be done through a separate gazette notification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-palm-shaped-idea-emerging-for-ncr/articleshow/87004432.cms||Dipak K Dash

The Shirol region of Kolhapur, which is considered the vegetable-producing bowl of western Maharashtra, was battered by heavy rainfall, damaging the crop. Prices of the flowers, especially marigold flowers, have doubled owing to Navaratra and Dasara festival. Rajesh More, a flower vendor at Shingoshi flower market, said, “The demand for flowers is high due to Navaratra and Dasara. The price of marigold flowers on Wednesday was Rs 100 a kilo and might double in a day. These flowers are in huge demand on the occasion of Dasara.” The case is the same in the vegetable markets in the city. Fatima Bagwan, vegetable vendor at Shahupuri vegetable market, said that the rates have increased due to the demand in Navratra. The good quality farm produce is arriving in less quantity as much was damaged in the heavy rain and flood that happened last month in Shirol region. She said that tomatoes were selling at Rs 100 a kg, brinjal at Rs 120 a kg, capsicum at Rs 80, ladies finger Rs 80, cluster bean Rs 80, potato Rs 60, Onion Rs 60, Fenugreek Rs 50 and drumsticks at Rs 10 per piece in the retail market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vegetable-flower-prices-skyrocket-in-kolhapur/articleshow/86999984.cms||---

The deceased have been identified as Bhushan Badan and Sharad Mahajan — both residents of Nashik city — and Rajesh Tiwari of Ambernath, Kalyan. Senior officials of the Wavi police station said they are in the process of registering an offence against the truck driver for allegedly parking the vehicle without putting on any parking lights. The deceased had been to Pune on Tuesday by car to attend a meeting of their company. After attending the meeting, they were returning to Nashik on Tuesday night. When they reached the Nandur-Shingote area on the Nashik-Pune highway around 12.30 am, their car rammed into a truck parked along the road. Senior officials of the Wavi police station, who rushed to the accident spot, said that the accident was so severe that the car was stuck beneath the truck. The police had to arrange for two cranes to first lift the truck and then pull the car out. The entire operation took over one-and-a-half hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/car-rams-into-parked-truck-on-nashik-pune-highway-3-killed/articleshow/86999981.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||SilverLine a game changer, says CM||Thiruvananthapuram: Government and opposition locked horns over the Rs 63,941-crore semi high-speed rail project in the assembly on Wednesday. The latter quoted the number of possible ridership feasibility and the construction cost from government reports to cite that the project was unviable and would only lead to a major ecological catastrophe. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who countered opposition charges, said that the project will be a game changer in Kerala. “The project was envisaged in such a way that places of worship, paddy field and biodiversity in the 11 districts through which it passes are least affected. Only 9,314 buildings will be affected by the project,” he said. Vijayan said that the project was aligned in such a way that it passes through the least densely-populated areas and the claims that it would destroy the economic conditions of the state were baseless. “There are no governments in the world that do not avail loans for infrastructure development. The reduction of travelling time to one-fourth will boost business, technical and tourism sectors of state,” he said. While on the Kasaragod-Tirur stretch, the line passes parallel to the existing rail track, from Tirur to Thiruvananthapuram, the alignment was designed to avoid paddy land and wetlands. Of the 115km of paddy land through which the line passes, 88km is an elevated stretch, he said. At the same time, the opposition focussed on the adverse impact the project would have on the fragile ecology of the state. “Kerala is already reeling under a series of natural disasters. The project – 55% for which embankments of 15-30m width and 4-10 m height have to be constructed –will divide the state into two. The government’s project report states that it may lead to soil piping, landslides. There will also be change in the land use pattern for 500m on either side of the project line,” Satheesan said. He added that not only these adversities, but huge quantities of rock and earth the project would require will lead to destruction of Western Ghats to a large extent. Satheesan added that the project report also said that there are 164 hydrologically-sensitive areas on the project route. On one hand, the CM talks about initiatives like room for rivers when floods hit the state and such projects will lead to barricading the natural course of water, he said. Seeking a leave for adjournment motion on the matter, IUML leader MK Muneer said that such unviable projects aren’t required. He added that projects like suburban rail that are cost-effective and viable will suit Kerala. “We are not against development projects. But we need to discuss alternatives,” he said, adding that painting anyone who is fighting for their survival as extremists, Maoists or agents of right-wing forces is not the right method of dealing with issues. Opposition later staged a walkout after speaker MB Rajesh refused to admit the adjournment motion on the basis of the explanation given by the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/silverline-a-game-changer-says-cm/articleshow/87004501.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Jewellers, garment shops, electric appliances and automobile stores have registered a 20-25% rise in sales in the festive days of Navaratra so far as compared to corresponding festive period last year. “All the sectors are witnessing good business and there has been around 20-25% rise in business in festive days of Navaratra as compared to the Navaratra last year,” said Santosh Mandlecha, president, Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture. He added that they were expecting the positive sentiment in the markets to continue up to the Diwali festival. Ravi Parakh, owner of electric appliances, said that the response for various electric and electronic appliances like smart TVs, LED TVs, refrigerators, laptops is good due to festive days. Chetan Rajapurkar, senior office-bearer of Nashik Jewellers Association, said that there has been good demand for gold ornaments and silver-made idols of goddesses. The prices of gold have declined from Rs 56,200 per 10 gm last year to Rs 47,500 per 10 gm. “Hence, people have started wedding purchases of gold ornaments considering that the prices of gold may increase in future. Moreover, some people are booking jewellery and will take deliveries on the auspicious occasion of Dasara on Friday,” said Rajapurkar. Apart from gold, there has been a boom in the automobile market, particularly the passenger car segment. A staffer at an automobile showroom said that they have delivered around 75 vehicles in Navaratra. Prafulla Sancheti, president of Nashik grocery traders association, said Navaratra and Diwali have importance among people and it has resulted in increase in sales.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/festive-season-manages-to-light-up-nashik-city-markets/articleshow/87000097.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Yashpal Arya’s return to Congress likely to benefit party in SC seats||DEHRADUN: The return of Yashpal Arya, a prominent Dalit leader with a strong voter base in Kumaon and Garhwal, is being seen as a major gain for the Congress as it had performed miserably in the 13 reserved seats in the 2017 Uttarakhand assembly elections. Out of 13 SC seats, the party could win only two. Arya's exit from the Congress was seen as one of the major reasons for the party's dismal performance in reserved seats. His return now is likely to swing the balance back in the Congress’s favour in the SC seats, feel experts. Of the 13 SC seats, eight are in Garhwal and five in Kumaon region. In 2017, BJP had won 10 reserve assembly seats of Tharali, Ghansali, Rajpur Road, Jwalapur, Jhabreda, Gangolighat, Bageshwar, Someshwar, Nainital and Bazpur. According to the 2011 census, the state's population comprises 92.97% Hindus, followed by 13.95% Muslims, 2.34% Sikhs and 0.37% Christians. An estimated caste break-up reflects that there are around 40% Thakurs, 20-25% Brahmins, 19% SC, 5% OBC and 3% ST. Commenting about the impact of Arya’s return on the SC seats in the state, political analyst Jai Singh Rawat told TOI, “Arya is among the most influential Dalit leaders in Uttarakhand. He has won in all four assembly polls held in the state. Unlike most other politicians, he holds sway in both Kumaon and Garhwal.” Rawat added that 13 seats were a big number in the 70-member state assembly. “Some of the battles on these seats were closely fought. In the Tharali bypoll, the BJP candidate had won by around 2,000 votes. In such a scenario, Arya's presence will certainly have a strong impact,” he added. Arya had won the Bazpur constituency in 2017 and his son Sanjiv won from Nainital. A source said that Congress may consider repeating Sunita Bajwa as its candidate from Bazpur and Arya may shift to another constituency like Someshwar, which is likely to pose a major challenge for the BJP since minister of state Rekha Arya is currently representing the seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/aryas-return-to-cong-likely-to-benefit-party-in-sc-seats/articleshow/87000081.cms||Kautilya Singh

The district administrations have also been asked to submit an action report taken in their jurisdictions at the earliest. During a review meeting held in Mumbai on Tuesday, Bhujbal also sought undertaking a special campaign to carry out a crackdown against biodiesel outlets operating sans official permission. TOI, on Tuesday, had carried a report on rampant illegal sale of biodiesel amid rising diesel prices that have already breached Rs 100-mark. “The illegal sale of fuel, including biodiesel, has been affecting the revenue generation of the state government as well as the Centre to a major extent. The matter also needs to be brought to the attention of the Centre. There is need for expediting action against unauthorised sale of biodiesel,” an official release quoting Bhujbal has said. “An official permission is required for selling biodiesel through outlets on the line of diesel and petrol. It has been observed that outlets are coming up without following such due procedure. Many such unauthorised outlets are not following blending norms of fuel,” it added. The aforesaid review meeting discussed the Biodiesel (manufacturing, storage, supply, selling) Policy, 2021, of the state government that grants permission exclusively for sale of top B-100 type of biodiesel and not for any other mixture. As per the policy, biodiesel retailers should retain samples of at least last three supplies received by them from their suppliers for inspection and testing by competent authorities. Deputy divisional commissioner of food and civil supplies Waman Kadam, who attended Tuesday’s review meeting, could not be reached for his comments despite repeated attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bhujbal-orders-squads-to-keep-check-on-illegal-sale-of-biodiesel/articleshow/87000034.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Coimbatore||Health minister inaugurates projects in private hospitals||Coimbatore: Health minister Ma Subramanian on Wednesday inaugurated ‘Little Hearts Project’, an initiative of KG Hospital to identify children with heart ailments by conducting free screening in schools.Majority of children who suffer from heart diseases have a congenital heart defect, a problem with the structure of the heart. Congenital heart defects include holes in the walls of the heart, narrow valves, valve leaks and sometimes a combination of multiple defects. Early cardiac screening will help diagnose the disease before symptoms arise.“School screening programmes were conducted by KG Hospital, where children with heart diseases were detected and brought to the hospital from government or private hospitals for free surgical correction under the government’s insurance scheme,” said Dr G Bakthvathsalam, chairman of KG Hospital.Unhygienic conditions at home and lack of awareness among parents and teachers contribute to majority of paediatric heart illnesses, experts say. From the age of four years to 19, heart diseases occur because of congenital reasons or rheumatic heart diseases. Many children do not participate in sports activities requiring exertion. They may be weak physically and not able to cope up with other children in aerobic exercises.The minister also inaugurated life-saving medical equipment such as patient monitors, syringe pumps, ventilators and non-invasive ventilators at Sri Ramakrishna Hospital. The equipment were sponsored by Robert Bosch Engineering Solutions and procured by Aram Foundation Charitable Trust, a city-based NGO, to enhance the Covid-19 ICU unit in the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/health-minister-inaugurates-projects-in-private-hospitals/articleshow/87004496.cms||---

The proposal in this connection will be tabled at the meeting of the Tree Authority committee of the municipal corporation soon. The NMC has also conducted the spot survey and ownership of these trees is with the civic body. NMC has proposed felling of these trees, which are causing hurdles in the development and widening of some major roads in the city. The officials said the 28 trees belong to the species of peepal, banyan and cluster fig (Umbar) and neem. “These 28 trees are located at the left side of the road between Trimurti Chowk and Mauli Lawns. We have plans to widen this road and these trees are causing hurdles for road expansion works. Hence, we have proposed transplantation of these 28 trees elsewhere,” said NMC officials. Environmentalists have expressed their disappointment about the civic body’s proposal of chopping 161 trees. Rajesh Pandit, an environmentalist, said the NMC needs to focus on keeping trees instead of chopping them. The Bombay high court has already banned the cutting of trees belonging to the species of peepal, banyan and cluster fig (Umbar). There are options like changing road alignment, adjusting as a divider or road may be diverted along with the trees, said Pandit. “If there is no alternative to the chopping of odd trees on the roads considering the threat to human life, then they should be transplanted. But NMC’s focus should be to save all the trees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-proposes-felling-of-161-trees-in-city/articleshow/87000106.cms||Tushar Pawar

Responding to a question on vaccination for children, the minister said that an expert committee has given its nod but an official confirmation is yet to come from the Centre. Recalling how Tamil Nadu started vaccinating pregnant women on the next day of central government giving its nod for the same, the minister said Tamil Nadu woulld vaccinate children in the similalr manner. He appreciated the Coimbatore district administration for topping among the districts in vaccinating maximum number of eligible population with first and second doses. So far, 93% of eligible population over the age of 18 years is covered with the first dose of Covid vaccine in the district. This includes 6% vaccination in private facilities. This is highest in the state compared to any other district. Further, the district is also ahead of state average in terms of inoculating people with the second dose. Around 37% of population is covered with the second dose in the district when the state average is 24% only.

Of the 65,000 individual participants, he cleared three rounds to receive the third prize.As many as 284 deaths were reported due to aircraft accidents in India in 2019, Pravin said. “After analysing the reasons for fire accidents and aircraft accidents, it was found that enhancing fire retardant of composite can reduce the severity of accidents,” he said.Commercially available composites contain petroleum-based products that catch fire when exposed to high temperature. He used nanoparticles obtained from natural resources as a flame-retardant. It was also approved by jury members of the DRDO contest for proposal submission under technology development funding (TDF) scheme for a funding of up to Rs 10 crore.Pravin was guided by R Ravi kumar, M Kirupa Sankar and A Vimalarasan, faculty in-charges of the bioprocess and bioproducts special lab. “For flame-retardant property, he used nanoparticles obtained from natural resources and incorporated those flame-retardant nanoparticles onto natural fibre composite, thus making the whole product biocompatible and biodegradable. Since this is a novel idea, it is eligible for patent also,” said Ravi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/engineering-students-life-saving-invention-bags-drdos-innovation-contest-award/articleshow/87004510.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Fund fraud: Police probe revolves around cashier||Thiruvananthapuram: Nemom police probing the tax fraud in zonal office is going ahead with the investigation pinning the case mainly on cashier Sunitha. The hearing of her bail plea has been postponed to October 20. The bail plea of Santhi, the charge officer who was suspended along with Sunitha, was reportedly rejected on Tuesday. Police officials hinted that they have completed the first phase of the probe and they need to arrest Sunitha to make further headway in the investigation. The police have collected all relevant documents, including bank statements of the staff reportedly involved in handling of cash at the zonal office in the past one year. Besides, the statements of auditors were also recorded. The police officials hinted that Sunitha who is currently in hiding is being traced and will be taken into custody for further questioning. “From the investigation so far, we are focusing our probe mainly around the cashier who was primarily in charge of all cash transactions in the main office. The manner in which forged receipts were found in the register is suspicious and hints at fraud,” police sources said. As regarding Santhi, the police believe that it was more of supervisory lapse and she had no direct role in the fraud. Sunitha has earlier given a complaint to the corporation secretary listing down names of all the staff who had carried money from the zonal office to the bank in the past one year. It is also learnt that, of around seven staff, two staff had mainly carried the money in 2020; the year in which a major chunk of money went missing from the corporation account. The police, however, are focusing solely on Sunitha and it is learnt that cops will turn to other staff only after her arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fund-fraud-police-probe-revolves-around-cashier/articleshow/86975334.cms||---

They would conduct fever surveillance camps and take preventive measures, in addition to creating awareness among the residents.Since the Covid-19 cases have come down significantly, the official said, the health department could divert staff for dengue eradication work. “People have been asked to keep their premises and surrounding areas clean to prevent them from becoming breeding ground for aedes mosquitoes. Action will be initiated against people if they were found to be responsible for the breeding of dengue mosquitoes.”CMCH dean A Nirmala said they had seen four to five dengue cases in the past one week. “We have kept the wards ready by taking the possibility of a spike in dengue cases in the coming days into account.” She said they were keeping the premises clean and dry, as part of anti-dengue measures.Senior health officials said the dengue cases had surfaced in the district as early as January, when close to 100 cases were reported in a month.

Transport commissioner Mahendra Soni elaborating on the initiative said, "we are running the campaign specifically for children’s vehicles at present with the aim to reduce road accidents in the state, reducing irreparable loss of public and money due to accidents, creating awareness about traffic rules among the general public and violations which cause road accidents. In view of road safety, a campaign will be run by the department for effective control over unauthorized/unlawful operation of these vehicles." While transport department was the nodal agency for road safety, this is the first campaign being run after the name was revised to transport and road safety department. Adding further, Soni said, "it is very important to stop the use of illegal Bal Vahini for safe transportation of students. That is why this campaign will be run by the department with a view to provide safe, convenient and accessible vehicle system to the students of educational institutions.

---||Mangaluru||Midday meal resumption could bring back more students to campus||Mangaluru: The state government’s decision to resume mid-day meals in schools from next week is expected to bring back children who have reportedly stayed away from the offline classes. This will also reduce the burden on students as well parents who now have to pack their tiffin to school. The midday meal programme was stopped in March 2020 after the pandemic hit the country. Instead, each child studying in government and aided schools were supplied with rice, wheat, tur dal, oil and salt. Though schools were opened during the previous academic year, there was no midday meal served to students. “Offering midday meal in schools is crucial especially for those students below poverty line. There are students who arrive at the school as early as 7am when their parents leave for work. The food that they pack is often the previous day’s leftovers. At times, it turns stale, cold and cannot be consumed during lunch break. Whereas, as part of the midday meal programme fresh and hot food is served. Along with an increase in attendance, it will also help students to concentrate well on academics,” said Shambhu Shankar, coordinator, Block Resource Centre, Belthangady taluk. An official said that the parents have been requesting the authorities to resume mid-day meals in schools. There are few students who attend classes staying hungry the entire day. “For some school children from poor backgrounds, the midday meals are the only nutritious and healthy meal of the day. It is good that the government is resuming it,” the official said. The midday meal will also bring back migrant students who have remained in their hometowns. Overall, the district has 90% of attendance. This year, the midday meal beneficiaries are likely to increase from the existing 1.47 lakh children to 1.50 lakh children in Dakshina Kannada. Usha M, executive officer, Akshara Dasoha, Dakshina Kannada told TOI that they have been supplying dry ration to eligible students in the absence of midday meal since March 2020. Midday meal workers were roped in to supply them to children. “This year there is an increase in beneficiaries and DK is prepared to start midday meals anytime. The district has about 3,213 midday meal workers,” said Usha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/midday-meal-resumption-could-bring-back-more-students-to-campus/articleshow/87003266.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Mumbai||In govt promotions, cabinet decides to support VJNT quota||MUMBAI: The state cabinet on Wednesday decided to file an additional affidavit in the Supreme Court seeking to maintain reservations in promotions in government jobs. While the Constitution allows for the quota for the SC and SC community, the cabinet has sought to retain the reservation for the VJNT (nomadic tribes) and special backward class community as well, on the grounds that these communities are under-represented in government jobs. The cabinet considered a report by a committee led by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on the representation of backward communities in government jobs and promotions. The report concluded that the VJNT and special backward class category did not have adequate representation in promotions in government jobs and that a quota was required. The MVA government has been dealing with the quota in promotions conundrum since May after it decided to scrap the reservation, in response to the Maratha quota in jobs and education being set aside by the SC. A subsequent attempt to restore the quota in promotions was blocked by the HC saying this issue had to be resolved in court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-govt-promotions-cabinet-decides-to-support-vjnt-quota/articleshow/87007609.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

The service was stopped last year due to the pandemic. The service was resumed in March this year as a special train with thrice the fare existed pre-Covid. The train has been making only one trip a day with stoppages reduced to four from six.“The train has been skipping Periyanaickenpalayam and Thudiyalur railway stations causing inconvenience to the people. But the railways refused to stop the train in these stations despite significant relaxation of Covid norms,” general secretary of TPDK K Ramakrishnan said.The ongoing flyover work on Mettupalayam Road has been causing inconvenience to people to reach Coimbatore from Thudiyalur and Periyanaickenpalayam. While the train was offering a convenient option, the railway chose to skip the stoppages citing administrative issues. Now that the Covid norms have been relaxed and train services are being resumed, the stoppages need to be increased for Memu, he said.Asked as to what prevents the railway from stopping in these two stations, a senior official from southern railway said that there are no station masters in these stations. As the ticket counters in Periyanaickenpalayam and Thudiyalur were operated by private players, fresh tenders need to be issued to operate the ticket counters. “It may not be feasible for the private players to run the ticket counter with reduced fares,” the railway official said.The protesters also demanded season tickets for school and college students, which were issued pre-Covid. While schools and colleges have reopened, the railway must come forward to issue season tickets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/reduce-memu-train-fares-says-tpdk/articleshow/87004589.cms||---

He said reusing cooking oil was a hazardous practice, as that could cause an array of health problems.The attempt is being made under the Repurpose Used Cooking Oil (Ruco) scheme, which aims at wiping out used oil from the system, by collecting the same from bulk users such as hotels and snacks units.District food safety officer Dr K Tamilselvan said they had already completed the application process to set the new record. “We have identified 315 bulk oil users in the district. We had collected 32.13 tonnes of used cooking oil after the launch of Ruco scheme in the district. The oil is being sent to designated places to be recycled into biodiesel.”The minister, meanwhile, urged hoteliers and residents to cut down on the use of sugar, salt and oil to stay healthy. He dedicated a vehicle to collect excess food and distribute the same to the needy. He said people could contact 9087790877 to share the excess food.The event also featured a hand washing sensitization programme to teach school students how to wash their hands properly and create awareness among them on its importance.Ma Subramanian also flagged off five vehicles to vaccinate people at their doorsteps. Arranged by the city corporation in association with Namma Kovai, a collective of citizens, its five zones will get a vehicle each for the vaccination drive.The health minister used the occasion to appreciate both the residents and the administration for the district’s performance in vaccination front. He said the government’s mega vaccination camps had helped speed up the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/drive-on-to-collect-used-cooking-oil-to-set-world-record/articleshow/87004641.cms||---

Replying to a calling attention motion by Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan requesting the government to bring these under the ambit of GST, the minister said that though under the GST only 28% maximum tax can be slapped on these products, the state will receive only 14% of the tax income. “The real concern is the special cess that is slapped by the Centre which is the major portion of the revenue, and it goes to the Centre alone,” he said. Whenever the price of international crude reduces, the Centre slaps additional cess and because of this, the benefits of price reduction of the crude does not reach the public. Also, the income from these additional cesses are not shared with the states. For these reasons, the only way to reduce the prices of petrol and diesel is to do away with the additional cess slapped by the Centre, he said. He said that when the matter was discussed in the GST council, most of the states including those ruled by Congress opposed the idea of bringing them under the ambit of GST, he said. He said that while a major portion of the tax levied on petroleum products are taken away by the Centre, the revenue is not being shared correspondingly with the states. The minister said that when the LDF government came to power in 2016, the sales tax of petrol and diesel were 31.80% and 24.50%, respectively. But the government reduced those to 30.08% and 22.76%, respectively. Thereafter, the rates have not been changed, he said. The minister added that the real reason is that the price-fixing power of petrol and diesel have been handed over to the markets and now, the rates are spiralling even beyond the actual market conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/high-fuel-prices-due-to-centres-special-cess-fm/articleshow/87004675.cms||---

Sit-in protests held in front of the Trivandrum airport, a day prior to handing over the operations to the Adani Group, is a typical example. It can only be seen as an extension of attempts to derail the development of the airport. Such steps will only drive away investors from the city and the state,’’ said S N Raghuchandran Nair, president of the Trivandrum Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Lulu Mall, Adani Vizhinjam Port, Adani Airport, and Taurus Downtown Projects etc… recently faced litigation on frivolous grounds. “Petitioners were fighting battles for those who control them from behind the curtains. Their target is to obstruct the projects, or slow them using legal tangles. There have been attempts to torpedo the Outer Area Growth Corridor (OAGC) project too right at the beginning,” said secretary, Abraham Thomas. “We must understand that major projects have the potential to create thousands of new jobs for the youth and facilitate local wealth creation, thus transforming the capital city region into an economic powerhouse. “TCCI calls upon the citizenry of Thiruvananthapuram to be alert, and guard against unscrupulous elements who work against the capital city region,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bids-to-derail-devpt-works-slammed/articleshow/86975413.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Take steps to contain dengue spread, says minister Ma Subramanian||COIMBATORE: Stating 342 dengue cases were reported across the state in the past two weeks alone, health minister Ma Subramanian on Wednesday asked the district administration and local bodies to take adequate measures to contain its spread. He said they had screened 86,000 people for the deadly fever during the period and 342 of them were found to be positive for dengue. The minister said only 26,000 people were screened for dengue in the comparable period last year. “This year, we have conducted 60,000 more tests and it helped us identify many cases.” The minister was speaking after inaugurating a special new-born care unit at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital. Built at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore, the 80-bed facility will help pre-term born babies, those weighing less than 1.5kg and babies born with heart related anomalies or congenital diseases. While the hospital has a neo-natal care unit, this additional facility will take care of the new-borns that require special care. Subramanian said they hadn’t downed the guard against Covid-19 after the considerable dip in the daily caseload and at least 1.5 lakh people were being screened daily for the infection through RT-PCR tests. He said at least 11,000 RT-PCR tests were conducted daily in Coimbatore alone. “We haven’t compromised on the testing and it is maintained at the same levels of May this year.” When asked about the alleged malpractices by private Covid testing laboratories, Subramanian said they were doing random quality checks at the laboratories and taking action against the errant ones. The minister said the mass vaccination drive wouldn’t be held on Sunday (Oct 17) because of the Puja holidays. Referring to the pending approval for 800 medical seats in the newly-started medical colleges, the minister said a team of national medical commission was expected to revisit the infrastructure of four new medical colleges soon. “While the team had pointed out a few anomalies in the infrastructure during their previous visit, a team led by the director of medical education had visited New Delhi for a discussion. The required changes have been made and approval is expected during the team’s revisit,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/take-steps-to-contain-dengue-spread-min/articleshow/87004627.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||KPCC list nearly ready as leaders reach consensus||Thiruvananthapuram: The new office-bearers of KPCC are expected to be announced by the party high command soon as an agreement was reached between the leaders in state on the choice of new leaders. The final list of new office-bearers was submitted to the high command by KPCC president K Sudhakaran. The list was submitted after having a marathon discussion with Ramesh Chennithala and Oommen Chandy by the KPCC leadership. The talks had led to a deadlock over giving relaxation to a few leaders from the policy adopted by the political affairs committee for selecting new leaders. It is learnt that the senior leaders and present leadership have reached a consensus for not diluting the policy adopted by the political affairs committee. This will mean that no relaxation will be given to any leader. The political affairs committee had decided that a leader, who occupied different positions in the party, will not be reconsidered. This includes district Congress committee presidents who had to relinquish their positions in a short time after occupying the seat. But there were demands to include certain women by giving some relaxations. The groups and senior leaders opposed this move. It is learnt that the new list consists of leaders who will be occupying different positions for the first time. This will include vice-presidents, general secretaries and executive committee members. Altogether, a 51-member committee is expected. There are speculations that Chennithala’s nominee VS Sivakumar and Chandy’s nominee K Sivadasan Nair will be accommodated as vice-presidents. This time the KPCC leadership is learnt to have given due recognition to the demands of group leaders. Chennithala said all leaders will accept the decision of the party high command. “We haven’t put the KPCC leadership under any kind of pressure. All such reports are baseless. This time the leadership held several discussions, unlike during the selection of new DCC presidents,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kpcc-list-nearly-ready-as-leaders-reach-consensus/articleshow/87004760.cms||---

---||Jaipur||In a first, Jaipur Development Authority mulls green area in Lohamandi commercial scheme||JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) is planning to accommodate a green space at the Lohamandi scheme, which will be the first of its kind for a commercial scheme in the city. According to the proposal, 1.40 lakh sq metre will be earmarked for parks in the scheme. The scheme with an area of 13.50 lakh sq metre, will have six parks. An official at the civic body said, "We have proposed to develop two parks with an area of 49,000 and 44,000 sq metre each. Four small parks will also be developed in the scheme." The civic body plans to earn a revenue of Rs 500 crore after developing the scheme, out of which Rs 20 crore will be spent to develop green spaces. The JDA will construct a green walkway on the adjoining forest land. The length of the walkway will be around 1,150 meters. After receiving directions from the Urban Development and Housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal at the empowered committee meet, the re-planning was initiated. "The move is aimed at reducing pollution and develop green spaces in the city," the official said. Sources said the city had less than 10% of its area under green cover, which is way less than the mandatory 20% required as per the Master Plan 2025. Earlier, the JDA had planned to develop woodland parks and plant trees, but the results were far from satisfactory. The civic body and forest officials said increasing green cover in the city was a herculean task and needed sustained efforts and enough resources. As per the master plan, the entry roads from Delhi, Ajmer, Sikar and Agra are supposed to have green corridor of 30 to 45 metre on either sides of the approaches. However, the project could not be completed due to unavailability of land. "To increase the green cover, JDA has to earmark spaces in its new colonies. The is the only way to save planted trees," the civic body official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/in-a-1st-jda-mulls-green-area-in-biz-scheme/articleshow/87007016.cms||---
---||Delhi||WHO nod boosts voices for a third Covid shot in India||NEW DELHI: World Health Organization has recommended that all immune-compromised patients should get a third dose or booster shot of a vaccine against Covid-19. According to Subject Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) of the UN health body, moderately and severely immunocompromised people should be offered an additional dose since they are less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccine series and are at high risk of contracting severe Covid-19. “When implementing this recommendation, countries should initially aim at maximising two-dose coverage in that population, and thereafter, administer the third dose, starting in oldest age groups,” SAGE said. In India, booster shots have not been approved yet. However, the clamour for this step is growing. “We are doing great at vaccinating our adult population against Covid-19. Now, with approval granted to the vaccine against Covid-19 developed by Bharat Biotech for those aged 2-18 years, children may also get protection. However, we must not ignore the need for a booster or third additional dose in the elderly and the immune-compromised,” Dr N K Mehra, emeritus scientist at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said. “The functional ability of the body to mount a quick immune response goes down when people grow older. Same is the case with immune-compromised patients, for example a cancer patient or someone who has undergone organ transplant recently. Such people need a booster dose six to seven months after the second dose to prevent serious illness if they get Covid-19,” Dr Mehra said. A booster dose is essentially an additional dose of the vaccine you have already received. Vaccine manufacturers claim a booster dose may be needed for two reasons: first, to provide prolonged immunity, and second, to fight off the mutant variants. Countries like France, Germany and Israel, where a significant population have received two doses, have allowed a third dose. The US and the UK have also approved it. India started immunisation against Covid-19 this January and healthcare workers were the first to get it, followed by people above 60 years and those above 45 years who had qualifying comorbidities. In April, the facility was extended to everyone above 45 years and, finally, to those above 18 years from May. Dr Jamal Yusuf, professor of cardiology at GB Pant Hospital, said many people had completed six to seven months since full vaccination. “We must think about allowing a booster dose at some point.” Dr Dinesh Gora, senior resident of trauma surgery and critical care at AIIMS, said that with time, the circulating antibody levels decrease and only T-memory cells last. “So booster dosing will definitely reduce positivity and complications rates,” he clarified. Dr S K Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, recently told TOI that it would be prudent to start multiple trials at least to assess whether a booster dose could help increase the antibody levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/who-nod-boosts-voices-for-a-third-covid-shot-in-india/articleshow/87004713.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Citizens of Nashik district who have applied for various services like land records or income certificates and others from the local talathi office will have to wait till the agitation is called off. The services across 651 revenue offices, talathi and circle offices, have been disrupted after talathis stopped the online process as part of their agitation. This will have an effect on more than 25,000 applications that are presented on daily basis. NY Ugle, the district unit president of Talathi Sangh, Nashik, said the officers have been demanding justice and for the same they had started the agitation on October 7, starting with sporting a black ribbon. “Since our demand related to the transfer of the officer was not met, as planned we have surrendered the DSC.

---||Delhi||Allegation of ‘police action’ against students to be probed||New Delhi: Senior Delhi Police officers on Wednesday said an independent inquiry would be conducted against police personnel accused of assaulting two students of All India Students’ Association (AISA) outside Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence during a protest. The alleged incident took place on October 10 when activists of AISA and several other organisations marched to Shah’s residence protesting against the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. During the protest, when the agitators crossed the barricades, police personnel tried to contain them. Subsequently, two students alleged that their clothes were pulled up and police personnel assaulted them. While no FIR has been registered yet, the students have given a complaint to police commissioner Rakesh Asthana requesting him to look into the matter. Though senior officers refuted the claims, an inquiry was initiated into the matter on Wednesday. Jaspal Singh, joint commissioner of police (New Delhi), said, “An independent inquiry will be conducted by police into the allegations of assault. We are yet to receive details about the investigating team. However, legal action will soon be taken.” On Wednesday afternoon, students staged a protest outside Delhi Police headquarters demanding that the assistant commissioner of police (Chanakyapuri) be sacked because she allegedly ordered her subordinates to assault the students. They also alleged that it was a preplanned attack. Kavita Krishnan, AIPWA secretary, also joined the students and said the activists and several other students posted about the assault on Twitter, but police didn’t take any action. “Delhi Police assaulted the students and threatened them. The students wanted to lodge a complaint, but were scared. However, they did post about the incident on social media. Why didn’t police take action then? We have now drafted a memorandum explaining everything that happened outside the home minister’s residence. Women can’t be assaulted for protesting,” said Krishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/allegation-of-police-action-against-students-to-be-probed/articleshow/87004734.cms||---

Police claimed that accused Prithviraj Meena and Ravi Pagdi had taken money from students on the pretext of providing question papers. Meanwhile, police on Wednesday arrested another accused identified as Amit Kumar Meena (32) from Sawai Madhopur district. Rajasthan police said they have arrested 20 persons so far for their alleged involvement in the REET cheating case, which was unearthed on September 26 in Sawai Madhopur, leading to a series of arrests across multiple cities. Sleuths claimed they had got the whiff of the cheating racket well before the exam and arrested several suspects on the day the examination was held. Police learnt that the question papers had reached some suspects before the exam. They first believed Batti Lal Meena, the primary accused, had shared the papers. He was detained on Sunday in Uttarakhand. He admitted that he received the question paper from another accused, identified later as Prithviraj Meena. Based on Batti Lal’s information, police on Monday nabbed Prithviraj. He was posted as a junior engineer and had allegedly shared the paper with Batti Lal Meena for a hefty amount. "Batti Lal Meena’s role now appears to be confined strictly to receiving the paper from Prithviraj Meena and subsequently sharing it with others," said an official. Rajasthan police shifted their focus on Prithviraj Meena and his network that first got paper and later distributed it to others. Police suspect that someone from western-Rajasthan had sent the question paper Prithviraj Meena. Sources said Prithviraj shared some crucial leads about how he got the paper before the exam. Rajasthan police said they have constituted special teams to track down other suspects involved in the case. "It is important to unravel the complete nexus that got the papers and shared it with others," the official said. Police are still flummoxed about how someone got the paper beforehand despite heavy security ‘bandobast’, including a clampdown on mobile internet services. Besides the nexus of cheaters, police have not ruled out the possibility of some ‘mole’, that acted at the behest of suspects. "All participants of this cheating racket will be held. We will soon discover the way in which the accused got hold of the paper," the official added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/reet-paper-leak-1-more-accused-in-police-net-rs-rs-12-lakh-recovered/articleshow/87007068.cms||---

The committee was also annoyed with officials concerned for coming unprepared and submitting half-hearted information.Earlier, in the budget session of the Assembly in March, the issue of plantations had rocked the House. The forest department had received Rs2,429.78 crore between 2016-17 and 2019-20 for a special drive to plant 50 crore saplings in the state.On Tuesday, Sheikh Munna Sheikh, president, Sarpamitra Nisarga Sanwardhan Bahuuddeshia Sanstha, Akola, and another environment activist Dayanand Gaikwad submitted evidence of shoddy plantations under the ‘Greening Maharashtra’ drive under the 50 crore drive taken up by the earlier BJP government.The complainants said, in the last four years, over 50 lakh saplings were planted under the greening drive in Akola district, but now over 60% have failed to survive. Submitting documented evidence of plantations taken up from 2016-17 to 2019-2020, Munna told MLA Manohar Chandrikapure, chairman of the legislative committee, an amount of Rs24.58 lakh was withdrawn in the name of plantations between Vastapur-Zodga in Barshitakli taluka but Akola deputy conservator letter of February 7, 2020, states that plantation was not done in the said areas. “In Patur taluka’s Saywali village, social forestry spent crores in 2018 for developing a hi-tech nursery and a garden and planted 25,000 mango saplings. Today, the area is barren land. At many places, the money was misappropriated by showing bogus beneficiaries,” said Munna.He said, “In Popatkhed nursery, the saplings developed in polythene were dumped under the soil and were not planted. During lockdown, the SFD released payment for bills towards 100 laborers, watering of saplings, etc. If no works were done during Covid, how were bills approved? I have submitted relevant proof to the committee.” Citing another plantation irregularity on 250-hectare land belonging to PDKV in Akola, Munna said the SFD planted 10 lakh saplings between July 1 and September 21, 2019. However, in March 2020 during the site visit, no plantations were seen.“A video and pictures from the site have been submitted to the committee. The department used water from PDKV ponds but charged money for watering. Similar irregularities were reported from PDKV land in Borgaon,” he added.Gaikwad said, “In Mahan nursery in Barshitakli taluka, the SFD was also involved in power theft to water saplings from a gram panchayat well and charged money for watering saplings.”The legislative committee chairman, Manohar Chandrikapure, was not available for comments. One of the members Vikramsinh Sawant, who is MLA from Jath in Sangli district, confirmed the NGOs represented the committee on various irregularities in 50 crore plantations.“During our visit to the district places, we found that more than 60% plantations have died. At one spot in Aghekhed, officials hurriedly planted 400 big saplings ahead of the committee visit but the saplings were so loosely planted that these were uprooted after holding them,” MLA Sawant told TOI.Sawant said, “This is our second visit and we will again visit Akola after two months. We have sought a report from department heads as to what action has been taken in various irregularities.”“Poor plantations are not something new to the department whose own evaluation wing has time and again reported consecutive failures of plantations sites in the state. But no action has been taken against those responsible for the mess,” said Gaikwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-panel-expresses-concern-over-poor-50-crore-plantations/articleshow/87000292.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The shelf life is around six months and now the stock is over five months old from the date of manufacturing.As on Wednesday morning, just 150 jabs were given at the 20 private hospitals in city limits. The individual numbers ranging between 24 and 1 jab indicate doses are getting wasted in some amount at all private hospitals. The desperation is clear with hospital trying to salvage their losses by obliging to a single beneficiary as well. This is already leading to wastage as a vial having 10 doses has to be consumed quickly.Dr BK Murali, director of Hope and Ayushman hospital, said each of the 20 private hospitals running the vaccination programme in the district had ordered 6,000 doses. “They have been able to utilize only 1,000 doses so far. Still around 5,000 doses at each hospital are remaining and the expiry date is nearing,” he said.Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, director of Getwell Hospital, said, they had ordered five boxes each having 50 vials. “This comes to 2,500 doses. In three months, we could utilize only 160 doses. The stock expires in March 2022. At this pace, it is impossible to use the remaining 2340 doses in five months. It will be a massive waste,” he said.Dr Swarnakar said many times they have to send back beneficiaries if numbers don’t add up to 10 as they don’t want to waste remaining doses.Dr Swarnakar suggested that the manufacturers could take them back at same rate and export. “Vaccines are needed globally. Like other countries, the government must allow FLW and HCWs to get paid booster jab. This will also minimize losses suffered by private hospitals as we made infrastructure investments,” he said.Dr Tushar Gawad, Director (Administration) at Alexis Multispecialty Hospital, said they have 4,180 Covishield doses balance. Unless the government allows a paid booster dose, majority of this stock is likely to remain unused through its shelf life which ends in March 2022, thereby leading to criminal wastage of this precious vaccine” he said. However, Nilesh Mundhada, chief finance officer at Kingsway Hospital, said they recently added 3,000 vaccines. “We are expecting corporates and common beneficiaries to continue preferring Kingsway Hospital for vaccination,” he said. VHA convenor Dr Anup Marar said, “Considering the expiry of said stock in coming months, it would be prudent that authorities contemplate on the consumption of these doses. It will be great national loss of an essential item.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unused-vax-in-pvt-centres-will-soon-be-useless/articleshow/87000289.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Police registered a case on Monday. According to police, three people were arrested in a murder case in 2019 reported in Paschim Vihar. One of the accused, Prince Dixit, filed two separate bail applications. After the hearing, the court granted interim bail to Dixit on the ground that the mother of the petitioner expired on September 12, 2020. “Dixit was supposed to surrender in jail before March 15, 2021,” the officer said. Later, Dixit’s counsel filed another application seeking extension of bail on the ground that he (Dixit) was suffering from Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/murder-accused-submits-fake-rt-pcr-report-for-bail/articleshow/87004761.cms||---

The one-time aid will be given to all performing artistes whose annual income does not exceed Rs 48,000 and those who have been domiciled in Maharashtra for the past 15 years. The cabinet has sanctioned Rs 34 crore for the purpose. Subhash Patil, advisor to Rangkarmi Andolan, Maharashtra, an umbrella organisation that represents over 36 forms of arts and artistes across the state, said there are at least 10 lakh artistes. “This decision is wrong. For nearly two years artistes have suffered as they have no source of income. We have made several representations to the government and finally it takes a decision that will benefit a few.” Patil questioned the figure of 56,000, saying there are over 29,000 retired artistes whose annual income is around Rs 48,000 and are given a monthly state stipend. “Our organisation Orchestra Artists Association Maharashtra, Mumbai, alone has 15,000 members.” Meanwhile, BJP has announced it will host Eka Lagnachi Pudchi Goshta, a Marathi play at Rang Sharda, Bandra, to mark the opening of theatres on October 22. BJP MLA Ashish Shelar who is organising the show said this is to highlight the neglect of Marathi artistes by the government that claims to protect Marathi interests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cabinet-nod-for-rs-5k-aid-each-to-56000-performing-artistes-in-mumbai/articleshow/87007631.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Mumbai||Air India staff threaten stir over notice to vacate homes||MUMBAI: Air India ground staff and service engineers have threatened to go on an indefinite strike from November 2 over the airline’s recent notice asking them to vacate their staff quarters within six months of privatisation of the national carrier. Over 7,000 Air India employees live in Air India colonies that occupy about 184 acres of land in Kalina, Santacruz (east).  Three unions, representing a majority of ground employees, have demanded that the airline allow them to use the residential quarters till their retirement. The national carrier is expected to begin next year as a Tata-owned private airline. In an October 5 circular, Air India ordered its employees to sign an an undertaking, stating that they will vacate their quarters in six months after privatisation. The deadline to submit the undertaking is October 20. On Wednesday, the joint action committee of Air India unions submitted the strike notice to the regional labour commissioner. In its letter to the labour commissioner, the unions said the land on which the colonies are situated are leased in perpetuity by Airports Authority of India (AAI) to Air India. “Hence AAI are the owners of the land and the Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) is only a tenant. There is no reason for Air India to vacate the colonies in a tearing hurry and hand over the land to the Adani Group who have taken over the Mumbai airport,” said the letter. “There are several slums on airport land which have not been served notices. The Maharashtra government is the custodian of land records and their permission is essential for the transfer and/or change of user of land,” the letter said, demanding withdrawal of the October 5 circular.  “If the management has a legal right to ask the employees to vacate their houses in these colonies where is the question of seeking any undertaking from the employees,” the letter says, adding that the management demand “seeks to effect changes which impinges upon legal rights relating to the service conditions of the employees” as provided under Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. “Staff quarters are given mostly to staff who do not have a house in Mumbai and are not paid HRA. As such, they are legally entitled to the accommodation as a service condition and legal right that has been in existence for several decades,” the letter said. The first buildings in the colony were built in 1956.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ai-staff-threaten-stir-over-notice-to-vacate-homes/articleshow/87007634.cms||---

AAP asked why Pramod Sawant is afraid of showing Amit Shah the reality of roads that Goans have to bear everyday. “If BJP can fix roads for one visit, then surely they can fix roads for Goenkars who suffer daily,” the party stated, adding that Goans have been suffering due to bad roads across the state. AAP has repetedly exposed the reality of how potholes are affecting Goans. In one instance, while highlighting a road in Mapusa, AAP Goa Convener Rahul Mhambre had to help a lady who fell into the pothole with her child. “The fact that they showed such alacrity in fixing potholes for Amit Shah means they have the means but not the will to fix roads for Goenkars,” AAP stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-afraid-to-show-bad-roads-to-shah/articleshow/87004796.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rs 53.5-lakh fine imposed on 165 sites for dust pollution in Delhi||NEW DELHI: With dust a major factor in air pollution in the capital, Delhi government has been cracking down on constructors violating the rules on curbing dust proliferation. State environment minister Gopal Rai inspected the construction site of the WHO building on Mahatma Gandhi Marg on Wednesday and detected minor infractions there. Delhi Pollution Control Committee has inspected 522 construction and demolition sites over the past week and booked 165 for flouting the guidelines. According to a pollution source apportionment carried out by The Energy and Resources Institute and Automotive Research Association of India in 2018, dust from soil, roads and construction sites constitutes up to 25% of the coarse PM10 pollutants and 17% of respirable PM2.5 pollutants in Delhi’s air in the winter months. Delhi government has been running an anti-dust campaign from October 7 and has issued a 14-point guidelines for constructors. After inspection by 31 teams comprising engineers and green marshals, DPCC has penalised 165 non-complying with environmental damage compensations (EDC) totalling Rs 53.5 lakh. At the WHO site, Rai said, “We observed that most of the regulations and the 14-point anti-dust guidelines were being followed. There was also an anti-smog gun on the premises. However, we found loose sand that had been dampened with water but wasn’t covered with netting as required. We also noticed that the workers hadn’t been given face masks.” The minister added that DPCC had been informed about these violations. A notice has been issued to the construction agency and a penalty will be imposed on it if there is no compliance with the guidelines within two days. As the anti-dust campaign will continue till October 29, the inspection teams are visiting all construction sites in the capital to make sure the rules are being followed. According to government officials, the EDC is imposed on the basis of the National Green Tribunal guidelines of 2016, with the amount payable varying from Rs 10,000 to Rs 5 lakh depending on the size of construction plot. Rai asked people to report dust, vehicular or other pollution on the Green Delhi app to enable the government to take immediate action. Delhi government will also run a 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off' campaign from October 18 to curb vehicular pollution at traffic signals. A meeting of officials of environment and revenue departments, Delhi Police and Civil Defence Volunteers in this regard is scheduled for Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-53-5-lakh-fine-imposed-on-165-sites-for-dust-pollution/articleshow/87004791.cms||---

Denatured spirit is the base material used for preparing cosmetics, phenyl and such things too apart from sanitizers.Similar arrests were made in Nashik and Pune where denatured spirit distributors, who had supplied the material, had been taken into custody.Senior excise officials are yet to come to conclusion whether the racketeers were actually using denatured spirit to manufacture liquor, but with a misleading label. Sources stated that the racketeers used the labels of denatured spirit to evade substantial tax surcharges.In Nagpur, state excise team had zeroed down upon a den in Chankapur from where Mithun Saha (35) and his employee, Vishal Mondal (25), were caught red-handed while manufacturing liquor using denatured spirit.The department, led by senior inspector Narendra Thorat under the supervision of SP Pramod Sonone, had seized around 600 litres of denatured spirit, apart from other material and equipment worth over Rs14.38 lakh. “Denatured spirit may cause health hazards and its use in unauthorized liquor manufacture could have serious health implications,” he said.Following interrogation of Saha and Mondal, distributor of the denatured spirit was nabbed from Nashik, Indranil Bannerjee, who also has an export and import business. Bannerjee had supplied around 200 litres of denatured spirit to Saha and Mondal using fake documents, said an official.On October 7, the excise department had nabbed Avinash Pawar from Pune for having supplied around 400 liters of denatured spirit to Saha and Mondal without verifying the credentials of the manufacturer.SP Sonone said the liquor seized from the racketeers has been sent to Regional Forensic Science Laboratory (RFSL) for final report.At RFSL, a team of scientists and analysts under deputy director Vijay Thakre is set to examine the seized liquor samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/racketeers-using-sanitizer-spirit-to-make-liquor/articleshow/87000326.cms||Soumitra Bose

Joining the group of syndicate and senate members who have demanded that the state government should appoint an inquiry panel to probe alleged irregularities in the recruitment process of the university, the teachers’ body said that even financial irregularities should be probed. BUTA said that even in 2019, when the university had issued notification to fill up 650-plus teaching posts, it had brought to the notice of VC that the notification was not in accordance with the norms set by the University Grants Commission and All India Council for Technical Education. “But VC never paid heed. Finally, due to unavoidable circumstances, we had to approach Gujarat high court by filing a petition. University since last two years has not submitted its stand in the case,” said BUTA general secretary Dr Nikul Patel. “Also, for the National Institute Ranking Framework(NIRF) rankings, Rs 32.87 crore has been shown as expenditure at the Faculty of Technology and Engineering. Infrastructure set up at such a high cost is not visible on ground. So, we are demanding that apart from irregularities in the recruitment process, the state government should appoint an inquiry committee to probe financial irregularities,” he said. BUTA alleged that in the past a candidate with a basic degree in engineering has been recruited as assistant professor at commerce faculty to teach BCom students. Even a candidate who did not have a PhD degree was appointed as a professor in the commerce faculty, they claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/chorus-to-recall-msu-vc-grows-louder/articleshow/87002482.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan excise department shuts 16 liquor shops for three days||JAIPUR: After the excise department suspended 16 shops for three days on Wednesday, the liquor traders alleged that they are being targeted after protest was initiated by them to amend the policy. Disappointed with the move, the traders have decided to surrender their shops to the excise department on Thursday. The excise department claims the action was taken as the traders have not deposited composite fee. However, traders alleged, the department is targeting the traders who were protesting against the government. Nilesh Mewara, president of Raj Liquor Welfare Society, said, traders announced to protest against the new policy to gather the attention of the chief minister. Following this action has been taken against the protesters. “To develop the pressure tactics on the traders the excise department has taken the action. There are several shops who have not deposited composite fee. But, shops of only one group has been targeted.” The traders further alleged for almost three months, contractors from across the state have been demonstrating at district headquarters and excise offices, warehouses, but the government did not accept their demands. “After traders announced to come on the road, the department is taking action. We are businessmen and not going to default on payments. The government is harassing traders who are already under financial crises,” said another member. Liquor traders claim that the state government abolished the license fee, but gave it a new name, Basic License Fee and Rs 881 per box on Rajasthan-made liquor, Rs 357 per box is being charged separately on country liquor. As the number of shops increased in the state, it is claimed the profit sharing reduced. Moreover, the traders are allegedly facing difficulties due to the guarantee system. A society member also demanded that the excise department should provide various relaxations for traders to survive in the business. “It’s mandatory for a trader to purchase a fixed amount of liquor every month from the excise depot. A penalty is imposed, if traders fail. After shops were made composite, the traders must buy stock of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), country-made liquor including Rajasthan-Made Liquor (RML). It’s difficult for the shopkeepers to sell the stock of all three categories.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/excise-dept-suspends-16-liquor-shops-for-three-days/articleshow/87007104.cms||---

---||Goa||Amit Shah arrives in Goa today on 2-day visit||PANAJI: On the eve of Union home minister Amit Shah’s two-day visit to the state, BJP Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis said that Shah will oversee the party’s election preparedness in the state and that his visit “is important to gear up for elections”. During his visit, Shah will lay the foundation stone for the National Forensic Science University at Dharbandora. He will also address BJP karyakartas at Taleigao and hold meetings with the BJP legislature wing and core committee. Fadnavis, who has already arrived in Goa to oversee the preparations for Shah’s visit, said that the meeting between Shah and the BJP core committee and legislature wing is mainly to gauge the political situation at the ground level. Shah is also likely to discuss the BJP state unit’s view on pre-poll alliance arrangements. Realising that they could possibly need a pre-poll alliance with MGP, Fadnavis had recently met Madkai MLA and MGP’s Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar. Shah will also review central projects with officials. A core committee member said that Shah is likely to guide the party and its MLAs on facing elections even as it faces anti-incumbency. A political observer said that Shah is a master strategist and that his guidance will definitely help BJP to overcome the anti-incumbency and galvanise party workers to put in their full strength for the polls. “It will be interesting to see if Shah speaks on the issue of giving two or more tickets to one family,” the political observer added. A few BJP MLAs are eyeing tickets for their spouses. On the subject, BJP national president J P Nadda had said, “Family Raj and giving tickets are two different issues and it cannot be connected to family raj. Family raj means you don’t allow anyone to grow. We decide tickets based on merits. We will accommodate them to take the part towards victory.” BJP has been at the helm of the government in Goa for the past 10 years, beginning 2012, when riding on a Manohar Parrikar wave, the party won 21 seats in the 40-member House for the first time. Though in 2017 it failed to win a majority, Parrikar was quick to form a coalition government to ensure the party’s return to office. Since Parrikar’s death, BJP has focussed on splitting opposition parties and luring their MLAs with plum posts to ensure that they have a majority in the assembly. This will be the first time that BJP will go to polls in the state without Parrikar, whose charisma and political strategy ensured that the saffron party had an edge over its opponents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shah-arrives-in-goa-today-on-2-day-visit/articleshow/87004798.cms||Murari Shetye

The saffron party is organizing such conventions at different cities in Maharashtra to make party workers aware of the OBC-related issues and share key talking points.State party president Chandrakant Patil said, “We have to raise the pitch of our campaign so that the government will have to think twice before going to polls without OBC reservation. During the recently-concluded bypolls, we had raised the issue and it was widely discussed, but it wasn’t enough for the state government to defer the elections till the reservation issue was sorted out.” He urged party workers to become more aggressive to achieve results, as that has been the experience. Patil said, “Did they reopen temples just like that? We had to do agitation across the state, but even then they have placed multiple restrictions. There is a ban on entry of senior citizens, but it’s actually this age group which goes the most to temples. You (Uddhav Thackeray) don’t step out of Matoshree, so how will you know who visits temples.” Patil said even though the recent bypolls were held without OBC quota, BJP ensured that OBC candidates were fielded. “I told everybody else that I won’t sign their forms, as we are giving opportunity to OBC candidates,” said Patil. Senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule pointed out to party workers the need to highlight failures of MVA, with respect to the OBC community. “You need to tell citizens that MVA was the reason for the OBC reservation issue not being able to stand the legal test in the Supreme Court. Our government had passed an ordinance, but it was the MVA which failed to make it stand in the court,” said Bawankule.Former BJP MP Hansraj Ahir said at the ground level, citizens must be told about central government’s initiatives regarding OBC community. “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there have been various schemes announced to benefit the community. We (party workers) have to understand the importance of taking our message to the community efficiently,” said Ahir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/raise-pitch-for-obc-electoral-quota-bjp-tells-its-workers/articleshow/87000363.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Despite the festivities, there is stability in the Covid graph,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s Covid task force. “Apart from Mumbai, Thane and Pune, most other districts are calm,” he added. Follow TOI's live blog for latest updates on CovidThe week-on-week growth rate in 25 of the 36 districts in the state is between 0 (Dhule, Washim, Chandrapur) and -180 (Ahmednagar). Only 11 districts, including Mumbai, show a positive growth rate between the September 29-October 5, and October 6-October 12 period. In fact, 17 districts have less than 100 active cases at the moment, and Nandurbar and Bhandara have only two active cases. The state government on Wednesday reported 2,219 cases and 49 deaths. With this, the total caseload of the state rose to 65.8 lakh and deaths rose to 1.4 lakh. After two days of under-450 cases, the city recorded 477 cases and the active cases also rose to 5,997. In fact, Mumbai is contributing one-fifth of the total active cases in Maharashtra (29,555). BMC officials said though there is a rise in cases, it is not significant. At the height of the second wave, the city recorded 11,020 cases on April 3. There was a discussion on Covid cases in the state cabinet. According to the presentation made in the state cabinet, the weekly case growth rate is 0.03% and 11 districts have higher rates. The weekly positivity rate of the state is 2.03%, with eight districts at a higher rate. Sindhudurg has the highest 6.9%. In four districts — Sindhudurg, Pune, Nashik and Palghar — the rate is on the rise. In all, five districts reported over 80% of the cases in the last one week. Joshi said the state, especially Mumbai, should be “watchful” for the next three months at the “very least”. Though a third wave as huge as the second wave seems unlikely at the moment, the emergence of a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus could change all that, he warned. State officials said with cases dropping, there is a demand to relax the norm that only the fully vaccinated can enter malls or board local trains, and also to extend shop timings. But they are staying alert and have asked districts to ramp up testing ahead of the festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cases-drop-19-in-state-but-rise-18-in-city-in-fortnight/articleshow/87004859.cms||Malathy Iyer

However, Aryadan being the former minister, vigilance was in need of the government clearance and approval from the state governor. Saritha had claimed before the Solar commission that she had given Rs 1.90 crore to former chief minister Oommen Chandy’s aide Thomas Kuruvila. According to her, she met Aryadan upon the instructions of Chandy and handed over Rs 40 lakh to him in two instalments. Based on the preliminary probe of the vigilance, the cabinet has decided to recommend the governor to give prosecution sanction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cabinet-gives-nod-for-vacb-probe/articleshow/87004847.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As the withdrawal of nominations ended on Wednesday, 30 candidates, including from three main parties of TRS, BJP and Congress, were left in the fray. Elections will be held on October 30. Twelve candidates, including BJP candidate Eatale Rajender’s wife Eatala Jamuna, withdrew the nomination papers. In what could upset the TRS, symbols like roadroller, roti maker (roller pin) and helicopter were allotted by the EC. The roadroller symbol was allotted Praja Vani Party candidate L Venkateswarlu, roller pin to Praja Ekta Party candidate S Srikanth, helicopter symbol to independent U Ravinder and camera symbol to independent candidate P Raju. Tiller symbol was given to independent L Srinivas Reddy and cup and saucer symbol to Dalita Bahujana Party candidate D Srinivasu. The TRS had earlier petitioned the EC not to allot these symbols as it had led to confusion among voters. Stung by the Dubbak bypoll result where the ruling party lost and an independent with his roller pin symbol bagging over 3,500 votes, TRS representatives said car look-alike symbols could lead to upsets if the contest gets close. The fight is triangular among BJP candidate and former minister Eatala Rajender, TRS candidate Gellu Srinivas Yadav and Congress’s Balmoor Venkat Narsing Rao with all the parties pulling out all stops to win the election. So far, the authorities have seized Rs 1.45 core at various checkposts. Apart from the checkposts, flying squads were also set up. Around 30 grams of gold, 14 kg of silver and 867 litres of liquor have been seized. Around 66 sarees and 50 shirts meant for distribution to voters were also seized. Police recovered 3.51 kg of ganja. Telangana chief electoral officer Shashank Goel said all arrangements were being made for a smooth polling on October 30. “We will begin EVM commissioning. We have made all the arrangements for the polling. Paper with symbols to be placed on EVMs is being printed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/worry-for-trs-as-ec-allots-car-look-alike-symbols/articleshow/87004822.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

However, all of the state’s stray cattle cannot be sent to one shelter. We need to have more gaushalas in all talukas. We cannot blame the cattle when they go and eat vegetables growing in fields. They’re a part of the ecosystem. We need to come up with a holistic plan to tackle this problem,” he said. The Calangute MLA said that any person intending to set up a cattle shed in one or two talukas could be provided with support. Talking at the launch of harvesting machines in various panchayats in Calangute and Siolim constituencies, Lobo said that dues of farmers who sell their produce to the state government, which have not been cleared so far because of lack of funds, will be paid soon. He also assured to take up farmers’ demand for subsidy on diesel used for their farming machines. “The government provides an annual diesel subsidy to fishermen and on the same lines we should provide one to farmers,” he said, adding that the state government will continue to provide all assistance to farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-pushes-for-plan-to-tackle-stray-cattle-problem/articleshow/87004817.cms||---

No coal stock, blame BJP. But they will never tell you that central government had already informed them about the need to stock up coal as monsoon season was upon us,” said Patil.During the media interaction, Patil also took a swipe at the state government over women’s safety. “Maharashtra always had a history of being a place where women were safe. In Mumbai, girls would return late after playing garba without fear. But now girls can’t venture out without someone accompanying them,” said Patil. He questioned NCP MP Supriya Sule’s “silence” on the issue. “During my tenure (as PWD minister), she would spot all the potholes and take selfies. Now she can’t see all the crimes being committed against women. What about Vidya Chavan (NCP MLC), she’s not speaking at all either. It’s shocking what level of compromise they are doing for the sake of power,” said the BJP neta. About NCP’s plan to carry out a statewide padyatra post-Diwali, Patil said, “It is shocking that they will now go from village to village. If so, then the only thing they can talk about is how they have failed the farmers. Also, they will have to explain why their ministers are being investigated by authorities.”He also said BJP, in its role as the opposition party, has started to expose those who do wrong. “It started long ago and you can see that many top politicians have been exposed for their wrongdoing,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mva-partners-have-habit-to-blame-bjp-for-everything-patil/articleshow/87000371.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

He said it was decided initially that GWMC would float a tender to collect waste from the beaches, but former CM Manohar Parrikar at the eleventh hour handed it over to the tourism department. “The CM has to take this seriously, and next time changes should be made,” he said. Lobo was speaking to reporters at the sidelines of the launch of a harvesting machine at Verla, Canca He said the tourism department forcefully took over the waste management on beaches, but failed to manage waste on the beaches. “Parrikar had initially said that only GWMC will take care of wet and dry waste everywhere. That is why we built plants at Saligao and Cacora, and another one is coming up at Bainguinim. We also built the bio-medical waste plant at Kundaim,” said Lobo. “Fines have to be levied, and GWMC has the authority to impose fines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/beach-cleaning-should-be-under-waste-corp/articleshow/87004843.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: MSRTC union blames salary delays as 24th staffer ends life since pandemic||KOLHAPUR: A 42-year-old assistant mechanic with the Pandharpur depot of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) in Solapur district committed suicide on Wednesday morning, making him the 24th staffer of the state transport utility to have taken his life since the pandemic began. Dashrath Gidde’s death comes just a day after a driver from the Beed depot ended his life. Ashok Changan, divisional secretary of the Maharashtra ST Workers Congress, claimed that the Beed driver did not have money to pay his monthly electricity bills, which resulted in power being cut at his residence. “The delay in getting salaries has become routine during the pandemic. It has hit the MSRTC employees hard. We received salaries for July in September, which impacted our financial situation and invited penalty and action in many cases,” he said. Gidde, working at the Pandharpur depot for the last three years, hailed from Mohol town of Solapur district. Pandharpur city police, who have registered the case of accidental death, said the reason behind Gidde ending his life could not be ascertained. “We didn’t find any suicide note, hence the actual reason of suicide is still not clear. The family members claim that they are going through a tough financial situation. We found the family to be in a poor financial condition. There might be some other family issues too, which we are probing,” inspector Arun Pawar of the Pandharpur police said. MSRTC depot manager at Pandharpur S F Sutar said Gidde was a good person. “He never revealed any details of his present situation. We will help his family in all possible ways,” he said. Experts have underlined the need for counselling the workforce to prevent any more suicides. Consulting psychiatrist Dr Manik Bhise said financial stress often acts as a trigger for suicide. “Counselling can help many vulnerable individuals in developing a proper frame of mind. Avoiding all forms of addiction and maintaining active participation in family and social life can also prove to be of great help,” he said. The MSRTC, which has a fleet of over 18,000 buses that ferried around 67 lakh citizens daily prior to the Covid outbreak, has a workforce of around 93,000 across the state.

---||Nagpur||Stringent rules poured water on KP’s Ravan dahan plans||Nagpur: For the second year in a row, the almost seven decades old Ravan Dahan event at Kasturchand Park (KP) ground has been cancelled, but this time there were other reasons apart from Covid-19. Sources in Sanatan Dharm Yuvak Sabha (SDYS) say district collectorate’s resistance to allowing the ‘desired’ number of attendees made the process of navigating the bureaucratic maze for obtaining NOCs unviable. Though the initial nod had come from the Heritage Committee, SDYS’ joint secretary Prashant Sahni said that this green signal is just the start. “It’s a long road from here as we need NOCs from almost seven different authorities,” said Sahni. Sahni claimed that one of the crucial NOCs, from city cops, had been granted. “We had sought permission for 500, but approval was given for 100. Still, we thought that somehow we can hold the event,” said Sahni. The turning point came during a meeting with district collector R Vimala. A SDYS member, who was present during the meeting, said, “Before officially applying for permission, we wanted to discuss it with madam. But she was a bit vary citing the threat of third wave and said that three people, one for each effigy, may be allowed.” Finally, SDYS decided not to apply for permission and stopped process of seeking NOCs from other authorities as well. The cost of organizing the event is estimated to be between Rs 5-6 lakh, funds for which are raised by SDYS. The cost and logistical efforts for negligible attendees were ultimately “not worth the effort” and it was decided to cancel it this year as well. In a press statement, secretary Sanjeev Kapoor and other office bearers like Narendra Satija, Gautam Sahni, Ashish Dhawan etc confirmed that Ravan Dahan will now be held at their organization’s premises at Kadbi Chowk. A five feet effigy of Ravan will be set on fire in the presence of around 20 SDYS office bearers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stringent-rules-poured-water-on-kps-ravan-dahan-plans/articleshow/87000409.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

As per the previous plan, the entire project was proposed to be completed in 21 months. However, in the revised plan it is stated to complete the phase-1 in 21 months and phase-2 in 12 months. Speculations are rife that plan has been revised as state government is apprehensive that entire project will not be completed in 21 months and it might not inaugurate it before elections. An official said, “Twelve storeys will be constructed in phase-1 and remaining 10 stories in phase-2. The entire height of the building will be 125 metre.” A draft has also been prepared to increase the cost of the project. Now, the revised project cost will be Rs 500 crore including goods and service tax (GST). Earlier, it was Rs 405 crore excluding GST. “The final decision will be taken by the Urban Development and Housing (UDH) minister,” said an official. Sources said, the decision was also taken to construct the project in phases as the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) did not receive the height clearance from the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The tower will be the tallest in the state with a proposed height of 125 metre where the first helipad will be constructed. Recently, the (AAI) had given a no objection certificate (NOC) to construct building up to a height of approximately 51 metres. An official at the town planning department said, “After studies, the Appellate Committee for Height Clearance will subsequently grant NOC to high-rise. The committee will verify if the structure was coming in the glide path of the aircraft.” The building will be oneof-its-kind as it will have an air ambulance landing facility for helicopters, basements including parking and hospital services and 20 operation theatres. The project was announced in the budget speech. The medical education department had sanctioned Rs 96 crore for its implementation. Subsequently, Jaipur Smart City Limited accorded sanction of an additional Rs 125 crore for the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-plans-ipd-tower-at-sms-hosp-in-two-phases/articleshow/87007142.cms||---

The court accepted the prosecution demand that all persons accused in the infamous case should appear before the court for trial beginning on November 22. The chargesheet will be read out to the accused on the opening day of the trial. The court rejected the claims of the former MLAs that the visuals submitted before the court as evidence against them were doctored. The court said the visuals can be considered as evidence in the case. Court also refused to admit the claim that the accused persons stayed inside the assembly complex during the previous night of the budget day without any ill motives. The LDF government’s bid to withdraw the case had faced a setback in the Supreme Court earlier. The SC in July said the LDF MLAs must face prosecution under Indian Penal Code (IPC) and prevention of damages to public property Act for damaging assembly property. Besides Sivankutty, the other persons accused in the case are former ministers EP Jayarajan, KT Jaleel and former MLAs K Kunjahammad, CK Sadasivan and K Ajith. The state assembly had witnessed unprecedented scenes on March 13, 2015, as LDF members, then in the opposition, tried to prevent the finance minister KM Mani from presenting the budget. Mani was then facing corruption charges in connection with the bar bribery case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/court-rejects-discharge-plea-of-sivankutty-others/articleshow/87004947.cms||---

Police recovered 91 such items, including 27 mobile phones. Cybercrime officials said they received a tip-off and based on surveillance arrested Gautam alias Prithvi Barad, 19, a resident of Lathi Road, Amreli and Nilesh Babaria, 21, a resident of Keshod in Junagadh. Police said a case was registered under IPC Section 419 (cheating by impersonation) and sections of the IT Act. During their interrogation, the two revealed that they were members of various social media groups from where they got user IDs and passwords for OTT content providers and e-commerce portals. From analysis of their chats on these groups, police found that credentials of several OTT services were shared on them along with user IDs and passwords of online retailers. The duo were thus able to get user IDs and passwords and would use them to access these accounts and check order details. When they came across such pre-paid orders, they would change the delivery address and enter a dummy phone number. When the delivery worker would arrive, the two would meet them outside the addresses and collect the goods from them. They had diverted about 1,000 orders from popular online e-commerce websites. Cybercrime police said that among the 91 items recovered were 27 mobile phones, seven digital watches, two tablets, laptops and other expensive appliances and even tool kits. Police also recovered clothes, shoes and other items from the two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/youths-change-addresses-steal-parcels/articleshow/87002734.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Ashtami turnout low, yet Maharashtra crosses 9 crore doses & Mumbai covers 96% with 1 jab||MUMBAI: Although the Covid vaccination drive hasn’t seen any record turnout during the ongoing Navrati festival, both Maharashtra and Mumbai posted new achievements on Wednesday. The state rode past the 9 crore milestone in inoculation on Wednesday, while Mumbai ensured 95.7% of its 92.3 lakh adults have got at least one dose. “We have fully vaccinated 2.8 crore of our adult population (30%), which is the highest for any state in the country,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), on Wednesday. In Mumbai, 54% of the adult population is fully vaccinated. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid, said: “We have to be cautiously optimistic even though we have given out 9 crore shots. We now need to identify unvaccinated geographies, break the hesitancy and vaccinate the maximum number of people before the year ends.” However, Mission Kavach Kundal, whose aim was to vaccinate 15 lakh people daily, coincided with Navratri and has been struggling to bring people to vaccination centres. On Wednesday, the state turnout was the second lowest (6.96 lakh) during the week-long mission. Mumbai, too, posted one of the lowest tallies in months, with only 55,320 people getting vaccinated on Wednesday. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said: “Many fast on Ashtami and wouldn’t like to get vaccinated as a result,” he said. The city has adequate stocks of vaccine and expects vaccination to pick up after Dasera, he added. A senior BMC official said the civic body is fine-tuning a plan to take vaccination closer to the people: temporary vaccination centres will be set up in neighbourhoods to increase vaccine coverage. While Pune, Bhandara and Sindhudurg districts have managed to vaccinate close to 90% of their adult population, data shows 22 districts have coverage lower than the state’s average. Twenty-six districts have a lower second dose coverage that the state’s average. The state has given the first dose to 68.2% of its population and 30% are fully vaccinated. A district officer from Hingoli, which has one of the least vaccine coverage, said one reason for hesitancy is the decline in Covid cases. The district isn’t industrialised and no corporate-sponsored vaccination camps have been held here. "Most parts of the districts are rural and hesitancy is high in these pockets. We are trying to create awareness and reach out at the village level,” said the official. Hingoli has given 46.9% of the population the first shot and 17% both. Nanded has the worst vaccine statistics in the state, with first-shot coverage of 43.9% and only 16.4% fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ashtami-turnout-low-yet-state-crosses-9cr-doses-city-covers-96-with-1-jab/articleshow/87004928.cms||Malathy Iyer

In all, there are 30 candidates in the fray, after the last date of withdrawal of nominations. Four women had filed their nominations giving hopes of breaking the monotony of the men’s contest in the constituency. Women have never contested from this seat after the formation of Telangana in 2014. Of the four women, nominations of two were rejected due to documentation not being proper. The other two too backed out on Wednesday, the last date for withdrawal of nominations. One of them was Eatala Jamuna, who had filed her nomination as Rajender believes it as a back-up for him, in case something goes wrong with his nomination. She withdrew her nomination on Wednesday. Another independent candidate Noor Jahan Begum (40), a social worker, too withdrew from the race. This was not the first time that Noor Jahan had entered the electoral fray. Political analysts said while women should definitely contest from unreserved seats, they said it was not rare in Telangana that only men were in the electoral fray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/huzurabadby-poll-to-beall-male-fight/articleshow/87004916.cms||Roushan Ali

He was 86. Kutty was under treatment for heart related ailments at a private hospital in Kozhikode where he died in the morning. Hailing from Pulikkal near Kondotty in Malappuram district, Kutty is credited for taking the Muslim folk song genre, which had been an integral part of the cultural tradition of the Muslim community but used to be confined to marriage venues and other family and community gatherings, to the larger public realms across Kerala, Gulf and beyond. Kutty enlivened the state’s Mappilapattu scene for over six decades by singing and composing hundreds of folk songs. He also took the lead in taking the genre to the masses by starting the first music troupe exclusively for Mappilapattu, christened Kutty’s Orchestra, in 1957. Kutty’s rendering of popular songs like Samkritha Pamagari, Amina Beevikomana Mone, and Kalapootintathishayam were much sought after during his concerts. He also penned hit songs like Kiliye Dikru Padi Kiliye, and Arabu Nattil Akaleyengadirikkum Bappa Ariyan, among others. Known as the ‘Sultan of Mappilapattu’, Kutty conducted performances across Kerala and major cities in the country. With the Gulf migration from Kerala picking up pace in the 1980s, his music programmes were much in demand there. When his first gramaphone records of folk songs became a hit in 1962, he followed it up with numerous music cassettes. Vadakkumkara Mohammed Kutty (V M Kutty) was born to Unnein Musaliyar and Ithachakutty on April 16, 1935. After his studies, he began his career as a teacher in a lower primary school at Kolathur in 1957 but left the job to pursue his passion for singing. Kutty had performed Mappilapattu for All India Radio station, Kozhikode in 1954. He introduced many female singers into Mappilapattu, including those from other religions. The V M Kutty-Vilayil Valsala (who later became Vilayil Fazeela) duo was a big hit in the 1970s and 80s. He had written around a dozen books on Mappilapattu and its history and cultural and literary traditions. A multifaceted talent, he had composed music for many folk songs, was playback singer for seven movies and also acted in a couple of movies like Pathinalam Ravu. He was honoured by the Malayalam Thunchath Ezhuthachan University with an honorary DLitt degree and had won many awards including the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy award. The funeral was held at the Pulikkal Juma Masjid buriyal ground after the body was kept for public homage at Mahakavi Moyinkutty Vaidyar Mappila Kala Academy. Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and many other dignitaries and celebrities condoled the Kutty’s death. In his condolence message, Vijayan said that Kutty was a genius who played a vital role in popularizing Mappilapattu and took it to new heights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/v-m-kutty-the-sultan-of-mappilapattu-passes-away/articleshow/87004995.cms||---
---||Delhi||Dust pollution in Delhi: Green cover for road dividers, flyovers to be beautified||NEW DELHI: The Public Works Department has decided to beautify flyovers and give a green cover to wide road dividers as a part of the plan to fight dust pollution. The air quality of the capital has started slipping and is currently in the “moderate” category with PM10 being the main pollutant. A source said while several flyovers under PWD’s jurisdiction already had a green cover, there were others were saplings could be planted. “The green cover does not only make flyovers look beautiful, but also gives a rich visual experience to those passing by. Most importantly, it is significant for fighting dust pollution,” said a PWD official. The AAP government had recently announced the winter action plan enumerating 10 steps to check pollution levels. One of the steps included fighting dust pollution. Bad roads are one of the key causes of dust pollution and PWD is already working on a war-footing to make them pothole-free. The exercise is being monitored by PWD minister Satyendar Jain. An official said a survey was being undertaken to identify flyovers that either didn’t have a green cover or partially had plants and bushes. After this, the department would review the scope of greening and beautification work and carry out the task accordingly. “Flyovers that have plants, but not ideal conditions will also witness restoration work,” added the official. During the exercise, ornamental vines like bougainvillea would be used, among other climbing plants. Delhi government is also working on redesigning roads by emulating designs from European countries to make them spacious and carve spaces for pedestrians, cyclists and green areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dust-pollution-green-cover-for-road-dividers-flyovers-to-be-beautified/articleshow/87004989.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Minister defends move to seek nod for colleges, cites universities advertisement||MUMBAI: Despite negative recommendations by the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (BAMU), six new colleges proposed by a minister received letters of intent (LoI) from the state government. The matter was heard in the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court, which found the law had not been adhered to while giving the LoIs under the exception clause and set aside the preliminary approval given by the government. “An order passed exercising the state’s power under the said clause without recording appropriate and valid reasons would tantamount to arbitrary exercise of powers... An arbitrary action cannot be sustained,” observed the bench. The court added that the government may reconsider the proposal by strictly adhering to the law. The deadline for considering proposals for colleges for the session 2021-22 has already ended. The state had granted LoIs to 190 new colleges in April and May. One of the petitioners alleged that around 35% of these were from BAMU. “Around 40 proposals were from Aurangabad alone,” he said. Three different petitions were filed against the LoIs granted to seven colleges, many of them from the Adarsh Education Society and Hindustan Education Society managed by Sattar’s family. Sattar, who is minister of state for revenue, said the trust had sought permissions for arts and science colleges only when BAMU invited proposals based on its perspective plan. “If they had not invited the proposals in an advertisement, we would not have spent money on buying the land and constructing a new building,” said Sattar. “Our constituency requires colleges for girls, for tribal students and students from backward classes. Girls are deprived of education and if colleges are made accessible to them within 3-4 km, it will help them and the community at large.” He said that they would study the court order and then will fulfil all the requirements mentioned by the court. On why the trust floated proposals for multiple colleges in a small taluka, he said the entire taluka falls under hilly region and if an educational institution wants to offer free education to children in the constituency, without taking any aid from the government, why should the government be opposed to it. Of the 180 proposals received by BAMU, only 12 were approved after inspection by the administration and were considered to have fulfilled all the requirements under the universities act, said a petitioner. Despite not getting clearance from the university, the state government issued letters of intent, he added. “The government permits you to open one college in a taluka with a population of 10,000. There is no need to open a second college if the population is around 16,000, especially when seats are going vacant in existing colleges,” said the petitioner. One of the reasons cited by the university for rejecting the proposals was that the need of the college in the region did not exist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-minister-defends-move-to-seek-nod-for-colleges-cites-univ-ad/articleshow/87007695.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Business||Customs duty on crude edible oils cut||NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday scrapped basic customs duty on crude varieties of palm, soyabean and sunflower oil till March 2022 and also slashed agri-cess on these items in a move aimed at bringing down prices during the festive season. Edible oil industry body, SEA, said retail prices of edible oils could now come down by Rs 10 to Rs 15 per litre soon. As per notifications issued by the finance ministry on Wednesday, the duty cuts will be effective from October 14 and will remain in force till March 31, 2022. Post this reduction, the effective customs duty on crude varieties of palm, soyabean and sunflower oil will be 8.2% , 5.5% and 5.5% respectively. Besides, the basic customs duty on refined varieties of sunflower, soyabean, palmolein and palm oil has been slashed to 17.5% each from the current 32.5%. Sources said facing a herculean task to tame the rising edible oil prices forced the government to bite the bullet of reducing agri-cess. According to the notification, crude palm oil will now attract agri-infrastructure development cess (AIDC) of 7.5%, while the rate will be 5% for crude soyabean oil and crude sunflower oil. Earlier, cess on imported crude palmolein oil was 17.5 % and 20% on crude sunflower and soybean oils. Solvent Extractors’ Association of India executive director BV Mehta said, “The government has taken the right step to bring relief to consumers. We have one concern that the decision comes at a time when farmers are harvesting soya and groundnuts crops. There is a possibility this may bring down market prices and lower price realisation by farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/customs-duty-on-crude-edible-oils-cut/articleshow/87009039.cms||---

The church was brought under the ‘Receiver Administration’ on October 12, 1974 following disputes between the Jacobite and Orthodox factions. Interestingly it was handed over to the Orthodox faction on the next day of completion of 47 years of ‘receiver administration’. The district court in Ernakulam, which was designated to handle the church disputes, had in 2019 issued an order in favour of the Orthodox faction. Subsequently, the high court directed the RDO on September 12 to hand over the church administration to the Orthodox faction within a month. Finally the keys of the church were handed over to the parish vicar Father Joseph Mathew by village officer of Chelakkara TK Sasidharan. There was a proposal to hand over the keys to Orthodox faction on Tuesday. The police had made elaborate security arrangements to avert untoward incidents during the handing over of the administration of the church to the Orthodox faction. Kunnamkulam ACP T S Sinoj and Thalapilli tahsildar Gopakumar were among those present on the occasion. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/church-handed-over-to-orthodox-faction/articleshow/87005039.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Abhay Chudasama, the IGP of the Gandhinagar range, told mediapersons that last Friday the police control room had been informed about a murder near Sector 27. The victim was later identified as Bhatiya, who used to work at a hotel. He had been stabbed in his chest and neck. Chudasama said that 15 teams were formed to hunt down the killers. He said that inquiries showed that Bhatiya was an unassuming person. Statements of his colleagues and an inspection of his social media accounts revealed nothing out of the ordinary. “It was a challenging case as the motive for the murder was not clear,” Chudasama said. “Also since the body was found at 7am, the time of the murder was not immediately known.” Chudasama said records showed Bhatiya’s mobile phone had been switched off at Raipur in Ahmedabad. “However, his earlier location was Vastrapur from where he took a bike ride through an aggregator app,” Chudasama said. “He was dropped at Geeta Mandir and in the CCTV footage of the Gandhinagar depot, he is seen coming out and moving on GH Road.” Chudasama added: “He was seen in the footage of a camera at GH-5 but GH-6 cameras gave no clue. The CCTV footage of Sectors 22 and 23 was checked.” That too yielded nothing. Chudasama said that the cops then checked the vehicles passing from the area. An autorickshaw driver identified Bhatiya and said he had dropped him at the crossroads of Sectors 24 and 27. Hence, the CCTV footage of Sector 27 was checked. Footage showed Bhatiya being followed by three to four persons on a bike about 400 metres from the spot where he was killed. Chudasama said extensive scanning of the footage was undertaken to get the details of the bike. The cops then found the bike which had used the internal roads of Sectors 12 and 13. Based on the information derived from further probe, the four including the minor were rounded up. The accused have been named as Manav Pawar and Ashish Solanki; two others have been identified only as Ghyanshyam and Kanani. The four admitted that they had killed Bhatiya and had taken his handsfree and money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/murder-for-handsfree-long-arm-of-law-grabs-killers/articleshow/87002828.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||All eyes on Centre’s new paddy purchase plan||HYDERABAD: While the state government is aggressively encouraging farmers to grow crops other than paddy, clarity on how much they will need to shift to other crops will not emerge until the Centre comes up with its new paddy purchase plan. According to well-placed sources, after CM K Chandrasekhar Rao pursued the matter of FCI’s decision to procure limited quantity of paddy, states like Punjab also represented the matter with the Centre. A high-level committee was formed with Union ministers as members. The committee, led by home minister Amit Shah, will decide how much the Food Corporation of India (FCI) will procure from each state and inform the same to them. Sources said the committee will meet soon to take a call on paddy procurement. Government officials said the state requires approximately 90 lakh tonnes of paddy for domestic consumption, with the remainder being exported or sold in other states. During Yasangi and Vanakalam seasons, the state produced more than one crore tonnes of paddy. During the discussions for rabi season paddy procurement, the FCI has informed the state government that it will extend the procurement period once the physical verification of paddy is done. Paddy procurement is normally concluded by September 30. The state government urged the FCI to provide a timeframe for completing the purchases by May next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/all-eyes-on-centres-new-paddy-purchase-plan/articleshow/87005020.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Legal teams help people fight for justice||Hyderabad: Breaking the shackles of ignorance and darkness that formed the core of the stranglehold village elders have over the vulnerable sections in villages, scores of legal teams are now touring villages in the erstwhile Karimnagar district, educating them about what they should do when they suffer or come across injustice on account of the judgments of these elders. They are giving villagers toll-free numbers for providing succour to women in crisis, children, disabled, the old and other vulnerable sections. “Complain to police or inform us when you see a rape victim silenced by these elders with meagre compensation. Invoke the Pocso Act when you notice sexual abuse of minors. Invoke the law when the old and disabled are not given their due ,” these are some of the messages they are delivering to villagers. This was part of the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav and a call from the legal services authorities at the national and state levels, who urged the state to take up legal outreach programmes. What has made the programme more appealing was the direction given by M G Priyadarshini, principal district and sessions judge of Karimnagar district, asking legal teams to concentrate on social evils, which were weakening society. 70 teams were formed with 196 judicial officers, para-legal volunteers, and activists, and they were fanned out into Karimnagar, Jagtial, Peddapalli, and Sircilla. “We will invoke it for you, just call us,” they said in a message.“The amount of awareness must be sustained by continuous follow-up. If it is deserted after Amrit Mahotsav, then the law may lose grip ,” a volunteer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/legal-teams-help-people-fight-for-justice/articleshow/87005078.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan Congress turmoil to crop up on CWC sidelines as CM Ashok Gehlot likely to attend||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot is likely to go to New Delhi to attend the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting scheduled on October 16. The chief minister’s official programme is yet to be declared but Congressmen in Rajasthan are already speculating the outcome of his visit on the state politics. Since Gehlot would be visiting Delhi after a gap of seven months and at a time when his inhouse competitor Sachin Pilot has been stepping up pressure for changes in the state government, the Congress central leadership is expected to use the opportunity to discuss Rajasthan’s political issues with the CM. Gehlot’s meeting with the Congress top brass that is long overdue was cancelled in the past owing to his ill health. Pilot is in Delhi since Tuesday evening, but will return to Jaipur before October 16 as he is not the CWC member. Last month, Gehlot’s cabinet colleague Harish Chaudhary, who is AICC observer in Punjab where too the Congress is battling internal strife, told the media in Jaipur that the day Gehlot’s plane lands in Delhi the party men can expect a cabinet rejig in Rajasthan. Pilot has been demanding cabinet expansion and reshuffle as well as state-level political appointments since August last year but, party sources said, now he is unlikely to settle for anything less than the CM’s post for himself. “To make a credible difference in governance so that the Congress government gets repeated, Pilot would need to present at least two state budgets before the next assembly election in 2023,” said a PCC office-bearer closely following the Gehlot-Pilot tug of war for power. Loyalists from the Gehlot camp are equally confident of a status quo at the top post in the state. “At the most, a cabinet rejig may take place after this meeting. This would be because two more cabinet vacancies may be created in the near future. But a change of CM is out of the question,” a minister, who did not wish to be quoted, said. Early this month, Gehlot publicly declared that his government would complete the full five-year term and alluded that he would be CM for the 4th term after Congress retains power in the 2023 state elections. The CWC, which is the party’s highest decision-making body, has been called to discuss the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, farmers’ issues as well as the 23 Congress senior leaders’ demand for an organisational overhaul. On the meeting sidelines, the Congress central leadership would want to engage with senior leaders from partyruled states like Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan facing demands of a leadership change at the local level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-cong-turmoil-to-crop-up-on-cwc-sidelines-as-gehlot-likely-to-attend/articleshow/87005083.cms||Bhanupratap Singh

Initial police investigations revealed that a group of unidentified assailants had entered the house of Bajrang Bahadur late on Tuesday night and hearing uneasy sounds, the house owner woke up and raised an alarm. The assailants first left the house owner critically wounded and further attacked his wife and daughter when they rushed to save the man. The assailants had attacked the woman and her daughter with sharp-edged weapons and escaped with booty. Villagers told police that the incident came to fore at around 6:30 am when the grand-daughter came out from the house and approached them. When the villagers entered the house, they spotted the bodies of the mother and daughter while the house owner was alive. The police teams searched the house and spotted a pair of shoes and a wooden article with blood stains from the back of the house. Police said that the son of the critically injured house owner had committed suicide a couple of years back. Following which, the son's wife had gone somewhere after leaving their minor daughter at the house of grand-parents. Industrial Area chouki in-charge Manoj Kumar said several teams of police have been pressed into action and the case will be cracked soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/woman-daughter-murdered-in-trans-yamuna-locality/articleshow/87005072.cms||---

The woman on October 9 had dialled 112 and informed police that constable was her husband and he had been forcing her to leave the house after having affairs with other women. When police team checked the facts and woman’s credentials, the woman was not found on the given address. The woman on October 12 (Tuesday) again called up the constable and sought money threatening that she would fabricate false charges against him. The constable later asked the woman to come at Patti area to receive money but woman insisted him to come at Udhaiyadeeh bazar to give the money. A police team, meanwhile, cordoned the area and managed to catch the woman red handed. When police quizzed the woman, she confessed that she along with two of her accomplices, was involved in extorting money from youths on the pretext of threatening to fabricate false charges if yhey failed to give her money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/woman-held-for-making-abortive-bid-to-extort-rs-2l-from-cop/articleshow/87005079.cms||---

The year-long study on 871 Covid-affected pregnant women at the hospital recorded nine maternal deaths. This translates to 1.03% mortalities among the women studied. “The good news is that all the three babies we had to deliver early survived. Nearly 70-75% pregnant women admitted during the second wave were asymptomatic to mildly infected, while 5-7% were with severe infection. The rest were moderately symptomatic. Those who had a severe infection and succumbed had reported late to the hospital. Early treatment is prime to improve outcomes,” Dr Mahesh Asalkar, lead researcher and head of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology, YCMH , told TOI. The study also stated that none of the 871 patients admitted to the hospital had received any vaccine against Covid when the research was being undertaken. “Vaccinating pregnant women can thus improve outcomes,” he said. Dr Asalkar said out of the nine deaths recorded, five were noted in the third trimester of pregnancy. “Pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, may be a high-risk factor and can cause poor maternal outcomes in case Covid-19 is present. Out of the five cases in the third trimester, three were delivered by Cesarean. Two were preterm, and could not be delivered as this decision was not taken by the respective families,” he said. Three of the four (out of the nine mortality cases) were in early pregnancy, hence delivery was not indicated. The fourth case was extra-uterine pregnancy. Dr Asalkar said the neonatal outcome was good, and the three babies were negative for Covid-19 and discharged. He said early delivery of the baby (around eight to nine months of pregnancy) was justified in critical illness “as it helps the mother to recover faster, because it reduces her body’s oxygen demand”. The study, however, showed that pregnant women with symptoms were at a higher mortality risk, so such groups should be continuously monitored. Dr Asalkar said results from two large Covid-19 pregnancy registries in the past — the PAN Covid registry (in the UK and 10 other countries) and the AAP-SONPM (American Academy of Paediatrics-Section on Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine) registry — had found maternal mortality in three of 651 women with Covid (0.46%) and five of 2,398 women (0.21%) with the infection, respectively. “Though our study had higher prevalence (1.03%) of mortality as compared to that mentioned in these two registries, we would still say the mortality percentage is small,” he said. YCMH was declared as a dedicated Covid hospital and during the pandemic, its department of obstetrics and gynaecology not only provided health services to the coronavirus-positive pregnant women but also kept records of all cases till date since the beginning ofthe pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maternal-death-rate-among-covid-ve-women-low-study/articleshow/87005050.cms||Neha Madaan

His claims are wrong,” Somaiya told a news conference. “The income tax raids were carried out on the premises linked to family members of Ajit Pawar because they are appearing to be owners of the sugar mill,” he said. Despite repeated attempts by TOI, Ajit Pawar could not be reached for his comment on Somaiya’s allegation. His officer on special duty (OSD), Anil Dhikale, told TOI, “The deputy chief minister is busy with back-to-back meetings, including that of the state Cabinet, on Wednesday. If any official statement is to be issued, it will be shared at an appropriate time.” Somaiya said said 90.5 % share of the sugar mil “are with a private firm”. He said, “The income tax raids, going on for the last seven days on the premises of Ajit Pawar’s relatives, are one of biggest raids in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/i-t-raids-not-politically-motivated-somaiya/articleshow/87005139.cms||---

Over 14,000 TRS leaders and members from across the state will attend the meeting. Announcing this at a press conference on Wednesday, TRS working president KT Rama Rao said the party president’s election takes place every two years as per the party bylaws. It is also a tradition to hold the party plenary on April 27 every year to celebrate the party’s founding day. However, due to the Lok Sabha elections and Covid-19 pandemic neither of them could be held for the past few years, he said. “At the moment, the severity of the pandemic in Telangana is much lower than in other states. Vaccination is also being widely implemented and the state could attain 100% vaccination within two months. As a result, we’ve agreed to hold the party’s plenary on October 25,” he said. M Sreenivas Reddy, former MLC, would serve as the returning officer for the election with Paryada Krishnamurthy as supervising officer. The resolutions committee will be chaired by former speaker S Madhusudhana Chary.  TRS working president KT Rama Rao said the party will honour the two-decade anniversary in Warangal by holding ‘Telangana Vijaya Garjana’ meeting on November 15. Lakhs of TRS activists and leaders from every corner of the state will take part in the garjana meeting. KTR, however, dodged a question on the Huzurabad by-election saying “it was a minor affair.” He said since campaigning was going on, there was nothing to discuss. He brushed aside a question on the Krishna River Management Board taking over irrigation projects from October 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-set-to-elect-party-chief-at-oct-25-plenary/articleshow/87002908.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Ahmedabad||Mehendi Pethani filed complaint against Sachin Dixit over hidden marriage||AHMEDABAD: Mehendi Pethani, murdered by her live-in partner Sachin Dixit, had made a nearly hour-long call to a helpline to discuss the despair that Dixit was stoking in her. She had also filed a police complaint saying he had cheated her by not revealing that he was a married man. Police said on Wednesday that Pethani had sought advice from the Jeevan Aastha helpline on November 1, 2019. Around that period, she had filed the complaint of cheating against Dixit at the women’s police station in Shahibaug. However, the application was withdrawn after both parties worked out a compromise. Abhay Chudasama, the IGP of the Gandhinagar range, told mediapersons that Pethani had reached out to the Jeevan Aastha helpline of the Gandhinagar District Police. He said she had told the counsellor that she was afraid of her boyfriend, Dixit. Pethani also informed the counsellor that she had left her husband because of some issues. It is not clear at this stage if she had divorced her husband. Chudasama said that the call to the helpline lasted 54 minutes. He said the counsellor had advised Pethani to cut off contact with Dixit. The counsellor told her to stay firm if she was feeling threatened by Dixit. Pethani was also advised to contact her estranged husband and resolve the problems. Pethani was told to consider reuniting with her husband. As for the cheating complaint, Chudasama said that both the families were called for a meeting in which Pethani and Dixit were present. A settlement was reached. The cops involved in the investigation said Dixit’s family claims that it was not aware of his relationship with Pethani. The cops said, however, that may not be entirely accurate. They cited the statement of Aradhana, Dixit’s wife, that she suspected he was having an extramarital affair. She has told the cops that she had no knowledge of Dixit having a baby with another woman. The boy is now about 10 months old. Aradhana has also told the cops that in 2019, she and Dixit had a heated argument over his affair. Aradhana stays with Dixit’s parents in Sector 26 of Gandhinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mehendi-filed-plaint-against-dixit-over-hidden-marriage/articleshow/87002886.cms||---
---||Pune||Covid-19: ‘Most Pune patients treated with molnupiravir recovered in 5 days’||PUNE: Covid patients in Pune treated with molnupiravir, an antiviral oral pill, recovered within five days of symptom onset, a small trial of the investigational drug at Dr DY Patil Medical College and Hospital has revealed. Medical experts have, however, emphasized on robust studies before arriving at any conclusion. “By recovery, we mean those treated with molnupiravir showed a rapid decline in blood inflammatory markers and viral load (CT value) than those treated with standard Covid treatment,” hospital’s trial researcher Shalaka Agarkhedkar told TOI. She said the molnupiravir group tested negative for the virus within five days whereas the group not treated with the new drug took 10-14 days for full recovery. The Pune trial site is part of the multicentric trial of 31 hospitals across the country involving 348 Covid patients where generic molnupiravir is currently being tried and assessed. The trial is still under way at most of these centres. “The Hyderbad-based Natco Pharma, which is spearheading the trial, is currently doing interim analysis of 348 Covid patients, including Pune findings. The company will submit the data to the Drug Controller General of India in a few days. Currently, the trial sites across the country have stopped new recruitments as the findings so far have been very promising,” Shalaka said. Pune study, ready with its interim findings, comprised 18 moderately ill Covid patients who were treated on an outpatient-department basis and followed up with blood investigations and RT-PCR tests at regular intervals for 15 days from May 31, 2021. The enrolled patients were divided into two groups. “Each group had nine patients whose blood oxygen saturation was below or equal to 92. They were also found to have inflammatory markers, including D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels that are indicative of patients chances to progress to severe disease,” Shalaka said. Infectious disease expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the National Covid Task Force, said, “We need robust studies to confirm these findings. It could be a potential game-changer drug when used in right patients.” Using the active pharmaceutical ingredient, Natco Pharma, after due permissions, initiated the advanced phase 3 trials for the generic version of the international drug firm Merck’s experimental molnupiravir in May this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/most-pune-patients-treated-with-molnupiravir-recovered-in-5-days/articleshow/87005080.cms||Umesh Isalkar

According to the disability commissioner’s office, the state currently has around 35 lakh persons with disabilities; the 2011 Census pegged the number at 29 lakh. Health officials said 22,901 persons with disabilities have been vaccinated so far as per rough estimates, but the tally will have to be cross-checked with the disability commissioner officer. “Maharashtra’s differently-abled population is 2.5% of the total population, which would have increased to 3.5%. We feel that the number of vaccinated persons is much higher than what is estimated by state public health officials,” said disability commissioner Omprakash Deshmukh. He said the numbers are being verified so that the administration can reach more people. Deshmukh said the real figures are not known as the CoWIN application does not have a category for persons with disabilities and neither has any record been maintained since the vaccination drive began in January. “After the Centre’s directive, many persons with disabilities who were able to reach the vaccination centres were given preference. However, there are many who are unable to reach vaccine centres and vaccination at home must be ensure in such cases,” he said. Activist Rafiq Khan, who works for the welfare of persons with disabilities, told TOI that with no official figures, there can only be estimates. “We have several groups across the state and most people who have been unable to reach vaccination centres have been left out,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/just-20k-of-35l-with-disabilities-vaccinated/articleshow/87005125.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Delhi: ‘False claims strike blow at rule of law’||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has imposed a cost of Rs 2 lakh on a man for filing a property dispute case allegedly based on false and frivolous grounds. The court said it would be a public disaster if “the fountain of justice is allowed to be poisoned” by falsehoods. Additional senior civil judge Kishor Kumar further said such filing of false claims in courts was akin to assailing the rule of law and no court could ignore such conduct by petitioners because it had a tendency to shake public confidence in the judicial institution and put the very structure of an ordered life at stake. “It would be a great public disaster if the fountain of justice is allowed to be poisoned by anyone resorting to filing false claims. The courts of law are meant for imparting justice between the parties. One who comes to the court, must come with clean hands,” the court said in the order. “More often than not, the process of the court is being abused. A person whose case is based on a false suit has no right to approach the court. He can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation.” The litigant had filed a suit claiming that his father had used joint family funds to purchase four properties that, he claimed, had been orally partitioned upon his death. The litigant asserted that the suit property fell in his share. He further claimed that a property in Moti Nagar was transferred to his mother and it was agreed that after her death, it would devolve in his name exclusively. Despite this knowledge, his plaint stated, in 2017, his brother allegedly refused to vacate the property after the death of their mother. A year later, he said, he also learnt that his brother was trying to get the property transferred to his name using false documents. The court said the plaintiff and his counsel had, without any fear and in order to “impure the stream of justice”, openly submitted false facts here and there as per their convenience. “Such a practice requires iron-hand handling,” the court added. “Counsel for the plaintiff has been successful in keeping the case lingering on the pretext of getting it settled though he very well knew that the case of the plaintiff as drafted and filed in the court is false and frivolous.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/false-claims-strike-blow-at-rule-of-law/articleshow/87005128.cms||Usha Das

Most of the unvaccinated in rural areas are farmers or farm workers, who are busy with their work on the fields. Our health staff visits them on their fields and vaccinates them with due precautions and care. We have also started evening vaccination for villagers who are unable to show up at vaccination centres during the day,” said Sanjay Deshmukh, the assistant director of health services in the Pune region. Over 70,000 Asha workers are involved in various healthcare activities. “Each one of these Asha workers is given the responsibility of a population comprising 1,000 people. We have told them to find out which residents in their assigned population have not received a single shot yet and those who have not taken the second dose. They identify and inform the health staff, who then visit these people at their farms/homes and vaccinate them,” Deshmukh said. This door-to-door vaccination has already begun in Pune, Satara and Solapur in a big way. “As per the Centre’s Census records, Pune district has 83.42 lakh eligible population above 18 years of age.

Total fines worth around Rs 1.75 lakh have been collected from such offenders over several weeks. “Stagnated water in the premises of such people has led to rampant breeding of mosquitoes. This has ultimately caused dengue for many. So, we have charged them a fine and have also issued warnings to all,” said Sanjeev Wavare, a senior official of PMC’s health department. As per PMC data, in the course of the crackdown, a range of fines were charged, based on the number of sites and breeding spots at any given location. The drive was undertaken over around a month’s time, and tackled both residential as well as commercial properties. Most mosquito breeding spots were found in scrap tyres and abandoned vehicles, open tanks, flower pots, terraces, bathrooms, kitchens of eateries, garages, under-construction sites, and various marketplaces. “Dengue cases were found at 400 places, but only breeding spots were seen at other locations. We have charged fines as a warning to the citizens involved. They should take precautionary measures to avoid mosquito breeding on their premises,” added Wavare.

---||Mumbai||They have learnt their lesson, don’t deny bail: Aryan Khan’s lawyer||MUMBAI: Aryan Khan’s lead counsel Amit Desai said on Wednesday that Section 27A is the only offence for illicit trafficking under the Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), and NCB rightly never invoked it against Aryan as it has no case. Aryan was arrested only for alleged consumption of small quantities, with no recovery of drugs or money from him and hence no case of use, sale or purchase of any drugs, and he was not arrested even for abetment or conspiracy, Desai said. He added that even consumption there is no proof of, as it was his friend Arbaaz Merchant who in the NCB panchanama of October 2 is recorded as speaking of having consumed charas. Opposing the bail pleas of Khan, Arbaaz and Munmun Dhamecha, the NCB said, “There is sufficient material in the form of WhatsApp chats, pictures, etc to show Aryan was an active part of illicit drug chain with other co-accused, hence abetment and conspiracy apply and so do the rigours of not granting bail under NDPS Act.” ASG Anil Singh, with Advait Sethna, special public prosecutor for the agency, said, “NCB has material to show Khan was in touch with some persons abroad who appear to be a part of an international drug network for illicit procurement of drugs, and investigation is on to find the person.” Aryan ought to be granted bail as maximum punishment attracted is a year’s imprisonment, said Desai, who appeared with Satish Maneshinde at the physical hearing before the special NDPS judge at sessions court, V V Patil. He pointed how NDPS Act was amended with reformative steps to reduce punishment for consumption and said “they are not peddlers, racketeers or drug traffickers”. “India was a signatory last December to the UN move to remove cannabis from the list banning research into its medical use. In many countries these substances are legal. Let us not penalise the youngsters. Let us not make it worse for them. They have suffered enough. They have been in custody since October 3. They have learnt their lesson. Let us not keep them behind bars and deny them bail,” said Desai. The heart of the NCB case is that all accused are “inextricably connected” with each other in a conspiracy and that Khan used to purchase charas from Merchant. Desai said NCB has made the allegation of an international drug chain, but where is the question of any connection of Aryan with the other accused or of a conspiracy, he asked  NCB uses “a very frightening term” like illicit trafficking and “just dumps it on Aryan Khan,” said Desai. Advocate Taraq Sayed for Merchant argued that even if NCB is right in saying 6gm charas was recovered from him, it is a small quantity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-they-have-learnt-their-lesson-dont-deny-bailsays-aryans-lawyer/articleshow/87005261.cms||Swati Deshpande

All the northern districts, including Palakkad, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod are on orange alert for very heavy rainfall of 12-20cm. Central districts of Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki and Thrissur are on yellow alert for isolated, heavy rainfall of 7-11cm. Kerala has received heavy rains this month till date unlike any of the traditional southwest monsoon months. From October 1-13, the state has received 123% excess rains with the highest of 253% large excess recorded in Kozhikode.  Other districts that received large excess rainfall this month included Kannur (198%), Kasaragod (191%) Palakkad (177%), Malappuram (168%) and Pathanamthitta (165%. Several of the irrigation dams are more than 90% full. These include Vazhani (98%), Peechi (96%), Chimoni (96%), Chulliyar (95%), Neyyar (92%), Meenkara (90%), Siruvani (For TN use- 89%), Mangalam (88%), Kallada (87%), Kanjirapuzha (86%), Malankara (75%), Kuttiyadi (71%). The barrages include Karapuzha, Maniyar, Bhoothathankettu, Moolathara and Pazhassi where water is being released. On Wednesday, the maximum rainfall received was 10cm at Thaliparamba & Cheruthazham. Kannur, Hosdurg, Vellarikkundu, Mattannur and Panniyoor received 9cm rainfall while Kudulu and Kakkayam received 8cm rains.  IMD said that the cyclonic circulation over east central Arabian Sea is very likely to persist during next two days and an east-west trough runs from cyclonic circulation over east central Bay of Bengal to cyclonic circulation over east central Arabian Sea.  Its influence is causing the excess rainfall over Kerala which will bring rain for four-five days. Skymet Weather said that the southwest monsoon has barely withdrawn from north and central India. The wet spell over these parts will be the quickest and with the shortest possible break. Month of October invariably remains dry over north India after the retreat of monsoon.  The deviation from the norm may also bring rapid change over of weather conditions, setting pace for early winter over the plains of north India. Malampuzha dam to be opened: The shutters of Malampuzha and Chulliyar dams will be opened as heavy rain continued in the catchment areas and the water level crossing the danger mark on Wednesday. Executive engineer of Malampuzha irrigation project said a warning has been issued to people living on river banks following the decision to open the shutters as the water level crossed 113.78m.

---||Pune||Court finalises Narendra Dabholkar case trial schedule from October 29||PUNE: Special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi on Wednesday submitted a list of 32 witnesses to a special UAPA court for examination during the trial in the August 20, 2013, murder of veteran rationalist Narendra Dabholkar. The trial is to commence from October 29 as per an initial programme for two months finalised by the court. Special judge SR Navander, hearing the case, was expected to pass an order on whether to hold the trial from a dedicated facility inside the Yerawada jail or from the Ashoka hall at the district and sessions court premises in view of the crowding concern. The judge, however, told the representing lawyers that the Ashoka hall did not seem to be a feasible option. The trial can begin with examination of formal witnesses from the existing courtroom in the old building with restricted attendance of people, lawyers and the media. On October 29, the court will start with the examination of an inquest panchanama witness, followed by another witness who accompanied the police party during a search of the flat where Dabholkar would stay during his visits to Pune. Subsequent trial proceedings have been fixed for November 13, 20 and 27, besides, December 4, 11, 18 and 19. After the court proceedings on Wednesday, Suryavanshi told TOI , “Our list contains names of some very important witnesses, including eye witnesses, but we won’t elaborate any further at this stage as to who they are.” Prime accused and ‘Sanatan Sanstha activist’ Virendrasinh Tawde, besides Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar — the two men accused of opening fire at Dabholkar, were produced via videoconferencing mode from the Yerawada central jail. Another accused Vikram Bhave, who is out on bail granted by the high court, was physically present before the court, while the fifth accused Sanjiv Punalekar, a Mumbai lawyer, secured exemption from hearing. Defence lawyer Suvarna Avhad submitted that the accused have still not received a CD of Dabholkar’s postmortem procedure. Similarly, they haven’t yet received the x-ray plates and photos of the dead body. She said the defence had already applied for these documents. Suryavanshi brought to the court’s notice that the case was initially investigated by the Pune police before the Central Bureau Investigation took it over in May 2014. “We will verify which agency is in possession of these documents and make a statement accordingly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/court-finalises-dabholkar-case-trial-schedule-from-october-29/articleshow/87005248.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The accused, Dinesh Keshwani, persuaded businessman Mussadik Shabbir Ahmed, also a resident of Bandra, to invest in shares by promising him high returns on his hard-earned money and later diverted the funds into their personal accounts, police said. The Economic Offences Wing of Mumbai Police on Monday arrested Keshwani, and booked him under IPC sections for cheating, forgery, breach of trust and under section 120 B for criminal conspiracy.

---||Pune||Pune police issue lookout notice for Kiran Gosavi||PUNE: The city police on Wednesday issued a lookout notice for Kiran Gosavi, who is wanted in a Rs 3.09 lakh cheating case registered in 2018 in the Faraskhana area. Gosavi is one of the two private persons at the centre of a row for their role in the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) cruise drug case involving actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan Khan. Gosavi had hit the headlines for posting a selfie with Aryan Khan at the NCB office after the latter was brought there. The NCB has described him as an “independent witness” in the cruise drug case. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI, “Deputy commissioner of police (Zone 1) Priyanaka Narnavare has issued the lookout notice against Gosavi to prevent him from leaving India, as he is wanted in a criminal case here. The police have filed a charghesheet against Gosavi, but he continues to evade arrest and his whereabouts are not known since the FIR was registered.” Gupta said, “We have been constantly making efforts to trace Gosavi. We conducted searches at various places on the basis of inputs received by the police. But he is constantly changing his hideouts. We have received information that Gosavi has suddenly become active on social media and is seen here and there. Hence, the lookout notice is issued.” DCP Narnavare told TOI, “After spotting Gosavi on news channels, the Faraskhana police officers visited his Thane residence. But he was not found there. We have issued the lookout notice, which is addressed to the Bureau of Immigration, New Delhi. The notice requests the bureau not to allow Gosavi to move out of the country, as we want him in a cheating case here.” Chinmay Deshmukh, a young job-seeker from Kasba Peth, had lodged the case against Gosavi on May 29, 2018. After futile searches in Thane and Mumbai, the Faraskhana police in August 2018 filed a chargesheet against Gosavi in court under Section 299 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) which refers to record of evidence in absence of the accused. According to the 2018 FIR, Thane resident Gosavi was then running a firm — KPG Dreamz Solutions — at Ghatkopar in Mumbai. Complainant Deshmukh then came across an online advertisement on a social networking site stating that the company was providing jobs to young talented people in the hotel industry in Malaysia. Deshmukh then contacted the company. The company officials told him to send his bio-data and later took his passport and other details. They also told him to deposit fees of Rs3.09 lakh, including the air ticket charges. Deshmukh deposited the money and the company told him to come to Mumbai airport for flying out to Malaysia. However, no one turned up at the airport. Deshmukh tried to call the company officials, but no one responded. He then realized that he was cheated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-police-issue-lookout-notice-for-kiran-gosavi/articleshow/87005250.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Pandals follow Covid protocols, allow entry to members only||PUNE: Some Durga Puja committees have shifted their usual Puja venues elsewhere to avoid crowding and ensure strict adherence to Covid protocols. Nandanik Sanstha, known to draw large crowds at Rohi Villa, has relocated to Raga Lawns, Mundhwa. Entry is allowed only to members who have to wear mandatory masks and follow social distancing while taking darshan. “We have about 150 members, all of whom are fully vaccinated and have been given identity cards for entry. They can come along with their families. We usually bring in artists from Kolkata to play the dhol (drum), but it has not been possible this time. We are playing it digitally, so the ladies can perform the dhunuchi naach (dancing with incense burner). Everyone needs to be seated while taking darshan to avoid crowding, and only a maximum of 50 people are allowed on the premises at any given time. The members are getting numerous calls from acquaintances inquiring about the Puja, but we have had to turn down most. We are issuing entry passes, with date and time affixed, valid for an hour only,” said Gautam Banerjee, president, Nandanik Sanstha. Supriya Banerjee, vice-president, Nandanik Sanstha, added, “This year we will not have the traditional Sindoor Khela, where married women smear each otherwith vermillion and offer sweets to each other. Instead, we will line up to apply vermillion on the idol.” The Durga Puja being organised at Mauli Garden, Baner, is also strictly members-only event. Deepankar Basu, advisor, Bengali Association Pune, said, “We are strict about entry and those whose names are not in the list are turned away. If someone has been coming regularly to our Puja and want to attend it this year too, we are encouraging him/her to become members. New memberships are also being issued at the venue.” The crowd-puller festival organised by Bangiya Sankriti Samsad at Congress Bhavan has shifted to a private property on Bhosale Nagar. “Though everyone can watch the aarti online, only members are allowed entry. Throwing of flowers during pushpanjali is not allowed, and it is mandatory to wear masks on the premises. We do not have any food stalls and the bhog is also limited to our members, who can eat it at home as we have prohibited eating or distribution of any kind of prasad or bhog on the premises,” said Madhumita Ghosh, vice-president, cultural, Bangiya Sankriti Samsad. Durga Puja celebration also coincides with Navaratri, which involves worshipping different forms of Goddess Durga. Marwari tradition Natasha Agarwal, a resident of Kharadi, said the Marwari tradition has two main festivals. “One is Navaratri, and the other is Diwali. While it is mostly about food, moongphali ki kadi (kadhi with peanuts), kuttu ki poori, aloo puri, samachawal, we have a grand ritual called Kanya Puja in which we invite nine girls and serve them the same food we offer to the goddess. We give them gifts and take their blessings by touching their feet,” she said. Ramya Yalana, resident of Pimpri, said that in South Indian communities, the last three days are celebrated paying obeisance to GoddessSaraswati. “On these three days, we keep books and other education-related items at the feet of the deity. Dasara is an auspicious day to start learning something new. Parents start teaching their young children how to write on this day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pandals-follow-covid-protocols-allow-entry-to-members-only/articleshow/87005321.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

In the first phase, 16,451 out of the 21,054 households have started getting tap drinking water, which is 78% of the target. In the phase II, 6,422 (94%) of the targeted 6,716 households have started receiving water. BUIDCO executive engineer Kapil Deo Prasad said the cost of the project was around Rs155 crore. He said 14 borewells were already constructed. However, three projects under AMRUT in Katihar have been facing hurdles because of the non-availability of suitable land for the purpose. These are at Laliyahi, Industrial Area and Gami Tola. Marshy land and waterlogging are creating problems in constructing overhead tanks for the storage of water and its supply to the town households. Even treating water before making it fit for drinking is a challenging task for the urban development department’s officials in Katihar because the region has high content of iron in water. Assistant engineer at BUIDCO, Pankaj Kumar, said, “The level of iron in the water is 8PPM. It is with the help of pressure filtration technology that we bring down the iron content to 0.3PPM. We appeal to every household to avail piped water supply, because it is free of cost and the treated water is healthy for consumption.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tap-water-supply-work-in-katihar-in-full-swing/articleshow/87000724.cms||---

The bils will be audited in one month and a committee of public health officials and members from civil societywill follow up with recovery and reimbursement. The complaints which emerged in the survey carried out by Jan Arogya Abhiyan (JAA) and Corona Ekal Mahila Punarvasan Samiti , and by individuals. Abhay Shukla from JAA said,“This is just not our survey but also of other cases and this intervention would surely help as collectors and public health officials to coordinate with the nodal officer. A committee is to be formed with representatives from the civil society will definitely help,” he told TOI. Anand Phadke added that their survey showed that patients were overcharged and many were not even given bills. CEMPS representative Heramb Kulkarni added that they had surveyed 2,579 patients of whom most were admitted to the private sector. “They had been overcharged in the range from Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh. This intervention will help as district collectors and commissioners are supposed to keep a track of these issues,” he added.  Representatives from the hospital sector said necessary auditing is carried out before discharging the patient with many following self-regulatory mechanism on charges. Sanjay Patil, chairman of Hospital Board of India, Pune said that the capping charges did not consider the input cost and also did not take into confidence all the stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/overcharging-complaints-surface-audit-of-2500-bills-in-one-month/articleshow/87005319.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: For Rs 2,000 crore road works, netas seek audits, listed companies||MUMBAI: Resistance and a slew of questions over the Rs 2,000-crore-plus road repair work tenders invited by the BMC continue to arise in political circles. Opposition party leader Ravi Raja said that unless stringent auditing is done at every stage of the repair works, the city would get the same poor quality works. Raja said that while the BMC is promising to start works soon, it seems unlikely that the promise will be kept. TimesViewIt is a shame that the BMC, India’s richest municipal corporation, cannot properly maintain and repair its vast network of roads. The thousands of crores allotted for new roads over the years seem to have been sucked into a dark hole. Corporators from all parties must sit together and fix this issue.“The BMC is unlikely to finalize a contractor by December, which is the year end and the code of conduct for the upcoming civic elections is likely to come into force by January 2022, which means civic staff will get busy with it. Once elections and formalities following it are completed, the monsoons 2022 will arrive, when no work can be done. This means actual work on the ground may begin only next year post rains,” he said. BJP MLA Ameet Satam in a letter sent to the BMC commissioner on Wednesday said that as per an RTI he had filed the BMC has spent more than Rs 21,000 crore in the last 24 years on making city roads but unfortunately the city continues to stay famous for its bad roads. “I would hence like you to put a condition that only listed (in BSE and NSE) infrastructure companies should be allowed to bid for Mumbai city roads,” said Satam, also requesting that the BMC needs to incorporate a condition of utility corridor on each road. On Wednesday, even the MNS had come out objecting to the road repair works and party leader Sandeep Deshpande said that while citizens are hopeful that they will get good roads with the BMC having invited tenders of such large amounts, it looks unlikely that the hopes of the people will be met. “It appears that the same contractors who were blacklisted for shoddy repair works will get entry into the system. This will lead to the city again getting sub-standard quality roads and potholes to develop in no time,” he said, adding that the 227 corporators should raise their voice against this. The MNS has only one corporator in the BMC currently. The BMC over the past week invited tenders close to Rs 1,000 crore, inviting bidders for strengthening and improvement of various roads in cement-concrete and mastic asphalt. This includes around Rs 300 crore works in Mhada layout roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-for-rs-2000-crore-road-works-netas-seek-audits-listed-cos/articleshow/87005353.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||Delhi: With pandemic in lead role, dhakis miss the beat for another season||NEW DELHI: Durga Puja without the loud reverberations of the drumbeats seems a little less energetic than normal. But with the Covid-19 pandemic foiling full-scale celebrations, the dhakis — the drummers who yield their dhaks with gusto at Bengali events — aren’t out in full strength this year. Many have reached the city from West Bengal, but the demand for the dhakis is down, with most pujo pandals now content with one percussionist rather than the traditional four or five. Ananta Ghorai of West Medinipur is a fairly disheartened man. He said, “I have been coming to Delhi for eight years, always with the hope of earning more than we would back home. But the pandemic has affected us terribly. Usually we perform in groups of four or five, sometimes even bigger depending on the pandals and the scale of their organisation. But this year, the celebrations are lowkey and we aren’t needed.” Ananta, who came to Delhi with 50 other dhakis, normally earned around Rs 12,000 over five days. “Pujo is the annual event when we could expect good earnings,” said Ghorai, stationed at Durgotsab Greater Kailash II. “For the rest of the year, we fall back on the small farms we own.” Madhusudhan Ghorai, also from West Medinipur, added, “For three decades, I have been coming to Delhi during Durga Puja as part of a dhaki group. But Covid has changed things and our earnings have reduced sharply. The pandals are not having the usual dhaki performances.” The drummer at Chittaranjan Park’s D Block pandal said they were yet to recover losses they suffered due to the pandemic. “We have been trying to sustain ourselves from the basic farming that we do. But we suffered again because this year the farms were flooded after incessant rains,” mumbled Madhusudhan. “We get some support from the West Bengal government, but I have a family of eight to support. If Durga Puja isn’t celebrated fully, how will there be a demand for the dhakis?” For teenager Kartik Ghorai, it has been a miserable experience. He is grateful he has something to look forward to, having been contracted for a family Durga Puja celebration at a CR Park residence. He can now add a bit to his family’s wretched earnings in the Covid period. “For two years I have been playing the dhak myself after earlier accompanying the elders at the pandals. Back home, I juggle time between farming and studies,” said the 16-year-old. “Most of my family members are dhakis, but after the pandemic we hardly get called to play as a group. It’s mostly one individual per pandal with people cutting down on the grandness of the puja. So, our income is taking a big hit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-pandemic-in-lead-role-dhakis-miss-the-beat-for-another-season/articleshow/87005324.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

The revenue committee has written to AMC commissioner Mukesh Kumar requesting additional staff. The letter says that the number of properties in the city has risen from 12 lakh in 2001-02 to 22 lakh now, as the city limits were expanded twice, in 2006-07 and 2020-21. ‘At present there are approximately 140 ward inspectors and 30 divisional superintendents who are responsible for distributing property tax bills, tax collection and for processing applications and complaints,” the letter says. ‘In the present situation one ward inspector has to take care of two or three wards. The department needs one ward inspector to process every 5,000 entries and one divisional superintendent for every eight wards. By this calculation, the department requires 440 ward inspectors and 57 additional divisional superintendents,” the letter says. “Due to the staff crunch work on processing applications, bill distribution and tax collection is hampered which causes difficulties to tax payers. We have requested the commissioner to grant additional staff,” said Jainik Vakil, chairman of AMC’s revenue committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-revenue-dept-asks-for-more-staff/articleshow/87003071.cms||---

While the officials said they have yet to come across any evidence that suggests leopard movement, locals insist that it is indeed the wild cat that was spotted by some of them. This has triggered a sense of fear and panic in the locality. Local resident Mukesh Wadkar said, “The leopard killed a calf in a cattle-shed on October 10, but has not caused any harm to residents, other cattle and dogs. We suspect it sneaked into the city from jungles between Ramtekdi hills and Undri, or Mohammadwadi and Handewadi villages. The forest department holds huge tracts of land at these places.” He added, “On October 11 and 12, stray dogs were barking fiercely at night at Jadhavwadi and Tarawade vasti. On checking CCTV footage, residents spotted a leopard moving around. Its pugmarks were also found at various places.” Activist Jeevan Jadhav said, “CCTV footage shows that the leopard came from an open plot located between Angul and Sanket housing societies at Wadkarmala. Eyewitnesses have also seen the animal.” Pune range forest officer Mahesh Sanas told TOI, “We are still looking for conclusive evidence regarding leopard movement. It is difficult to make out from the black and white CCTV footage as to whether the animal seen is a leopard as it doesn’t seem so in size. We haven’t found any pugmarks yet and bite marks on the dead calf do not seem to be from a leopard.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/forest-officials-heighten-vigil-after-reports-of-leopard-sighting-from-mohammadwadi/articleshow/87005289.cms||Sandip Dighe

PWD minister P A Mohammed Riyas who chaired an online meeting on Wednesday to assess the situation in the district, asked the authorities to conduct a special drive to clean up the clogged drainages. The minister asked officials to complete the drive by October 18 and added that steps should be taken to permanently resolve the recurring water logging in the city. Directions were also issued to take steps to prevent recurring waterlogging at Moonalingal. Major road stretches in the heart of the city, including Mavoor Road, Stadium Junction, Rajaji Road etc had witnessed heavy waterlogging on Tuesday. Vehicular traffic was also affected at Moozhikkal and many other areas due to waterlogging on Tuesday. However, after the intense wet spell experienced by the Kozhikode and Malappuram districts on Tuesday, rains kept away from the two districts on Wednesday. In Kozhikode, 13 of the 15 relief camps which were set up on Tuesday were disbanded. There are only two relief camps left in the district with 22 inmates. However, with IMD issuing orange alert for Malabar districts on Thursday, district authorities have stepped up vigil and has initiated steps to deal with rain related emergencies.

---||Pune||Pune: Big dandiya events go quiet, but societies buzz with cheer||PUNE: Dandiya and garba are synonymous with Navaratra celebrations, specially for the large Gujarati community in the city. Even though the grand community celebrations stand cancelled due to the pandemic, Gujaratis have carried on the tradition of celebrations at home with their families or neighbours. Meeta Panchal, a resident of Pradhikaran, Nigdi, said, “We put on songs on the television and play dandiya with our daughters in the evenings. Sometimes, they dress up in traditional dress to indulge in the festive spirit. We had also visited my sister’s home in Ghansoli where we got to participate in a dandiya programme at a function organised in their housing society. On Dasara, the Gujarati tradition is to eat fafda (a savoury) and jalebi for breakfast. ” Vishal Ramaiya, from NIBM Road, said celebrations were within the family. “My mother brought back a packet of gathiya (a savoury) from Gujarat, which we will eat on Dasara morning along with jalebi,” he said. Some housing societies, with a large number of Gujarati residents, have organised private dandiya and garba functions within their premises for residents. Dhaval Thakkar, resident of Wagholi, said, “Our society has been organising daily functions on the premises to keep the residents engaged. After playing dandiya and garba, snacks are distributed to the participants in the evenings so we can get together in a small group. Fun games are also organised for children such as musical chairs, dance competitions, where they are given prizes.” Private functions for friends and families are also organised. Anand Dalal, from Aundh, said, “We organised a small get together at our home, after which there was a dinner and gifts for the guests. All the rituals aside, Navaratra is a time for family and friends to celebrate. We had catered to a spread of vegetarian food and special meals for those who were fasting.” Disappointed with the subdued buzz for Navaratra, Savita Yadav, from Kondhwa, has travelled to Gujarat. “I wanted to visit my sister in Maninagar, and what better time than during the biggest festival of the state. My husband and I wanted to experience the dandiya, garba, food and festivities in full swing,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/big-dandiya-events-go-quiet-but-societies-buzz-with-cheer/articleshow/87005338.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Goa||BJP hasn’t held discussions with MGP on alliance yet, says Devendra Fadnavis||PANAJI: Stating that BJP is self-reliant to fight elections, Goa BJP election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday said that BJP has never closed its doors for alliance with anyone. “We are not a party with closed doors,” Fadnavis said. Fadnavis was responding to a question on whether BJP has closed its doors for MGP to forge a pre-poll alliance. “We are yet to hold a political discussion (with MGP). When we will have a discussion, we will be able to speak (on the alliance) at that time,” Fadnavis said when asked about his meeting with MGP senior leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar in Mumbai. Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday had said that the alliance would be decided after discussions. A political observer said that BJP is facing anti-incumbency, and without pre-poll alliance with MGP it may have difficulties to sail smooth. “It is the need of the hour that BJP forges a pre-poll alliance,” political observer said. The meeting between Fadnavis and Dhavalikar has raised eyebrows in political circles. Questions are being raised as to whether BJP is looking to forge a pre-poll alliance with MGP. However, Dhavalikar said that given the present political situation he does not want any alliance with BJP. When asked if he met Fadnavis to discuss an alliance, Dhavalikar had said, “I-PAC’s Prashant Kishor met me, Congress Goa desk incharge Dinesh Gundu Rao met me. BJP functionaries meet me. I had a one-hour-long meeting with TMC’s I-PAC. I met all of them, and Fadnavis is one.” In 2007, when MGP joined BJP to topple the chief minister Digambar Kamat-led Congress government, MGP MLAs were disqualified. Later, in 2012, MGP had a pre-poll alliance with BJP and the alliance had won an absolute majority. However, after former chief minister Manohar Parrikar was elevated as defence minister, MGP had differences with then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar and was later dropped from the cabinet. In 2017, after the assembly election results, again MGP supported BJP to form the new coalition government under Parrikar’s leadership, but after his demise, chief minister Pramod Sawant split MGP. Out of the party’s three MGP MLAs, two joined BJP, and Dhavalikar was again dropped from the cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-hasnt-held-discussions-with-mgp-on-alliance-yet-says-fadnavis/articleshow/87005354.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Former BITian and MD of UK-based firm to perform rituals at London’s oldest Puja||Ranchi: The Bengali community at Camden in the United Kingdom has been celebrating Durgotsav in traditional Bengali style for more than 57 years. The oldest puja there is organised by the London Durgotsav Committee (LDC). This year, the rituals will be performed by an alumnus of BIT Mesra Amit Ghoshal who is the managing director of Espex batteries limited, a subsidiary of Exide Industries, India. Talking to TOI, Ghoshal said that he is not a professional purohit (priest), but was happy on being chosen as the chief priest by LDC. “The Durga pujo at Camden is the oldest in London and it was an honour to be given the responsibility of carrying out the rituals this time,” he said. The Camden pujo was started way back in 1963 by some Bengali families in UK who had roots in Kolkata. One of the members of the puja committee, Sumana Adak, said that with time, several committees started hosting Sharadiya Durgotsav in the UK. “As of date, 64 pujas are organised, but Camden being the oldest is well known and most popular among the Indian community,” she said. To follow the tradition, the idol was earlier taken from Kolkata every year to London and then brought back for immersion. But owing to the pandemic, the committee has decided to retain last year’s idol on which the pujo is being performed this year. Ghoshal said they will carry out the rituals for immersing the ‘ghatt’ but the idols would be retained this year too. The puja is organised at Swiss Scottish Library on the banks of Thames where the ritualistic immersion would be carried out. The attendance at the puja venues in UK has increased since last year due to Covid-related travel restrictions. “We would have missed our home festivities a lot if the ‘Sabekiani” (traditional) pujo was not there at Camden and a few more places,” Sumana said stressing that they want to remain connected with the family in India through media. The Camden Puja is home to around 400 Bengali families residing there. Recently the community at Edinburgh has also started organising Durga Puja for those residing in Scotland. Sumana said that last year it was done virtually due to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/former-bitian-and-md-of-uk-based-firm-to-perform-rituals-at-londons-oldest-puja/articleshow/87002444.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

It is an annual family get-together for us and we wait for the Puja every year. For the last two years, we started hiring artisans to make the idols.” Sumit Sahay, a local resident, “The Ghosh family Puja pandal is a crowd puller every year.

---||Ranchi||Durga Puja samitis in Steel City violate norms, distribute bhog||Jamshedpur: East Singbhum DC Suraj Kumar on Wednesday intervened and stopped bhog distribution mid-way at a puja pandal in Kashidih and asked the organisers to maintain the safety guidelines issued by government for Durga Puja. The state disaster management department (SDMA) had strictly prohibited the distribution of bhog and allowed for home delivery of bhog as a safety measure in view of Covid-19. However, at Thakur Pyara Singh Dhurandhar Singh Durga Puja samiti’s pandal, the puja organisers were found distributing bhog among the devotees when the DC, along with a few administrative officials and cops, reached there. “The puja samiti was distributing bhog, the tokens for which were issued before. Perhaps of some confusion bhog was being distributed among the devotees at that pandal, however, when we pointed out that they were violating the SDMA guideline, the puja samiti rectified it immediately and switched to home delivering the bhog,” Kumar said. Meanwhile, BJP leader Abhay Singh, who is convenor of the Thakur Pyara puja, came down heavily on the DC for ‘insulting’ the puja samiti for bhog distribution. He said, “Even if there was some issue with bhog distribution, any top administrative official could have informed me over the phone about it and I would have corrected it. Rushing in to the puja pandal in tow with the entire administration team and a police force just to stop bhog distribution is insulting to the samite. That’s just not done.” At Rankini temple in Kadma, Dhalbhum SDM Sandeep Kumar Meena pulled up the temple managment on seeing long queues of devotees that had arrived at the premises to collect bhog. The temple committee had sold 2,400 coupons for Rs 150 each for bhog distribution. Upon the direction of Meena, the temple committee withdrew the coupon scheme and returned the money to the people and agreed to go for home delivery of bhog. In a separate incident, the New Sidhgora Durga Puja Samiti was asked to remove the dome of the pandal after city SP Subhash Chandra Jat visited the pandal on Tuesday evening and found that the dome was not in compliance with the SDMA guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/durga-puja-samitis-in-steel-city-violate-norms-distribute-bhog/articleshow/87002541.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Union coal minister to meet Hemant on Wednesday amid countrywide coal crisis in power plants||Ranchi: Amid the continued shortage of coal stocks in thermal power stations across the country, Union coal minister Pralhad Joshi is due to meet chief minister Hemant Soren and push for the environmental and pollution clearances which can pave way for the expansion of several mega mining projects of Coal India Limited (CIL). Joshi is due to arrive in Ranchi on Thursday morning and meet Soren at the latter’s office in Project Building. He is also likely to travel to Central Coalfields Limited’s (CCL) Ashoka coal project in Piparwar before returning to the state capital in the evening. While Soren’s office remained unresponsive, CCL’s chairman-cum-managing director P M Prasad confirmed Joshi’s visit to Ranchi. “His visit to Ranchi was due for many weeks now,” Prasad said. Prasad, however, did not divulge further details about the scheduled meeting. Joshi had paid Soren a visit in July last year. During the meeting, Joshi had urged Soren to soften his government’s stance against the Centre’s decision to hold auctions for commercial mining in coal blocks. The state government had demanded Rs 8,226 crore from the Centre as a compensation for nearly 20,000 acres of land which was acquired by the CIL in Jharkhand for mining projects between 2009 and 2019. “During the high-level meetings which were held about the recent crisis of coal stocks in thermal power plants, it was decided that CIL needs to augment its production to meet the country’s energy needs. However, CIL’s big ticket projects such as the expansion of Magadh and Amrapali coal projects and the new projects such as Sanghamitra and Chandragupta open cast coal projects are being delayed due to the delay in obtaining environment and other clearances. The meeting can also focus on these areas,” a CIL official said on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, CIL’s subsidiaries in Jharkhand have ramped up their coal dispatch to its clientele in the power sector. On Tuesday, the CCL dispatched 39 railway rakes which ferried 1.18 lakh tonnes of coal while Dhanbad-based Bharat Coking Coalfields Limited dispatched 74,000 tonnes of coal in 22 railway rakes. Records available with the Union power ministry showed that India’s coal-based power generation was at 2.65 billion units and had increased by 19.5% when compared to October, 2019. As of October 11, the country’s thermal power units had 7.31 million tonnes of coal stock to fire their units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/union-coal-minister-to-meet-hemant-on-wednesday-amid-countrywide-coal-crisis-in-power-plants/articleshow/87002390.cms||Dhritiman Ray

This is a second industrial accident in the factory in the last two months. Following the incident, the work at the factory has been suspended with immediate effect under the orders of the Probandar district collector A M Sharma, who has also ordered a probe into the incident. According to police, the accident took place when repair work was going on on the overhead container in which raw material was being poured through a conveyor belt. “I have ordered a detailed industrial safety audit and only after that, the work will resume at the factory. There have been two incidents in a short span of time. We will try to understand why this has happened. Was the accident caused due to human error or were the machines old and needs to be replaced. An assessment is being done by the deputy director of industrial safety in this regard,” Sharma told TOI. The deceased include the engineer Hiren Agrawat (29) and labourer Pratap Odedara (30). While Hiren died on the spot, Pratap succumbed to injuries at Rajkot civil hospital. Out of the three injured labourers, one is critical and is being treated at Rajkot civil hospital. Two other labourers are admitted to Porbandar civil hospital. Sources said that the district industrial safety officer had completed a safety training program at Saurashtra Chemicals last week. This training was done to create awareness among workers in wake of an industrial accident at a cement factory in Ranavav last month. “The deputy director of industrial safety is conducting an investigation. Based on his report, if any negligence is found, an FIR will be registered against those responsible,” said H P Dhandhaliya, police inspector of Kamlabaug police station in Porbandar. The factory is located on Porbandar-Veraval road and employs over 2,000 workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/2-die-as-container-falls-on-them-in-porbandar-factory/articleshow/87003356.cms||---

Hiraman is a social activist working for bringing awareness among men and women of tribal and Adivasi communities. Speaking at a meeting in Dhurki block of Garhwa district on Tuesday, Hiraman said, “The government has launched several welfare schemes for the development of tribals. But due to lack of education, they have not been able to avail the benefits.” In Garhwa, Korwa population is around 26,000. He added, “Some communities are still deprived of their rights due to lack of knowledge.” Hiraman called upon the tribals to educate their children so that they can get better jobs and business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/korwa-tribe-on-verge-of-extinction-in-garhwa-activist/articleshow/87002618.cms||---
---||Ranchi||People defy Covid protocols, throng pandals in Jamshedpur||Jamshedpur: Revellers thronged pandals on Maha Ashtami in Jamshedpur on Wednesday with little or no regard for Covid-19 protocols. At many places in Sonari, Kadma and other areas of the city, large number of devotees assembled at puja pandals to offer 'pushpanjali'. According to the guidelines, children under 18 years are strictly not allowed near the pandals and puja committees were notified at various meetings to follow this. On Wednesday, parents along with children were seen at most of the pandals and none of the puja committee members were seen trying to implement the ban. Besides, not a single member from the district administration or district police were seen at the pandals when TOI visited them. Many people are also seen without masks. Sumi Roy said masks did not match with her new dress, so she gave it a miss. Like Sumi many had either left it at home or wore it on the chin. Most of the pandals did not have any kind of sanitizer at the entrance. Decorative lighting was banned by the administration but many pandals, including Sonari Ram Mandir Durga Puja, was decorated with fancy lights. Despite a ban on food stalls, many venues had allowed people to set up stalls. PCR vans or bike-borne police did not remove them. In the evening, huge crowd was witnessed at Jairam Sporting Club in Adityapur. Only a handful of puja organisers have followed the 5-feet sealing on the height of the Durga idol. Puja bhog was also sold at various pandals, including Sonari Ram Mandir and Kadma-based Rankini Mandir. As per government guidelines, bhog cannot be sold, but can be home delivered. At Rankini mandir, 2,400 bhog coupons each worth Rs 150 were sold on Ashtami. Huge crowd gathered at the pandal to collect bhog and none followed social distancing. SDM had to intervene and deploy police force to remove devotees assembled to collect bhog. Money was refunded to the devotees. At Sonari Ram Mandir, it was sold for Rs 100. In another incident, two youths from neighbouring Seraikela-Kharswan died when their bike hit a road-side tree near Ramakrishna Mission under Bistupur police station. Some people, however, chose to stay back home and watched pujas on social media. Many clubs, including Sonari West, posted their daily puja rituals on Facebook and devotees offered ashtami pushpanjali at home in front of Durga pictures installed there. Joyoti Sen, a teacher at a private school, said, if protocols are not followed, the third wave will become a reality. Retired state-run MGMMCH doctor Anita Banerjee expressed anguish over the crowd turnout at various pandals. She said like last year, the administration should have taken steps and put a blanket ban on pandal hopping. She said like it or hate it such a move has to be taken till all citizens are fully vaccinated or Covid is totally wiped out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/people-defy-covid-protocols-throng-pandals-in-jamshedpur/articleshow/87003204.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

In a candid admission after his recent review of the pending police cases in the district, Singh said many of the investigations are kept pending for long to illegally extort money or receive gratification from the people involved. Singh said 2,000 cases are still under investigation in Palamu and a large number of them are dragging on for two years. He said, “Pendency of investigation is not due to crunch of investigating police officials. We have enough workforce in every police station. Investigations are left incomplete deliberately by the IOs.” He said 40% of the IOs are delinquent in this matter. “They are bound to face the music soon,” he warned. On being asked why the IOs leave investigation hanging for months and years, he said, “A case under the investigation of the police serves like an ATM card. An investigating police officer uses the prolongation of an investigation as an opportunity to extract or draw any illegal gratification from the person or persons against whom the investigation is on.” In Palamu, 2,000 warrants are still not executed, the SP said, stressing that the police officers, who are bound to execute them just roam around with the warrants in their pockets and draw huge benefits by just showing them to the persons concerned. He said execution of the warrants requires to be expedited since the panchayat polls are likely to be held by the end of this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/prolonging-investigations-is-like-atm-cards-for-ios-palamu-sp/articleshow/87002740.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Talking to TOI on Wednesday, acting state health mission director Bhuvnesh Pratap Singh said, “We have not received any formal intimation from the Union ministry of health and family welfare in this regard.” Singh, however, said the state health department’s inoculation drive for the new beneficiary group will be in adherence with the Centre’s guidelines as and when they are received. As per an estimate of the department, about 1.4 crore of the state’s population come under the age group of 2-18 years. Till October 11, as many as 19.87 lakh people between 18 and 44 years, 13 lakh people between 45 and 59 years and 8.89 lakh senior citizens have been fully immunized in the state so far. Sources in the department said vaccinating the new age group will not be much of a challenge. “We have several routine immunization sites across 24 districts which are functional round the year for child immunization programme. Those sites will be used to inoculate the children with the Covid vaccine. Besides, we also have mobile vaccination vans which are functional in rural and urban areas. They will be used, too,” a senior doctor, who is associated with the state integrated disease surveillance programme, said. As of Monday, Jharkhand has 1,345 session sites for administering Covid-19 vaccines to beneficiaries above 18 years of age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-awaits-centres-help-on-kids-vaccination/articleshow/87002395.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Former BITian and MD of UK-based firm to perform rituals at London’s oldest Puja||Ranchi: The Bengali community at Camden in the United Kingdom has been celebrating Durgotsav in traditional Bengali style for more than 57 years. The oldest puja there is organised by the London Durgotsav Committee (LDC). This year, the rituals will be performed by an alumnus of BIT Mesra Amit Ghoshal who is the managing director of Espex batteries limited, a subsidiary of Exide Industries, India. Talking to TOI, Ghoshal said that he is not a professional purohit (priest), but was happy on being chosen as the chief priest by LDC. “The Durga pujo at Camden is the oldest in London and it was an honour to be given the responsibility of carrying out the rituals this time,” he said. The Camden pujo was started way back in 1963 by some Bengali families in UK who had roots in Kolkata. One of the members of the puja committee, Sumana Adak, said that with time, several committees started hosting Sharadiya Durgotsav in the UK. “As of date, 64 pujas are organised, but Camden being the oldest is well known and most popular among the Indian community,” she said. To follow the tradition, the idol was earlier taken from Kolkata every year to London and then brought back for immersion. But owing to the pandemic, the committee has decided to retain last year’s idol on which the pujo is being performed this year. Ghoshal said they will carry out the rituals for immersing the ‘ghatt’ but the idols would be retained this year too. The puja is organised at Swiss Scottish Library on the banks of Thames where the ritualistic immersion would be carried out. The attendance at the puja venues in UK has increased since last year due to Covid-related travel restrictions. “We would have missed our home festivities a lot if the ‘Sabekiani” (traditional) pujo was not there at Camden and a few more places,” Sumana said stressing that they want to remain connected with the family in India through media. The Camden Puja is home to around 400 Bengali families residing there. Recently the community at Edinburgh has also started organising Durga Puja for those residing in Scotland. Sumana said that last year it was done virtually due to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/former-bitian-and-md-of-uk-based-firm-to-perform-rituals-at-londons-oldest-puja/articleshow/87002492.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

On Tuesday, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh issued a letter to all the deputy commissioners, directing them to personally monitor and depute officials from their teams to maintain vigil. Talking to TOI, Singh said: “With the decline in Covid-19 cases in Jharkhand, there is a possibility that Covid-appropriate behaviour might not be adhered to by the devotees during the festive season. So I have directed all the DCs to implement strict guidelines.” The health department’s letter comes in the wake of the letter issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare to all the states and Union Territories on September 21 where the ministry termed the next 100 days as critical in the fight against coronavirus. According to the letter, the states/ UTs have been asked to put restrictions in areas with a positivity rate of 10% or more in the last seven days and with 60% bed occupancy in hospitals, be it oxygen-supported or in Intensive Care Unit. The state has been directed to enforce at least a 14 day restrictions at any district which crosses the threshold limit during festive season. According to Singh’s letter, the DCs have been asked to strengthen testing, monitor the movement of migrants in their respective districts and to increase vigil at all entry and exit points. The letter also directed the DCs to keep a strict watch over mass gatherings during the ongoing festival of Durga Puja. The letter has also directed the district officials to install thermal scanners as well as CCTVs at places which are likely to be crowded during the puja. The districts have also been asked to deploy volunteers to make sure that the Covid-control measures are followed to the hilt. State epidemiologist Dr Praveen Karn said, “Our protocols for the festive season are in sync with the directions received from the Union health ministry. We are going to be extremely cautious as the next 100 days will be very critical and the districts have been asked to keep a constant vigil to prevent any further spread of the virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dists-to-remain-alert-till-new-yrs-eve-to-prevent-spike-in-cov-cases/articleshow/87003270.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

One of the committee members and RMC city manager Afroz Alam said, “We are aiming to visit all the pandals in the municipal area and assign them marks out of 70. The team members are engaged in this work day and night. Even a small and less popular pandal can win this contest.” A maximum of 20 marks will be given for non-utilisation of single-use plastic and plastic carry bag for distribution of offerings, water and puja materials. The district administration has issued detailed guidelines on observance of the Covid norms, including social distancing, wearing of masks, use of sanitizers, small size of pandals and statues, barricading around the pandals, adequate lighting for safety reasons, vaccination of puja committee members and prohibition from taking out immersion procession.

Abdulla Fefdawala, a resident of the United Kingdom, has been asked by the crime branch to be present before them on October 18. The police said that Fefdawala had sent crores of rupees through hawala to Vadodara-based key accused Salahuddin Sheikh, who is already under arrest. “We had earlier sent summons to Nabipur in Bharuch, which is native of Fefdawala. Now we have sent a summons to his UK residence and asked him to remain present before the investigating officials on October 18. Fefdawala runs the Al Falah Trust,” said D S Chauhan, ACP (crime). Sheikh had received about Rs 79 crores, most of which was from Fefdawala, in the last five years. A total of Rs 60 crore was received through hawala while Rs 19 crore was sent to Sheikh by donation to his Afmi Trust. The special investigation team (SIT) formed to investigate the money laundering case found that the money was used to fund legal fees of the accused in anti-CAA protests and for constructing mosques in different parts of the country. The police said that Sheikh along with two other co-accused Mohammed Mansuri and Shahnawaz Pathan have links with Imran Gheewala, Shadab Panwala, Asif Bodawala and Altaf Mansuri who have had links with the banned outfit SIMI. All the four are residents of Vadodara. “We are expecting to get custody of Sheikh, Mansuri and Pathan, who are in UP police custody, in the next five days. Their interrogation will help us get more details about the racket,” the police added. The police have said that Sheikh fabricated expenses related to the social work done by his trust and laundered the money for various other purposes.  Initial probe had got a huge amount from hawala in the last five years and some of it was diverted by using this school as a front, said police. The cop were also investigating if the conversion activities were undertaken by him in the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/summons-in-hawala-case-sent-to-key-suspect-in-uk/articleshow/87002549.cms||Tushar Tere

Goacan co-ordinator Roland Martins said that all urban local bodies should identify the possible disasters they foresee for the next six months and share the data with the directorate of fire and emergency services (DFES). “The chief officers of all municipal councils in Goa should be requested to take up disaster risk reduction as an agenda point in the meeting of the municipal councils every six months and submit the minutes of the same to the department for municipal administration (DMA) and the district disaster management authority,” Martins said. Gaocan’s letter is part of the ongoing Urban October awareness drive. The consumer awareness group has also petitioned the DMA to ensure that all municipalities prepare a list of unsafe buildings, along with a time-bound action plan to relocate the occupants and demolish the dangerous structures. The public works department (PWD) must also identify critical infrastructure and basic services with priority being given to schools, hospitals, bus stands, bridges and flyovers, it has proposed. “Municipal councils must be requested to contact the local office of the DFES for a list of possible disasters that they foresee occurring in the next six months, ending March 2022, and the necessary precautions that they need to take. The local office of DFES may be requested to submit a status report of loss to life, property and its financial value for 2020-21 for the jurisdiction of the municipal council,” Martins said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/civic-bodies-must-focus-on-disaster-risk-reduction/articleshow/87005572.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Tweetstorm adds twist to story of abandoned plane at Nagpur airport||NAGPUR: A series of tweets that went viral on Wednesday about a decrepit Boeing 720 lying at Nagpur airport for over two decades has once again brought to life the story of Continental Airlines and Sam Verma. For those in the business and frequent fliers, the story about the abandoned plane is nothing new as TOI and other media has often written about it. However, the tweets by one Chris Croy have added new and stranger twists to this already queer story which has intrigued many. I just found out that1. For 24 years every pilot who landed at the airport in Nagpur, India had to be warned abou… https://t.co/Qf0h2gdEdP— Chris Croy (@ChrisCroy) 1634061856000What Verma, the promoter of Continental Airlines, had to say on this only added more spice to it. Incidentally, Verma, who is also a pilot, had a few years ago landed a small aircraft on a highway stretch in Madhya Pradesh. Verma told TOI that one fine day he decided to wind up the airline business and the five planes, including the one in Nagpur, were grounded. He did so because the pilots and engineers in India were “just not good as compared to the Americans”. Croy claims to be the son of the man who fixed the plane for Verma in the US to enable him to fly it into India. The tweet says in 1990 his dad — an aircraft mechanic at Brown Field Municipal Airport at San Diego — saw a man circling around an abandoned plane. “This was Verma, the tyre magnate from India. It was earlier owned by one Kenneth Copeland who had abandoned the plane,” Croy tweeted. Croy’s dad spent the next one year trying to fix the plane. His friends told him that he may never be able to make it fly. Even if he does, permissions would be tough to get due to high sound levels. Croy senior could still convince the US’ Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which allowed it to fly to Tijuana across the border in Mexico at a height of 14,000 feet. “The plane did the tests there and flew to India. In the first flight to Delhi, it made an emergency landing at Nagpur and has been lying here since then,” wrote Croy. Though he mentioned 24 years, it’s known be there since longer. also, my dad lied and told my mom that the plane was still flying around India carrying "people and chickens".He… https://t.co/hDvSqqaKHZ— Chris Croy (@ChrisCroy) 1634081300000Croy’s claim of “facts” appear stranger than fantasy. He says his father lied to his mom and said that the flight is still flying carrying people and chicken. “The airport director in 2015 fixed new tyres and just got rid of the plane in half an hour,” he tweeted. The plane is still parked at the airport. Verma, now 85, is leading a retired life at Betul, about 100km from Nagpur, in Madhya Pradesh. He denied of knowing any person by the name Croy but said that the plane was bought from San Diego. “I had grounded planes in Indore and Mumbai too. I had purchased five aircraft spending millions. Continental Airlines was the first private carrier to start in the country. We ran till the end of 1990s and grounded it sometime in 1991,” Verma told TOI. The promoter also claimed that his airlines was the first to serve free liquor in domestic flights. “Even the flight to Surat in the dry state of Gujarat had liquor on board,” said Verma. “The then aviation minister Madhavrao Scindia supported the idea. Our clients were film stars and other big people and no one ‘lost control’ after drinking.” He also denied that the jet was repaired by some mechanic. “The entire work was done in the presence of FAA’s supervisors after which the agency issued a certificate of airworthiness. A similar permit was granted by directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) here,” says Verma. “After pumping in millions, I realised that aviation is not a viable business. So, I grounded the planes and continued with the tyre business,” he said. Verma said he “had the licence of one of the pilots cancelled as he was of an unstable mind.” He also denies the story of any emergency landing. Verma says he wanted to remove the plane from Nagpur to his private land but the airport management demanded rent. A litigation continues over its payment. There was a loan from Tourism Finance Corporation of India (TFCI) which was settled. “Even Canara Bank had a claim but we managed to get the clear title. Now, the plane is in our name but the recovery suit goes on,” he said. Having built a Balaji temple in Betul, Verma says, “I spend my days in devotion.” Over the years, there have been many plans to convert the abandoned aircraft into a restaurant, museum and model for training crew. But nothing has worked out now. Not the only abandoned plane The Boeing 720 is not the only plane stranded at Nagpur airport. A Bombardier Challenger 605 belonging to the Abhijeet Group headed by Nagpur businessman Manoj Jayaswal is also here. Jayaswal, known for his huge bank default of over Rs12,000 crore, was the second to buy a Bombardier after Gautam Adani. The plane that was bought in 2012 was soon grounded due to the company’s financial crisis. There were attempts by the lender to auction it which did not succeed.

---||Nagpur||Centre had asked Maharashtra to stock up coal||NAGPUR: Amidst the nation-wide coal crisis leading to disruption in electricity supply at various places, documents shared with TOI have revealed that the Centre had warned Maharashtra to stock up coal in a series of letters, dated as early as February last year. On Tuesday, state energy minister Nitin Raut had pinned the blame on Coal India Limited and Centre for the coal mismanagement. On February 5, 2020, Union minister of coal Pralhad Joshi had written to state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, asking that thermal power plants of the state keep sufficient stock of coal. “As per the Central Electricity Authority’s report, coal stock at power plants of Maharashtra is sufficient for 23-days consumption. It would seem that the stock is comfortable for now but it may not be enough for summer season requirement,” stated Joshi. He further directed Thackeray to advise power utilities to continue submitting full program for coal dispatch to maintain their coal supply as per norms. “This is particularly important in view of the fact that our country imported around 235 metric tonne of coal last year, shelling out over Rs 17 lakh crore,” Joshi added. Joshi further pointed out that the total due payable to Coal India Limited (CIL) by Mahagenco was more than Rs 800 crore. In another letter written on April 26 this year by Alok Kumar, the power secretary, to Sitaram Kunte, the state chief secretary, had pointed out that many power plants of Maharashtra are having “low coal stocks”. “Also, Mahagenco has an outstanding due of Rs 2,852 crore to the coal companies. South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL) and Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) need to increase coal supply at all thermal power plants of Maharashtra so that adequate coal stock could be built up to meet peak summer demand.” Another set of documents show that in March this year, CIL wrote to general managers of various thermal power plants in the state, including ones in Bhusawal, Chandrapur, Koradi, Nashik and Parli, warning that the stations were carrying coal stock of very less days as against the normative requirement for 20 days. “CIL will not be responsible for any critical stock-related contingencies,” the letters clearly stated. As recently as September 28 this year, Joshi wrote to Raut, stating that in view of the sudden spike in coal-based generation, supply to power units has been prioritized. “Dahanu thermal power plant may be advised to lift coal through road mode so that the coal stock is built up,” the letter added. Raut on Tuesday said the state is facing a shortage of 3,500 to 4,000 MW of electricity supply and blamed “mismanagement and lack of planning” on part of CIL for the situation. “The CIL has failed to ensure timely supply of coal for thermal power generation plants in the state,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/centre-had-asked-maha-to-stock-up-coal/articleshow/87005723.cms||Manka Behl

The DMK won 128 district panchayat wards while its ally Congress won seven, MDMK won two and VCK one. The DMK won 930 panchayat union wards while its allies Congress won 32, VCK and MDMK won 15 each, CPM four and CPI two. The main opposition AIADMK could manage to win just two district panchayat wards. Its ally BJP and other parties – PMK, AMMK, NTK and MNM drew a blank in district panchayat ward polls. The AIADMK emerged victorious in more than 200 panchayat union wards while its ally BJP won eight. PMK won 44 panchayat union wards, AMMK five and DMDK one. Independent candidates won in more than 90 panchayat union wards. Vijay Makkal Iyyakkam claimed that its members have emerged victorious in 115 non-political posts in the local bodies. The state election commission is yet to officially declare the results of polls and bypolls to the local bodies. NTK and MNM that boasted of impressive vote share in the 2019 parliamentary polls and 2021 assembly polls, came a cropper failing to win a single district panchayat ward or a panchayat union ward. The elections, however, had its fair share of nail-biting finishes in the polls to non-political posts. Soundararajan emerged victorious as the president of Chengalaakurichi panchayat near Thirukurungudi in Tirunelveli district by one vote. In a similar incident, Maheshwari was elected as the president Kambaneri panchayat near Kadayanallur in Tenkasi district by a margin of three votes. Eight members of an extended family were elected to the local bodies in a panchayat union and a panchayat in Sankarankoil in Tenkasi district. A member of the extended family was elected as a panchayat union ward member on a Congress ticket while another member was elected as village panchayat president while six others as village panchayat ward members. Siblings from Jolarpet in Tirupattur district were elected as village panchayat president and village panchayat ward member. K Mala Sekar and K Uma, daughters of a DMK functionary Kannarangam were elected as Kaveripattu village panchayat president and Jolarpet village panchayat ward member respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ruling-dmk-allies-make-near-sweep-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/87009145.cms||Bosco Dominique

While the biker was killed, four people, including the bus driver, two employees of the firm and a passerby, were injured. The condition of the fourth passenger is not yet known. Police said the bus, which is owned by Shiv Tour and Travels, had started from the LG office with four people on board, including the driver. “The incident took place around 9.15pm when the vehicle, which was coming from Lal Kuan side and was heading to Choudhary Mor, lost balance on the Bhatia Mor flyover, rammed the divider, skidded to the opposite lane before crashing into the railing. From there, it plunged to the road below. Before it fell to the ground, it first crashed into a tree, which absorbed much of the impact,” said Ghaziabad SSP Pawan Kumar, who, along with the district magistrate and other officials, reached the spot after the accident. When the bus jumped to the other lane, it hit a biker, who also fell from the flyover with his bike because of the impact. He died on the spot, officials said. His mangled body was found later. “Though his identity is not yet known, the bike’s registration plate revealed that the name of the owner is Kamlesh Pandey, a resident of Kavi Nagar. But we cannot be sure if he was the one who was riding the bike,” said Kumar. Among the injured are Mahendra, the bus driver; Asif, who was a passerby; and two LG employees, Sunil and Deepak. “All of them have been admitted to MMG Hospital. Deepak is said to be in a critical condition,” said Kumar.  It is not yet clear why the bus went off course. Rajnish Yadav, owner of Shiv Tour and Travels, said the driver informed them that he lost balance while trying to save the biker. Yadav also told TOI that according to the driver, seven people were on board when the bus started but three got down on the way before the accident took place. SP traffic Ramanand Kushwaha said eyewitnesses said they heard the sound of a tyre burst before the accident, but investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/bus-falls-from-flyover-as-driver-loses-control-1-killed/articleshow/87007484.cms||Abhijay Jha

On Wednesday, the contractor who had contacted them for the job was arrested. According to the workers, they had asked for safety gear before going in but were told it was not dangerous. Around 9 pm on Tuesday, contractor Hemant had approached the four labourers and asked them to clean the underground tank at Jagdamba Petroleum Private Limited. Ravindra, one of the labourers who went inside the tank, said Hemant offered to pay them Rs 6,000 for the job. “He had contacted us for such work earlier, so we did not think this was going to be so dangerous. They did not give us any safety gear and four of us were wearing just cloth masks,” he said. Usually, head gear, belt, harness and oxygen masks are provided for such work. The 18-year-old labourer said when they reached the spot, they met factory owner Surendra Gupta who showed them the tank that had had one opening on the surface. “There was a foul smell and when we asked about it, the owner said there was no danger involved, as they had cleaned out water from the reservoir some seven-eight times. He said we just had to remove dirt from inside the chamber,” Ravindra said. Around 9am, Pankaj (21) and Rambhesh (26) entered the tank and soon, they fell unconscious. “When they stopped responding to our calls, we got worried. Ramesh and I were standing next to the ladder that they had used to get inside. I went down to check on them but I felt suffocated and within a minute, I climbed back up,” Ravindra said. Pankaj and Rambhesh were pulled out by some local people with the help of a rod after about 15 minutes. They were taken to Greater Noida’s Kailash Hospital where they were declared dead. According to local people, Rambhesh got married about one-and-a-half-years ago. Station officer, Kasna, Sudhir Kumar said the factory gets petrochemicals from other places and treats that to make petroleum products, which is then distributed to paint and other industries. The two labourers died of suffocation, the police officer said. On Wednesday night, contractor Hemant was arrested, he added. An FIR was lodged against him and the factory owner under IPC sections 304 A (death due to negligence) and 284 (with any poisonous substance any act in a manner so rash or negligent as to endanger human life) after Ravindra lodged a police complaint. The factory owner could not be contacted. DCP (Greater Noida) Abhishek Jha said a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each would be given to the families of the deceased labourers after an assessment by the labour inspector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/sent-to-clean-tank-two-labourers-die/articleshow/87007491.cms||Shikha Salaria

Speaking at the launch of the National Infrastructure Master Plan called ‘Mission Gati Shakti’, the CM said UP had already started the implementation of its own action plan for infrastructure development and directed state officials to cooperate with the Centre fully to make the mission a success. UP has achieved a major goal in improving its ease of doing business rankings over the past 4.5 years. With the cooperation from the central government, we are already implementing various projects which are important for our infrastructure development,” he said. He said Gati Shakti was being recognized as the ideal initiative for good governance to build a strong India. “It is also going to be a means of providing a single-window platform for planning, quick approval and decisionmaking for any project,” he added. “Through Gati Shakti-National Master Plan, India aims to develop holistic infrastructure for manufacturing, multi-modal connectivity, utilisation of resources, timely creation of innovative capabilities and speedy resolution of bottlenecks. Under the Rs 100-lakh crore national master plan, there will be better opportunities for employment to youth and to improve their standard of living,” the CM said. He added that India’s economy would grow only when the state and the central government work in coordination and UP would also move forward on the path of development. “Several infrastructure projects like Prayagraj-Varanasi-Haldia National Inland Waterway, Eastern and Western Dedicated Freight Corridors, Multi-Model Logistics and Transport Terminal, Regional Rapid Rail (RRTS) and Delhi-Jewar-Varanasi HighSpeed Rail Link, are crucial for UP’s development,” the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-play-a-key-role-in-making-india-5-trillion-economy-says-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/87009163.cms||---
---||Chennai||Officials in Tamil Nadu suggest online darshan to keep Covid at bay||CHENNAI: The public health department is pushing for ‘online’ darshans and muted celebrations amid increased Covid violations and crowding at markets, bus stops and railway stations ahead of the festival season. It also suggested taking the online route for shopping, gifting and reunions. On Wednesday, health officials met CM M K Stalin to discuss Covid-19 management. The directorate of public health said the state is seeing a slow but steady decline in the number of cases daily. The weekly average of new cases has dropped from 1,668 in the week of September 15 and 21 to 1,349 cases in the week of October 6 and 12. During the same time period, weekly average deaths dropped from 23 to 19 and overall test positivity rate or TPR (number of people tested positive per 100 tests) dropped from 1.1% to 0.9%. On Wednesday, the state reported 1,280 new cases, nine cases less than the Tuesday tally. The case load remains high in Chennai, Coimbatore and Chengalpet, which added 1,185, 968 and 722 cases in a week till Wednesday. On Thursday, these districts reported 173, 145 and 98 new cases. The state recorded 19 deaths on Wednesday and has 15,650 active cases. The health department said the state should retain the ban on mass gathering in containment zones and areas with TPR above 2%. “...Predictions show a high probability of resurgence in the next few months with upcoming festivals and wedding season,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. Analysis by the health department showed that though the state’s TPR is below 1%, 13 districts have TPR above 1% due to clusters from educational institutions, weddings, funerals, and workplaces. The state has recorded 2,959 positive cases from clusters in education institutions since September 7. TPR is highest in Krishnagiri (1.82%) and Thanjavur (1.68%). Director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam said the risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission and death is significantly low among those who are fully vaccinated. “The risk of the infection with both the vaccines is also much lower,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/officials-in-tamil-nadu-suggest-online-darshan-to-keep-covid-at-bay/articleshow/87009165.cms||Pushpa Narayan

There is likely to be at least two to three hours of load shedding initially to handle peak hour demand. The state requires 190 million units of power daily for all its needs, while the supply has come down to 150 million units due to coal shortage. The Rayalaseema thermal power project is now generating 375 MWa day against capacity of 1,650 MW. This is because of the closure of two units for annual maintenance and two more units due to shortage of coal. Similarly, Narla Tatarao thermal power station in Vijayawada is generating 1220 MW against its capacity of 1,760 MW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-mulls-power-cuts-for-industries-after-dasara/articleshow/87001936.cms||Gopi Dara

The party’s state president Somu Veerraju wrote the letter on Wednesday, the last day for withdrawal of nominations. Jana Sena’s election symbol is still a ‘free symbol’ as the party failed to get the required percentage of votes in the last election. Because of this, EC officials allotted the symbol to an independent candidate in the Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election held in May. However, both BJP and Jana Sena had made representations to the EC seeking withdrawal of the symbol, following which allotment of the symbol to the independent candidate was cancelled and he was given a new symbol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bjp-asks-ec-to-freeze-jana-senas-glass-symbol-in-badvel/articleshow/87001945.cms||Gopi Dara

He also cited the state’s poor financial health as a hurdle to resolve the key issues of the state, including the 18-point agenda of the AICC. Sidhu had quit as the Punjab PCC chief last month over his objections to the appointments of the state DGP and advocate general. Ahead of the meeting slated to discuss Punjab Congress’s organisational issues, Sidhu’s video and his “no compromise” remark has fuelled speculation about his next move. Well-placed sources said the central leadership may accept Sidhu’s resignation. In the video posted on his social media handle, he said: “Someone who understands my love for Punjab will never point a finger at me… You should facilitate and the high command has done so... But how will we move forward if we make compromises? ... the system rises to bite you. We will fight… In politics, 5 can become 50, and 50 can be zero.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/compromise-not-way-ahead-says-sidhu-day-ahead-of-aicc-meeting/articleshow/87009187.cms||---

---||Chennai||On eve of Ayudha Puja, prices of flowers, fruits zoom in Chennai||CHENNAI: Ahead of Ayudha Puja, prices of flowers and fruits skyrocketed in local markets across the city on Wednesday. While produce was twice as expensive in retail markets, the cost of many varieties of fruits and flowers either crashed or witnessed only a marginal revision at the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC), where vendors source goods for retail sale. Yet, local vendors cited high prices at the wholesale market for hiking rates on the eve of the festival. The price of marigold, the most popular flower purchased during Ayudha Puja, plunged at the wholesale market as it was flooded with flowers from Salem and Krishnagiri districts and Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh. Marigold accounted for about 60% of all flowers that arrived in the city. Koyambedu received about 500 tonnes of marigold on a single day which resulted in prices dropping to between Rs 60 and Rs 140 per kg depending on the quality. But, retail vendors sold ‘oru muzham’ or 1ft of marigold for Rs 30 to Rs 40. Vendors can make garlands of roughly 10ft with just 1kg of marigold. Assuming that the best quality flower was sourced and adding other input costs, 1ft of marigold should have cost only Rs 20 to Rs 25 at retail shops, said S Mookaiah, president of Chennai Koyambedu Flower Traders Association. “The price dropped on Wednesday due to the arrival of (massive loads of) marigold thanks to rains. Fleecing customers will force people to cut down on the volume of flowers they intend to buy. This is clearly visible as at least 10 tonnes remained unsold in Koyambedu,” he said, adding that farmers would be facing the brunt of such losses. Prices of fruits too were on the upswing across the city. A kilogram of mosambi cost Rs 35 to Rs 45 at Koyambedu, but was twice or even thrice as expensive in local markets with the cheapest being Rs 70. Pomegranates cost Rs 160 to Rs 290 a kg at roadside shops and supermarkets. Both fruits were cheaper just a few days ago. S Srinivasan, president of Chennai Fruits Commission Agents Association, said fruit prices were stable for a week at Koyambedu except for mosambi, whose wholesale price increased by Rs 10 on Wednesday. “The market witnessed brisk sales on Wednesday. Unlike last year, more fruits arrived this Ayudha Puja season,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/on-eve-of-ayudha-puja-prices-of-flowers-fruits-zoom-in-chennai/articleshow/87009214.cms||---

After rains damaged soyabean crop, farmhands have now nearly doubled their wages for harvesting it from waterlogged fields. For harvesting soyabean, the workers are now demanding around Rs3,000 to Rs3,500 an acre. Till last year the standard rates were in the range of Rs 1500 to 1700, said sources in the hinterland. Farmers said farms across Vidarbha and Marathwada are waterlogged due to excessive rains. “There is a major loss to farmers due to rains. To avoid further damage to the crop farmers are wanting to complete the harvesting at the earliest. This has raised the wage demand,” said Manish Jadhav a farmer from Mahalgaon taluka in Yavatmal. On one hand if rains have damaged the soyabean crop, on the other hand the per acre output is expected to be more in some pockets. This means even if the quality may be inferior the quantity may be higher, say a section of farmers. Hoping that the famers may reap good profits from soyabean this year, the workers too are demanding high wages, said farmers TOI talked to. Even those supplying harvester have increased the rate citing higher diesel price. From Rs 2,000 an acre earlier the harvester rent has gone up to Rs 2500, said farmers. Vallabh Deshmukh, a director of state government seed producing company - Mahabeej, said farm workers from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh too have reached Buldhana district for soyabean harvest. “This is because of a high demand of farm hands. The wages have nearly doubled but the yield is expected to be good at least in Buldhana,” he said. Amitabh Pawde, a farmer and an activist, said that soyabean crop is expected to have suffered a major damage and harvest is also tough due to waterlogging Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), a state government agency, said that the output is expected to be halved. A farmer in Yavatmal who said his soyabean yield was good also mentioned about losses in cotton and tur due to rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/labour-pain-for-farm-sector-as-wage-demand-for-harvest-doubles/articleshow/87004580.cms||Shishir Arya

He also raised concern over the rising population of Muslims. Bhagwat was speaking at the annual Vijayadashmani event held to mark the foundation day of the outfit. The event, which was again closed for the media, had the consul general of Israel Kobbi Shoshani as one of the special guests. In recent times, he is the first visitor from Israel which RSS is also reported to be looking as a country to emulate. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat performing ‘shastra puja’on the occasion of Vijayadashami, in Nagpur on Friday In his speech, Bhagwat mentioned that religions like Islam and Christianity came through invasion, and Jews and Parsis came to India seeking refuge. Bhagwat reiterated the 2015 resolution of RSS Akhil Bhartiya Karyakari Mandal (ABKM) which openly talked about rising population of Muslims and Christians. Referring to Muslims, he said they can follow patriots like quartermaster Abdul Hamid or Hasan Khan Mewati who fought Babur alongside Rana Sanga. Read AlsoBharat's journey from 'swadheehnta to swatantrata' is yet far from complete: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat at annual Dussehra addressRashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Friday said that the country's journey from 'swadheehnta to swatantrata' is as yet far from complete as there are elements in the world for whom India's progress and its rise to a respected position are detrimental to their vested interests.The written text of Bhagwat’s speech released by RSS includes the AKBM resolution. It cites the 2011 census which said that population of religions of “Bhartiya origin” has come down from 88% to 83.8% between 1952 and 2011. The Muslim population, on the other hand, has grown from 9.8% to 14.23% during the same period. The rate of growth of Muslim population has been very high than the national average in the border states of Assam Bangladesh and Bihar. It clearly indicates the unabated infiltration from Bangladesh, the resolution had said. The RSS chief says that the religious imbalance in north-eastern states has also assumed serious proportions. “The populations of people following indigenous religions have come down to 67% from 81.3% from 2001 to 2011. In just one decade, the Christian population has grown by 13%. In Manipur, the population of religions of Bhartiya origin has come down to 50% from more than 80%. The unnatural growth of Christian population indicates at targeted action by some vested interest groups,” reads the resolution which was released as part of the written text. Bhagwat, who did not read out the entire resolution, also advocated the need of implementing the national register of citizenship (NRC). “The NRC is however not meant for those people who have been living in India as citizens since generations,” he said. Bhagwat called for a policy to ensure demographic balance in population which needs to be applied on all in equal terms. He also criticized the recent incident of firing “between the police of two north-eastern states” (Bhagwat did not name Assam and Mizoram) and said that they are part of the same country. On Kashmir, Bhagwat said efforts need to be taken to make the people of the state understand that they are also “sons of Mother India”. “Terrorists have restarted their spate of killing targeting Hindus,” said Bhagwat. On Taliban, Bhagwat said they “claim to having change but indications are that they are the same of old”. “The country needs to have a cautious approach toward the new regime in Afghanistan,” said the RSS chief. “Their predisposition to passionate fanaticism, tyranny and terrorism in name of Islam is sufficient to make everyone apprehensive. Now, China, Pakistan and Turkey have coalesced in an unholy collation with the Taliban,” Bhagwat added. The RSS said properties and management of Hindu temples are being usurped and handed over to heretics. “In south India, temples are being controlled by the government. In rest of the country it’s a mixed system where temples are run by both government and trusts. The temples should be handed over to the Hindu devotees and the wealth utilized for worship of the deity and welfare of the Hindu community,” said Bhagwat. Bhagwat also raised concern over rise of rise of drugs and and cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. “It is very clear that the drug money goes to anti-nationals,” he said.

On Wednesday, two juveniles including an ITI student were feared dead after they were dragged in by huge waves in separate incidents. While the emergency mechanism already comprises outposts, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and life-guards, police teams will now patrol the sand stretch till late evening hours under a new arrangement in tune with chief minister M K Stalin’s announcement in the assembly on preventing drowning in the sea. The 3.5 km stretch falls under the Anna Square and Marina police stations. While the first has two outposts, the other has one, each consisting of two policemen, two fire and rescue services personnel, two fishermen and trained swimmers. The teams, headed by a sub-inspector, patrol the sands on ATVs, often chasing away people venturing into the sea. Triplicane assistant commissioner M S Baskar said, “We have displayed our mobile numbers on all four sides of the outposts and people can call them in an emergency.” Police also plan to install CCTV cameras at the outposts and link them with Wi-Fi to monitor beach-goers. Loganathan, a fishermen who is part of the rescue force on the beach, said that in the past two days, they had rescued about eight people dragged in by waves. “We can just glance at the sea and tell if it is rough and inform police personnel who then intensify patrolling,” he said. Police also play recorded voices, warning people against stepping into the sea. On Wednesday, a 17-year-old boy from Avadi was feared dead, while his friend was rescued by fishermen off Gandhi Statue. The two had come with nine others and were frolicking in the sea when the incident occurred. A few hours later, Kothandaraman, an 18-year-old student from an ITI in Royapettah was dragged into the sea. He was part of a team of 11 boys, all residents of Saidapet, studying at the ITI. A search for the missing boys was continuing till late in the night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-outposts-life-guards-on-marina-beach-after-13-deaths-from-drowning/articleshow/87009254.cms||---

With the Centre directing states to carry out home vaccination for those unable to reach centres, state health officials said district health officials have been directed to plan vaccination drives after taking data from the state disability commissioner office. The state has around 29 lakh disabled persons, according to the disability commissioner’s office, according to the 2011 census, which is estimated to be 35 lakh now. Union government last week announced Covid-19 vaccination at home for disabled, elderly and people with special needs. Guidelines for arranging for vaccination centres nearest to disabled and elderly, known as Near-to-Home Covid vaccination centres (NHCVC), for the elderly and differently-abled citizens, but now vaccination will be provided at the doorstep of beneficiaries with special needs, the directive stated. State public health officials told TOI that nearly 22,901 disabled persons have been vaccinated so far, but the numbers may be higher. With the CoWin app not not having a separate category, the tally has to be coordinated with the disability commissioner’s office, added officials. “The differently-abled population in the state is around 2.5% of the total population, which would have increased to 3.5%. The number of inoculated persons is higher than what is estimated by state public health officials,” stated Omprakash Deshmukh, disability commissioner. He said that the work is on to check for the actual numbers so that the local administration can carry out the process of vaccination. Rafiq Khan, an activist who works for the disabled sector, told TOI that with no proper numbers the coverage can only be estimated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-20k-disabled-persons-vaccinated-in-state-officials/articleshow/87005972.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu urges Centre to make 500km as national highways||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government has urged the Centre to declare 500km of roads in the state as national highways, for which in-principle approval was given by the Union ministry of road transport and highways in 2018. The state government also demanded that the Centre take up works of Madurai Western Ring Road, Coimbatore Half Ring Road and Coimbatore-Sathyamangalam Road at 6,600 crore. The roads that the state government wants to be converted to NHs are Tiruvannamalai-Kallakurichi (65km), Vallioor-Tiruchendur (70km), Kollegal-Hanur-MM Hills-Palar Road-TN border extended up to Mettur (30km), Palani-Dharapuram (31km), Arcot-Tindivanam (91km), Mettupalayam-Bhavani (98km), Avinashi-Mettupalayam (38km) and Bhavani-Karur (77km). “The present condition of these roads needs immediate repairs/improvements to cater to the present day-to-day traffic. The roads are most important, connecting significant pilgrimage centres such as Tiruvannamalai, Tiruchendur and Palani and many trade and tourism centres. Upon upgradation, Kallakurichi-Tiruvannamalai and Arcot-Tindivanam roads will serve as the shortest routes to important pilgrimage centre Tirupathi/Tirumala,” minister E V Velu said in a representation to Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The 30-km-long Madurai Western Ring Road will connect AIIMS, Madurai-Cochin Road and Kodai Road, link the integrated Madurai bus stand at Mattuthavani and central vegetable and flower market with NH44 (Srinagar-Kanyakumari Road). The project cost is 1,200 crore. The 3,480 crore Half Ring Road for Coimbatore was approved by the Centre in March 2018. It can be taken up in two phases – from Karanampettai to Periyanayakkanpalayam and Madukkarai to Karanampettai. Acquisition of 463.4 hectares of land is estimated to cost 536 crore, Velu said. Coimbatore-Sathyamangalam Road connects Ooty-Kothagiri-Mettupalayam-Sathyamangalam-Gobichettipalayam-Erode road and Sathyamangalam-Bhavani road. The stretch from Coimbatore to Sathyamangalam that leads to Karnataka through Dhimbam hill is two-lane with many curves. The NHAI has proposed four-laning of Coimbatore-Sathyamangalam and two-laning of Sathyamangalam-inter-state border for 90km. “The ministry may consider upgrading the inter-state connecting road for safer traffic flow in the ghat section and decongest traffic,” the minister said. The project cost, including land acquisition, is 1,920 crore. The state government also took up with the ministry the need to widen eight bypasses on the Salem-Ulundurpet section of NH-68 to four-lane immediately. Statistics reveal that the existence of two-lane bypasses within the four-lane highway causes frequent road accidents and fatalities. “Accidents occur frequently on these bypass locations, where the transition from two-lane to four lane and four-lane to two-lane occurs at the junction points of these bypasses,” Velu said. Between April 2016 and July 2021, 715 accidents took place, resulting in 169 fatalities and 309 major injuries. Incidentally, the Salem-Ulundurpet highway upgradation to four-lane was initiated during the previous DMK regime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-urges-centre-to-make-500km-as-national-highways/articleshow/87009279.cms||Julie Mariappan

This includes 1,183 PSA plants sanctioned under the PM CARES Fund. “We are confident of commissioning the remaining 41 PSA oxygen generation plants approved under the PM CARES Fund by the end of this month. This task has been carried in a mission mode and was an example of the ‘whole of government’ working together. Simultaneously, 1,311 plants have been commissioned which were sanctioned by central PSUs and funded by other entities,” said housing and urban affairs secretary Durga Shanker Mishra, who was tasked to lead this programme. According to a status document on the PSAs built utilising the PM CARES Fund, 100% of the sanctioned plants are operational in 22 states and UTs; in nine other states and UTs over 90% plants have been commissioned; and in the remaining five states less than 90% plants are operating. Mishra said the government turned the crisis into an opportunity to install these plants at hospitals which had to depend on supply through cylinders. “Now these facilities will go a long way to meet the medical requirements across districts. Under this programme, we also trained nearly 7,000 people with technical background to operate and maintain these plants,” he said. The secretary said these plants are equipped with Internet of Things and by December all will be covered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2500-oxygen-plants-commissioned-across-india-in-record-112-days/articleshow/87009222.cms||Dipak K Dash

The institute is funded by the Union ministry of Ayush. “Project proponent has shown the cost of the project as Rs 23 crore. As per SOP, fine to be levied is 1% of total project cost, which works out to Rs 23 lakh. The project proponent shall deposit the said amount within a period of one month before this authority,” the Goa-SEIAA said at its meeting on October 5. The institute is coming up in an area of 2 lakh sqm in Dhargalim and the foundation stone for the project was laid by then Union Ayush minister Shripad Naik, in 2018. But the environment clearance (EC) for the project was sought only in August this year. After the Goa-SEIAA received the request for approval for the project in August, an inspection was held on August 17. It is during this inspection that it was found that construction work had already been initiated without the environmental clearance. “The construction has already started without obtaining prior environment clearance and hence it is a case of violation,” the Goa-SEIAA noted at its meeting held in August. The Goa-SEIAA has set some terms of reference for the environment impact assessment to be carried out at the site. “The authority decided to grant Terms of Reference (ToR’s) to the All India Institute of Ayurveda subject to imposition of penalty as per office memorandum issued by the ministry of environment forest and climate change,” Goa-SEIAA said at its meeting this month. The land where the centrally funded AIIA project is coming up at Dhargalim was originally acquired by the state government for development of a sports city. The land was subsequently allotted to the ayurveda institute. Of the total land area of 2 lakh sqm earmarked for the AIIA, 47,500 sqm will be the built-up area. The national institute at full capacity is expected to have 500 seats on offer for students covering different programmes. The institute, comprising a research centre and a 100-bed hospital, will offer post-graduate and graduate programmes, and expand in future to include courses in homeopathy, unani and siddha systems, as well, it has been announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ayurveda-institute-fined-23l-for-environmental-violation/articleshow/87004795.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Speaking to TOI Sawant said that the decision was taken by the task force on Covid management. Since offline teaching has not resumed for students up to Class VIII, it will be easier to hold classes for the four standards in a staggered manner, he said. Sawant said that schools will have to follow all necessary Covid protocols and added that the director of education would issue a circular listing all the Covid-related SOPs to be followed. The state’s Covid-19 expert committee recommend to the government to reopen schools for Classes IX and X, as well as higher secondary schools. Earlier in the day, the parent teacher association and teachers council of Dr K B Hedgewar High School, Cujira, held a rally in Panaji, followed by a demonstration at Azad Maidan, demanding offline exams and classes. A large number of students were also present holding banners like ‘online exam bye-bye, offline exam amka zai (we want offline exams)’. While the state government has already issued a circular allowing higher secondary schools to conduct their exams for Class XI and XII in the offline mode, the demonstrators said they want Class IX and X exams also in the physical mode. “When everything else has opened up, schools should be allowed to hold offline exams and classes at least for students of Class IX to XII,” said a teacher Deepak Amonkar. Students said that conducting online exams does not give an accurate picture of where the student stands. “There is scope for cheating in online exams and many students are just copying from the books. It is not fair to the more studious of the lot,” said one student at the rally. A parent declared that Dr KB Hedgewar’s parents association supports the demand. “We fully support this demand and if this plea is not heard, we will see that thousands more are gathered here the next time,” said the parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/classes-ix-to-xii-to-return-to-schools-from-mon-cm/articleshow/87004826.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Goa||‘Revora panchayat violated human rights of dalit woman’||PANAJI: In a case of discrimination against a woman by the Revora panchayat, the human rights commission found that the dalit mother’s rights had been violated. It recommended that the panchayat secretary place her application for permission to repair her house before the panchayat for reconsideration. “On consideration by the village panchayat, the same be forwarded to the Block Development Officer (BDO), Bardez for grant of permission of house repairs,” the commission stated in its inquiry report/order. The grievance of the woman is that the panchayat was not granting her permission to repair the house despite her being legally married and co-owner of the house, as her husband had not given his NOC. The house was damaged after a tree fell on it in 2017 and thereafter she had been given government accommodation under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. As the house repairs couldn’t be carried out, she has sought permission to continue to occupy the government accommodation. Recently the authorities asked to vacate the premises saying no more extension would be given. That is when she made a fresh application to the panchayat in respect of her equal right as co-owner of the house and sought permission to repair it. The dalit mother of two has strained relations with her husband and lives on a monthly maintenance of Rs 5,000. “The commission finds that, in the present case, the village panchayat of Revora has violated the human rights of the complainant by not forwarding her application to the BDO for the house repairs...only as her husband has also not given NOC,” the commission’s chairperson Justice U V Bakre and member Desmond D’Costa stated in the inquiry report/order. The commission also recommended that the North Goa collector, BDO Mapusa, secretary of the Revora panchayat and assistant engineer sub division III, WD VIII Karaswada “consider the extension of the permission of the complainant to stay in the government quarters…for a further period of 60 days from the date of grant of permission by the BDO and secretary for carrying out repairs of the house”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/revora-panchayat-violated-human-rights-of-dalit-woman/articleshow/87005000.cms||Lisa Monteiro

An initiative of the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) and funded by World Bank, iRAD will establish an accurate and uniform accident data collection mechanism and analysis, and will introduce corrective interventions in policy and infrastructure towards improving road safety in the country. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that iRAD will help to prevent accidents and that in today’s digital world the most important thing is knowing how to use data. The project is a comprehensive web-based information technology solution which will enable various agencies to enter details of a road accident from different perspectives such as details related to victim, investigation, road engineering, vehicle condition and include spatial details like accurate location information. The project’s software will provide back-end analytics as well as simultaneous linkage with multiple real-time syncing and updating of data, which will be disseminated to multiple stakeholders under whose jurisdiction the accident comes under. After the police department captures details of a road accident an alert will be sent to the officials of the transport and highways department through email and SMS.  Officials of the police department will then send a request to the transport department’s motor vehicle inspector asking for an inspection of the motor vehicle. After this inspection, details pertaining to the transport department will be captured and the accident information report accordingly generated. Similarly, details pertaining to the highways department will be captured by the assistant engineer of highways/public works department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/central-road-accident-database-launched-in-goa/articleshow/87005005.cms||---

Earlier, the Goa state expert appraisal committee (Goa-SEAC) had already recommended that an urban forest be developed within the stadium complex. “After discussion and considering recommendation by the Goa-SEAC, the Authority, members unanimously decided to recommend the said project proposal for grant of Environmental Clearance under provision of ElA Notification 2006 (as amended) with a condition that project proponent should adhere to the commitment of keeping not less than 10,000 sqm area as a virgin land/undisturbed and also fence it up to protect it,” the Goa-SEIAA has said at its meeting on October 5. The Goa Cricket Association has been accordingly asked to submit revised plan for the project, the marking reserved area. The revised plan has to be submitted on the Union environment ministry’s portal Parivesh. The Goa Cricket Association is constructing the stadium on a plateau in Dhargalim, which will involve the loss of 850 trees. It has said that it will compensate for the loss of trees by planting more than 2,500 others. The project is coming up on a 1.8 lakh sqm area, where the built-up area will be around 48,000 sqm. The stadium will have seating capacity of 32,000, with parking for more than 3,000 vehicles. The Goa-SEAC had already recommended that a precondition for approval for the stadium project should be set that the association will develop an urban forest within the stadium complex. The environment body has also suggested that the stadium should include provision for rooftop water harvesting and that the trees being planted in the complex should be of indigenous varieties only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/keep-10k-sqm-land-untouched-in-dhargalim-cricket-stadium-project/articleshow/87005100.cms||---

The high court of Bombay issued an administrative order on October 5 shifting the case back to Goa, a decision based on a plea submitted by Congress president Girish Chodankar. “As per an administrative order of the chief justice dated October 5, this matter is re-transferred from the principal seat to high court of Bombay at Goa,” said the judicial section officer to Congress . “The same will be placed on board and will come up for hearing on October 20 or on any other day as per the convenience of this court.” Chodankar had challenged Patnekar’s order dismissing the disqualification petition against the 10 former Congress MLAs. When the case came up for hearing before the high court of Bombay at Goa, Justice Mahesh Sonak recused himself from the case. With no other division bench in Goa, the case was placed for hearing before the principal bench at Bombay. Justices K K Tated and Pritviraj Chavan were hearing the case as the principal bench of the high court of Bombay. However, after Tated retired, the hearing was stalled. With an alternative division bench available at the high court of Bombay at Goa, and with MGP’s writ petition regarding the disqualification petition also being heard by the Goa division bench, Congress asked for the case to be re-transfered to Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-disqualification-plea-sent-back-to-hc-in-goa/articleshow/87005183.cms||---

Festive season coupled with Navratri celebrations have slowed down the vaccination drive, officials said. The state had managed to be on the top list of populated states in terms of administering the first dose of vaccine, data so far shows. As per daily average, around 5.71 lakh vaccine doses were administered everyday in September when a total of 1.7 crore vaccine doses were administered. However, in October so far, it has reduced by one-third to just 1.76 lakh doses everyday. Only 21 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in the state so far in this month. Officials say that the vaccination has slowed down a bit due to the festival seasons, but it is likely to speed up after October 15. “It has slowed down a bit due to the festival and harvest season, but inputs received say that it will speed up with same intensity once the festival season is over, i.e., after October 15,” state vaccination officer, Dr Santosh Shukla told TOI. Sources said that there are several people who have postponed their second dose vaccination by nine days due to the ongoing Navratri festival. Apart from it in rural areas, people into harvest season which is considered as a timebound work, hence there is less vaccination. Experts however believe that it could also be due to psychological Covid-19 fatigue. “It is quite normal behaviour if we are going through persistent stress for a particular reason, our sub-conscious mind adjusts for bringing relief in such a way, that people often tend to behave to opposite of what was bringing them stress. It’s a kind of rebellion from our subconscious mind”, Dr Satyakant Trivedi told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-festive-season-big-hurdle-in-vaccination-drive-say-officials/articleshow/87009313.cms||---

Stating that Goa was a developing state, he described people’s representatives as the ones who are “dedicated to the downtrodden” and are “at the service of the people.” Pillai also shared his experience as governor of Mizoram while interacting with students. “Responsible citizens should reach out to the downtrodden and weaker section of the society to give them a helping hand in whatever way one can,” he said, adding that the governor’s discretionary funds will be increased by Raj Bhavan soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/reach-out-to-downtrodden-says-guv-during-orphanage-south-hospital-visit/articleshow/87005178.cms||---

Twenty-seven patients from the male ward and nine from the female ward were moved to the multi-storied hospital that discharged its last Covid-19 patient on Tuesday. The gynaecology and paediatric wards will be the next to shift on Thursday. SGDH that conducted 64 deliveries of Covid-19 mothers and managed 82 children infected, is already equipped for the shifting of these two wards. The OPDs are expected to move from Saturday, and the hospital authorities are trying to keep doctors at both the new and old hospitals on Saturday for the paediatrics department to avoid any inconvenience to patients during the move. The surgery branches will move last. Although Covid-19 patients will not be admitted to SGDH, the Covid-19 casualty will continue functioning where people can get assessed, collect home isolation kits, check their oxygen saturation level and receive medication. Governor P S Sreedharan Pillai visited the hospital on Wednesday to check preparations for the third wave and was shown the paediatric ward and the oxygen plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/medicine-ward-shifted-from-hospicio-to-district-hospital/articleshow/87005241.cms||---

---||Goa||CII says govt must prioritise logistics for rapid growth||PANAJI: While Goa has the major infrastructure facilities such as a port, rail and road connectivity and an airport, the lack of a good logistics support system prevents the state from becoming a multi-modal logistics hub, said the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here on Wednesday. CII has urged the state government to create one more riverine berth for general cargo movement through inland waterways. CII has also said that there is an urgent need for the Sada Varnapuri dual carriageway linking the national highway to Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) to be completed soon. “To become a successful multi-modal logistics hub, good logistics support system is a basic requirement for trade and industry much like electricity and water are. Lack of this leads to costs of doing business going up, making businesses unviable,” said Anthony Gaskell, mentor of CII’s logistics panel. Gaskell said Goa needs a modern container terminal at MPT along with a multi-modal logistics park with modern warehousing. He was speaking at the launch of the Pradhan Mantri GATI SHAKTI National Master Plan. “The container throughput at MPT has stagnated in the range 20-30K TEU’s (twenty-foot equivalent unit) for many years and has the potential to handle more. Currently the port is only handling a small proportion of the container traffic of Goa while it has the potential to handle more,” said Gaskell. CII has called for the creation of truck parking facilities at all the industrial estates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cii-says-govt-must-prioritise-logistics-for-rapid-growth/articleshow/87005358.cms||---

India had come out with the advisory as UK, even after recognising Covishield vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India, retained the 10-day quarantine period for fully vaccinated travellers from India. The advisory has been withdrawn after the British government ordered discontinuation of mandatory testing and quarantine norms for those vaccinated with Covishield and travelling from India. The health ministry said, “Based on the evolving scenario, it has been decided that the revised guidelines stand withdrawn and the earlier guidelines on international arrival issued on February 17 shall be applicable to all travellers arriving in India from the UK.” India had come out with the advisory as UK, even after recognising Covishield vaccine, retained the 10-day quarantine period for fully vaccinated travellers from India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-withdraws-quarantine-and-tests-advisory-for-uk-travellers/articleshow/87009330.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Jabbed 6 months back, Punjab health workers thinking of booster dose||CHANDIGARH: Health workers in Punjab, especially those inoculated in the initial phase, have started approaching the government to offer them a booster dose of the vaccine. Health workers -- doctors, nurses and ancillary staffers --were the first to get vaccinated when the drive started in January and a large number of them received both doses on completion of the 28-day deadline set initially by the central government. Many studies done to examine the duration for which vaccine induced immunity holds up have documented a steady decline of antibody levels among vaccinated individuals. According to experts, the antibody levels shoot up after vaccination and then start to taper off after 6 to 7 months. The spread of the highly contagious Delta (B.1.6172) variant of Covid, which is being considered as the major reason for breakthrough infections, has left health workers in the state worried. As per data of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), as many as 2,363 samples have tested positive for different variants of concern. Of the total, 1,014 samples are of Delta variant that accounts for about 43% of total variants of concerns detected in the state. Punjab Civil Medical Services Association (PCMSA) president Dr Gagandeep Singh said they are getting lot of enquiries about the booster dose from doctors working in both the private and government sectors. “Health workers keep asking about booster dose, especially those who got the dose first in January,” said Dr Gagandeep, who himself got his second shot in February. Dr Navjot Singh Dahiya, national vice-president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) and former president of Punjab chapter of the association said that their members, especially those with low antibodies, have started talking about it and many are interested in taking the additional shot. He further said that the issue will be taken up in the next meeting of the body. Even as demand for booster shots is rising, the central government had recently clarified that it was not even thinking of the booster shot at the moment as giving two doses to the adult population is the main priority. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar confirmed that the department has started receiving requests from health workers for the third dose from both private and government sectors. He, however, said no one will be provided with an additional dose till the central government comes up with a policy. BREAKTHROUGH INFECTION In Punjab, about 70 cases of breakthrough infection - patients contracting the Covid virus after getting vaccinated - have been detected. No death among such patients has been reported in the state so far. The vaccines do not provide full protection but do reduce the severity of the infection and the chances of death. WHAT IS BOOSTER SHOT A booster dose is administered to a fully vaccinated individual when the immunity drops below a prescribed limit. According to a statement released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on October 4, the objective of a booster dose is to restore vaccine “effectiveness from that deemed no longer sufficient”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/inoculated-over-6-months-back-health-workers-in-punjab-thinking-of-booster-dose/articleshow/87007296.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Chandigarh||Breach in Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s security cover: CIA inspector suspended||MOHALI: The intelligence branch of the Punjab Police detected many instances of major breach in the chief minister’s security cover during the marriage function of his son in Mohali. Taking serious note of the anomaly, the additional director general of police (ADGP) intelligence shot a letter to the SSP Mohali to take action as per the law, while pointing out the series of breaches in security cover. Acting upon the information, SSP Mohali Navjot Singh Mahal suspended CIA Inspector Sukhbir Singh as he was named in the letter for breaching the CM’s security and standing next to the CM during the wedding function while being under the influence of liquor. Two more of police staff were suspended for enjoying food and liquor at the wedding after leaving their duties. The SSP said, “We have already taken action against the CIA inspector and suspended him. A departmental enquiry has also been marked against him.” The letter reads: “One uniformed police officer of CIA staff posted at Kharar (who was intoxicated) crossed the security cordon of the chief minister and reached close to the chief minister and was seen showing his closeness to the CM Punjab. No attempt was made by the security personnel to stop him.” Many other police officers were also seen breaching the security protocol at the CM’s sons wedding and other functions. While detailing the loopholes in the security cover of the CM, the intelligence branch letter reads: “Many loopholes in the security of CM, Punjab were found during the ladies sangeet function organised at Arista Resort Jandpur, Kharar, on October 8.” While listing the loopholes, ADGP pointed out that it was observed that normal checking was being done at entry gates for male and female guests. No one was present at the gate to identify the relatives of the family. Due to weak checking at the main gate, many armed employees also attended the programme unchecked. Some of the employees posted at the door frame metal detectors (DFMD) had become quite relaxed and many of them left their points and started taking dinner. Several on-duty uniformed police personnel were seen consuming liquor. Out of them, two to three employees who consumed alcohol became drunk and remained the centre of attraction among the common people. During the function, a gazetted rank police officer was seen touching the feet of a minister, which became a topic of discussion among the employees and the public. Lady police personnel deployed in civil dress were seen enjoying the atmosphere of the wedding by consuming food and beverages in groups during the function. The commandos posted with the CM were mostly busy watching videos on their mobile phones and the security personnel were also seen on camera consuming alcohol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cia-inspector-suspended-for-major-breach-in-cms-security-cover/articleshow/87007307.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Chandigarh||Jubbal-Kotkhai set for 3-way fight as Bragta refuses to withdraw||Shimla: In Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly constituency, known as the apple heartland of Himachal Pradesh, the presence of rebel candidate Chetan Bragta, son of former BJP MLA Narender Bragta, has spelled trouble for BJP as all efforts to pacify him failed and he refused to withdraw his name on Wednesday, which was the last date to do so. This leaves a triangular contest on the seat between Congress candidate Rohit Thakur, BJP’s Neelam Saraik and Bragta. Bragta, who was the state convener of BJP’s IT department, was later in the day suspended from the party for six years for contesting election against the party candidate. Already, apple growers are already not happy with the government and are holding protests against it. Now, the presence of a rebel is expected to make the Jubbal-Kotkhai byelection, necessitated by the demise of Chetan’s father in June, tougher for the ruling party. Under pressure to withdraw his name, Bragta remained in an undisclosed location throughout the day and he appeared before his supporters through social media only. In the morning, he greeted his supporters on Navratra and announced that he will not withdraw his candidature. Later, he appeared again on social media to announce that the Election Commission of India had allotted him the election symbol “apple”. “For apple, my father, late Narendera Bragta, fought till his last breath,” he said. BJP state president Suresh Kashyap said the party was taking the byelections seriously on all four seats of Arki, Jubbal-Kotkhai and Fatehpur, besides Mandi. He said Saraik had remained a zila parishad member from Jubbal-Navar-Kotkhai for three terms and is an experienced candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jubbal-kotkhai-set-for-3-way-fight-as-bragta-refuses-to-withdraw/articleshow/87007342.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Power crisis continues: PSPCL make power arrangements for week from Mundra plant||Patiala: For the fifth consecutive day, power supply in Punjab continued to be erratic and power cuts were imposed on all consumers for two-four hours on Wednesday. On an average, daily power shortage in the state has been about 1000 MW for a week. On Tuesday, 1,865 lakh units were supplied in the state and the shortage was more than 150 lakh units. PSPCL bought 259 lakh units at Rs 14.56 per unit. The coal stock left at Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat plants is 2.6 and 1.9 days, respectively. Private plants at Rajpura, Talwandi Sabo and GVK have coal stock of 2.4 days, two days, and 1.5 days. Around 14 rakes were received at private plants on Tuesday. Sources said PSPCL has agreed to purchase 500MW from Tata Power’s imported coal-based power plant at Mundra in Gujarat for one week at Rs 5.5 per unit from October 12 to October 19. This is only an intermediary arrangement looking into the power shortage in Punjab. PSPCL is hoping for an improvement in the power situation with the supply of an adequate number of coal rakes. In 2007, Tata power won the bid for the Mundra Ultra Mega Power Plant (UMPP) at a price of Rs 2.9 per unit for supply of 450 MW power to Punjab, but a few months ago it refused to sell power at the rate it had promised to provide in the PPA and proposed to sell power at higher rates. PSPCL officials said they have neither negotiated nor challenged the seller in any court. “We have neither challenged Mundra UMPP in the court nor had we negotiated the PPA. There are no plans for negotiation too, so far. The UMPP had refused to sell power a few months ago. However, temporary arrangements for power have been made from them,” said Paramjeet Singh, director generation, PSPCL. V K Gupta, spokesperson of All India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF), said most of India’s coal-fired power plants have critically low levels of coal inventory at a time when the economy is picking up and fuelling electricity demand. The power demand has increased in the last two months, he said. Gupta added coal secretary Anil Kumar Jain, in his letter to CIL, blamed it for not meeting production and off-take targets. During the financial year 2021-22 (Till 21 Sept), against a coal production target of 260.4 MT, actual coal production is 237.35 MT. PSPCL supplied 9,352MW despite coal shortage Despite coal shortage, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) claimed to have supplied 9,352 MW in Punjab on Tuesday. PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad said the corporation had to purchase about 1,800 MW from power exchange at a rate of Rs 10.55 per unit on Wednesday as well. He said the critical coal stock position is still prevailing in all the thermal power plants situated in Punjab. “Around 13 coal rakes were received against a total requirement of 22 rakes on Tuesday. Although the coal rake supply is lesser, consistency is being maintained. A sufficient number of coal rakes are in pipeline and the coal position shall improve in the coming few days. The power cut duration was lesser yesterday due to improved power availability as an additional unit of GGSSTP thermal plant, Ropar, and Anandpur Sahib Hydel Project (84 MW) started power generation after repair of the channel in record time and one unit of GVK was also made operational. The record repair of channel of Anandpur Sahib hydel project has given a big relief to PSPCL in this power deficit scenario where power has to be purchased by PSPCL at higher rates whereas the per unit cost from its own project is only 25 paise,” said Prasad, while appreciating efforts of hydel organisation engineers or officials for their hard work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-crisis-continues-pspcl-make-power-arrangements-for-week-from-mundra-plant/articleshow/87007361.cms||---
