In the previous week ended July 30, 2021, the reserves had surged by $9.427 billion to reach $620.576 billion. In the reporting week, the increase in the forex kitty was due to a rise in foreign currency assets (FCAs), a major component of the overall reserves, as per weekly data by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). FCAs rose by $1.508 billion to $577.732 billion in the reporting week. Expressed in dollar terms, the foreign currency assets include the effect of appreciation or depreciation of non-US units like the euro, pound and yen held in the foreign exchange reserves. Gold reserves were down by $588 million to $37.057 billion in the reporting week, the data showed. The special drawing rights (SDRs) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) dipped by $1 million to $1.551 billion. The country's reserve position with the IMF also fell by $31 million to $5.125 billion, as per the data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/forex-reserves-rise-by-889-million-to-lifetime-high-of-621-464-billion/articleshow/85313123.cms||---

The central bank will also start rolling back its accommodative policies which have led to easy liquidity conditions, they said. The view from analysts came even as inflation cooled down to 5.6 per cent for July, after two months of breaching the upper end of the RBI's tolerance band of 6 per cent. The central bank has been keeping the status quo on policy and continuing with the accommodative stance to help revive GDP growth. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had on Thursday opined that the current conditions do not warrant withdrawal of the accommodative measures. "The RBI has been tolerant of inflation and has stayed accommodative to support growth given the deep hit suffered by the economy. But it appears to be reaching the end of tether as inflation remains elevated," rating agency Crisil said. "If this pressure (on inflation) continues and systemically important central banks, especially the (US) Fed, begin normalising, the RBI will start to roll back accommodation. We expect the RBI to make a more definitive statement by this fiscal end, and raise rates by 0.25 per cent," it added. Its peer Acuite said it expects policy normalisation to begin in a gradual fashion with comfort on vaccination, clarity on fiscal stance, and global rates setting and called the increase in the quantum of variable reverse repo auctions as the first small step towards the same objective. Next, the central bank can look at increasing the reverse repo rate by 0.40 per cent to narrow the difference between repo and reverse repo rate to 0.25 per cent by February 2022, it said, adding that the repo will be unchanged at 4 per cent. In parallel, the vaccination drive is expected to lead to herd immunity and thereafter, the RBI will follow up with a 0.25 per cent rate hike in April 2022, it said. Analysts at Japanese brokerage Nomura said last week's review had signs of RBI policy pivoting towards normalization, pointing out to one of the members of the monetary policy committee also dissented against the "accommodative stance" and the increase in FY22 headline inflation target to 5.7 per cent. "The August policy meeting already bore initial signs of a policy pivot via calibrated liquidity normalisation. We believe this will be followed by the phasing out of durable injectors of liquidity, a 0.40 per cent reverse repo rate hike (in December quarter) and 0.75 per cent of repo/reverse repo rate hikes in 2022," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-to-hike-rates-starting-early-2022-take-more-steps-towards-policy-normalisation-analysts/articleshow/85313238.cms||---
---||Business||Facebook, Amazon seek US approval to operate undersea data cable||WASHINGTON: Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc have asked the US government for approval to operate a new undersea data cable between the Philippines and California after China Mobile agreed to exit the plan, a government agency said Friday. The two companies told the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) they intend to start commercial operation by late 2022 and said the new data connection will provide significant new capacity on routes where capacity demand continues to increase substantially each year. The companies in a joint filing said the new cable will help to support Facebook applications and provide Amazon and its affiliates with capacity to support Amazon’s cloud services and connect its data centers. Amazon, Facebook and China Mobile did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The United States has repeatedly expressed concerns about China’s role in handling network traffic and potential for espionage. Around 300 subsea cables form the backbone of the internet, carrying 99% of the world’s data traffic. In September 2020, Facebook, Amazon and China Mobile withdrew their application to connect San Francisco and Hong Kong as part of the Bay to Bay Express Cable System. In April 2020, the FCC approved Alphabet Inc unit Google's request to use part of a US-Asia undersea telecommunications cable, that excluded Hong Kong, after US agencies raised national security concerns. Google agreed to operate a portion of this 8,000-mile Pacific Light Cable Network System between the United States and Taiwan, but not to Hong Kong. Google and Facebook helped to pay for construction of the completed link but US regulators have blocked its use. The companies in August 2020 abandoned the proposal to use the Hong Kong portion. In May 2019, the FCC voted unanimously to deny China Mobile the right to provide services in the United States, citing risks that the Chinese government could use the approval to conduct espionage against the US government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/facebook-amazon-seek-us-approval-to-operate-undersea-data-cable/articleshow/85313415.cms||---
---||World||Spain starts sending 800 migrant minors back to Morocco||MADRID: Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta on Friday began sending back some 800 unaccompanied migrant minors to Morocco three months after they arrived en mass, an official said. The minors were among up to 10,000 migrants who flooded across the land border into Ceuta over several days in May as Moroccan border guards stood aside. This was widely seen as retaliation over Spain's decision to host Brahim Ghali, leader of the Polisario Front, a movement demanding Western Sahara be independent from Morocco, for medical treatment. Local daily El Faro de Ceuta published images of minors being escorted by police to the Moroccan border on Friday. Contacted by AFP, a source at the central government's representative office in Ceuta, who refused to be named, confirmed the evictions had started. According to Cadena Ser radio, the interior ministry ordered these on August 10. The NGO Save the Children said it would lodge a complaint to try and put them on hold. Once a complaint is filed, the decision to send a migrant minor back takes some time, as each case must be evaluated separately. Many migrants were returned to Morocco soon after they arrived in May. But at the end of July, some 2,500 remained in Ceuta, according to local leader Juan Rivas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/spain-starts-sending-800-migrant-minors-back-to-morocco/articleshow/85312603.cms||---
---||India||At 100GW, India now fourth in solar, wind energy capacity||NEW DELHI: India’s renewable energy capacity, excluding large hydroelectric projects, hit 100 GW (gigawatts) on Thursday, making it the world’s fourth largest in terms of total installed green energy capacity. The milestone is commendable for the world’s third-largest polluter as it has been achieved in a short span of five years of prime minister Narendra Modi announcing in 2015 his plan to build 175 GW renewable energy capacity by 2022. But going by the pace of capacity addition this year, achieving that target within the stipulated time frame will be a herculean task. But a government statement said “India aims to touch 450 GW capacity by 2030, staying resolute in its commitment to sustainable development goals”. Be that as it may, the milestone will help New Delhi resist pressure to declare a net zero goal and call out the developed economies on their pitiful effort to reduce carbon emission. “Another landmark day in the history of the Indian power sector… Under the visionary leadership of PM @narendramodi ji, we shall continue to be global leaders in energy transition,” power and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh tweeted. Another landmark day in the history of the Indian Power Sector. Our installed Renewable Energy capacity (excluding… https://t.co/FT2ujFRKBr— R. K. Singh (@RajKSinghIndia) 1628775922000“We would like to acknowledge the pivotal role played by the government in helping the sector reach this goal. Favourable policies and an enabling environment have helped Indian renewable energy companies grow exponentially,” ReNew Power CEO Sumant Sinha said. The 100 GW renewable capacity accounts for 26% of India’s total installed generation capacity of 383 GW. If large hydroelectric projects are included, the total renewable capacity works out to 146 GW, or 38% of the total installed capacity. The high trajectory of the renewable energy capacity building, despite per capita emission being one-third of the world average, shows India's commitment to decarbonise its economy and will meet its NDC (nationally determined contributions) targets for power generation from non-fossil fuel sources and emission reductions. According to the government statement, India now has the world’s fifth-largest solar power and fourth-largest wind energy capacities. It said projects totalling 50 GW capacity is under installation and 27 GW is under tendering. India has also enhanced its ambition to install 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-100gw-india-now-fourth-in-solar-wind-energy-capacity/articleshow/85313737.cms||Sanjay Dutta

Amazon began rolling out biometric technology at its Whole Foods stores around Seattle in April, letting shoppers pay for items with a scan of their palm. The system, called Amazon One, lets customers link a credit card to their palm print. Klobuchar, who was joined by Senators Bill Cassidy, a Republican, and Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, expressed concern in the letter dated Thursday about both privacy and competition related to Amazon One. "Our concerns about user privacy are heightened by evidence that Amazon shared voice data with third-party contractors and allegations that Amazon has violated biometric privacy laws," the lawmakers wrote in the letter. "We are also concerned that Amazon may use data from Amazon One, including data from third-party customers that may purchase and use Amazon One devices, to further cement its competitive power and suppress competition across various markets," they wrote. The lawmakers asked Amazon about plans to expand Amazon One, and to whom they had sold or licensed the technology. They also asked how many people had signed up for it, how the data is used and if it is ever paired with facial recognition systems. Amazon declined comment but pointed to a blog post dated April 21, which said that it was in "active discussions with several potential customers." It further said that Amazon One was designed to be "highly secure." "The Amazon One device is protected by multiple security controls, and palm images are never stored on the Amazon One device. Rather, the images are encrypted and sent to a highly secure area we custom-built for Amazon One in the cloud," the blog post said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/amazons-palm-print-recognition-raises-concern-among-us-senators/articleshow/85313701.cms||---

The first Kannada I-Day address in 1963 by the then acting governor, Nittoor Srinivasa Rao, drew cheer and even prompted eminent littérateur Kuvempu, who was to be coronated as Rashtrakavi a year later, to pen a 14-line poem applauding the development. Every year since independence, official celebrations observing the big day at Parade Grounds had a customary address by the governor of the state. In 1962-63, then governor of Mysuru state, Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, was away on a tour of the United States and Justice Nittoor Srinivasa Rao, who was chief justice of Mysuru high court, was the acting governor. On August 15, 1963, Rao was scheduled to give an Independence Day speech as the acting governor. However, the staunch Gandhian and Kannada language lover was in a bit of a shock to receive his speech copy in English. In Nittoor Srinivasa Rayaru: Noorara Nenapu, a biographical sketch of the famed freedom fighter, writer and jurist published in 2003, the incidents of the day are well recorded with Rao urgently calling for a typist to translate the English speech and type it in Kannada. “Rao jovially recalls in the book how the word jawan meaning soldier was translated as jawana by the translator which means peon in Kannada,” says Vemagal Somashekar, senior historian and Kannada author. With the speech translated into Kannada in an hour, Justice Rao took centre stage at Parade Grounds in Bengaluru on the morning of August 15, 1963 and delivered the governor’s speech for the first time in Kannada. The speech came as a pleasant surprise to many present at the venue and to lakhs of people of then Mysore state, who were tuned in to the radio. It was considered a historic day by Kannada language lovers back then and even made it to newspaper headlines. Poet Kuvempu was so enthralled by Rao’s I-Day speech that he penned a 14-line poem titled Rajyapalarige Abhivandane (salute to governor). Kuvempu lavishes poetic praise on the speech, saying Nanna Hottege Hande Haalu Hoydantaaitu (felt like having drank a huge vessel full of milk). The poem appeared in Kannada newspapers the next day and was much discussed in literary and political circles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nittoors-i-day-kannada-speech-had-kuvempu-pen-poem/articleshow/85314074.cms||Petlee Peter

The audience at Field Marshal Manekshaw Parade Ground will be restricted to 500 invitees, including 100 Corona warriors, 25 Covid survivors, defence officials, among others. The ceremony will have no cultural programme or aerial flower shower, said BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta. A full-dress rehearsal was held on Friday at the venue where I-Day eent will be held. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai will hoist the flag at 9am on Sunday. “He will address the people of Karnataka followed by the national anthem, guard of honour, Nada Geethe and Raita Geethe. The programme will get over in around 45 minutes,” said J Manjunath, DC, Bengaluru Urban District. “Twenty platoons from Karnataka State Reserve Police, Karnataka Industrial Security Force, Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, civil police, traffic cops, women police and mounted police will be part of the parade along with four bands,” he added. “The stretch between BRV Junction and Kamaraj Road Junction on Cubbon Road will be blocked from 8.30am to 10.30am on Sunday.

The blue bus was the centre of attraction during the 10km victory drive from HAL airport to Chinnaswamy Stadium. In fact, the Royal Challengers Bangalore management in 2016 had planned a similar roadshow on the same bus, but the team didn’t win the IPL final against Sunrisers Hyderabad. However, the RCB team travelled in BMTC’s Volvo buses as part of its ‘Go Green’ initiative. Launched in 2001 for sightseeing in the city, the open bus — Kaveri — has been lying idle at the Shantinagar depot. Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation is now giving it a new lease of life. Sources said KSTDC has purchased the bus from the cash-strapped BMTC for Rs 3.5 lakh. “It will be used for sightseeing in Bengaluru. We will rebrand it soon. We are hoping the bus will become popular among tourists, but the route and other things are still being planned,” said a KSTDC official. Sources said as part of the plan, KSTDC is chalking out a list of tourist spots in the city. The service is expected to cover places like Cubbon Park, Lalbagh, Ulsoor Lake, Vidhana Soudha, Tipu Palace, Iskcon temple, Gavigangadhara temple, Bull temple, Dodda Ganapathi, Sir M Visvesvaraya Museum and Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath. BMTC officials said their sightseeing services weren’t very popular due to various reasons. In 2014, the corporation launched Hop-On, Hop-Off (HO-HO) service, which was later renamed Bengaluru Rounds and finally Bengaluru Darshini. KSTDC has six double-decker buses modelled on London’s Bus Tours. Each has a seating capacity of 40 (20 seats each in upper and lower deck). These buses were operational when KSTDC launched its double-decker service Ambari in Mysuru for sightseeing purposes in March. But the service was hit by Covid-19 and is yet to be resumed. However, KSTDC is unable to extend it to places like Bengaluru and Hampi mainly due to overhead cables and other obstacles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kstdc-buys-open-bus-from-bmtc-for-sightseeing-in-city/articleshow/85314154.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

These stunning, and rapid, victories have brought the insurgents to 40 km from the national capital, Kabul. The Taliban now control 18 of the country’s 34 provincial capitals. Kandahar, a city of more than six million, is considered to be the most significant victory for the Taliban: it is key for the country’s industrial and agricultural output, and the outfit’s founder Mullah Omar had ruled Afghanistan from the city till 2001. The only big cities that the Afghan government still controls, besides Kabul, are Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar in the country’s east, and Mazar-e-Sharif, Balkh’s capital, in the north. After taking over Kandahar city, capital of the eponymous province, the insurgents captured Lashkar Gah, the capital of neighbouring Helmand. The Taliban next entered Pul-e-Alam, capital of Logar province just south of Kabul, and then seized Ferozkoh, the capital of Ghor in the centre, and Tarinkot, Uruzgan’s capital in the south. The insurgents, government and Taliban sources confirmed, have also taken Qalat, the capital of Zabul, and Badghis’s capital Qala-e-Naw. The other provincials capitals, which fell earlier, are Faizabad, Farah, Pul-e-Khumri, Sar-e-Pul, Sheberghan, Aybak, Kunduz, Taluqan, Zaranj, Ghazni, and Herat. “Kandahar was taken without resistance. The Taliban were celebrating their victory by firing AK-47 rifles," said Pashtana Durrani, a female university student who escaped Kandahar on Friday. "We’ve left behind all the books that my father and grandfather had given me, every memory, and we’ve had to burn all our pictures," she said. The Taliban’s formal claims about their latest victories have not been challenged by Kabul. The Uruzgan governor, however, released a video claiming that he was asked by local political leaders and tribal elders to hand over control of Tarinkot to the Taliban to avoid bloodshed. Some of the provinces that have fallen to the Taliban over the past week were surrendered in negotiated deals, as on Friday, and on Thursday in Ghazni where the governor was subsequently arrested by government forces. In Herat, however, commando troops and a militia led by 75-year- old warlord Ismail Khan had put up stiff resistance, but the city collapsed on Thursday night. The Taliban confirmed on Friday that they had Khan and several of his top aides in their custody. "All government officials, including the Herat governor, police chief, the head of the National directorate of Security (NDS) office in Herat, warlord Ismail Khan, the deputy minister of the interior for security, and the 207 Zafar Corps commander, surrendered to the Taliban after the province fell to the group," an Afghan media outlet reported. The Taliban later allowed Ismail Khan to go to his home. In a video message released by a pro-insurgent media outlet, the former governor claimed he had joined hands with the Taliban and was "treated well in custody". Local tribal and political leaders have played a key role in Taliban victories by influencing the government’s military and political representatives to avoid bloodshed, surrender and gain safe exit. The Taliban propaganda machine has also played a major rule in the group’s easy wins in several provincial capitals. "Government functionaries, including foot soldiers and law enforcers, are told that their leaders are dual nationals and have no stake in Afghanistan. Their families are settled abroad and they can no longer stay in the country after the exit of their Western backers. This has been a common perception among locals and Afghan security forces about the incumbent rulers of the country," said Afghan tribal elders contacted by TOI. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid has said that the armed group is determined to push ahead with offensives to take control of all the provinces. He urged the Afghan security forces in the remaining areas to "end resistance and not risk their lives". In Kabul, President Ashraf Ghani’s government has been faced with a challenge: the influx of thousands of people displaced by fighting in other parts of the country. The mosques, parks, schools and government facilities are full of internally displaced people while many sleep on the streets. The World Food Programme has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe due to food shortages in the war-torn country. The displaced families regularly protest in Kabul, appealing to the government to provide them shelter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-take-kandahar-kabul-just-40km-away/articleshow/85314245.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The deceased child was identified as Veer Singh (2), son of Balbir Singh and nephew of Jasbir Singh, whose house at Khandli Bridge Chowk, on the outskirts of Rajouri town, was targeted by militant(s) at around 9.30 pm, according to the local police. At the time of the attack, the family was sitting on the terrace. Jasbir Singh (36), his brother Balbir Singh (42), his parents Romesh Chander (65) and Sia Devi (60), and his nephews Arjun Singh (12) and Karam Singh (12) were hospitalised after the attack. Jasbir Singh underwent surgery on Friday and his five-month-old son Munna was referred to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMC&H) Jammu for specialised treatment. The attack on the BJP functionary comes barely days after BJP’s Ghulam Rasool Dar and his wife were shot dead in Anantnag on Monday. Rajouri observed a day-long shutdown against the grenade attack in response to calls given by Sanatan Dharam Sabha, Rajouri, local chapters of the Bajrang Dal and VHP, and local trading associations. DIG (Rajouri-Poonch range) Vivek Gupta went to the attack site and is leading the investigation. Search teams have recovered the lever of the grenade and security personnel have been conducting searches in and around Rajouri town, but no arrests have been made as yet. The police fear that the terrorists escaped after throwing the grenade. J&K lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha extended his extended deepest condolences to the BJP functionary and his family and said the "perpetrators will be brought to justice soon". Protests broke out at Government Medical College and Hospital in Rajouri on Thursday night over lack of facilities. The BJP functionary’s family members and locals also shouted slogans against the administration for not providing Jasbir Singh with security cover. The protesters alleged that only one doctor was available at the hospital. The terror attack has come as a shock to the town as Rajouri district has been almost militancy-free since 2005-06. However, the security agencies have in the recent past highlighted attempts to revive insurgency in the twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch, which lie along the LoC and also share boundaries with Kashmir. Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts of Jammu region also are facing similar issues. Army, CRPF and police teams have been maintaining a cordon in the Upper Panghai forest in Thannamandi for over a week after two LeT terrorists were killed. The police also claimed to have foiled a terror plot five days before the country’s 75th Independence Day by recovering a large cache of arms and ammunition, including AK-47 assault rifles, hand grenades, detonators and pistols. In a separate incident, the J&K police arrested two freshly recruited members of the Hizbul Mujahideen from Kishtwar district on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terrorists-lob-grenade-on-bjp-politicians-house-in-rajouri/articleshow/85314467.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

For Goa who were chasing a striker to fill the big boots of last year’s Golden Boot winner Igor Angulo, those words were music to their ears. Many players who they contacted had fears over Covid-19 and the long bio-secure bubble for the Indian Super League. But the 33-year-old looked hungry for success. Never mind the profile of the player – he hasn’t played at big clubs or in the La Liga – or the less than impressive numbers for the past two years. But Goa, known to handpick the best attacking foreign talent in the last couple of years, knew who they were selecting. “Airam is a player we have monitored closely for three years and we have always found him to be an ideal fit for our style of football,” said Puskur. When his profile was presented to coach Juan Ferrando, he lost no time in giving the go ahead. After all, Ferrando tried to sign the Spanish striker during his time in Greece with Volos. Two ISL clubs – Chennaiyin FC and NorthEast United FC – reached out to the striker last season but couldn’t tempt him to come to India. When Goa held talks and made an offer, Cabrera grabbed it, even turning down another ISL team whose coach had made a call. “We waited for the right profile through the course of the summer and we are satisfied that we’ve found the profile who can spearhead our attacking efforts next season,” said Puskur. The club is understood to have sought feedback with a number of their contacts in Spain. Among those who provided glowing references were a former Goa player and another ISL champion. “I want to thank FC Goa for the trust and faith they have put in me. I believe this will be another wonderful chapter in my life. I want to help the team with goals and all the experience I acquired in Europe to help the team grow,” said Cabrera. Cabrera did duty for Spanish clubs like Villarreal B, Cordoba, Numancia, Lugo, Cadiz and Extremadura before moving to the Polish top flight where he scored 30 goals in 60 appearances. He last played for Wisła Płock in Ekstraklasa, the Polish top-tier league, from where Angulo had also landed in Goa. By the time the season ended, Angulo had won the Golden Boot and took the team to the ISL playoffs. Goa are hoping for more from Cabrera.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-show-faith-in-airam-spanish-striker-they-tracked-for-three-years/articleshow/85314546.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The duo had fired at a BSF convoy in Mir Bazar area on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway the previous afternoon and was planning a big attack, IGP (Kashmir Range) Vijay Kumar said. A rocket propelled grenade (RPG) launcher was among the cache of arms — an AK-47 rifle, four magazines, grenades — recovered from the slain terrorist, identified as Usman from Pakistan, the IGP said. The recovery of the RPG launcher is significant. Terrorists were planning to use the weapon after several years, signifying that they were planning a major attack which was successfully averted due to the vigilance of the security forces. Following Thursday’s attack, security forces had launched a cordon-and-search operation in the area when the ultras, who were holed up in a nearby building, opened fire at the search party triggering an encounter. In the initial gunfight, two CRPF personnel and as many civilians sustained injuries. “Intermittent exchange of fire continued throughout the night and in the early hours of Friday, Usman was killed while his aide managed to escape the cordon,” the IGP said, adding that security forces took utmost care in ensuring zero collateral damage in the operation. Security agencies had already received inputs about a possible terror attack on highways, including the stretch from Qazigund to Pantha Chowk. “The operation was a success due to the alertness of the security forces who zeroed in on the terrorists after the attack, forcing them to take refuge in a nearby building,” the IGP said, adding that the highway was being cleared and traffic would resume shortly. IGP Kumar said terror attacks were being planned in J&K ahead of the upcoming Independence Day in a bid to instil fear among citizens and prevent them from attending I-Day functions. “We have put in place stringent security measures to ensure the functions are conducted seamlessly and request people to attend them without fear,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lashkar-terrorist-from-pak-killed-in-kulgam-encounter-aide-flees/articleshow/85314648.cms||M Saleem Pandit

In Poonch district, one person was arrested and an improvised explosive device (IED) was recovered in the Mendhar area. In Doda, the police, special operations group, Army and paramilitary forces on Friday evening launched a cordon and search operation in Tanta Forests at Kahara and busted a terrorist hideout where the team seized a large quantity of arms and ammunition. The area was cordoned but no arrest has been made so far while the investigations are in progress. In Poonch, SSP Vinod Kumar said a joint team comprising cops, Army and Border Security Force (BSF) personnel, rounded up a man because of his suspicious movements. After frisking the man and his belongings, security forces recovered an IED - four sticky bombs in a bottle - and Rs 10,500 in cash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terrorist-hideout-in-doda-busted-arms-and-ammunition-found/articleshow/85314698.cms||---

Vlaho Bukovac's "Blagovestanski sabor" - which depicts a historic 1861 assembly of prominent Serbs in the then Austro-Hungarian empire - was recovered in a raid in Zurich in which two Serbian nationals were arrested. The painting was recovered on Wednesday, police said, in a cross-border operation with Serbian authorities in which several other people were detained. "In the middle of the week, the Zurich public prosecutor's office seized a painting stolen from a Serbian castle in the 1990s," Zurich police said. "This painting is considered an important national cultural property in Serbia." While Serbian reports put the market price of the painting at around half a million euros, it is the work's value as a cultural symbol that is of most interest. Blagovestanski Sabor, or the Annunciation Assembly, is seen as one of the most significant events in the history of the Serbs. At the meeting, the Serbian elite sought political autonomy for territories inhabited mostly by Serbs from the empire, which then controlled much of central and southern Europe. The Zurich police say they arrested a 44-year-old Serb and a 76-year-old person of Swiss and Serbian nationality in connection with the alledged attempted sale of a stolen artwork. The Zurich public prosecutor's office has opened criminal proceedings against the two men. The 44-year-old was released from custody on Thursday, without the police giving the reasons. For its part, the Beta news agency reports that three people suspected of being involved in the attempted sale of the painting have been arrested in Serbia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/swiss-police-recover-painting-stolen-from-serb-castle-in-1993/articleshow/85314560.cms||---

Dennerby was busy with his mission of ensuring that Indian girls do well at the Fifa U-17 Women’s World Cup next year. But with Maymol resigning a month ago, citing personal reasons, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) had to step in quickly. “With his vast experience, Thomas will bring in immense value addition to the women’s team,” said AIFF general Kushal Das. “He is acquainted with India and we look forward together for him to improve our team.” Dennerby has plenty of experience, coaching several national squads. He coached Sweden’s women’s team to a third-place finish in the Fifa World Cup in 2011 and a quarter-final spot in the 2012 London Olympics. Dennerby also coached Nigeria at the 2019 Fifa Women’s World Cup. “I am grateful to the AIFF for finding me suitable for the job,” said Dennerby. “I have been in India and am aware of the huge potential. It is a big challenge to get the girls ready for the Women’s Asian Cup. Life is all about challenges, and I relish it.” When Dennerby was first approached for the job, he was hesitant. “The coach’s focus was on the under-17 team. He didn’t want any distractions, but we felt he was the best person for the job. It’s impossible to get an experienced man like him at short notice,” said one senior AIFF official. Dennerby will take charge of the team next week when the 30 probables assemble in Jharkhand. Till the conclusion of the senior tournament, the under-17 girls will train under assistant coach Alex Ambrose. Meanwhile, the AIFF has drawn up a plan that will ensure that the team is well-prepared for the Women’s Asian Cup with 10-12 friendlies. According to sources, a number of international exposure tours will be held while plans are also afoot to organise a four-nation tournament at home. The Women's Asian Cup 2022 will be held in India from January 20 to February 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aiff-banks-on-dennerbys-experience-as-womens-football-coach/articleshow/85314759.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||World||New York Assembly to suspend Cuomo impeachment investigation||ALBANY: The New York state Assembly will suspend its impeachment investigation into Gov. Andrew Cuomo once he steps down, the chamber's top Democrat said Friday.  Cuomo announced his resignation on Tuesday over sexual harassment allegations, days after he faced increasing pressure to resign or face the possibility of being ousted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature through the impeachment process. Cuomo said at the time that it would not take effect for 14 days, at which point he will be replaced by Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul.  The state attorney general last week released an independent investigation that found Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women.  Speaker Carl Heastie said in a statement that the Assembly Judiciary Committee had heard from its lawyers that it can't impeach and remove an elected official no longer in office. Nevertheless, Heastie said, the evidence the committee had gathered "could likely have resulted in articles of impeachment had he not resigned."  Since March, outside lawyers have been helping the committee conduct a wide-ranging investigation on whether there were grounds to impeach Cuomo, a Democrat. The announcement came on a day the Assembly had initially set as a deadline for Cuomo's legal team to respond with any additional evidence refuting the allegations against him.  Cuomo's office and lawyer, Rita Glavin, didn't respond to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press about whether the governor was going to comply with the deadline.  "Let me be clear - the committee's work over the last several months, although not complete, did uncover credible evidence in relation to allegations that have been made in reference to the governor," Lavine said.  That included evidence related to sexual harassment, the misuse of state resources in conjunction with publication of the governor's book on the pandemic, and "improper and misleading disclosure of nursing home data."  As the answer to the legal question of impeaching a departed official remained unclear for several days, some Democrats, including Assemblymember Ron Kim, had urged the Assembly to impeach Cuomo anyway to prevent him from running for office again in New York.  Heastie said that he's asked Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Lavine to turn over "to the relevant investigatory authorities all the evidence the committee has gathered."  Cuomo faces ongoing probes from the state attorney general over his $5 million book deal and from state prosecutors, who are scrutinizing his handling of nursing home deaths data. The state's ethics commissioners, who could levy fines against Cuomo, are also looking into similar issues.  Heastie also cited "active investigations" by county district attorneys in Manhattan, Albany, Westchester, Nassau and Oswego concerning incidents of alleged sexual harassment by Cuomo.  Several women have said the governor inappropriately touched them, including a current aide who said he groped her breasts at his official residence, the Executive Mansion, last November. That aide, Brittany Commisso, filed a criminal complaint that could result in a misdemeanor groping charge.  Some Judiciary committee members, including Democrats Phil Steck and Kenneth Braunstein, said Friday morning that they wanted the committee to at least release a report of their findings to the public.  Heastie's statement didn't say whether the committee would still publicize its findings.  Heastie's spokeperson Mike Whyland didn't respond to repeated requests for comment Friday. Heastie on Monday estimated the probe has cost taxpayers "millions" so far, but didn't respond to repeated requests by the AP for an estimate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-york-assembly-to-suspend-cuomo-impeachment-investigation/articleshow/85314821.cms||---
---||World||Officials meet as fuel shortage, power cuts paralyze Lebanon||BEIRUT: Severe fuel shortages and wide power cuts have paralyzed tiny Lebanon, with some businesses temporarily closing down on Friday as top security officials met to discuss the situation. Lebanon has for decades suffered electricity cuts, partly because of widespread corruption and mismanagement. The Mediterranean nation of 6 million, including 1 million Syrian refugees is near bankruptcy. The situation deteriorated dramatically this week after the central bank decided to end subsidies for fuel products. The decision will likely lead to a hike in the prices of almost all commodities in Lebanon. The move by the central bank was rejected by both Lebanon's president and outgoing prime minister who claimed they were not notified in advance. Major roads were jammed Friday as thousands of cars waited in long lines at petrol stations. People rushed to bakeries to buy bread amid fears some might close down. ``Many bakeries that are running out (of diesel) will close tomorrow,'' Ali Ibrahim, head of the bakers' union, told state-run National News Agency. Fuel shortages have been blamed on smuggling, hoarding and the cash-strapped government's inability to secure deliveries of imported fuel. President Michel Aoun called an ``extraordinary'' Cabinet meeting to discuss the nationwide crisis but outgoing Prime Minister Hassan Diab, whose government resigned a year ago, declined to attend, saying the constitution restricts duties of his caretaker Cabinet. The situation has been made worse by the failure of political leaders to agree on a new government to chart a path out of the crisis and negotiate a recovery package with the International Monetary Fund. Protesters in Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon closed roads Friday to protest power cuts and fuel shortages. Earlier this week, Energy Minister Raymond Ghajar said Lebanon needs about 3,000 megawatts of electricity but produces about 750 megawatts. The gap has been filled for decades by thousands of private generator owners who also had to cut supplies amid severe diesel shortages. People currently get an average of two hours of electricity a day from the notoriously corrupt state company that has cost state coffers more than $40 billion over the past three decades. Among those to announce a temporary closure was City Mall, one of the largest in Lebanon. Some hospitals have warned they will be forced to close if they are not supplied with diesel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/officials-meet-as-fuel-shortage-power-cuts-paralyze-lebanon/articleshow/85314415.cms||---
---||World||US imposes sanctions on Cuban officials, military unit over violence||WASHINGTON: The US Treasury Department said on Friday it was imposing sanctions on two Cuban Ministry of Interior officials and a military unit over the government's crackdown on protesters last month.  The department said it was sanctioning Romarico Vidal Sotomayor Garcia and Pedro Orlando Martinez Fernandez and the Tropas de Prevention of the Cuban Ministry of Revolutionary Armed Forces.  "Today's action shines a spotlight on additional perpetrators responsible for suppressing the Cuban people's calls for freedom and respect for human rights," said Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Twitter rejected the sanctions, calling them "US opportunistic measures against Cuba's Ministry of Interior officers and Armed Forces Prevention Troops. Such measures reflect double standards of a government used to manipulation and lies to maintain the blockade against #Cuba."  In July, the US put sanctions on the Cuban police force and two of its leaders.  The protests erupted in July amid Communist-ruled Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of its old ally, the Soviet Union, and a record surge in coronavirus infections. Thousands took to the streets, angry over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties, and the authorities' handling of the pandemic.  Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the unrest on the United States, which in recent years has tightened its decades-old trade embargo on the island. He has said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by US-orchestrated social media campaigns.  The US Treasury earlier announced sanctions on Cuba's defence minister and an interior ministry special forces unit over allegations of human rights abuses in the crackdown that followed the protests, in which hundreds of activists were detained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-imposes-sanctions-on-cuban-officials-military-unit-over-violence/articleshow/85315311.cms||---
---||Pune||Almost empty malls greet fully vaccinated patrons in the city||After a long halt, city malls are back in business, albeit with certain restrictions still in place. Currently operating till 8 pm, malls are allowed to function at 50 percent capacity and strict sanitation guidelines. Additionally, only those people who have taken both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine are allowed to enter the mall premises. This rule has reduced footfalls considerably, much to the dismay of mall authorities. Mall authorities also say that since a major chunk of the fully vaccinated population in Pune belongs to the 45+ age group, the malls’ target group, including collegians and young working professionals, are still unable to visit the establishments. No rise in footfall because of the fully jabbed rule Many people from the 18+ age bracket are yet to take their second vaccine dose, leading to a fall in the patrons that frequent malls. "Whatever footfall we have had in the past few days, it’s just 10 percent of what it should have ideally been, if there were no such restrictions. The mall is open, operations and services are on, there are operational costs involved, but there are no people coming in. It’s worse than when malls were shut,” laments Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, committee member-(SCAI) and COO, Amanora Mall. Revenues at an all-time low With restrictions in place, many malls have reported just a single digit revenue percentage over the last few days. So, despite reopening, there’s not much to look forward to for them, business-wise. "A major chunk of our customers who spend on shopping and eating at the mall fall in the below-45 age group and unfortunately, most of them have only received a single dose of the vaccine as of now. The footfalls and the sale is very low. Almost 80 percent of the retail earnings in the mall are from customers who are below the age of 45 years, and Gen Zs and millennials are a big source of revenue. Only about 10 percent of the crowd at the mall right now is between the 18-44 bracket of people who are fully vaccinated,” shares Vikas Ladhe, centre head, SGS Mall, Camp. The state government should take a fair decision: Mall authorities While mall owners are demoralised with the double vax rule, they have presented several proposals to higher authorities in bringing about some change. "As an association, we’ve written to the district collector to review the guidelines and permit partially vaccinated people to walk in too. Restaurants and other clothing outlets outside malls don’t have such rules, but malls do. It is disheartening to send your customers back," says Surjit. Another important suggestion that was given by the malls was about setting up RT PCR testing facilities in their premises. "We have proposed a few changes and relaxations in the guidelines and hope that the authorities will either allow people with single-dose vaccination to enter the mall or help us with RT-PCR testing facilities so that we know that the person who has taken a single dose is not COVID positive. Only when such flexibility is given can an extension in the deadline help our sales," says Vikas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/almost-empty-malls-greet-fully-vaccinated-patrons-in-the-city/articleshow/85311187.cms||Sushmita Jha

In a video message, Johnson defended the withdrawal of UK forces from the country, saying that there is not a military solution to the current crisis in Afghanistan. On Thursday, UK announced that it would deploy 600 UK troops to Afghanistan to help evacuate Britons. "As everybody can see, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. And I said in the House of Commons a few weeks ago we could see this coming from some time. We would have to make preparations to pull out and that's what's going on now that moment has now come so in the course of the next few days we will see the vast bulk of UK embassy staff, officials come back," he said. The prime minister also vowed to step up efforts to bring back Afghans, who helped the UK and international forces throughout the last 20 years. Johnson's remarks come as Taliban terrorists have taken control of half of Afghanistan's provinces weeks after the US and other forces announced the withdrawal of their troops from Afghanistan. Amid rising violence, several countries including the US and India have asked their citizens to leave the war-torn country immediately. Appreciating the role played by UK armed forces in Afghanistan, the prime minister said: "Thanks to the country's armed service, we have seen no Al Qaeda attacks against the West for a very long time." The violence in Afghanistan has escalated as the Taliban terrorists have been on a military rampage. Heavy fightings are underway in several cities in Afghanistan. Taliban has toppled six provincial capitals in the past 24 hours which brings the total number of provinces fallen to the terrorists to 18, local media reported on Friday. Khaama Press reported that centres of Kandahar, Helmand, Herat, Badghis, Ghor, Logar, Zabul, and Oruzgan provinces fell to the Taliban in the past 24 hours. Apart from said provinces, there are also other provinces like Paktia and Wardak where the Afghan government forces only control the provincial capitals and the Taliban are controlling the rest of the geography, it reported further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/vast-bulk-of-evacuation-of-uk-embassy-staff-officials-from-afghanistan-in-coming-days-pm-johnson/articleshow/85315467.cms||---

---||World||Marine vanguard lands in Kabul as US speeds up evacuations||WASHINGTON: The first forces of a Marine battalion arrived in Kabul on Friday to stand guard as the US speeds up evacuation flights for some American diplomats and thousands of Afghans, spurred by a lightning Taliban offensive that increasingly is isolating Afghanistan's capital. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said "elements" of a battalion were now in Kabul, the vanguard of three Marine and Army battalions that the US was sending to the city by the end of the weekend to help more Americans and their Afghan colleagues get out quickly.  The Taliban, emboldened by the imminent end of the US combat mission in the country, took four more provincial capitals Friday, heightening fears they would move soon on the capital, which is home to millions of Afghans. "Clearly from their actions, it appears as if they are trying to get Kabul isolated," Kirby noted at a Pentagon briefing.  The Pentagon also was moving an additional 4,500 to 5,000 troops to bases in the Gulf countries of Qatar and Kuwait, including 1,000 to Qatar to speed up visa processing for Afghan translators and others who fear retribution from the Taliban for their past work with Americans, and their family members.  The remainder - 3,500 to 4,000 troops from a combat brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division - were bound for Kuwait. Kirby said the combat troops would be a reserve force on standby "in case we need even more" than the 3,000 going to Kabul.  The temporary buildup of troops for US evacuations highlights the stunning pace of the Taliban takeover of much of the country, less than three weeks before the US is set to officially end nearly 20 years of combat in Afghanistan.  President Joe Biden has remained adamant about ending the US mission on Aug. 31, insisting the American and NATO mission that launched on Oct. 7, 2001, has done what it could to build up a Kabul-based Afghan government and military that could withstand the Taliban when Western troops finally withdrew.  Friday's latest significant blow was the Taliban capture of the capital of Helmand province, where American, British and other allied NATO forces fought some of the bloodiest battles in the past 20 years. Hundreds of Western troops died there during the course of the war, in fighting that often succeeded in knocking back Taliban fighters locally, only to have the Taliban move back in when a Western unit rotated out.  The State Department said the embassy in Kabul will remain partially staffed and functioning, but Thursday's decision to evacuate a significant number of embassy staff and bring in the thousands of additional US troops is a sign of waning confidence in the Afghan government's ability to hold off the Taliban surge. The Biden administration has not ruled out a full embassy evacuation.  The US had already withdrawn most of its troops, but had kept about 650 troops in Afghanistan to support U.S. diplomatic security, including at the airport.  The Biden administration warned Taliban officials directly that the US would respond if the Taliban attacked Americans during the stepped-up deployments and evacuations.  Americans are preparing a military base abroad to receive and house large numbers of those Afghan translators and others as their visa applications are processed. The Biden administration has not identified the base, but earlier was talking with both Kuwait and Qatar about using US bases there for the temporary relocations.  As of Thursday, the US had flown 1,200 Afghans - former American employees and their families whose visas are farthest along in the approval process - to Fort Lee, Virginia.  State Department spokesman Ned Price said the US soon will have evacuation planes flying out daily, for those Afghan translators and others who manage to reach the Kabul airport despite the fighting.  The number of Afghans flown out under the special visa program is going to "grow very quickly in the coming days," Price said Thursday.  The viability of the US-trained Afghan army was looking increasingly dim. A new military assessment says Kabul could come under Taliban pressure as soon as September and, if current trends hold, the country could fall to the Taliban within a few months.  Shortly before Price's announcement of the evacuation of some embassy staff, the embassy urged US citizens to leave immediately - reiterating a warning it first issued Saturday.  The latest drawdown will further limit the ability of the embassy to conduct business, although Price maintained it would still be able to function. Nonessential personal had already been withdrawn from the embassy in April after Biden's withdrawal announcement that same month, and it was not immediately clear how many staffers would remain on the heavily fortified compound. As of Thursday, there were roughly 4,200 staffers at the embassy, but most of those are Afghan nationals, according to the State Department.  Apart from a complete evacuation and shuttering of the embassy, Price said other contingency plans were being weighed, including possibly relocating its operations to the airport.  Britain also was sending 600 troops to Afghanistan on a short-term basis to help its nationals leave the country.  Canada was sending special forces to help Canadian staff leave Kabul, a source familiar with the plan told The Associated Press. That official, who was not authorized to talk publicly about the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity, did not say how many special forces would be sent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/marine-vanguard-lands-in-kabul-as-us-speeds-up-evacuations/articleshow/85315564.cms||---
---||World||On Lithuania's border, a former Afghan soldier is caught between war and politics||KAZITISKIS, LITHUANIA: As Taliban fighters seized a series of provincial cities across Afghanistan, thousands of kilometres away in a makeshift refugee camp in eastern Lithuania, former Afghan soldier Fazel Rahman looked back on a war he abandoned two months ago. He said he had been warned by Taliban sympathizers in his home village that his life would be in danger unless he joined them, but he didn't see that as an option so he decided to follow the path that tens of thousands of other Afghans have already taken and make his way to Europe. "The situation in our country has got worse. The Taliban killed my cousin," said Fazel Rahman, who served for 15 years in the Afghan army. "I fled with my kids because they threatened me, warning me to leave my duty." Now waiting in a former school building in the village of Kazitiskis in the Ignalina region of Lithuania, he has found himself in the middle of a standoff between Belarus and the European Union. The EU accuses Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko of using the refugee crisis to pressure the bloc to reverse sanctions it placed on the country over a disputed presidential election last August and its treatment of political opposition. With the Afghan capital Kabul now close to being besieged by the Taliban after a lightning campaign that followed the withdrawal of most US forces last month, politicians in Europe are becoming increasingly concerned that more irregular migrants like Fazel Rahman may come. The European Union border agency Frontex has already noted an increase in people coming from Afghanistan and Syria through the Western Balkans. Hanging around with about 130 others in a metal enclosure outside the former school building, Fazel Rahman waits, chatting with others as laundry dries on the fence and children play in the dust and mud. The camp is fitted with foldout beds and showers, and it provides a temporary haven from the harsh journey, during which he said he was beaten severely by border guards. "Even in a war, soldiers don't treat people like I was treated," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/on-lithuanias-border-a-former-afghan-soldier-is-caught-between-war-and-politics/articleshow/85315566.cms||---

The Taliban have been inching closer to Kabul and full control of Afghanistan, fueling fears of a return to their brutal regime that was toppled by the United States-led 2001 invasion. "I'm... deeply disturbed by early indications that that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas under their control, particularly targeting women and journalists," Guterres told reporters. "It is particularly horrifying and heartbreaking to see reports of the hard won rights of Afghan girls and women being ripped away," he added. The UN chief warned that "directing attacks against civilians is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and amounts to a war crime." Security forces in Afghanistan have capitulated on fronts, with individual soldiers, units and even whole divisions surrendering - handing the insurgents even more vehicles and military hardware to fuel their lightning advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-imposing-horrifying-curbs-on-afghan-womens-rights-un/articleshow/85315829.cms||---

Firefighters pulled one person from wood planking and roof debris about 6:20 a.m. at the La Bonita market east of the Las Vegas Strip, and that person and three others were taken to a hospital for treatment, Clark County Fire Battalion Chief Steve Broadwell told reporters. Broadwell said no life-threatening injuries were reported.  It was not immediately clear how many people were inside the building at the time. The store was scheduled to open at 6 a.m. Broadwell said the store would have been busier later in the day.  Store owner Jaime Martinez did not immediately respond to a telephone message.  Vendor Michael Martial told the Las Vegas Review-Journal he was walking toward the store when the front of the building crumbled forward.  "There were three homeless people trapped under it," Martial said. "Two were able to get out on their own free will. The third one was actually hit in the back of the head. He was gushing blood."  Martial told the newspaper that he called 911 and tried to help the injured man. He also said firefighters arrived "extremely fast" and pulled a person from the rubble. Photos showed debris piled in front of a sign reading "Bienvenidos" in Spanish, or "welcome."  Broadwell said no one else was injured and there was little damage to the interior of the store.  Deli supervisor Adolfo Navarrete told the Review-Journal he and more than a dozen other employees scrambled out of the back of the building to safety.  "I just see the windows breaking like it is an earthquake," he said. "And I look behind me and I see a bunch of debris and dust."  The store is in a strip mall built in 1979 with businesses including a restaurant and clothing, ice cream and beauty supply stores.  Broadwell said it did not appear that other shops were damaged and the investigation was turned over to county officials to check for structural strength.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/las-vegas-grocery-storefront-collapses-at-opening-injures-4/articleshow/85315908.cms||---

According to Qatar, China and Pakistan were among the countries who said they won't recognise any violent takeover in a separate meeting in Doha on August 10 this week. The bad news continued to pour in from Afghanistan Friday about the Taliban military offensive with reports saying that the insurgents were close to taking control of India's showpiece infrastructure project Salma dam, also called India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam, in the Herat province. The dam had been inaugurated in 2016 by President Ashraf Ghani and PM Narendra Modi. The province capital and Afghanistan's third-largest city, Herat city, also fell to the Taliban, reports from Afghanistan said. Read AlsoTaliban take Kandahar, Kabul just 40km awayThe fall of Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second-largest city and the former headquarters of the Taliban movement, in the south to the insurgents in the early hours of Friday was followed by the swift retreat of government forces from at least six other provincial capitals. These stunning, and rapid,Efforts to arrive at a political settlement in Doha have continued despite the apparent Taliban atrocities. Qatar held a meeting on August 10 first with the US, China, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, UK, UN and EU in Doha and followed it up with another meeting separately on August 12 with representatives of India, Germany, Norway, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Turkmenistan. According to Qatar, all participants in both meetings urged the Afghan government and Taliban to take steps to build trust and accelerate efforts to reach a political settlement and comprehensive ceasefire as quickly as possible. "Participants reaffirmed that they will not recognize any government in Afghanistan that is imposed through the use of military force," said the Qatar foreign ministry. This is also contrary to reports that China was looking to recognise the Taliban after it takes over Kabul. They also took note of statements by both sides on the "guiding principles" for a political settlement that included a commitment not to allow any individual or groups to use the soil of Afghanistan "to threaten the security of other countries". This has been one of India's primary concerns as the Taliban insurgents threaten to take over the country by force. The other guiding principles include inclusive governance, respect for human rights, including the rights of women and minorities, a mechanism to deliver a representative government and respect for international law, including international humanitarian law. The participants also raised "grave concerns" about reports from across Afghanistan about large numbers of civilian casualties and extra-judicial killings, also "widespread and credible allegations of human rights violations, all attacks (ground and air) against provincial capitals and cities, and the destruction of physical infrastructure that perpetuate conflict and make reconciliation efforts more difficult".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wont-recognise-any-afghan-government-imposed-by-force-india-others-at-doha-meet/articleshow/85315316.cms||Sachin Parashar

The boot was on the first lady's left foot Friday as she and President Joe Biden boarded a helicopter in Delaware to fly to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland. She also held onto crutches.  President Biden helped her navigate a short flight of stairs onto the chopper.  The first lady punctured her foot in late July during a beach walk in Hawaii, where she flew for official events after participating in the opening of the Tokyo Olympics, the White House said.  She returned to Washington on July 26 and received outpatient treatment at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, on July 29. President Biden joined his wife at the hospital.  Her spokesperson, Michael LaRosa, said it wasn't known what caused the puncture, but the wound was cleaned, was not infected and was expected to "heal nicely."  The first lady had not been seen in public since she returned from Hawaii.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/jill-biden-wears-medical-boot-after-foot-injury-in-hawaii/articleshow/85316086.cms||---
---||World||US immigration advocates blast 'cruel' Biden policies on asylum||WASHINGTON: Dozens of pro-immigrant groups criticized President Joe Biden's asylum policies on Friday, saying continued expulsions of migrants at the US-Mexico border and other deterrent measures were "cruel, unlawful and ineffective." In a letter to Biden and his top immigration officials, more than 80 organizations urged the Democratic president to restore the ability of all migrants to claim asylum in the United States and eschew any new policies that limit asylum access. Promising a more humane immigration approach, Biden has reversed many of the restrictive immigration policies of his Republican predecessor, former President Donald Trump. But the Democratic president has kept one of Trump's most limiting measures which allows US authorities to expel migrants caught crossing the southern border back to Mexico. The groups urged Biden not to adopt any policies that force migrants to wait in Mexico for the resolution of their US cases, which they said "would unquestionably put individuals in danger and violate US asylum law." Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on Thursday that the United States would expand an online asylum registration system in the hopes migrants will apply remotely, adding that more changes would be announced in the coming days. Mayorkas did not say which asylum seekers would be eligible to use the online system. Last week, the Biden administration began flying some Central American and Mexican migrants caught at the US-Mexico border to southern Mexico in an effort to deter crossers. In the letter to Biden, the groups said they were "gravely concerned" about the flights to southern Mexico and reports that migrants were then bused to a remote part of Guatemala. Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the Los Angeles-based National Immigration Law Center, which signed the letter, said the flights signaled the Biden administration was taking a more restrictive stance. She said it appears Biden is focusing only on arrests and deportation and not on the rights of the asylum seekers as his promises of a more humane approach implied. "That absolutely contradicts what the Biden administration said they were going to do," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-immigration-advocates-blast-cruel-biden-policies-on-asylum/articleshow/85316059.cms||---
---||World||Venezuela government, opponents to launch talks in Mexico||MEXICO CITY: Venezuela's government and opposition are set to launch a new round of negotiations on Friday in Mexico in another attempt to end a crippling political and economic crisis. The issues of sanctions, elections and political prisoners are on the table, but President Nicolas Maduro has warned he will not bow to "blackmail" by the United States. The two sides will sit down at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City to begin the dialogue mediated by Norway and hosted by the Mexican government. Talks in the Dominican Republic in 2018 and Barbados the next year failed to resolve disputes centered on Maduro and Juan Guaido, the opposition leader considered president by about 60 countries. The parties are due to meet again on August 30 to discuss a seven-point agenda that does not include the departure of Maduro, accused by the opposition of having been fraudulently reelected in 2018. There could be a softening of certain sanctions and progress on issues such as political prisoners, but Maduro is not on the brink of leaving power, said Luis Vicente Leon, director of Venezuelan pollsters Datanalisis. The South American nation's economic crisis has been deepened by a raft of fresh sanctions imposed by Washington following the contested election. The United States has urged Maduro, a former bus driver who became president on the death of his mentor Hugo Chavez in 2013, to make serious efforts toward holding elections if he wants sanctions relief. In a state television broadcast on Thursday, Maduro said his country would go to the talks "autonomously and independently and does not submit to blackmail or threats from the United States government." Earlier, Maduro said he was seeking an "immediate lifting of all the criminal sanctions" led by the United States, which in 2019 said it no longer considered him the legitimate president after wide allegations of electoral irregularities. US state department spokesman Ned Price said the sanctions, which include an oil embargo, were aimed at "promoting accountability" on democracy and human rights. "We've also been clear that the Maduro regime can create a path to easing sanctions by allowing Venezuelans to participate in long overdue free and fair presidential, parliamentary and local elections," Price told reporters. Maduro will be represented by a delegation headed by parliament speaker Jorge Rodriguez and the president's son Nicolas Maduro Guerra, who is also a politician. The opposition team will be led by the politician and lawyer Gerardo Blyde and include Guaido's foreign policy chief, Julio Borges, and other former lawmakers. Guaido, who declared himself Venezuela's president in 2019 through his position as parliament speaker, wants guarantees over electoral conditions and a clear program for presidential elections, as well as the release of political prisoners. Maduro never lost control of the country's institutions, in particular the armed forces, while Guaido was replaced as parliament speaker after the opposition boycotted legislative elections in December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/venezuela-government-opponents-to-launch-talks-in-mexico/articleshow/85316210.cms||---
---||India||Government releases Rs 7,200 crore to get 3rd-wave-ready||NEW DELHI: Drawing from the experience of the second wave of Covid infections to prepare for a third if it does strike in coming months, the health ministry has approved release of over Rs 7,200 crore or 50% of the Centre’s share in the Rs 23,123 crore emergency response package announced in July. The ministry is hopeful that all 1,755 PSA oxygen generating plants will get commissioned by the end of August. If oxygen plants to be set-up by PSUs are also taken into account, a total of 2,200 such plants will be functioning in the near future. At present, around 375 plants have been commissioned across states and 500 are at an advanced stage and likely to be set-up soon, official sources said. The government is focused on medical infrastructure, buffer stock of medicines and oxygen availability right down to the district level as priority areas under the emergency response package to prevent the possibility of the shortages that happened when the second wave struck. As per guidelines of the response package, the ministry is targeting district level oxygen availability with at least one 10,000 kilo litre oxygen tank on standby. It is also part of the plan to install 961 Liquid Medical Oxygen storage tanks with support to 1,450 facilities for Medical Gas Pipeline System (MGPS), with an aim to support at least one such unit per district. The health ministry is preparing against the benchmark of the peak of case load reached in the second wave in May and also taking into account the challenges that Delta and Delta Plus variants have presented. The ‘India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package: Phase-II (ECRP-II package)’ amounting Rs 23,123 crore was approved by the Cabinet on July 8. The fund sharing is Centre and state in the 60:40 ratio. This scheme is to be implemented over nine months from July 1 to March 31. A little over Rs 1,827 crore was released of the central share in July to states as advance to undertake preparatory activities. On Friday, based on plans submitted by states, the health ministry approved release of another 35% of the total central share of Rs 14,744 crore. According to sources, the ministry’s decision to release these funds at the initial stages itself is rooted in the thought that they want the states to have the funds to go ahead and deliver the needful. It is also seen as an attempt to prevent the blame-game that unfolded over oxygen availability and supply during the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-releases-rs-7200-crore-to-get-3rd-wave-ready/articleshow/85316161.cms||---
---||World||NY let childhood sex abuse victims sue; 9,000 went to court||ALBANY: For two years, New York temporarily set aside its usual time limit on civil lawsuits in order to allow victims of childhood sexual abuse to sue churches, hospitals, schools, camps, scout groups and other institutions and people they hold responsible for enabling pedophiles or turning a blind eye to wrongdoing.  That window closes Saturday, after more than 9,000 lawsuits were filed, a deluge whose impact may be felt for many years.  Four of the state's Roman Catholic dioceses have filed for bankruptcy partly as a result of litigation unleashed by the state's Child Victims Act. Thousands of new allegations against priests, teachers, scout leaders and other authorities have intensified the already harsh light on institutions entrusted with caring for children.  And survivors of abuse have been given an outlet for their trauma and a chance at accountability once thought long lost.  "This has, ironically, been a very healing experience for me on a personal level," said Carol DuPre, 74, who sued the Roman Catholic diocese in Rochester, saying she was molested by a priest as a teen in the early 1960s as she counted offerings and typed up bulletins after church services.  She put the events "in a storehouse in her mind," but it still haunted her for decades. When the chance came to file a suit, it was an easy decision.  "The idea of confronting it, talking about it and dealing with it is internally setting me free."  New York is among a number of states that have in recent years established windows allowing people to sue over childhood abuse no matter how long ago it took place. Similar windows were opened in New Jersey and California.  Ordinarily, courts put deadlines on suing because of the difficulty in holding a fair trial over incidents that happened many years ago. Witnesses die or move away. Records are lost. Memories fade. But lawmakers believed that, despite those hurdles, victims deserved an opportunity for justice and might feel emboldened now to speak up about things they've kept to themselves for many years.  New York's one-year window was originally supposed to end Aug. 14, 2020, but it was extended twice amid concerns that the coronavirus pandemic and resulting court disruptions were keeping survivors from coming forward.  Barring another extension, electronic filings will be accepted until midnight Saturday, according to a state courts spokesperson.  The tsunami of litigation surprised even some of the lawyers who work regularly with alleged abuse victims.  "We thought maybe we get one hundred cases or a couple hundred cases and here we are," said attorney James Marsh, whose firm has filed about 800 cases. "We woefully miscalculated the interest there."  Plaintiffs' lawyers said potential clients were still coming forward as the deadline neared, some gaining the strength after seeing stories of others filing suits. Attorney Jeff Anderson said some survivors wait until the last minute because of the difficulty of coming forward.  And some will not have gained the strength to come forward before the window closes, said attorney Mitchell Garabedian.  "A court deadline that's been publicized encourages many victims and survivors to come forward," Garabedian said. "But to other victims and survivors, it's meaningless."  Some have struggled over whether to publicly expose old wounds.  "It was not an easy decision," said Donna Ashton, a 56-year-old Rochester-area woman who filed a lawsuit in June claiming she was abused as a teen by the musical director at a Baptist church. "You have to unearth and relive the trauma that you had when you were a young person."  She married the man at age 19 after what the lawsuit said was manipulation, grooming and abuse. The church has disputed the allegations.  "I had children with him and I had to make sure that that was OK with them and that they were OK with me coming forward with this," she said.  Thousands of the cases filed in New York involve religious institutions, according to court data.  Experts caution it's too early to estimate liability for church-related entities in the state. Though Anderson, who calls New York the "main battleground," expects it to be in the billions of dollars.  The Diocese of Rockville Centre on Long Island cited the "severe" financial burden from litigation when it became the largest diocese in the United States to declare bankruptcy last October. Half of New York's eight Roman Catholic dioceses have filed for bankruptcy, starting with the Diocese of Rochester in 2019.  "Whatever financial pain the Church suffers as a result of this crisis pales in comparison to the life-altering suffering of survivors," Dennis Poust, executive director of the New York State Catholic Conference, said in an email.  Poust said bishops are focused now on resolving the civil claims in a way that satisfies those who have been harmed while preserving the church's charitable, educational and sacramental ministries.  The bankruptcies allow dioceses to consolidate victims' lawsuits and negotiate with the claimants as a single class.  For instance, the Boy Scouts of America sought bankruptcy protection in February 2020 and last month reached an $850 million agreement with attorneys representing tens of thousands of victims of child sex abuse.  Attorneys see the closing window as the start of another intense phase as individual cases are considered and bankruptcies proceed. The cut-off for new Child Victims Act filings could lead to resolutions because defendants will now know how many claims they are dealing with.  "It's still early in the process because the window hasn't closed yet," Anderson said. "And once it does, we'll see more progress."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ny-let-childhood-sex-abuse-victims-sue-9000-went-to-court/articleshow/85316370.cms||---
---||India||Tough action likely against opposition MPs for Rajya Sabha scuffles||NEW DELHI: Tough action is being contemplated against opposition MPs named by the Rajya Sabha secretariat in its report on the fracas in the House on Wednesday when the general insurance bill was taken up for passage. Discussions held with officials by Vice-President and Rajya Sabha Chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu have led to the assessment that the pulling and shoving in the House was initiated by a set of opposition MPs determined to approach the officials' table and physically disrupt proceedings. Naidu is also understood to have conferred with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla over the physical aspect of disruptions during the monsoon session and it was felt that there is need for disciplinary action to prevent further deterioration in the conduct of MPs in Parliament. The immediate context, however, remains the incidents in the Upper House on Tuesday and Wednesday when some MPs clambered onto the officials' table and two marshals were injured in the melee. The Parliament security staff have lodged complaints about the actions of certain MPs that led to injuries to two staffers. They have also compiled the television coverage of the events from multiple cameras placed inside the House. The process of the disciplinary action is to be finalised and the RS secretariat is studying past instances where action was taken against MPs for conduct in the House or for other misdemeanours. On a few occasions, a committee was set to review the matter and submit recommendations, as was the case in the "cash for questions" scam which led to 11 MPs being expelled for the remainder of their terms. Sources said Naidu was upset over the turn of events and that the actions of the MPs suggested they were determined to prevent passage of legislations at all costs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tough-action-likely-against-opposition-mps-for-rajya-sabha-scuffles/articleshow/85316371.cms||---
---||India||Amid growing storm, Twitter transfers India head Manish Maheshwari to US||NEW DELHI: Amidst serious legal and regulatory troubles in India, American micro-blogging giant Twitter has transferred its country director for India, Manish Maheshwari, to San Francisco in a new role and has done away with the post, forming a “leadership council” to run its operations in the country. Senior functionaries – Kanika Mittal and Neha Sharma Katyal – will continue to lead the India sales roles and now report to Yu Sasamoto, who is the vice-president for the company’s Japan, South Korea and Asia-Pacific (JAPAC) region. Maheshwari, who was leading Twitter’s India operations over the past two years, will now be in-charge of Twitter’s “Revenue Strategy and Operations” for new markets worldwide. This caps a tumultuous tenure in the country where he saw multiple FIRs and police cases being filed against him over a variety of legal issues following the rollout of new IT Rules. It’s not yet clear whether Maheshwari can simply walk out of the country to take up the new assignment, or whether he would first need to tackle the legal and IPC cases where he has been named as a party/accused along with Twitter. Asked about the issue, Twitter India refused comment. Twitter has decided that instead of a country director, a leadership council will guide its operations in India. This council is likely to have personnel such as Mittal (responsible for leading Twitter’s business in north and east India) and Katyal (who heads the western and southern region businesses). Amongst other senior functionaries, Krishna Iyer – who is the head of channel sales for Twitter India – will now report to global business partners and Mitchell Kreuch, who leads APAC “agency development” function. He is also a likely member of the leadership council. “Instead of a single country director, our wonderful India leadership council will guide and support you all as a team moving forward,” a senior Twitter official said in a communication to India team members, adding that the company will “continue to invest in India as a strategic, high-growth market for our company.” Twitter has been in the middle of a massive political slug-fest in India over the past few months, first being accused by the ruling BJP and the NDA government of trying to “dictate” its terms while using “opaque policies” to “arbitrarily” suspend user accounts and delete tweets. This related to a variety of issues, such as Twitter’s reluctance to take down around 1,400 accounts linked to the farmers protests and its tagging as “manipulated media” some of the content put out by top BJP members. And as it was attacked over its slow pace in appointing statutory officers in India despite the mandate under the new IT Rules, Twitter had also taken on the government when – in a surprisingly scathing attack – it accused the government of engaging in a “dangerous overreach that is inconsistent with open, democratic principles”. In a statement on May 27, Twitter alleged that it had been forced to “withhold” (block in India) portions of “legitimate free speech” over fears around the safety of its employees and threats of financial penalties. Recently, however, it seemed to have made peace with the government but now has been accused by opposition Congress and its top leader Rahul Gandhi of bias and interference in the country’s political processes, for blocking the accounts of many functionaries of the party. Twitter said it had taken the action after Congress and its leaders had shared pictures (in tweets) of the family of a nine-year-old victim who is alleged to have been raped and murdered in Delhi. The matter has again brought the company and the way it moderates content to the fore. The company has also appointed officers in India to answer user queries related to the content and coordinate with the government.

Private vehicles of more than 20-year vintage and commercial vehicles older than 15 years will be scrapped if they don’t pass the fitness test. While launching the National Vehicle Scrapping Policy, Modi said the move would help create wealth from waste, a concept followed in developed countries, and called for India to work towards “clean, congestion free and convenient mobility” in the 21st century. However, many old vehicles in Delhi-NCR won’t get the benefit as their age, and not fitness, has been made the criterion for retirement by NGT and the Supreme Court. Union road transport minister, Nitin Gadkari had earlier said the Centre will take legal advice on whether it should seek the review of NGT and SC order after announcement of the policy. Highlighting the need to protect the environment and reduce exploitation of natural resources, Modi said, “Rare metals are already rare. But who knows even the metals in abundance will also become rare,” as he added that the impact of climate change is now being felt by all. He said the generation of metal meant for vehicle manufacturing from scrapped vehicles will save huge amounts being paid for import of scrap while pointing out that reuse is also a way to cut down on exploitation of natural resources. India imported scrap material worth Rs 23,000 crore last year, the PM said. Union road transport and highways minister, Nitin Gadkari said the roll out of the long awaited policy will increase the supply of raw materials at low cost for vehicle manufacturing as the scrapped materials can be reused. Gadkari said nearly one crore vehicles have been found without valid fitness certificates and registration certificates. Union transport secretary Giridhar Aramane said the pollution concerns may force courts and state administration to ban old vehicles as he pitched for the need to set up more vehicle scrapping centres in the country. Earlier, the PM also said the new policy will promote a circular economy and make the process of economic development more sustainable and environment-friendly. “The policy, aimed at recycling old and unfit vehicles, will give a new identity to India’s mobility and auto sector,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fitness-to-be-criterion-to-scrap-vehicles-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/85316554.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Bengaluru||RT-PCR negative certificate must for travellers returning to flats in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Residents of apartment complexes and gated communities who are returning to Bengaluru following inter-state travel are mandated to carry RT-PCR negative reports (not older than 72 hours). If they are not carrying such reports, they should compulsorily undergo an RTPCR test and stay in home quarantine till the results are out. This is part of the latest measures announced by BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta in the backdrop of an increase in the number of Covid clusters and containment zones in the city. There were more than 160 containment zones in the city and half of these are apartments. Kids above 3 to wear mask in open spaces: BBMPIn a note to resident welfare associations (RWAs) and management committees of apartments, housing societies and gated communities, Gupta stated: “If any resident or his/ her family members has undertaken interstate travel, it is suggested to ensure they are tested. This rule shall be applied for official travel too.” The advisory is silent on exempting those completely vaccinated from producing the negative test report. While emphasizing on strict adherence to Covid protocols such as masking and distancing, the chief commissioner’s note suggests the apartment associations and committees to maintain a comprehensive list of all nonresidents visiting or accessing the complex. While allowing the common areas to be used with Covid-appropriate behavior, the associations/ committees are to ensure that these places do not get converted into socializing or meeting points for residents. The BBMP note states that children above three years should wear masks while in open spaces/play areas and conduct of group classes/ group activities should be avoided. Gupta stated that if three or more cases are reported within 100 metres in a housing society or gated community, the it will be declared a cluster and that house, along with all adjoining houses within 100 metres, will be notified as containment zone. In case of an apartment, if a cluster is detected on a single floor, that floor along with one below and above it will be declared a containment zone. Containment zones shall remain active for a minimum of 14 days from the date of declaration of the last detected positive case. The BBMP directive suggests RWAs to form task forces for effective communication, surveillance and containment of Covid. The RWAs have been instructed not to stigmatise, harass or abuse any affected resident of family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/-ve-cert-must-for-travellers-returning-to-flats-in-bluru/articleshow/85316821.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Arun Singh likely to visit Bengaluru next week to quell discontent||BENGALURU: With the government still struggling to overcome initial hiccups after Basavaraj Bommai took over as chief minister, BJP has decided to send national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka Arun Singh to Bengaluru to address the issues. Singh is expected to arrive next week, and party sources said he will speak to legislators and ministers in a bid to douse the discontent which surfaced after cabinet expansion and allocation of portfolios. The stated objective of replacing BS Yediyurappa was to ensure equitable representation and distribution of resources among regions and infusing fresh blood into the cabinet. To the dismay of ruling party legislators, both the objectives remained unmet as the new cabinet accommodated only seven first-timers while most of the old guard returned. “Regions like Kodagu, identified as BJP’s stronghold, have been utterly neglected. It is heartbreaking for people of the district that it has no representation despite BJP sweeping all recent elections,” said Madikeri MLA Appachu Ranjan. He said the district has been ‘Congress-free’ for about two decades, thanks to the overwhelming support of people to BJP. Madikeri was the only city corporation where BJP won when 10 urban local bodies (ULBs) across Karnataka went to polls in April, while Congress won seven. “Kodagu faced devastating floods for two successive years. Of the Rs 546 crore package announced, only Rs 200 crore has been released so far and people’s pleas are falling on deaf ears. Many districts are facing similar problems. We thought the change of guard will address this issue, but the new dispensation is more disappointing,” said Ranjan, pointing out that 13 districts are not being represented in the cabinet. The discontent came to a head on Tuesday when Mudigere MLA MP Kumaraswamy staged a dharna on Vidhana Soudha premises, much to the embarrassment of the ruling party, in protest of the government neglecting his taluk in Chikkamagaluru district in terms of flood relief. Many ministers are openly cribbing about insignificant portfolios given to them, with a major chunk of the funds going to two departments — irrigation and PWD (63% of capital expenditure estimated at Rs 43,358 crore). While minister Anand Singh’s rebellion came out in the open, many disgruntled legislators, including CP Yogeeshwara and Aravind Bellad, are camping in New Delhi. The brass views the developments as ominous, especially ahead of elections to three ULBs — Belagavi, Hubballi-Dharwad and Kalaburagi — scheduled for next month, which are expected to be followed by zilla and taluk panchayat polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/arun-singh-likely-to-visit-city-next-week-to-quell-discontent/articleshow/85310794.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

The vendors who were found selling tobacco products are being fined for violating Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (Cotpa)- 2003. District health officer (DHO) Dr Dhananjay told TOI that a fine amount of Rs 4.86 lakh has been collected. “The drive against tobacco use and sale in Mandya district is highest in the state. We have collected more than Rs 4.86 lakh fine from the violators. Raids on shops and people who smoke at public places are being intensified,” he said. Dr Dhananjay said that the district-level committee, which is the enforcing body of implementation of Cotpa, keeps holding quarterly meeting to ensure its effective implementation. “Our drive against tobacco use is a prolonged effort. We are concentrating on shops which are selling tobacco products within 100m radius of educational institutions. Also, we are fining persons who are smoking publicly and not complying with the provisions of Cotpa, including the one on pictorial warning,” he said, adding: “What is most shocking is the detection of ecigarettes which are prohibited in India. For the first time, we have seized e-cigarettes too.” These banned products appear to have been smuggled into the district. “We are coordinating the raids with other departments concerned. We are fully committed to implementing Cotpa in the district,” Dr Dhanajay said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/tobacco-shops-near-schools-raided/articleshow/85309387.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Plastics under 75 microns to be banned from September 30, says minister Nilesh Cabral||PANAJI: The Union environment ministry on Thursday issued a notification which will begin the process of banning single-use plastics across the country. The complete ban will come into effect from July 1, 2022. But single-use plastics will be banned in phases starting with bags under 75 microns from September 30. At present, there is already a ban on use of plastic bags below 50 microns in the state, which has now been upgraded to 75 microns. Goa environment minister Nilesh Cabral told TOI that a meeting headed by the chief secretary has already been held to begin deliberations on implementation of the new norms. There is already a ban on single-use plastics in Goa. Now, the use of plastic bags below 75 microns (will be) prohibited. The implementation has to be carried out through municipalities and panchayats. We have to see how this implementation is made effective,” Cabral said. In 2017, then CM Manohar Parrikar had first announced the government’s plans to impose a ban on use of plastic bags from the following year. In October 2019, the state government had notified a ban on use of single-use plastics in all its offices. The state was also early in imposing a ban on plastic below 40 microns in 2002 — upgraded to 50 microns by the Centre a few years back — but the enforcement regimen has been lacking. The new norms of the Union environment ministry are meant to deal with the menace of huge dumps of plastic waste across the country with no means to process it. This is leading to clogging of drains and pollution of water bodies. From July 1, 2022, only polythene bags of 120 microns will be permitted to be used. The increase in thickness of plastic carry bags is expected to help improve their collection. The notification states that the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of single-use plastic will be prohibited with effect from July 1, 2022. Single-use plastic items include earbuds with plastic sticks, plastic sticks for balloons, plastic flags, candy sticks, ice-cream sticks, thermocol for decoration, plates, cups, glasses, cutlery such as forks, spoons, knives, straw, trays, wrapping or packaging films, invitation cards, and cigarette packets, plastic or PVC banners.

He also said the police are open to further forensic investigations based on the girl’s preserved viscera if the family demands for it. An inquest is an investigation into a death that appears to be due to unknown or unnatural causes. “All procedures and angles are being followed and investigated as per the protocol in a case of inquest. The autopsy report (of the girl) shows no sign of foul play or assault. If the family demands for it, further forensic investigations can be carried out,” Saxena told TOI. Following the autopsy, the body was handed over to her family and final rites were performed on Thursday. Meanwhile, residents of the village the girl hails from have questioned whether foul play could really be ruled out when her body was found in such inexplicable conditions. “The girl’s family is not financially well-off. She was the eldest of four children – three daughters and one son,” a panch said. The other children are still studying. She and her father were the only two earning members of the family. They should have asked for a second autopsy, but they needed to be guided by someone on it,” said a village panch member. The teenager was employed at a store in Porvorim. Her father dropped her off near Guirim junction on Wednesday morning before he could proceed to work and she was expected to take a bus to work from the junction. However, the parents received a call the same afternoon from the girl’s cousin who works near her workplace, informing them that their daughter had not reached her workplace when she went to meet her for lunch as usual. The victim girl’s family then filed a missing person’s complaint. Her body was discovered on Calangute beach the next morning and was identified by the family. “All villagers are of the opinion that something is not right. If the girl had drowned — considering she had committed suicide — would she have taken off her clothes before?” a villager asked. Calangute PI Nolasco Raposo said the police are still investigating how the girl was found at Calangute when her father had dropped her off at Guirim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-villagers-suspect-foul-play-inquest-begins-into-teens-death/articleshow/85314844.cms||---

There are 663 active black fungus cases as of August 10 out of the 4,609 infections recorded in the state. The fungal infection has, so far, claimed 432 lives. Altogether, 2,519 surgeries related to the black fungus infection were performed on patients. Chittoor reported the highest number of cases of 724, while West Godavari witnessed only 23 black fungus infections. The state health department currently has a stock of about 13,800 Amphotericin B injections, 35,700 posaconazole injections and 30,380 posaconazole tablets. Orders have been placed for about 27,700 more Amphotericin B injections that would be made available by the end of this month. According to medical experts, mucormycosis begins to manifest as a skin infection in the air pockets located behind the forehead, nose, cheekbones, and in between the eyes and teeth. It then spreads to the eyes, lungs and can even spread to the brain. It leads to blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing of blood. Andhra Medical College principal, Dr P V Sudhakar, said that Visakhapatnam district has so far recorded about 370 black fungus infections. “The district is now reporting an average of one case on every alternate day. The black fungus cases have reduced in tandem with decreasing Covid-19 infections,” said Dr Sudhakar. The health department has identified 17 hospitals under the government setup for mucormycosis treatment. However, private hospitals with expert doctors to treat the condition can admit patients by notifying the case to the government as black fungus has been made a notifiable disease. The state government has fixed a package of Rs 41,968 for the treatment under Aarogyasri. This is apart from the costs incurred on Amphotericin B and Posaconazole. However, the hospitals can raise additional pre-authorisation, if there is any need for additional surgical intervention for black fungus patients. For nasal involvement, which may need endoscopic sinus surgery, the package has been fixed at Rs 16,932. For orbital involvement, which may need procedures such as orbitotomy, surgical management of proptosis and exenteration of orbit, the maximum package has been fixed at Rs 50,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/black-fungus-cases-fall-as-aps-covid-tally-improves/articleshow/85312856.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

He also inspected a community kitchen at Musepur Chowk in Saran and spoke to the people taking meals there. Nitish also inspected a Covid vaccination centre being run near the community kitchen set up for the flood-hit people. The CM asked asked the district officials to ensure Covid testing of all people living near the community kitchen there and make a separate arrangement for those who are found infected. “Also ensure vaccination of all those left out,” Nitish told the officials. Nitish asked Saran DM Nilesh Chandra Deore to expand the sitting area at the community kitchen so that more people can eat there with ease. He further asked the officials to arrange tents and other essential items at the community kitchen. Accompanied by state water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, Nitish spoke to some elected people’s representatives in Saran and asked them to work in coordination with the district administration for proper distribution of relief materials among the affected people.

The sale has taken place at a fraction of the original asking price after the lender failed to find a buyer despite holding multiple auctions across several years. According to real estate industry experts, the banks had originally fixed an unrealistic reserve price as the property had several limitations. Being at the outskirts of the Mumbai airport, there is not much scope to develop the property. The building includes a basement, a ground floor, an upper-ground floor and an upper floor, measuring a total 1,586 square meters. It is housed on a 2,402-sq-mtr plot touching the Western Express Highway outside the Mumbai Airport. The proceeds of the sale will add to the lenders’ recovery against the airline’s loan account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kingfisher-house-sold-for-rs-52cr/articleshow/85315176.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Alternate-day jab plan for first & second dose recipients||KOLKATA: In an attempt to clear the second dose backlog for both Covishield and Covaxin, and streamline the vaccination process for first-dose recipients, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Friday decided to keep its vaccination clinics and mega centres open for recipients of first and second doses on alternate days. This rule will come into effect from Monday. Under the new rule, second-dose recipients will be able to receive their shots at the 144 KMC-run vaccination clinics and over 50 mega centres on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and first-dose recipients will get their shots on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. According to a KMC health official, the civic brass had to change the rule after witnessing anomalies in the current system which were partly responsible for a growth in second-dose backlog. “We have detected loopholes in the existing system at our clinics and mega centres where we were vaccinating recipients of both doses six days a week. At a point, the system led to a huge backlog of second dose. Then we decided to introduce two separate shifts, but that did not solve the problem. So we decided to change the rule,” a KMC health department official said. According to a KMC medical officer who has been assigned to run a vaccination clinic in Tollygunge, the new rule will also benefit those who have been waiting for their first dose. “If we receive a normal supply of vaccines, we will be able to administer shots to younger people who have been queuing up at our clinics but are often refused,” the civic official said. Besides streamlining the vaccination process, the new rule will also enable the KMC medical officers to run other routine investigations at the civic body’s urban primary health centres, which have been converted into temporary vaccination units. “After handling the pressure of vaccination since morning, our medical and para-medical staffers at the primary health centres were not able to offer citizens other crucial investigations, which include tests for malaria and dengue, immunization or routine check-ups. The new system will offer us some time to concentrate on these,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/alternate-day-jab-plan-for-1st-2nd-dose-recipients/articleshow/85311685.cms||Saikat Ray

This is part of the bank’s strategy to increase the share of small businesses and rural, which are the fastest-growing segments for it. “Priority sector lending is not a sideshow but becomes the main show as banks grow larger. The commercial and rural banking (CRB) business is driving this,” said HDFC Bank group head (CRB) Rahul Shukla. The bank’s rural business grew 19% year-on-year in the first quarter despite the lockdown. “At present, we serve 1 lakh villages, covering both the wealthy as well as small and marginal farmers. We plan to increase that to 2 lakh in the next couple of years,” said Shukla. He added that this would be achieved without a corresponding doubling of resources. The bank is extending the footprint of its 5,500 odd branches by using alternate channels like the government’s common services centres (CSCs), which provide digital services to rural areas. The bank extends overdraft to leads generated by the CSCs based on their six months’ bank statement. It has also signed up 1.7 lakh village-level entrepreneurs (VLEs), of which 1.1 lakh have been onboarded as business facilitators. These VLEs have been empowered to issue sanction letters for consumer loans based on customer eligibility. Besides this, rural customers can access loans through the self-service digital portal as well.Extending the rural reach is part of HDFC Bank’s strategy of growing loans to small businesses. “India always had this entrepreneurial class. What has changed is that there is a lot more data available. Besides bureau data, there is bank transaction data and many small businesses are becoming part of corporate supply chains,” said Shukla. According to Shukla, the opportunity is not in lending to 1.5-2 crore entrepreneurs who are already borrowing from banks, but the remaining 4.5 crore who are not yet part of formal credit. Tapping this segment is not possible without reaching out to semi-urban and rural India he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-to-double-rural-coverage-to-2l-villages/articleshow/85314966.cms||Mayur Shetty

While former minister Muneshwar was in the Pappu Yadav-led Jan Adhikar Party-Loktantrik (JAP-L), Rajesh switched sides from the Congress. Muneshwar had started his political career in Saran with RJD boss Lalu Prasad and won his first election from Garkha assembly seat on the then Janata Party ticket in 1977. He was the minister of mines and geology in the Nitish Kumar-led grand alliance government in 2015. Apprehending that he might not get the RJD ticket in the 2020 assembly elections, Muneshwar switched to the JAP-L and contested the polls on its symbol, when to lose to the RJD’s official nominee. “RJD does not remain a party like earlier. hence I decided to quit the Lalu Prasad’s party a few months ago,” Muneshwar said on Friday, He also said all sections of society were getting benefitted from the development and welfare schemes of CM Nitish Kumar. “No other political leader in Bihar can provide good governance like Nitish. Being deeply impressed by Nitish’s pro-people works and his administrative skill, I finally decided to join his party JD(U),” Muneshwar told TOI. The two-term former MLC from Paschim Champaran Local Authority, Rajesh Ram was earlier with JD(U) before he had joined the Congress in 2015. He contested the MLC election from the Paschim Champaran Local Authority seat on the Congress ticket in 2015 and won. As his six-year term as the MLC ended on July 16 this year, Ram returned to JD(U) fold. Sources said he would contest the next MLC election on the JD(U) symbol. Rajesh, who is the younger brother of former Bihar minister Purnamasi Ram, had won the MLC election for the first time in 2009 on the JD(U) ticket. Rajesh too lauded the Nitish model of development after joining JD(U).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ex-minister-muneshwar-former-mlc-join-jdu/articleshow/85308794.cms||Madan Kumar

The rally on Dalal Street this year has been helped by a combination of local and global factors, including a slow but steady vaccination drive, which, although is yet to fully control the pandemic. During the day, led by two heavyweights — TCS and RIL — the sensex gained nearly 600 points to close at 55,437, while the Nifty crossed the 16,500-level for the first time and closed at 16,529, up 165 points. So far in 2021, the sensex has gained nearly 7,700 points or 16%. According to market experts, a slew of reasons has been behind this 7,000-plus-point rise in the sensex. The RBI’s accommodative policy stance to support growth, a steady exchange rate helped by judicious central bank intervention, positive foreign fund flows and continuous buying by retail investors through the mutual fund route have helped the gains in stocks from almost all the industries. In addition, a steady flow of IPOs from good companies which brought in positive listing gains for investors, a pan-India vaccination drive with localised lockdowns and strong corporate results as debt burden of most companies fell sharply also helped the rally on Dalal Street, they said. On Friday, the sensex opened marginally higher and rallied through the session to hit an all-time high at 55,488 points and closed just a tad off that level. Of the 30 sensex constituents, 20 closed with gains with TCS, RIL, HDFC Bank and Infosys together contributing over half of the index’s gain. The day’s rally also lifted investors’ wealth to an all-time high with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 242.5 lakh crore, translating to a little over $3.25 trillion. According to Joseph Thomas, head of research, Emkay Wealth Management, the rally in frontline indexes and the major sectors continued amid optimism about corporate earnings in the coming months and the continuation of soft-money policy by the central bank. “The current week saw the Nifty and the sensex touching all-time highs, inviting even those on the side-lines to join in. Equity funds saw very good inflows in the last month, both on account of lump sum and SIPs, and the continuation of the same trend may see the markets edging higher. The gains in midcaps and smallcaps was quite negligible, though the sectoral indexes like banking, pharma and tech continued to be buoyant,” Thomas said. In addition to expectations of a normal monsoon-driven economic revival, strong economic data from the US and the UK in recent weeks have also helped gains in the past few days, Thomas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-surges-7700-points-in-7-months-to-scale-55k-peak/articleshow/85315404.cms||---

The jump was driven by both radio (57%) and solutions business (27.9%) compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Growth, however, was on the low base of last year. Compared to two years ago, ENIL’s revenues were still 70.5% down. This was a direct result of the pandemic’s second wave, the operator of India’s No.1 FM radio channel, Radio Mirchi, said on Friday while announcing the first quarter results. It added that the focus on cost control continues. This helped reduce overall costs by 7% over the same quarter of the previous year. During the quarter under review, ebitda loss was Rs 18.7 crore and net loss was Rs 27.7 crore. The company said its balance sheet remains strong with cash reserves of Rs 213 crore as on June 30. ENIL MD & CEO Prashant Panday said, “Just when we were cruising towards a full recovery, the second Covid wave hit the country. A strong recovery, however, is being seen now. What is giving our recovery strength is the growing strength of our digital products, which have contributed 12.6% to our revenues. We see both solutions and digital growing rapidly in the remaining months of the year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/digital-biz-helps-mirchi-q1-revenues-grow-by-44/articleshow/85315128.cms||---
---||Business||Insolvency case: Lenders’ decisions questioned||MUMBAI: A series of judgments in the Supreme Court has established the unbridled power of the committee of creditors (CoC) in insolvency cases. However, the CoC wisdom has come under question in the Videocon and Siva Industries case, which has strengthened calls for a code of conduct proposed by the Parliamentary standing committee on finance last week. In the early years of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), the Supreme Court had upheld the unquestionable nature of the commercial wisdom of the CoC in the Essar judgment. The apex court had also affirmed that the tribunals do not have any right to question CoC’s wisdom, including on dissenting creditors in another case. Besides, there are several other orders giving financial creditors the upper hand. Lenders have also been accepting bids after deadlines, citing value maximisation, they have also accepted bids close to liquidation value, leading the Parliamentary panel to question their actions. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has also questioned the behaviour of the CoC in two cases. In the Videocon case, the NCLT raised doubts on the confidentiality clause being in real-time use after it turned out that the bid put in by Vedanta’s Twin Star was close to the confidential liquidation value assigned by lenders. “Commercial wisdom of Coc is like the basic structure of the IBC process. Any deviation there may have wider dysfunctional implications. However, to address growing concerns about indiscretion in decision making of CoC, there is now a felt need to have a professional code of conduct for CoC as suggested by standing committee on finance, and penal provisions for acts of misconduct, if any,” said Hari Hara Mishra, director, UV ARC. More recently this week, the NCLT Chennai bench shot down a proposal put forward by the CoC to withdraw insolvency proceedings against Sivasankaran’s Siva Industries in order to do a one-time settlement. “The NCLT observed that without receiving even a single penny from the promoter of the corporate debtor, the CoC has voted in favour of withdrawal of insolvency proceedings and this is what gave an impression that it is not a settlement but a business-restructuring plan. Hence, NCLT was of the view that the powers of the adjudicating authority cannot be circumscribed on the ground that ‘commercial wisdom’ of the CoC would prevail over any other provisions of the IBC,” said Nirav Shah, partner, DSK Legal. Shah added that while the unquestionable commercial judgment of the CoC is not getting weakened, this rationale cannot be said to be applicable to the one-time settlement proposal that the tribunal is required to consider before approving the same. A senior advocate who appears on behalf of lenders said that while the rights of lenders are not in doubt, a code of conduct for financial creditors was required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insolvency-case-lenders-decisions-questioned/articleshow/85315069.cms||Mayur Shetty

This was in addition to the announcement made by chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday regarding auditoriums, swimming pools and stadiums. According to the order, all shops and establishments, including restaurants and bars, which had been allowed to remain till 8pm so far, can now keep usual working hours till 10.30pm. Stadiums and swimming pools may remain open with 50% capacity at a time and cinema halls, auditoriums and open-air theatres will be allowed to open with 50% seating capacity at a time. The night restrictions will be in place from 11pm to 5am. Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India president Sudesh Poddar said the extended timings will be crucial for survival of the food and beverage industry. He said restaurants were not getting the dinner crowd, which counts for more than 50%-60% of business. “From 7.30pm to 10.30pm is the prime time for dinner and we get a major part of the business. We will be on the revival path with the new timings announced on Friday,” he said. Speciality Restaurants chairman Anjan Chatterjee said the new timings will help the industry get back a majority of the dinner business.  Confederation of West Bengal Trade Association president Sushil Poddar praised the relaxations. “The additional time will give us flexibility. It would be good for both retail and wholesale trade,” he said. A leading liquor retailer was also happy, saying, “The last two hours, from 8pm to 10pm, is vital for us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/now-you-can-dine-out-till-10-30pm/articleshow/85311632.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

Usually, the number of foreign students seeking admission is more from African countries and Bangladesh. This is for the first time that we are witnessing such record number of applications for admission from Afghani students,” said professor Dhanesh Patel, director of Office of International Affairs (OIA).  A number of agencies have sprouted in Afghanistan aiding students who seek admission in Indian universities because of low cost of living, scholarships, familiarity with the country's culture and language, easy-to-obtain visas and use of English in the classroom. “Over the years, our hostel infrastructure offered to foreign students has also improved. The students who pass out from here act as our ambassadors. We are also helping them with the registration process for the foreign regional registration office as well as finding a family host,” said Patel.  MSU itself is regaining its diversity after several decades. “We already have 156 foreign students enrolled with us. We have confirmed admission of 125 students whose applications were routed through ICCR and 41 other students who are self-funded. In total, we have 322 foreign students who have been enrolled this academic year which is the highest in recent times,” said Patel.  The university is hoping that this year it might touch a new record of 500 plus foreign students as there are nearly 300 applications which are currently under process, and more are pouring in.  Interestingly, many foreign students are seeking admission in commerce and science streams as well apart from traditionally favourite arts, performing arts and fine arts.  Now, there are students who have enrolled for PhD programmes in engineering, commerce, pharmacy, science and arts streams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/afghanistan-students-surge-at-msu/articleshow/85311932.cms||Prashant Rupera

The Niti Aayog said the state government’s welfare initiatives under Navaratnalu have helped several millions of poor people during the pandemic. A team from NITI Aayog, comprising advisor Sanyukta Samaddar, SDG officer Alen John and data analytics officer Saurav Das called on chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy here on Friday and presented the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index 2020-21 report. They said the state government’s focus on education, health and agricultural allied sectors has put it ahead of many states in terms of SDG ranks. AP secured the third rank in many parameters of the SDG index for 2020-21. The chief minister explained the reforms initiated under different sectors for integrated development of Andhra Pradesh. He said they have revamped priority areas with a focus on all-round development of all regions as well as sections. Jagan said that a sustained focus on the development of core sectors for human development—education and health—would unleash development among all the sections. Meanwhile, NITI Aayog continued its session for the second consecutive day on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index 2020-21 in the Secretariat. The team explained the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) to senior officials of the state government and asked them chalk out a plan to keep the state at the top of SDG rankings. The Niti Aayog advisor said India ranked 62 among 107 countries in SDG goals. “However, AP is placed better in the ranking as it achieved an overall rank of 9 in the country. We can achieve better ranking by next year with proper planning to achieve the sustainable development,” said Samaddar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/niti-aayog-lauds-aps-efforts-to-achieve-sustainable-devpt/articleshow/85312669.cms||Samdani MN

He directed chief secretary Dr Adityanath Das to ensure that all senior officials attend duties only from the Secretariat. He made it clear that it was not proper on the part of senior officials to function from camp offices and not visit the Secretariat. Sources said the CM would make himself available in the Secretariat at least once a week. The chief minister has been conducting review meetings with ministers and senior officials from his camp office in Tadepalle. The CM is visiting the Secretariat only to chair the cabinet meeting once or twice a month. After attending the CM’s review meetings in the camp office, a majority of senior officials are reportedly leaving for their residences and operating from respective camp offices. Sources said the chief secretary took the issue to the notice of the chief minister and explained to him that such a trend would derail the administration. He said that making senior officials attend duties from the Secretariat would instill discipline among the officials down the line and strengthen the functioning of the government. Taking advantage of clearing the files from the e-office system, the senior officials were skipping office. According to sources, the chief minister expressed his displeasure at senior officials for not visiting the offices regularly. He has decided to make himself available at the Secretariat to make officials fall in line. Subsequent to the CM’s instructions, the chief secretary conducted a review meeting with special chief secretaries, principal secretaries and heads of departments (HoDs) and directed them to be available in the Secretariat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/jagan-wants-senior-officials-to-attend-duties-from-secretariat/articleshow/85312623.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||Hands-on Adi passes on the Godrej baton||MUMBAI: Adi Godrej is stepping down from the board of Godrej Industries — both as chairman and director — which makes it the last of the listed firms of the Rs 32,000-crore Godrej Group where the 79-year-old patriarch has passed on the baton to his successors. Godrej Industries said these changes to its board will be effective October 1. His younger brother, Nadir Godrej, who is managing director of Godrej Industries, will take over as CMD of the company. Godrej Industries is the holding company, which has interests in consumer goods, agriculture, real estate, chemicals and financial services, other than incubating new businesses. ABG, as Adi Burjorji Godrej is known, will, however, continue as chairman of the 124-year-old diversified Godrej Group and chairman emeritus of Godrej Industries. Over the decades, ABG has nurtured the growth of these companies with his hands-on leadership style, and has also brought in top-notch professional talent to compete with multinational rivals. Under his leadership, the soaps business of Godrej has been a formidable competitor to market leader Hindustan Unilever (HUL). Godrej Group is a conglomeration of different legal entities, some of which are listed on the stock exchanges. It is controlled by the Godrej family, with Adi Godrej’s cousin Jamshyd Godrej heading Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Company. The part of the Group which was so far managed by Adi Godrej (Godrej Industries, Godrej Consumer Products, Godrej Properties and Godrej Agrovet) has gradually passed on to the next generation of leaders. The part of the group which was overseen directly by ABG is now over Rs 20,000-crore combined. At a young age of 21, when Adi Godrej had taken over the reins of the erstwhile Godrej Soaps (now GCPL), as MD in 1963, the turnover was a little over Rs 2 crore. Under his leadership, where new marketing skills and strategies were deployed, the turnover of the company shot up to nearly Rs 8 crore in 1967, a growth described as “a watershed in its history” in the book on Godrej’s hundred years by B K Karanjia. By 1995, Godrej Soaps’ turnover was at a striking distance of Rs 600 crore. Under ABG, the group has also gained broader global insights through short-term tie-ups with MNCs like Procter & Gamble, Sara Lee and Pilsbury, among others. ABG’s leadership style was different from his predecessors and mentors, although the core purpose was strictly adhered to. If pre-Independence the Godrej Group was known for its swadeshi push, ABG looked at MNC rivals like HUL as customers to whom the group supplied raw materials for making soap. In 2017, Godrej had stepped down from the board of Godrej Properties as well, while at Godrej Agrovet, the board is chaired by Nadir Godrej. His son, Pirojsha Godrej heads Godrej Properties. “It has been a privilege to serve Godrej Industries for over four decades, during which we have delivered strong results and transformed our company. I am grateful to our board for their support and guidance; to all our team members whose passion, commitment and hard work has driven our success; and to all our customers, business partners, shareholders, investors, and communities, for their continued partnership. I am very confident that our best years are ahead of us, and I look forward to Nadir and our team achieving our exciting aspirations,” said Godrej. Last week, Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) announced that effective September 30, 2021, Adi Godrej will step down from the board and will continue to be chairman emeritus. His daughter Nisaba Godrej had already taken over the leadership as chairperson of the single largest company (Rs 11,000 crore turnover) in the group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hands-on-adi-passes-on-the-godrej-baton/articleshow/85315325.cms||Namrata Singh

RBI deputy governor M K Jain said that the RBI has put in place various regulations to improve the governance in banks and make them more resilient. In addition, banks have also made improvements in their risk management capacities. “Yet, the changing operating and risk environment requires banks to be vigilant, strong and agile so as to identify risks early, absorb the shocks and be able to adapt to the newer ground realities,” said Jain. Jain said that the Covid-19 spread and the public health responses to the pandemic, including the social-distancing and lock-down measures, tested the operational and technological resilience of the financial system like never before. “However, it’s a matter of great satisfaction that both the RBI and the financial institutions demonstrated tremendous operational resilience and ensured uninterrupted availability of financial services to the general public by putting in business continuity plans,” he said. He added that the RBI has been focusing on cyber resilience of institutions even before the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-reviews-covid-steps/articleshow/85314869.cms||---

The cops include Nitasha Guria (Bhagalpur SSP), Babu Ram (Darbhanga SSP), Hari Prasath S (Nalanda SP), Nilesh Kumar (STF SP), Yogendra Kumar (Madhepura SP), Ugranath Jha, and Mohammad Neyaz Ahmed (both inspectors). As many as 152 police personnel serving across the country have been awarded the medal this year. According to sources, of all the cases for which the five officers and two inspectors of the Bihar police have been feted, conviction was carried out in only the one related to the gang rape of a minor at Rajgir in Nalanda in September 2019. In January 2021, seven people were awarded life imprisonment in the Rajgir case. The remaining cases are either under trial or being investigated. Babu Ram and Yogendra Kumar received the medal for solving the kidnapping case of a 25-year-old at Singhwara in Darbhanga. The criminals had demanded a ransom of Rs 1 crore, but the victim was recovered after three months from Muzaffarpur. Altogether 12 kidnappers were arrested, who are presently facing trial. Kumar told TOI, “Police have to think and act like criminals sometimes. We laid traps to arrest the kidnappers several times and learned to handle pressure and be patient.” Hari Prasath S recalled a dacoity case when he was posted in Nawada last year. “The criminals entered a house and murdered the owner’s 14-year-old son by slitting his throat. Our team tracked them down and arrested them within two days,” he said, adding that it was a team effort as everyone played a vital role in cracking the case which is under trial at present. Visibly happy with the medal, Natasha Guria, who joined as the SSP of Bhagalpur in January 2021, pointed out that her priorities were proper and timely investigation of cases, crime control and maintenance of law and order in the district. “Making Bhagalpur a crime-free district and creating a people-friendly image of police are my responsibilities,” Natasha said and added that she had given strict instructions to the SHOs of different police stations to get rid of criminals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/7-cops-awarded-hms-medal-for-excellence-in-investigation/articleshow/85283805.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Bihar: Ganga crosses highest flood level at Hathidah, but to start falling today||PATNA: The Ganga water level crossed the highest flood level (HFL) of 43.17 metres at Hathidah and reached 43.21 metres on Friday, increasing the miseries of the flood-affected people in the downstream up to Bhagalpur, Kahalgaon and further east. At Farakka, where the water level was 1.03 metres above the danger level, all the barrage gates there remained open for the accelerated discharge of water. The Ganga water entered Ganga Tower apartment at Mainpura and electric crematoriums besides several other low-lying areas along the river bank in Patna while people of diara areas in the district reached the state capital with their belongings and cattle and were camping at Patna Law College and in the nearby localities. The river water also entered the lower localities at Bhagalpur, including the campus of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University, T N B and Marwari colleges. The quarters and colonies of the college teachers at Bhagalpur had knee-deep water. Similar reports have also been received from the Munger and Kahalgaon towns. However, the water level in the western stretch of the river started showing a falling trend from Buxar up to Patna, but flowed 1.16 metres above the danger level at Digha and 1.63 metres at Gandhi Ghat in the state capital, state water resources department (WRD) sources said. “For the last three days, the hourly increase of the water level at Patna was .7 cm per hour, or over 2cm in three hours. But on Friday, the increase in the water level at Patna was 1cm in three hours,” a WRD source said, adding that the flood scenario is expected to improve from Saturday afternoon. According to Central Water Commission (CWC), the water level in the Ganga will fall by 6cm at Buxar on Saturday, even as the water level will continue to increase along its downstream from there, including at Patna. “The increase will not be sharp and high as witnessed in the past few days,” the WRD source said. However, alarming scenario started building up along the downstream of the river at Hathidah onwards up to Kahalaon and Farakka on the east. The water level at Munger was 42cm above the danger level, followed by 73cm at Bhagalpur and 1.09 metres at Kahalgaon. The situation is unlikely to ease, as river Sone that meets Ganga at Maner on the outskirts of Patna was already in spate. The water discharge through Indrapuri barrage across it increased from 1.27 lakh cusecs to 1.35 lakh cusecs. “Since the water discharge through the Ganga was over 22 lakh cusecs on Friday, its water level was higher than that of Sone. Accordingly, the Ganga was unable to take in water from Sone swiftly,” the WRD source said, adding that the water level of Punpun has been falling. The water discharge through Sone is expected to fall, as no rainfall was received in the basins of Chambal, Ken and Betwa rivers in Madhya Pradesh in the last couple of days. The rainfall was nil in Madhya Pradesh on Friday, and only light rainfall is forecast for the next couple of days in Nepal, Bihar and Jharkhand. Among other rivers, the water discharge through the Birpur barrage across Kosi increased from 1.51 lakh cusecs in the morning to 1.70 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. However, the water discharge through Kosi in its upper reaches in Nepal has fallen. Similarly, even as the water discharge through Valmiki Nagar barrage across Gandak increased from 1.16 cusecs in the morning to 1.40 lakh cusecs in the afternoon, the water discharge showed a falling trend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ganga-crosses-highest-flood-level-at-hathidah-but-to-start-falling-today/articleshow/85313836.cms||Abhay Singh

He directed officials to bring all expert advice to farmers on to digital platforms to create awareness. The chief minister said cultivation of water intensive crops—paddy, sugarcane, tobacco and subabul—using borewell water should be discouraged to save natural resources.

The incident took place in the chimney of Saurashtra Cement Limited which markets cement under the brand name of Hathi at around 3pm on Thursday. The fire brigade was informed at around 5pm. The contract for the maintenance work was given to a Mumbai-based company, sources informed. The accident occurred when the labourers were doing painting work inside the chimney standing on a 45-foot high scaffolding. The workers were trapped inside the chimney when the scaffolding collapsed. It took nine hours for the fire brigade, coast guard and NDRF team to rescue the trapped workers. “Why the structure collapsed is a technical issue so we are awaiting the report of the deputy director of industrial safety. Based on the report we will come to know whether there was negligence, safety standards were followed or not and based on that we will register an offence in a day or two,” Ravi Mohan Saini, superintendent of police Porbandar, told TOI. “The entry to the chimney was blocked. We had to cut the chimney wall with a gas cutter to bring the trapped labourers out,” Saini added. According to sources it was the last day of the maintenance and painting job and the accident happened when the labourers were dismantling the scaffolding.

Three persons, including Pampam’s parents and one of his friends were arrested. Dhananjay Singh (63) and Vijay Singh (60) died on the spot. Women and children of the family managed to escape. Pappu Singh (55) was undergoing treatment at a hospital. SHO (in-charge) Pankaj Prakash said the killers in police uniform, after reaching in front of Dhananjay’s house, yelled that they had come to nab a notorious criminal, Ramkrishna Yadav. Police said Dhananjay’s grandfather had married twice and Pampam is their only step-cousin. Dhananjay and his brothers had disputes over different plots of land with Pampam. “The disputes were settled one by one with the last one being settled hardly a few months back by the sarpanch,” Khagaria SP Amitesh Kumar said. Amitesh said Pampam is associated with Mithilesh Yadav, a notorious criminal of Saharsa, while Dhananjay and his brothers were aligned with another criminal Ramkrishna, who is Mithilesh’s maternal uncle and arch-rival. Mithilesh was probably tipped off that Ramkrishna was hiding inside Dhananjay’s house, he said.  “The criminals conducted a house search after taking everyone out but failed to locate Ramkrishna. In the meantime, Pampam opened fire, killing Dhananjay and Vijay while Pappu received gunshot injuries,” he said, quoting eyewitnesses. Mithilesh and his gang commit crime in police uniform. At least eight cases are lodged against Ramkrishna with Beldaur police station. He has been evading arrest for the past several months. “He is accused in over 10-12 criminal cases in Khagaria, Madhepura and Saharsa. Last month, a reward of Rs25,000 was declared on him,” the SP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-khagaria-brothers-shot-dead-third-injured/articleshow/85308825.cms||Debashish Karmakar

He also took a jibe at chief minister Nitish Kumar, saying the latter, in spite of sending a letter to the PM a week ago, got not reply. “Caste-based census is in the larger interest of the masses,” Tejashwi told reporters.  The RJD’s de facto chief said PM Modi did not bother to give an appointment to Nitish, who wished to lead a delegation of the state’s legislators to meet him on the same issue. “With no response even after a week, it is obvious that the PM is ignoring Nitish. But RJD will not sit idle on the issue. We have been left with no option but to stage a dharna at Jantar Mantar in Delhi,” he said. Nitish had assured the opposition party leaders earlier that he would seek an appointment with the PM to discuss the contentious issue of conducting caste census in the state. Nitish on Thursday said he had not received any reply from the PMO on the letter sent on August 4 to seek an appointment with the PM to discuss the issue related to caste census. “The demand of a caste census is not only from the leaders of Bihar but also from the other states. The leaders of our party have already met Union home minister Amit Shah and apprised him of the matter,” Nitish had said. This is perhaps for the first time in the last four years that Tejashwi has supported his party’s rival and JD(U) leader Nitish so openly on any political issue. Former CM and HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi has also demanded a caste census to be conducted by the state itself. “If the Centre doesn’t agree to the demand, the state should go for it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-tejashwi-writes-to-pm-on-caste-census/articleshow/85313474.cms||Ramashankar

The chief minister also directed officials to conduct an audit of revenues following reports about fake challans in several districts. Meanwhile, the stamps and registration department has initiated measures to plug loopholes in the existing software by designing new software. The new version has been fortified with additional security features where the sub-registrars can verify payments in CFMS portal at their end. At present, sub-registrars are depending on physical challans produced by asset purchasers through stamp vendors resulting in malpractices. The fake challans scandal is creating ripples in the stamps and registration department as irregularities are coming out from several districts across the state. The issue was noticed in Kadapa where senior officials found revenues were not tallying with transactions. The state commissioner and inspector general of stamps and registrations, MV Seshagiri Babu, directed district registrars to inspect sub-registrar offices and tally challans with revenues. According to reports, stamp vendors in Krishna, East Godavari and Guntur districts have also committed huge irregularities by taking advantage of the existing software used by the department. A few stamp vendors have remitted lower amounts in banks and produced morphed challans in sub-registrar offices to go ahead with malpractices. It is alleged that some sub-registrars were taking bribes from vendors and not verifying the records before approving registrations. This has resulted in huge loss to the exchequer, said people familiar with the matter. The IG, stamps and registrations, said that they have found irregularities in 10 offices in the state with a revenue loss of Rs 5.25 crore. He said they have initiated measures to recover the amount and placed six sub-registrars under suspension for lapses. Enquiries are going on in several other offices. “We have changed the software to plug loopholes. We have also booked criminal cases against vendors,” said Seshagiri Babu. He said the government is also contemplating to bring in a licensing system for document writers where they have to clear a qualifying examination. Mandatory licensing was abandoned about 25 years ago. According to Guntur range DIG of stamps and registrations, K Srinivasa Rao, irregularities have been found only in the Mangalagiri sub-registrar office. He said they carried out inspections in all 35 offices in the district and found no evidence of irregularities, except in Mangalagiri. “We have found losses to the tune of Rs 7.9 lakh in Mangalagiri and are taking measures to recover the revenue,” said Srinivasa Rao. However, Krishna district DIG Ravindranath said they have detected irregularities to tune of nearly Rs 3 crore in the district. He said documents would be validated only after the difference was paid to the exchequer. “The cases will continue even after payment of the actual amount. We have issued notices to 347 document writers in connection with fake challans,” said Ravindranath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/probe-into-fake-challan-scam-reveals-over-rs-5cr-revenue-loss/articleshow/85312584.cms||Samdani MN
---||Kolkata||‘Kolkata needs to retain its vibrant neighbourhoods’, says French economist and Nobel laureate Esther Duflo||KOLKATA: Kolkata should preserve its neighbourhoods that reflect the multi-religious and multi-cultural character of the city, French economist and Nobel laureate Esther Duflo said during a conversation on Kolkata and heritage with writer and heritage activist Amit Chaudhuri on Friday evening. The discussion was organised by Calcutta Architectural Legacies in partnership with Bengal Club and Intach. “Kolkata has still managed to retain neighbourhoods with cultural vibrancy. Here, every individual building may not be architecturally remarkable but they add up to the spirit of the neighbourhoods and the city. We need to protect these localities because the built environment does matter,” said Duflo. In an interaction with TOI during a trip to Kolkata seven years ago, Duflo had stressed that the city needed to recognise its potential as a tourist attraction and preserve precincts in north, central and south where neighbourhoods still retained old buildings that were architecturally distinct. “Investing in preserving these localities can be financially rewarding,” she had then said. On Friday, she recounted her long association with the city. “It was its intellectual vibrancy that struck me. It is rare to find such a city in India or in any developing country. Kolkata needs to retain the architectural heritage,” she said. Over the years, Esther has visited the city more than 20 times. Now wedded to former Kolkatan and Nobel prize winning economist Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, the sight of demolition of old buildings continue to irk her. “Every time I come here, I see one more splendid building gone and replaced by a glass building. Someone needs to put an end to the destruction and fix the crumbling buildings,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-needs-to-retain-its-vibrant-neighbourhoods/articleshow/85313104.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Irked WR officers seek central inquiry into commissioner of rly safety’s ‘misbehaviour’||Mumbai: In an unprecedented move, the Western Railway Officers’ Association has urged the WR general manager to demand a central inquiry against the commissioner of railway safety (CRS), western circle, for alleged “misbehavior and verbal indecency”. The commission of railway safety, working under the administrative control of the Union ministry of civil aviation, deals with matters pertaining to safety of rail travel and train operations and is charged with certain statutory functions as laid down in the Railways Act, 1989. The trigger for the letter was the altercation at a meeting in the chief administrative officer’s (construction) conference room on August 4. The WROA, in the letter addressed to WR general manager Alok Kansal, claimed, “At the meeting, CRS of western circle R K Sharma misbehaved with senior officers. Anand Kumar, financial advisor and chief account officer, while politely expressing his professional views consistent with codal provisions on a particular topic of the discussion, encountered unexpected hostility from Sharma.” It further stated: “Sharma’s humiliating verbal indecency to ‘shut up’, ‘get out’ and ‘main tumhe batata hoon’ for no reason shocked everyone in the meeting.” TOI has a copy of the letter dated August 7. On August 4 itself, the WROA then convened an extraordinary general body meeting to discuss Sharma’s “conscience-shaking” behaviour. “Officers narrated incidents of abusive, foul language, deviant, humiliating and terrorising behaviour of the CRS...By insulting senior officers in front of the staff and contractors, he [CRS] tried to give a message of his self-proclaimed supremacy...An inquiry about his working will unravel more than the above,” the letter claimed. The letter also referred to an “unanimous resolution” at the meeting that “the railway board may be approached to forward the complaint to the secretary/ministry of civil aviation for conducting a detailed inquiry with the suggestion of shifting Sharma immediately to some other circle...” When contacted, Sharma denied the allegations and instead blamed the FA&CAO of misbehaviour. “I feared manhandling as I raised a few queries which were not liked. The officer told me: ‘Who had invited you?’ The WR officers wanted me to approve some items within a few hours which was not possible as I cannot compromise on the safety of passengers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-irked-wr-officers-seek-central-inquiry-into-commissioner-of-rly-safetys-misbehaviour/articleshow/85315533.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Chandigarh||Months ahead of Punjab assembly polls, special drive to update voters’ list||Chandigarh: With assembly elections scheduled to be held next year, the Election Commission has started the revision exercise of the voter list in Punjab. As per guidelines of the Election Commission of India (ECI), a special campaign for registration, deletion and correction of particulars in voter list with a qualifying date of January 1, 2022, has started in the state. Known as special summary revision, this gives an opportunity to citizens to register themselves as voters and also verify their electoral details through offline or online medium. Chief electoral officer (CEO) Punjab S Karuna Raju said the prevalent situation due to Covid-19 had posed some challenges in conducting elections, however, the election machinery was geared up to tide over this unprecedented situation. In view of upcoming assembly election in the first quarter of next year, this exercise would be extensively carried out across the state from district-level, constituency-level to right up to the booth-level. A door-to-door exercise will be undertaken by the booth-level officers (BLOs) till October 31, 2021. He said with an objective to improve the health of electoral rolls and ensure enrolment of all eligible citizens, special summary revision was conducted in the later part of each year in all the states. People who have not been able to register themselves as voters and those who find errors in the electoral rolls or have migrated to some other constituency can utilise the special summary revision of the roll with the qualifying date as January 1, 2022, who have completed or will be completing age of 18 on or before January 1, 2022. The CEO has directed all the deputy commissioners-cum-district election officers to undertake this revision activity and to supervise their teams periodically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/months-ahead-of-punjab-assembly-polls-special-drive-to-update-voters-list/articleshow/85315517.cms||---

---||Meerut||Hospital salutes UP doctor who worked 20 hours/day for 2 years, names lab after mom||MEERUT: The day Dr Atul Srivastava’s mother died, over 300 Covid test reports were lying on his desk, waiting for his approval. It was April 30. The microbiologist at Muzaffarnagar Medical College rushed to his mother’s funeral for just two hours, cremated her and made his way back to the lab he had been painstakingly putting together for over a year. Since April last year, the Covid research and diagnostics lab at the hospital was all he had worked for — 20 hours a day, testing over 20,000 samples without a single day of leave. On Friday, the hospital formally inaugurated the lab with a salute to the doctor — it was named ‘Smt Jai Shri Sinha Diagnostic and Research Laboratory’ after his mother. “For me, this is dedicated to all frontline warriors who went down fighting the disease and saving lives,” Srivastava, 40, said. An MBBS from Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College in Meerut, he did his microbiology postgraduation from Christian Medical College in Ludhiana before joining the Muzaffarnagar Medical College’s microbiology department in April 2016. It was in April last year, when the country had just begun to realise the seriousness of the pandemic, that he was asked to set up the lab. “We started working day and night to structure the lab … It was difficult. There was no technical knowhow because the labs that were around were either new or working overtime. I had to depend on my instincts and the literature available on the internet. I spoke to equipment manufacturers, learnt about things on my own and, now, we have an 18-room lab,” he said. In October, the Indian Council of Medical Research allowed the lab to start conducting tests. Since then, he has tested 20,662 samples. “I had three assistants and we worked round the clock to ensure there was no report backlog.” But in April this year, when the second wave of infections swept across the nation, his family, all of them, fell sick. “His mother, father, brother, sister-in-law, brother-in-law and uncle tested positive. His mother, brother-in-law and uncle passed away. But he showed commendable professional commitment,” said Prof GS Manchanda, principal of the medical college. “Some 300 reports from the panchayat election committee were awaiting his approval the day his mother died. He knew getting the reports out would ensure timely completion of the elections,” he added. “So now, dedicating the lab to his mother is a gesture of gratitude towards his selfless service.” But it was tough for Srivastava. “I was a wreck. My mother was gone, my brother was in the ICU and I had to tell him she was recovering. I had no idea how many of my family would survive,” he said. “But at the same time, I’d have to keep rushing back to conduct tests. There were times when beds were not available, or there were no ambulances. I knew how much one negative test would mean in those times, ensuring a bed is available for the next person who tests positive. I had to go on."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hosp-salutes-doc-who-worked-20-hrs/day-for-2-yrs-names-lab-after-mom/articleshow/85310909.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Pune||MahaRERA to set up cell to speed up recovery orders, clear backlog||Pune: The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) will set up a ‘recovery cell’ in coordination with the district administrations to execute its recovery warrants issued against errant developers. A total of 285 such orders since 2018 are yet to be implemented in the state. Among these 285 orders, one was issued against the developers of a “much-delayed” realty project in Mumbai in 2019 after Malad residents Arun Sheth and his wife approached the MahaRERA to recover their investments in the project. “Even after the recovery order was issued and the Mumbai collectorate sent out a letter in May 2019, there has been no follow up. And with the pandemic now, all officials are busy in addressing the health crisis and have no time to implement the orders,” Sheth said. The recovery warrant orders, under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, are issued by the MahaRERA adjudicating officers against the developers and forwarded to collectors for attachment of properties and recovery of dues. “To address the delay in the execution of such warrants at the earliest, the MahaRERA will set up a recovery cell,” MahaRERA chairman Ajoy Mehta to TOI. The recovery cell will help execute the recovery warrants with the help of MahaRERA and district administration officials. Chairman of Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association Ramesh Prabhu said once the MahaRERA issued a recovery warrant order and it is not complied by the respondent/promoters, the allottees could file a petition of non-execution of the order. “The MahaRERA conducts the hearing of execution petition and if the respondent does not comply with the orders, MahaRERA issues the recovery certificate/warrant against the promoters and then transfers it for execution to the collector of the district where the project is situated. The collector transfers it to the tehsildar to execute the order by following the procedure prescribed under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966. The challenge is that both the collector and the tehsildar are engaged in number of other activities and do not focus on recovery orders,” Prabhu said. An advocate practising in the Bombay HC said even though the MahaRERA has power for recovering arrears, it is not as effective as rules and orders prescribed under the civil or criminal procedures. “We find orders for recovery falling short as revenue department gives less importance to RERA orders. An effective recovery mechanism is necessary,” advocate Manjunath Kakkalameli, also a RERA practioner, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharera-to-set-up-cell-to-speed-up-recovery-orders-clear-backlog/articleshow/85315561.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The commission has sought a response within a week.In its notice, the commission has further asked what action had been taken against the accused, who assaulted the person, besides how many persons had been arrested and sections under which the accused had been booked.The commission also asked about the preventive measures taken to avoid recurrence of such incidents in future to create an atmosphere of peace and communal harmony. “What action has been taken against the policemen in whose presence the person was being beaten up,” the commission questioned.Also, the Commission said that due to the incident, the rights of the child of the victim have been violated, and asked whether the mental and physical condition of the child has been evaluated after this incident. “If so, a detailed report may be furnished in this regard,” the Commission added.It went on to ask whether any statement of the child has been recorded. “A video clip of the same may also be furnished,” it stated further.Meanwhile, three persons, who were arrested on Thursday night for allegedly assaulting the 45-year-old man, accusing him of indulging in religious conversion in the Barra area of the city, were released on bail on Friday.“The three accused, Ajay Rajesh, Aman Gupta and Rahul Kumar, booked under sections 147, 323, 504 and 506 of IPC following a complaint by the victim Afsar Ahmed, have been released on bail,” said inspector Barra Harmeet Singh.He added, “As all the IPC sections are within the ambit of punishment less than seven years, all the three accused have been granted bail from the police station itself.”On Friday, Samajwadi Party national president and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav condemned the incident “of openly beating an innocent youth on the instigation of BJP”. “Such incidents are shameful for democracy. Law and order is completely destroyed in the state,” he added.The State Commission for Minorities has also expressed displeasure and wrote a letter to the police commissioner asking to reply in three days, and register a case and take strict action, besides providing security cover to the aggrieved family.To recall, a disturbing video clip of the incident showing the man’s little daughter crying and trying to cling with him and begging for mercy from a mob of assaulters, went viral on the social media on Thursday. Later, the police rescued the man and brought him to the police station.Police had said that the three main accused were arrested late Thursday night in connection with the Wednesday evening incident of assault and humiliation of Afsar Ahmed, an e-rickshaw driver. The Barra police had filed an FIR against a local man, who runs a marriage band, his son and around 10 unknown people based on a complaint by Afsar Ahmed.“Among whom, Ajay alias Rajesh Bandwala, Aman Gupta and Rahul Kumar were arrested,” police said.Meanwhile, in protest against the arrest of three persons, local activists reached DCP South office in the night and sat on a dharna. The officials assured them of a fair investigation following which they left.A woman resident of Kacchi Basti had accused her neighbours Saddam, Salman and one Mukul of molesting her daughter and getting her converted with the lure of Rs 20,000.The police had registered a case on July 31, but in the absence of evidence during preliminary investigation, the police did not file a section of conversion in the FIR.In protest against this, the local activists later created a ruckus at Ram Gopal crossing in Kachchi Basti in Barra on Wednesday evening.When Afsar, a relative of one of the molesters passed by with his seven-year-old daughter, the activists dragged and thrashed him severely. Later, a video of the incident also went viral.DCP South Raveena Tyagi later visited Afsar Ahmed’s house and met his daughter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/assault-on-muslim-man-national-minorities-panel-sends-notice-to-police/articleshow/85313951.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Scientist Alok Saini at a meeting held with KDA vice-chairman Arvind Singh and other officials discussed the remote sensing application which will use images collected by Indian Cartosat satellite of the ministry of science and technology. The object of the meeting was to apprise the officials of the use of technology to identify KDA’s assets and bring the layout in digital imaging. It will help in determining illegal constructions and encroachments. It can also be used in verification of residential assets of KDA which will help in allotment of vacant /un-allotted plots/buildings to increase KDA revenue. The vice-chairman directed that all such works being done in the city should be brought at one platform. He asked the officers to coordinate among all departments so that the assigned works could be disposed of in a time bound manner. Meanwhile, while reviewing complaints received at the ‘Janata Darshan’, it was found that there were several matters in which KDA had executed sale deeds to the allottees though the land was disputed and the possession could not be provided to them. Taking cognizance of the complaints, the vice-chairman said a physical inspection of property would be a better option before executing a sale deed. He asked the officers to seek reports from all concerned departments if there was no dispute over the land or building. He asked to constitute a SOP by forming a five-member committee under the chairmanship of additional secretary/ In-charge of the law department. The committee would study various stages of execution of sale deeds to avoid any dispute between the allottees and the KDA. The committee would prepare a procedural report about it and submit before him in ten days, the vice-chairman added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kda-to-use-remote-sensing-application-to-check-illegal-constructions/articleshow/85314010.cms||---

In Ghazipur, the CM attended a flood relief programme at Gahmar Inter College in Gahmar village. He listened to the problems of the people and distributed relief materials among 182 flood-hit families of Sevrai, Sadar, Muhammadabad, and Jamania tehsils. He also held a meeting with the officials and public representatives on the occasion. The CM directed the officials to ensure all assistance to the people in flooded areas. Later, talking to reporters, the CM said that the flood has affected 620 villages in 24 districts of the state. The flood situation became grim after the release of additional water from Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Regular monitoring of relief work is being done in flood-affected areas. “In Ghazipur district, the flood has affected 32 villages,” he said, adding that the rescue and relief operations are continuing on a war footing. The CM took stock of each and every arrangement made by the administration to rescue the people and relief work done so far. Local MLAs Sunita Singh, Dr. Sangeeta, Alka Rai, MLC Chanchal Singh, Zila Panchayat president Sapna Singh and others were also present on the occasion.

The bench, too, said during the hearing, “The Press Council guidelines are norms of behaviour. How can you put it to such exalted status of mandatory compliance? Let us know if you are restricting it to Article 19 (2) (reasonable restrictions on free speech).” Singh said the petitioners’main grievance was against government oversight, but the proposed inter-departmental committee—which can even block public access to content in emergent cases—under new IT Rules was not yet notified. The HC observed, “Fear of rules operating in the manner that rules provide which will clip their wings under Article 19 (1) (a) (fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression) is the petitioner’s case, it will leave a sword of Damocles hanging over their head.” ASG said public interest be considered since airwaves were not private property. The two PILs — by Ashish Khetan of a digital portal and by mediaperson Nikhil Wagle — said the new rules intended to control ‘online content’ and would have a chilling effect on speech.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-it-rules-do-no-good-to-democracy-says-counsel/articleshow/85313348.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Delta-plus deaths force doctors to defend efficacy of vaccines||MUMBAI: The recent deaths of two fully vaccinated senior citizens in Maharashtra from Covid-19’s Delta-plus variant has forced experts to once again defend vaccination as the best bet against the SARS2 virus. Delta-plus – or AY.1 – has been found in 0.5% of 11,968 samples sequenced in Maharashtra since April 2021. In absolute numbers, it works out to 66 cases and five deaths registered so far. Health officials said recent fatalities were among those with severe health conditions. The first was an 80-year-old from Sangameshwar, Ratnagiri, with severe mental illness, the second a 63-year-old woman from Mumbai with interstitial lung disease and the third a 69-year-old from Raigad with hypertension and diabetes. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said barring those in fragile health, most infected with Delta-plus had mild or no symptoms. But do vaccines work against Delta-plus? “Covishield and Covaxin probably produce lesser antibodies against Delta as compared to the original Wuhan strain, but they do provide protection,” said immunologist Dr Vineeta Bal from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. As the Delta and Delta-plus strains are similar in structure, she said it can be inferred that vaccines work on the latter too. Data from the UK shows the effect of vaccination on the ongoing Delta-driven third wave in terms of cases and deaths. On January 20, when the immunisation drive was a few weeks old, the country registered 38,746 cases and 1,824 deaths. In contrast, on August 10, with more than 50% of the population fully vaccinated, the UK had 23,269 cases and 104 deaths. Closer home, the Surana group had 1,393 admissions at its Chembur and Sanpada hospitals between April and July. “Of these cases, 114 Covid patients died. However, only one of them in our Chembur hospital was fully vaccinated,” said Dr Prince Surana. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid-19 task force, said, “Global data has shown Delta strains have ‘immune escape’. Hence, we need to continue using masks.’’ Moreover, Delta-plus cases are too few to draw inferences. “Isolated cases cannot be used to make generalisations,” Dr Joshi added. The basic principle of vaccination is they provide wide spectrum immune protection. “The protection is a combination of responses mediated by T cells and memory B cells and is often long-lasting. Therefore, vaccines might be preparing the immune system for a wide array of potential variants,’’ said Bengaluru-based epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu. Also, various Covid vaccines are different from each other. “Some are for the entire virus, some are prepared against a specific part of a protein,’’ he added. In order to get a definite answer, Delta-plus must be grown in the labs and then sera collected from individuals to test against it. “We don’t have that information in India, or even globally since there aren’t many Delta-plus cases the world over,” said Dr Bal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-delta-plus-deaths-force-docs-to-defend-efficacy-of-vaccines/articleshow/85313280.cms||Malathy Iyer

While the gold medal winner will receive a whopping Rs 2 crore, silver and bronze medalists will get Rs 1.5 crore Rs 1 crore, respectively. Members of the women’s hockey team, who performed exceptionally well but finished fourth, will be given Rs 50 lakh each as consolation prize. Besides, all 10 players from UP who participated in the Olympics will be given an additional Rs 25 lakh each. Making this announcement while felicitating 75 sportspersons, including three Olympians at Gorakhnath Temple in Gorakhpur on Friday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said: “We will honour all our Olympians and coaches with cash rewards on August 19. On this occasion, 75 sportspersons each from all the 75 districts will be invited to attend the event so that they may also draw inspiration from our achievers.” “We will focus on providing good training to sportspersons in the state. Coaches will also be paid well,” he said. “Due to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the biggest-ever Olympic team from India participated in Tokyo Olympics. During the challenging times of pandemic, our sportspersons proved their mettle. When a sportsman wins on a global platform, the pride of the nation is enhanced,” he said. “We have already announced that sportsmen from the state will get Rs 6 crore for Olympic gold, Rs 3 crore for silver and Rs 1 crore for bronze. We’ll also give cash awards to Olympic participants and have also decided awards for Commonwealth Games and Asiad.” The CM said the government was trying to create a conducive environment for sports and wrestling and swimming competitions were being organized at Gorakhnath temple on the occasion of Nagpanchami for the last few years. “Due to coronavirus, we could not organise the programme in 2020 and 2021. I asked the organizers to hold a programme to honour our international, national, state and district level sportsmen,” he said and praised the talented sportspersons of Gorakhpur. On this occasion, the CM honoured Olympians Prem Maya, Ranjana Srivastav and Preeti Dubey. During the felicitation programme on August 19, all the 19 members of the men’s hockey team which broke the 41-year-old jinx to win a bronze, will be given Rs 1 crore each.

Flood situation is also grim in Ballia, where the river is flowing 2.55m above the danger mark, and Ghazipur, where Ganga was flowing 1.59m above the danger mark. According to the flood bulletin of the Middle Ganga Division-III of the Central Water Commission (CWC), the flooded Ganga was flowing at the mark of 72.26m at 8 AM in Varanasi, where the increasing trend of the river stopped on Thursday. Now, the Ganga’s water level is falling at the rate of 1cm per hour. However, the residential colonies in low-lying areas are still marooned, and the people have to take shelter in the nearest flood relief camps. A number of people living along the bank of Varuna river have made makeshift arrangements on the terrace after flood waters entered their houses. Meanwhile, the relief operations by the local administration are continuing. During his visit to the city on Thursday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath also inspected some of the relief camps after making a round of the flood-affected areas. The CM on Thursday afternoon took stock of the flood caused by the Ganga and its tributary Varuna by a NDRF boat. He had assured the flood-affected people that his government is committed to extending all possible help, and asked the district officials not to let any stone unturned in ensuring the relief required for the flood-hit people. Ballia is the worst affected in the floods, as a major chunk of land is submerged under water. Despite the falling trend of flood waters, the river is flowing at the mark of 60.16m, which is 2.55m above the danger mark (57.615m). Similarly, Ghazipur too witnessed a falling trend of Ganga, but the river is flowing at the mark of 64.68m, which is 1.59 m above the danger mark (64.105m). Mirzapur is comparatively in a better position, as the Ganga is flowing at the mark of 78.11m, which is 0.39m above the danger mark (77.724m).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/receding-ganga-still-above-danger-mark-in-varanasi/articleshow/85313736.cms||---

A similar body would be created for Tirupur and Hosur as well.Several industry bodies had put forth the demand for formation of CDA ahead of the budget. “However, it’s an old demand, to find a solution for the limitations in licensing, delay in approval for industrial land conversion and building plans, which were hampering industrial activities. There is a need for restructuring the administrative apparatus, which will propel future growth of the city like it did in the case of CMDA,” an industry source said. “As the Coimbatore corporation can’t give approval for buildings beyond 5,000sqft, the local planning authority has to be approached. But we need to approach officials in Chennai to get clearance for bigger projects.”“Similarly, conversion of land for industrial projects has several hurdles locally and only an integrated and single window system like CDA can fast track projects,” said president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) C Balasubramanian. The Coimbatore District Small Scale Industries Association (Codissia) has been voicing the demand for long, president M V Ramesh Babu said. President of the Southern India Engineering Manufacturers' Association (Siema) K V Karthik said CDA will spur growth of the western region. “Neighbouring districts will also feel the growth just like suburban areas of Chennai are witnessing. It will make Coimbatore as ideal destination for industrial activities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cda-to-cut-red-tape-propel-citys-growth/articleshow/85313224.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: Ganga, Yamuna receding rapidly, people in flood relief camps preparing to return home||PRAYAGRAJ: With the Ganga and the Yamuna both receding rapidly, fear of the worst flood situation among city residents and officials is now fading away. Since yesterday, water level of both the rivers had started receding but at a very slow pace. However, since Friday morning, the decrease in water level picked up pace. At 4pm, Ganga at Phaphamau was receding at a rate of 3 cm, and at Chhatnag, it was receding at a rate of 4 cm per hour. Yamuna was receding at a rate of 5 cm per hour. In fact, Ganga at Chhatnag is now flowing below the danger mark of 84.73 m. At 4 pm, Ganga was flowing at 85.25 m at Phaphamau, and at 84.29 m at Chhatnag. At the same time, Yamuna was flowing at 84.98 m at Naini. Now with the rapid decrease in water level, locals have breathed a sigh of relief. Those staying in the flood relief camps have started preparing to return to their homes. Those who have moved to the first floor of their houses have started contacting labourers and painters to get their ground floors restored. “Since the entire ground floor of my house is submerged in flood water, I have to clean it up first and then apply fresh paint before moving back,” said Dharmendra Kanojia, resident of Chhota Bagdha locality. The district administration and teams of NDRF visited several flood-affected localities on Friday. “We distributed puffed rice, drinking water, biscuits and other eatables to the stranded people in flooded localities,” said Dinkar Tripathi, inspector at NDRF. NDRF teams distributes food packets in flood-hit areas on Friday“Both the rivers have started receding, and we believe that Yamuna too, like Ganga at Chhatnag, would come down below the danger mark by Friday night. Ganga at Phaphamau too would climb down the danger mark by Saturday, and the receding trend would continue in the coming days,” said executive engineer of irrigation department, Brijesh Kumar Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/both-rivers-receding-rapidly-stranded-residents-preparing-to-return-home/articleshow/85313908.cms||Rajeev Mani
---||India||Covid: SII chief doubts if vaxccine drive can cover all adults by end of year||PUNE: Serum Institute of India (SII) chairman and MD Cyrus Poonawalla on Friday raised doubts about the government’s claims of vaccinating all above 18 by the end of this year and making available 45 crore doses by September. He also said mixing of two different vaccines would not be advisable. “Politicians often bluff. Producing 10 crore doses a month is not an easy task,” he said while replying to a question on the vaccination and dose availability claims. Poonawalla praised the Centre for easing bureaucratic approvals and paving the way for faster manufacturing of the vaccines, but said the ban on export of vaccines must be relaxed. He recalled how industries used to face hardships in securing permissions and the harassment from bureaucrats 50 years ago. “The Modi government has made a good reform in terms of licencing of drugs. This has helped in quick manufacturing of the Covid vaccine. But the ban on export of vaccines was very bad. My son asked me not to speak about it. Exports should start. Nearly 150-170 countries need the Covid vaccines and we are not able to give them,” he said. Poonawalla was speaking to reporters after he was conferred with the prestigious Lokmanya Tilak award by the Tilak Smarak Trust in Pune on Friday. Deepak Tilak, great grandson of Lokmanya Tilak, and former Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde shared the dais. Poonawalla said no company in the world has been able to supply 10-12 crore doses in a month. “We could do it because we had made advance preparations for it and had made an investment worth crores of rupees so that we could supply around 110-120 crore doses per year. These numbers may help you to calculate. Other companies can also chip in by providing one or two crore doses per month, which would help increase India's total immunization potential,” he said. On the vaccine cocktail, Poonawalla said, “It is very wrong to encourage mixing of two different vaccines. It is a risky decision and a waste of time. If one vaccine is working, why should we mix it up unnecessarily and create complications? This should be completely discouraged.” Poonawalla also advised the need for a booster dose after a gap of six months post full vaccination. However, he felt that the gap between the first two doses should not have been extended to three months as done by "Modi government" and a gap of two months was better. Replying to a question on the launch of Novovax, Poonawalla said, “Unless we get a licence to launch Novovax, we cannot launch the vaccine. The parent US company has got some issues with the FDA of the country, which should be sorted by October-end. Once they get the licence, we would. There is some effort to get the licence before the parent company but that is an uphill task.” Poonawalla said he did not agree with the idea of introducing lockdowns. “There may be more cases in the beginning if a lockdown is not imposed, but then herd immunity may gradually develop in such a scenario. Herd immunity may be preferred to a lockdown because the Covid death rate is very low,” he said. On the losses faced by SII for providing Covishield at a lower cost, Poonawalla said the company has lost a huge amount in terms of profit, but not from making the vaccine. “Take for example the measles vaccine, which we are providing at a cost of Rs 8-10 per dose to the government of India whereas the same is given by foreign countries to us at Rs 50 per dose. That answers the sacrifice that the Poonawallas are making to protect the Indian population,” he said. Responding to a question on the “threats” that the family had to face earlier this year, Poonawalla said the issue was blown out of proportion. “There was no reason for people to exaggerate that my son had to leave the country because of that. It was the annual summer vacation which he went for,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sii-chief-doubts-if-vax-drive-can-cover-all-adults-by-end-of-year/articleshow/85317712.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Coimbatore||Rs 225-cr defence industrial park to come up in district||The state government will take the defence industrial corridors project of the Union government forward by establishing a defence component manufacturing park in Coimbatore over 500 acres at a cost of Rs 225 crore, finance minister Palanivel Thiagarajan said while presenting the revised budget for the financial year 2021-22 on Friday.The park is expected to attract Rs 3,500 crore investments. “Although the Union government announced establishment of defence industrial corridors connecting Hosur, Salem, Tiruchirapalli and Coimbatore, the support of the Union government has been limited,” the minister said.Industry bodies in Coimbatore welcomed the announcement. President of the Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association (Siema) K V Karthik said defence establishments have been organising vendors meets for sourcing components. “Defence components demand highest levels of precision. It will take time for the domestic companies to accustom to such requirements. Arrival of large manufacturing companies is crucial for manufacturing high precision equipment.”“Indian industrial giants like Tata, Reliance and L&T are active in the defence manufacturing sector. If this park becomes a reality, such companies can establish bases in the region for manufacturing defence equipment,” said president of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) Balasubramanian.The Coimbatore District Small Scale Industries Association (Codissia) has been asking the state government to bring large industries to Coimbatore after the Union government announced Tamil Nadu a part of the defence corridor project, said Codissia president M V Ramesh Babu. “Codissia Defence Innovation and Atal Incubation Centre (CDIIC) has incubated 10 startups to manufacture defence components and most of them are in Tamil Nadu. This year, we are incubating 15 more startups. One hundred and forty more medium and small industrial units have approached us and we are in the process of identifying companies capable of supplying components to defence units.”“The announcement on defence component manufacturing park in the state budget is in line with our demand. While large industries are expected to make an investment of up to Rs 3,500 in the park to manufacture defence products, MSMEs can become vendors to these industries,” Ramesh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rs-225-cr-defence-industrial-park-to-come-up-in-district/articleshow/85313236.cms||Sampath Kumar

With this, the number of people nabbed in the case has gone up to nine. An official source identified the accused as Arunkumar, a resident of Kittasurampalayam village near Pollachi. “He was a friend of one of the accused in the case.” Arunkumar was produced before the district mahila court, which remanded him in judicial custody. He was subsequently lodged in the Salem Central Prison. In 2020, the CBI had arrested K Arulanantham, T Heron Paul and P Babu for gangraping a college student in 2019 and taking video of the act. The incident came to light when the video went viral. Arulanantham was Pollachi town secretary of the AIADMK students’ wing. He was expelled from the party immediately after his arrest. In 2019, K Thirunavukkarasu, N Sabarirajan alias Riswanth, R Manivannan, T Vasanthakumar and N Sathish were arrested in the case. While the case was registered by the rural police, it was transferred to the Crime Branch-CID and later to the CBI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/one-more-held-in-pollachi-rape-case/articleshow/85313248.cms||---

Both these persons have been arrested.” AEROs are mandated to provide citizen-centric services including printing of voter ID cards and their timely distribution. UP Police has, meanwhile, formed several teams to nab the man’s accomplices — one from Delhi and another from Madhya Pradesh. Vipul Saini, who is in his early 20s, was picked up from Saharanpur’s Nakud town where he runs a computer shop on Thursday. Hard drives and computers from his shop were also seized. Saini is estimated to have made as many as 10,000 voter ID cards in the past three months. Police said his bank account had “a substantial amount of money running into lakhs of rupees." SP city (Saharanpur) Rajesh Kumar told TOI that an FIR has been registered against him under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act. Saini is lodged in Saharanpur jail at present. “During investigation, we found that Saini had an authorised franchisee to make PAN cards and he used to get a lot of requests to make voter ID cards as well," Kumar said. “Saini secured the ECI password through illegal means and with the help of his friends started to make voter ID cards as well. He sent them to MP and Delhi and would charge Rs 100 to Rs 200 for each card.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/no-data-breach-says-eci-after-hackers-arrest/articleshow/85311022.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: With strict social distancing rules in place, hoteliers question 10pm logic||MUMBAI: The 10pm deadline announced by the state government for dining-in at hotels and restaurants has left a sour aftertaste. Given the stringent SoPs in place (50% seating, entry restricted to vaccinated workers and guests, exhaust running along with ACs in enclosed spaces, frequent sanitisation and cleaning), many in the hospitality sector question the rationale behind the 10pm limit.  Their argument is that the social distancing rules for their businesses are far more than those for public transport and other establishments in the metropolitan region, and yet the time limits are more restrictive. TimesViewThe concerns of the hospitality industry are totally valid. It is in an extremely precarious situation financially. Putting arbitrary timelines on the functioning of business, more so for a sector where bulk of activity and revenue has always been in the post 8pm space, is irrational. Standalone restaurants and bars must be allowed to function till 1am. Longer the hours, the more dispersed will be the footfall, minimising chances of crowding and the spread of Covid-19. Equally importantly, in a sector that generates so much employment and is struggling to pay and engage staff, allowing a longer period of operations will encourage more shifts, and thereby, the necessity for more staff to be provided gainful employment. Surely the virus does not multiply faster at night.The government should also ensure that no licence fees are charged for the period from the date of the first lockdown till all restrictions are finally lifted. Enforcing timelines and rules that have little or no scientific rationality can sometimes have irreversible ramifications for the sustainability of an industry and of those employed in it.Governance cannot be an arbitrary exercise of power even if the objective is bringing down Covid numbers. The taxpayer is the final master and decisions that affect him/her must be able to withstand scrutiny. To treat the taxpayer as a silent observer who must put up with bureaucratic calls made in closed rooms and then plead to make his voice heard is indefensible.Why is it that the earlier deadline of 1.30am is considered unfeasible, especially since the bulk of revenues are generated in the second half of the night, they ask.  HRAWI senior vice president Pradeep Shetty said over 70% business for restaurants came from dining-in during evening hours while the rest came from home deliveries or orders in the daytime. Since many corporates had adopted WFH, lunch hour business has dwindled, he said.  Most restaurant owners said the problem was more acute in Mumbai due to the time spent commuting. Patrons to an Andheri bar, Anu Aparajith and Shital Dumre, said office goers in Mumbai often get home late and then plan to step out for a meal with family or friends. “A 10pm deadline will mean by the time we reach, the owners will already be preparing to pull shutters for the day,” they said.  A hotelier said the restaurant industry cannot be compared with malls and retail spaces. "People shop in malls after office hours or during the day. However, if the family has to shop and eat together, a 10 pm deadline is not realistic," he added.  AHAR President Shivanand Shetty too questioned the logic of the 10pm limit for daily operations since the hospitality industry has already adopted and practises best Covid norms. He, however, thanked the government for making a single dose the criterion for staffers and guests to enter hotel premises. “A large number of workers are jobless, and some of the owners ended their lives. There is no relief from taxes either to make up for the losses due to the lockdown," said another restaurateur while arguing for more relaxations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-strict-social-distancing-rules-in-place-hoteliers-question-10pm-logic/articleshow/85313359.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Scrappage policy to boost new car, CV sales, say dealers||AHMEDABAD: After the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) launched the new vehicle scrappage policy, car dealers believe it will help boost the sale of new cars as well as commercial vehicles. The new policy comes with a slew of incentives such as waiver of registration fee of the purchased vehicle, scrap value and road tax rebate, getting a 10-year old vehicle scrapped after a certain period becomes an attractive proposition. Dealers have projected a series of long-term benefit of such a policy. “In both commercial vehicle as well as passenger vehicles, the new policy will boost sale of new units. There are provisions proposed for a discount on new cars against a vehicle scrappage certificate, which go up to 4-5% of the ex-showroom cost of the vehicle. This will certainly boost demand for new vehicles in both commercial as well as passenger vehicle segment,” said Pranav Shah, chairman, FADA – Gujarat. Dealers estimate that with these waivers, the estimated cost of new vehicles will come down by an estimated 6%. For commercial vehicles (CVs), where the turnaround time for changing the vehicle is usually greater, the incentives will certainly encourage the users of older CVs to get their vehicles scrapped and invest in new ones. Dealers feel this will not affect the demand in the used car market. “The turnaround time for people changing cars is reducing from 7-8 years to 5-6 years. The vehicle scrappage policy has a provision for scrapping vehicles older than 20 years and this is still a long time, within which the second user of the vehicle can use the car and later opt for scrappage and still take the advantage on their next new car purchase,” said Jinmay Shah, business head, of a city-based car dealership. Industry stakeholders estimate that in Gujarat, at least 15 lakh commercial and passenger vehicles will directly be eligible for scrappage whenever it is rolled out. While this may give a major boost to new car sales, dealers fear that the used car market will have to battle an oversupply situation. “With a scrappage policy in place, more people will have a tendency to get rid of their cars after a certain number of years. This will cause an oversupply situation in the used car market, bringing the overall cost of used cars further down,” said Jigar Vyas, CEO of an Ahmedabad-based car dealership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/scrappage-policy-to-boost-new-car-cv-sales-dealers/articleshow/85313328.cms||Niyati Parikh

The state government also announced that it will set up two new scrap vehicle parks — one at Alang near Bhavnagar and another in Kutch. Manoj Das, additional chief secretary (ACS), the chief minister’s office, and in charge ACS, ports & transport department, said: “The policy will boost raw and metal recycling industrial units in the state.” Das said the state government has signed the MoUs with Tata Motors Limited, CMR-Kataria Recycling Private Limited, Cero-Mahindra MSTC Recycling Pvt Ltd, Modest Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, Mascot Engitech Private Limited, and Mono Steel India Limited. Das said: “The state has an established ecosystem for ship recycling and is well versed with the process of scrappage, waste disposal, and reuse of recycled materials.” Das went on to say: “Gujarat is intent on leveraging Alang and Kutch’s recycling ecosystem for the development of vehicle-scrapping facilities in Gujarat.” PM Narendra Modi, in his speech on Friday, stressed on developing Alang in Bhavnagar, which is a hub for ship recycling, into a vehicle-recycling hub. “Alang has already established itself as a ship-recycling hub. It also has skilled manpower,” Modi said. “I strongly feel that it can also become a hub for turning vehicles into scrap. This will change the life of small traders and workers, as they will get the benefits of an organized sector.” The PM said that the policy will boost the automobile as well as the metal industry. Industry bodies such as CII and GCCI lauded the Union government for coming up with the policy that will make Indian scrappage industry organized, transparent and environment friendly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-signs-6-mous-for-vehicle-scrapping-units/articleshow/85313401.cms||---

Explaining his case, advocate general BS Prasad informed the court that the money was meant for land losers who had secured decrees from courts and even filed execution petitions for getting their decrees enforced. “This is not for defending the CS in the contempt cases as alleged by the petitioner,” he said while urging the court to allow them to release the money without the need for any addendum because the record was clear about the purpose of the grant.

---||Pune||Pune: Online entry system for UG courses, results by August-end||PUNE: The first merit lists for most undergraduate courses offered by colleges in the city will be out before the end of this month. Some parents complained that the admission websites of some colleges are not user friendly and they cannot even enquire with the colleges since they are closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions. However, colleges said multiple helpline numbers along with email IDs have been provided to the parents for grievance redressal. Some colleges have also said that students from boards that have not released the original mark sheets of Std XII can also provide online scanned copies of the mark sheets. The form filling process at most colleges started in the first week of August and will continue till August 20. “While I was able to easily fill up forms of two colleges, it was very difficult to fill up the online form of a prominent college. The helpline numbers given were landline numbers that were busy and at one point, when we were entering the marks, the form would not go ahead. We did not know what to do. So we have sent an email to the college,” said a parent. However, the college authorities said that all emails by parents are replied to within a stipulated time. Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce has been following the online application process since 2007 and claims that there are hardly any grievances from the parents. “We have a seasoned system that is very smooth for users. Initially, there was trouble, as we had kept the leaving certificate and domicile certificate in the mandatory category due to which the form was not getting submitted. As soon as parents contacted us, we removed it. Now there is no trouble,” principal Hrishikesh Soman said. Like the last year, the physical verification of certificates may not be possible. “It is a bit tricky for colleges but considering the situation, it may be the only way ahead,” added Soman. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, said they plan to upload videos by principals talking about the admission process, which documents to keep ready, what to do if a document is unavailable and post it to their official YouTube channel. However, he said that some of the biggest problems that colleges face while verifying the forms are in the easiest of details. “Students sometimes ask a friend or a cyber cafe operator or someone else to fill-up the form and we find mistakes in name, age, reservation category among others. Then students sometimes upload pictures from a picnic or a family outing on the application form. It is very important to check the forms thoroughly before submitting,” Zunjarrao said. The colleges also make some documents mandatory because keeping a liberal admission process poses problems in the future. “If we do not take caste certificates seriously and then we come to know that the student has no caste certificate or a non-creamy layer certificate, then it is wrong. A worthy student can lose an opportunity because of this student. Hence, we need to be strict during document verification and students too must ensure that all correct documents are sent,” he added. Undergraduate courses in arts, commerce and science are popular among the huge community of students in the city and those coming to Pune from other parts of the state and from those outside the state. Many pursue courses leading to the civil services while earning a degree. They enrol for degree courses that wind up by morning or afternoon and take up these courses in nearby institutes. Others tend to veer towards courses in foreign language institutes. Many commerce students study for CA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/online-entry-system-for-ug-courses-results-by-aug-end/articleshow/85315674.cms||Ardhra Nair

The state government is focusing on improving infrastructure, processes, and strategy in a bid to create a logistics hub in Goa, Sawant said at the 7th edition of the CII Goa conference on logistics. “I personally feel that we should leverage the use of waterways for internal transportation of goods. I welcome suggestions related to the efficient use of waterways for people and goods transportation,” he said. “Goa has the potential to emerge as a strategic logistics hub in the western India,” Sawant said adding that Goa can also help transport cargo through coastal and inland waterways for southern Maharashtra and northern Karnataka. “We have recently constituted the state logistics coordination committee which will focus on physical infra, systems and processes, logistics workforce, strategy and policy and coordination for this sector,” he said. He said that Goa as well as the Centre want to make logistics a key focus area. “India’s contribution to the world’s GDP was 25-30% and today we are at 7%. If we have to reach anywhere near that number again, we have to do a lot of work and logistics will be a key driver of the growth,” Sawant said. The chief minister as well as Rajya Sabha MP Suresh Prabhu spoke about the development of rail infrastructure and the greenfield airport at Mopa as key drivers of employment, economic growth and movement of cargo. Prabhu said that it makes sense for Goa to become a logistics hub. “Goa must not lose its identity, culture and environment and logistics will not do that. For this, Goa needs to put all the building blocks together to make sure it happens, sooner than later,” Prabhu, who is India’s Sherpa G20 and G7 Summit, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-goa-could-use-rivers-to-move-perishable-cargo/articleshow/85315750.cms||Newton Sequeira

Modi, in his ten-minute address through a video link, spoke about the ideals of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj that Purandare spent the better part of eight decades writing and speaking about, and also wished him good health and a happy birthday in Marathi. “At the beginning, I bow down and greet Shivshaahir Babasaheb Purandare, and I pray to God that I imbibe the ideals that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj propagated and upheld. I convey my greetings to Purandare on him entering the 100th year of his life, and I hope that his directions and his blessings are with us for a long time to come,” Modi said, addressing the audience in Marathi and Hindi. Both the current and former chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray and Devendra Fadnavis, wished Purandare through a letter and a video address, respectively. Also present was former Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan, who helped organise the civic reception and spoke briefly, as well as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, who joined remotely. Despite being present in person, Purandare addressed the gathering through a pre-recorded speech, speaking about his long career as a writer and dramatist, and his experience over the years reading, researching, and writing about Shivaji Maharaj. Purandare, born in Saswad, near Pune, in 1922, is a receipient of the Padma Vibhushan and Maharashtra Bhushan awards. His novels and dramas have been adapted into television dramas and stage shows, most notably Jaanta Raja, which was staged by his troupe for the first time in 1984, and has been staged thereafter more than a 1,000 times. Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar reminisced about reading the works about Shivaji in school and at home and being inspired by Purandare’s work on Shivaji Maharaj. “I remember reading about Shivaji Maharaj in the history class in school. A lot of information was shared about him at home, too. Even after that I needed some finishing touches, and the words of Babasaheb Purandare provided that touch. Those words inspired me in cricket as well, and it also provides a lot of inspiration to a lot of people, and builds a fighting spirit,” Tendulkar said, regretting that he never got the chance to watch Jaanta Raja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/modi-wishes-purandare-on-100th-birthday/articleshow/85315731.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Jaipur||220 freedom fighters feature in Rajasthan archives gallery||JAIPUR: Life sketches of 220 freedom fighters from the erstwhile 22 Rajputana states have been featured in a special gallery at the Rajasthan State Archives Bikaner (RSAB). The sketches include their contribution in all freedom struggles—Khilafat, Non-Cooperation, Civil Disobedience to Quit India movement—between 1920 and 1947. The gallery has recorded original audio of many of the fighters’ speeches, giving an idea of their oratory skills and first-hand account of the prevailing situation during that period. The gallery claimed to have untold stories of the state’s freedom fighters which deserves much attention from citizens. The RSAB is holding an exhibition of freedom fighters at Jawahar Kala Kendra from August 14 to 31. The profile of Vijay Shankar Shastri, who was born in 1926, has mastered the art of making explosives while he was a student in Delhi. He came to Jaipur, started supplying bombs to freedom fighters in Delhi, Meerut and Agra. The documents say that he led the march of 5,000 people from Sanganeri Gate to the Walled City in Jaipur protesting the death of Congress leader Lala Lajpat Rai on November 20, 1928. He was so fearless that he was providing a safe haven or a refuge to the freedom fighters escaping police in and around Jaipur. He died in 1974. The audio recording of freedom fighter Syed Fayaz in Bhilwara says how they were harassed by the local rulers who were functioning under the Britishers. He was tortured by the local police for going to the Congress office for reading newspapers. “I was pressurised to read the Mewar state paper. I ran to Ajmer to met Durga Prasad (Founder of a Hindi daily) in Ajmer which has connected me to other freedom fighters,” said Fayaz, who was jailed several times for participating in all freedom movements until India gained Independence. All these freedom fighters were lodged in prison at least once, they were forced to live in exile for years, properties confiscated, families harassed and were branded as ‘traitors’ by the local rulers. Explaining the reasons behind the initiative, Mahendra Singh Khadgawat, director of the RSAB says that the contribution of state freedom fighters has been forgotten in the history written after 1947. “The courage, sacrifice and valour of these freedom fighters are no less than any fighter of some particular regions known by the nation. It took me four years to collect all the archival content related to these fighters from libraries, government records, from over 300 newspapers and magazines,” said Khadgawat. The biggest resource turned out for the RSAD was the audio interviews of 240 freedom fighters recorded in 1982 under the special project of the state government ‘Oral History.’ “It is the biggest repository of freedom fighters any state has which can have the potential to dot the missing links in several freedom movement incidents,” said Khadgawat. Indicating another treasure trove waiting to hit the public domain is over 100 songs and poems written by these freedom fighters. “Every song and poem describes the state of mind of the people, their struggles, ambitions, hope and vision for free India,” said Khadgawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/220-freedom-fighters-from-erstwhile-rajputana-featured-at-state-archives/articleshow/85313471.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Pune||Crook uses spoofed email, gets bank to transfer Rs 20 lakh||PUNE: The Koregaon Park police are probing a transfer of Rs20 lakh from a company’s current account with a leading private bank’s Bund Garden Road branch, to a different firm’s account with the same bank in Kanpur. Police said the transfer was the result of email spoofing and occurred on December 1, 2020. The bank has since recovered nearly Rs16 lakh. Email spoofing is a form of cyber-attack in which a fraudster sends an email that was manipulated to seem like it originated from a trusted source. In this case, on December 1, the bank received an email apparently sent by one of its corporate clients from Chakan. The email directed the bank to transfer Rs20 lakh to a proprietorship firm’s bank account at Ashoknagar in Kanpur. The email contained a scanned copy of the proprietorship’s letterhead. The bank promptly made the transfer but later that day, the Chakan’s company officials contacted the bank. They questioned the bank about the Rs20 lakh debit, insisted that they issued no such email and told the bank to return the money to their account. The police said beneficiary firm’s proprietor was the main suspect. They believe he hacked the company’s email and monitored its communications with the bank before spoofing the email address. The bank’s chief manager stated in his complaint on Thursday night, “The bank submitted a complaint application to Pune cybercrime cell on December 2 last year and got the police to freeze the beneficiary account in Kanpur. By then, the account contained only Rs1.80 lakh. The suspect, who stays in Bina Bazar in Kanpur, had moved Rs5 lakh each to two separate accounts of a development bank and Rs2 lakh to an account with a nationalised bank. He withdrew Rs6 lakh by cheque and Rs20,000 from an ATM.” The complaint stated that the bank officials traced the proprietor and got him to move the money back from all three accounts to the original beneficiary account in the Ashoknagar branch. The bank managed to recover Rs15.8 lakh from the suspect, the complaint said. “The proprietor told bank officials that he was not in a position to return remainder. He is suspected of having pulled off the crime. We will soon send a team to Kanpur to arrest him,” senior inspector Dilip Shinde of the Koregaon Park police told TOI on Friday. When TOI contacted him, the complainant declined to comment on the matter. Inspector (cybercrime cell) Dagdu S Hake, who verified complaint application, told TOI, “We have given the Koregaon Park police the name, address and all relevant details of the culprit.” A case has been registered under IPC sections 419 and 420 (both related to cheating) and 34, and Section 66 (1) (d) of the Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crook-uses-spoofed-email-gets-bank-to-transfer-rs-20l/articleshow/85315748.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The investment in the project is estimated to be about Rs 1,500 crore, said sources close to the development. The State-Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), Gujarat recently gave the mandatory environmental approval to Vedanta to carry out 54 exploration and appraisal wells project in Gujarat. Vedanta Oil and Gas had proposed 70 exploration and appraisal wells drilling campaign at its block CB-ONHP-2017/10 which it bagged in the Open Acreage Leasing Policy-1 bid round. Out of the total 70 wells, 16 are in Rajasthan and 54 are in Gujarat. Vedanta Limited’s oil & gas operations comprise the assets of Cairn contributing over 26% of India’s annual production, as India’s largest private sector crude oil producer. Vedanta had earlier applied to the environment ministry to clear the project. In January 2019, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had planned a public hearing at Deodar for the Gujarat part of the 2766-sq km block. Of the total area, 2100 sq km is in Banaskantha, and 666 sq km is in Jalore (Rajasthan). Later on, Vedanta was exempted from preparing an Environmental Impact Assessment report and organising a public hearing to clear the project after the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC) put onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration activities as ‘B2’ category for seeking prior Environmental Clearance (EC). As per these new rules, Vedanta was to take clearance from Gujarat government’s SEIAA for starting work on the project. An e-mail sent to the company remained unanswered. As per plans submitted to SEIAA, Vedanta plans to set up Early Production Units (EPUs) and Quick Production Units (QPU) to produce well-fluid processing and production of up to 28,000 barrels per day of crude oil and up to 3 million cubic feet per day of associated natural gas, said sources. Cairn operates in the Lakshmi and Gauri oil and gas fields in CB/OS 2 block in Cambay, Gujarat. In 2002, the production of gas commenced in the Lakshmi gas field. In the Gauri field, it commenced in 2004. Cambay has produced approximately 34 million barrels of crude oil and more than 242 billion cubic feet of natural gas, according to Vedanta’s official website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vedanta-gets-nod-to-begin-oil-and-gas-exploration-in-banaskantha/articleshow/85313484.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation cancels lease to run heritage hotel||JAIPUR: Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC) has revoked the leases given to Epitome Destination to run four of its properties including 12-room heritage hotel Jai Samand and motels and guest houses after an internal committee of the corporation found the lessee violating the contract norms. In an official order on August 11, the managing director of RTDC Ngikya Gohain narrated reasons for cancellation of the lease highlighting how various departments like the forestry, water resources and the Udaipur district administration showed concern over the unlawful construction activities undertaken by the company in the eco-sensitive zone. Moreover, the order said that the licencee did not follow the terms of the contract and caused damage to the heritage structure and style of the building. TOI was first to report on July 26, 2021 that RTDC awarded the lease to Epitome Destination in March for five years starting from April 1, extendable by another similar period, for a monthly rental of Rs 40,000 for the four properties. The licencee then carried out renovation work, including the construction of a swimming pool without any approvals from RTDC. The company was asked to explain why it failed to take the approvals for the construction of a swimming pool which was not there earlier. It was only repair works the licencee was supposed to do, not any new construction. An enquiry committee had carried out inspection of the construction and found gross violations of the terms of the contract. All the decisions relating to the award of the lease were undertaken without the knowledge of the chairman of RTDC and principal secretary tourism. When TOI contacted principal secretary tourism, Gayatri Rathore, she said, “We are inquiring if due administrative processes were followed before awarding the leases. If we find overstepping of responsibilities, we will take necessary action as per the law.” In fact, there is a big question mark as to on what basis the monthly rents were fixed. All the decisions were taken by the MD of RTDC alone. Sources said the matter was never taken to RTDC board and unilaterally done at the MD level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rtdc-cancels-lease-of-jai-samand-hotel-3-other-properties/articleshow/85313523.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Compared to 390 kidney transplants at IKDRC in 2019, 2020 saw only 75 transplants till March 31. However, what did not change was the ratio of living donors to cadaver kidney donations, at 3:1. A retrospective study by Dr Vivek Kute, Dr Pranjal Modi, Dr Vineet Mishra and other experts on two decades of kidney transplants at IKDRC brought out the figure. Progress, however, has been made in the past few years, said the authors of the study. When the programme was launched in 1997 by Dr H L Trivedi, there were 54 transplants from living donors and six from the dead. Dr Mishra, director of IKDRC, said, “There is greater awareness about kidney disease and treatment now. We now have 54 dialysis centres in Gujarat and intend to add more.” The study also revealed that from 1997 to 2020, a total of 4,895 transplants were from living donors and 943 from the deceased. The most common diseases that led to end-stage kidney disease in recipients were chronic glomerulonephritis (24%), diabetes (16%), and hypertension (16%), among others. DyCM Nitin Patel announced donation of Rs 100 crore for IKDRC-GUTS from a philanthropist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/living-kidney-donors-still-thrice-cadaver-numbers/articleshow/85313568.cms||Parth Shastri

A new container feeder service operated by Shreyas Shipping and Logistics is expected to start from August 26 connecting MPT with Mundra port, the largest private port of India located on the north shores of the Gulf of Kutch. Another container vessel operated by MSC Agency (India) has sought a tentative berthing slot at MPT which will connect Goa with Colombo and Tuticorin. MV OEL Colombo, which is operated by MSC Agency (India) has approached MPT for a berthing slot for August 21 with about 90 containers to be offloaded and around 70 containers to be shipped out. Container agent Maersk Line had asked its customers to stop taking container bookings from MPT after the only container feeder vessel operator Sima Marine discontinued the service from August 3. Immediately after that on August 5, MPT announced substantial discounts for any new feeder operator with additional discounts for container vessels for three months for the seafood export season. MPT also waived off berthing charges for the first port of call of any feeder service which prompted MSC Agency (India) to show interest in operating its own vessel for import and export of containers. “We have just got the new that Shreyas Shipping and Logistics is looking to resume the feeder service at Goa effectively from August 26 with the first call and they are planning to target the hub at Mundra. Definitely, Mundra is the right choice in the current scenario as it will give the right exposure for Goa across the globe,” said Capt Swaminathan Rajagopalan, commercial manager at CMA CGM India Pvt Ltd. Rajagopalan said that consistency and frequency of the feeder service will be the game changer. The logistics committee of Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) had recently approached MPT and other state government officials expressing concern over the discontinuation of the feeder service.

The bench headed by Justice J B Pardiwala said, “We are quite disturbed by the present litigation. We are saying so because over a period of time, we have come across many such matters, where the companies engaged in the business of outdoor advertising have defaulted on crores of rupees and still continue to retain the contract for putting up hoardings in major cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, etc.” Over unpaid fees of agencies who obtained contracts for unipoles, the court further said it is very disturbing to note that crores of rupees are yet to be recovered towards arrears of licence fees. The Vadodara municipal commissioner had drawn attention of the standing committee to the payment default by the agencies, but contracts to these firms continued to be renewed. The court said about the will of the elected representatives of the civic body, “…it was expected of the standing committee to look into the same when the authority like the commissioner of the corporation is pointing out something serious to them. It gives an impression that someone in the corporation is trying to protect all the defaulters at the cost of public revenue.” The firms cited various reasons including the lockdown and Covid-19 pandemic for their inability to pay the fees and sought a waiver for the lockdown period. The HC did not grant any relief and instead insisted that it is public money and the government and its instrumentalities should recover it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-vmc-to-recover-pending-advertising-licence-fees/articleshow/85313606.cms||---

The complainant, a resident of Sanand, said she met the accused, 28, a resident of Sarkhej, at an automobile manufacturing factory in Moraiya village, where he joined work around eight months ago. They soon fell in love and got engaged on February 2 with the consent of the family members of both sides. After she got engaged, the accused began visiting her at her home in Sanand often. In February, the accused had some dispute with his family members and began staying at the complainant’s home. She alleged that when he was staying at her home, he had sex with her repeatedly, saying that they would marry soon. “He stayed at my home for around six months and had sex with me often. Around 15 days ago, he went back to his house after sorting out the dispute with his family,” she said. She further said that around two weeks ago, he met her and told her that he would not marry her and wanted to break off their relationship. When she took this to his parents, they supported their son and told the complainant to commit suicide. Aggrieved by this, the complainant had on August 8 consumed poison to commit suicide. She was taken to Sola Civil Hospital where she gave her statement to police.

A committee headed by the additional municipal commissioner has been set up to look into the matter. According to Agra municipal commissioner Nikhil T Funde, the civic body’s website was hacked last week. “The website was used to generate 288 fake birth and death certificates. The serial numbers on those documents do not exist in our records, that’s how we were able to identify the fake certificates. We assign a unique serial number to each document that is issued,” he said. All of the certificates were issued to residents in the Tajganj zone. “An FIR has been registered against unidentified persons as we do not know who was behind the crime,” said Funde, adding that a full list of fake certificates would be released soon. The FIR has been registered under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 471 (using a forged document as genuine), 417 (punishment for cheating) and sections of the IT Act. A three-member committee headed by additional municipal commissioner K B Singh has been set up to probe the case. The municipal commissioner said that possibility of an “insider’s role cannot be ruled out”. A civic official told TOI that a common service centre — which are run by private agencies and facilitate people to avail of public utility services for a fee — or a cyber cafe was likely involved. “Such centres usually charge anywhere between Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 for their services,” the civic official said. “Birth and death certificates are used to avail of benefits under government schemes. It is possible that some people who approached a common service centre to get the documents made were not aware that they were fake,” the civic official said. The Agra municipal corporation has 100 wards divided into four zones. On average, 80 death and birth certificates are issued from each zonal office every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-civic-body-site-hacked-288-fake-birth-death-certs-out/articleshow/85308851.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: High court fines state govt engineer Rs 50,000||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has held an executive engineer of the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB), M R Pandya, guilty of committing contempt of the court and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on him for not following court orders by deducting TDS of Rs 17.62 lakh from compensation for land acquisition to be given to a land owner. The case involved one Champabhai Hasurbhai from Kambhada village of Botad, whose land was acquired and compensation was awarded to him. Out of the compensation amount of more than Rs 1.9 crore, the department deducted TDS, which according to various judgments cannot be deducted from compensation awarded to land loser. This happened in 2008. Following a direction by the high court last year, the department was to refund the TDS to the farmer within three days, but it did not happen. The high court also noticed that the amount was also not deposited with the income tax department. When the bench headed by Justice Sonia Gokani inquired about non-payment to the landowner, the executive engineer came up with an excuse that he had delegated the work to a head clerk, who failed in his duty. The court refused to buy this argument and said, “One wonders as to how the head clerk could be said to be responsible in matters like this, as he would have no powers virtually to decide the aspect of disbursement, that too of such a huge amount of Rs 17,62,504 and the issue had been pending with the office of the executive engineer from the year 2016.” The court held Pandya liable for default and observed, “The contemnor by his conduct interfered substantially with the due course of justice and, therefore, he has been held guilty for contempt of court. The contemnor for wilful and deliberate disobedience of the order of the court is liable to be punished for contempt.” It was the unconditional apology tendered by Pandya and accepted by the court that spared him the prison. But the court ordered him to deposit with the court Rs 2,000 towards penalty and Rs 50,000 towards cost. Of this amount, the court ordered to pay Rs 40,000 to the litigant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/high-court-fines-state-govt-engineer-rs-50000/articleshow/85313644.cms||---

The party is going all out to woo the Marathi manoos from Konkan who form a major vote bank in the city and are traditionally Shiv Sena voters. While Gujaratis, north Indians and a section of Marathis do vote for BJP, the Konkan voter has proved a challenge. Party leaders from the Konkan have been making frequent trips to the coastal districts highlighting government neglect in these areas. BJP won 84 seats in the last civic poll. This time, as it again contests on its own with Sena, NCP and Congress arrayed on the other side, “the party’s focus is to reach out to the largest number of voters possible”, said Pravin Darekar, the BJP in-charge of the recruitment process for south Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-starts-poll-warmup-woos-senas-konkan-vote-bank-in-city/articleshow/85313670.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Nagpur||School associations to challenge fee reduction GR||Nagpur: The state government’s August 12 GR directing all schools to cut their 2021-22 fee by 15% will be challenged in court, say school associations. The GR also makes it clear that all fee-related disputes now need to be put before the divisional fee regulatory committee (DFRC) and its decision will be final. Sanjay Tayde-Patil, founder-president of Maharashtra English Schools Trustees Association (Mesta), said the state GR is a mere ‘optical illusion’. “The government is misleading parents and creating rifts between them and schools. Let us all be very clear that the government has no powers to interfere in the fee issue. We are definitely going to approach the high court and request for a stay on this particular GR,” said Tayde-Patil. Rajendra Singh, president of Independent English Schools Association (Iesa), said, “We are approaching the court next week. This GR is simply a populist move with no legal foundation. There is simply no legal basis for the GR and everyone knows that it’s outside the law’s ambit.” Unaided Schools Forum, which had challenged a similar GR of May 2020, is also approaching the court over alleged harassment by education officials. SC Kedia, honorary secretary of USF, said, “Our members are being threatened regularly by education officials with cancellation of NOC, which has to be renewed every three years. Our draft petition is ready and the legal process shall start soon against all excesses of the education department.” Last month, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad told TOI that the plan was to bring an ordinance regarding school fee reduction. Why the government changed the plan at the last minute is a surprise. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday termed the GR as an ‘eyewash’. A similar GR issued by the government in May 2020 was also challenged Advocate Willson Matthew, who has represented many schools in different legal disputes, said the current GR is unlikely to withstand scrutiny in court. Matthew said, “This talks about 2021-22 session, whereas there is nothing about it in the Supreme Court order which the GR quotes.” The DFRC can be approached only if minimum 25% of parents come together as a group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/school-associations-to-challenge-fee-reduction-gr/articleshow/85313637.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The family members of the deceased have expressed suspicion over the death even as the police believes that a road accident could be a possible cause. The bodies of Yusuf Kamal (21), Akbar Patel (25) and Samir Jethra (21) were found at the Dangaria village near a tree. The motorcycle they were commuting on was also found at some distance. All the deceased were residents of Kapdi area in Devgadh Baria. It is believed that the youths may have died late on Thursday night or in the early hours on Friday. Family members alleged that they may have been killed and made representations to the police asking a probe for murder. Deputy superintendent of police Kanan Desai said that the post mortem, as well as forensic experts, had revealed that the youths had met with an accident. It is believed that they were unable to negotiate a curve on the road while travelling at a high speed and went off the road. Police, however, registered the death as accidental death and began a probe. Prima facie it is believed that the deaths may be due to a road accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/death-of-three-youths-in-devgadh-baria-sparks-row/articleshow/85311966.cms||---

The quadrants dug for the purpose would be kept open and protected. As the government has decided to declare the archaeological sites as protected areas, this would be possible, they said.“The fund allocation towards archaeological explorations will serve as an encouraging factor to carry out the study on the ancient culture and heritage of Tamils further. The importance given in the budget is unprecedented and will be of great support to the state archaeology department,” Sridharan Krishnappa, deputy director (retired), state archaeology department said.The finance minister termed that the fund allocation for archaeology was the highest among all states. The proposal for deep-sea excavation in the Sangam-age harbours such as Korkai and Azhagankulam in coordination with the National Institute of Oceanography, National Institute of Ocean Technology and Indian Maritime University was also welcomed by enthusiasts. In the revised budget, Rs 16.66 crore has been allocated for the archaeology department. Meanwhile, president of the Tamil Nadu foodgrains merchants’ association, S P Jeyapragasam, said the rural employment project, which will increase the number of days from 100 to 150 and the wages to Rs 300 per day should be mainly for private agricultural land, as it will improve the productivity of agricultural products. Otherwise it will be an unnecessary expenditure for the government, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/archaeologists-hail-funds-for-excavations-in-revised-budget/articleshow/85313731.cms||---

The court said this after taking into account that the state government had taken a policy decision to withdraw all cases registered during jallikattu protests.The petitioner, A Selvin submitted an application seeking passport to the Madurai regional passport officer (RPO) on March 20. An FIR was registered against the petitioner by the Tuticorin Central police in 2017 for participating in a jallikattu protest. The RPO had sent a communication to the petitioner on June 17, wherein it was stated that if the criminal case pending against him is not disposed of, his application would be closed. Following this, the petitioner had filed this present petition. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that the February 20 GO makes it clear that all cases pertaining to jallikattu protest will be closed and action will be dropped, if it is at the FIR stage. The judge observed that in the present case, the investigation is still pending, and it is at the FIR stage. The case will squarely fall under this category. Hence, the judge directed the RPO to process the application and issue a passport within four weeks. The judge further directed the inspector of police of Tuticorin Central station to immediately file the action dropped report in the jallikattu protest case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-asks-rpo-to-issue-passport-to-jallikattu-protester/articleshow/85313714.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Delhi||45 of 3,200 inmates out on interim bail re-arrested: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Only 45 out of the 3,200 undertrial prisoners, released on interim bail this year due to the second wave of the pandemic, were re-arrested for different crimes in the capital. The AAP government on Friday gave the figures to Delhi High Court, saying the number of those arrested again is “not significant”. A full bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi, Rekha Palli and Talwant Singh, which was hearing a suo motu case on extension of interim court orders, was informed that the authorities are “quantifying the data of arrested prisoners” and the police will file a separate reply. The data from the jail administration came after last month the high court took note of the rising crime rate in the capital and asked Delhi government to file a report on the impact of its orders extending interim bails granted to undertrials and convicts to decongest jails to contain the spread of Covid-19. The court wanted to examine if the release of prisoners was in any way responsible for the rising graph of crime rate. However, Delhi government informed it that the prison department has already requested Delhi Police to file a separate report after analysing the law and order situation to give a better picture on impact of the release orders to the court and sought more time. In its response ,the government also informed the court about the pendency of a petition before the Supreme Court on decongestion of prisons on account of Covid-19. The apex court, in its order last month, had made it clear that those prisoners who were already released from prison by SC orders from time to time and on the basis of recommendations of High Powered Committees of each state, they shall not be asked to surrender to prison. The SC is likely to take up the matter again next week. The high court then adjourned the hearing till September 4 while extending all interim orders which are scheduled to expire in cases before it, as also the district courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/45-of-3200-inmates-out-on-interim-bail-re-arrested-hc-told/articleshow/85313738.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand HC allows anyone, even children, to seek e-court services||NAINITAL: Uttarakhand high court will allow anyone, including children, to seek services of ‘e-court vans’ — which will connect remote areas to virtual courts — through an online link or after writing to the local administration. TOI had earlier reported that ‘e-court vans’ would initially be deployed in five hill districts of Pithoragarh, Champawat, Uttarkashi, Tehri and Chamoli. On Friday, Uttarakhand high court said it would provide a link on its website through which people can seek services of ‘e-courts’. One can also write to the local administration. Registrar general Dhananjay Chaturvedi said the focus of e-courts would be to provide help to children, women and elderly living in remote parts of the state who find it difficult to approach courts to record statements or file complaints. “People can approach local village officials, the administration, courts or volunteers of our legal services authority and request the facility. We will also provide a link on the high court’s website where people can ask for mobile courts. The entire effort is to make access to the judicial process easy for people living in the remotest parts of the state,” Chaturvedi said. Judges will hear the cases — both civil and criminal — online while technical teams stationed in the vans will facilitate the appearance of witnesses, complainants and experts before the virtual court and also help with documentation. Investigating officers and medical experts can join the court through the vans. The e-courts will be flagged off by Chief Justice RS Chauhan on Independence Day. Last year, during the Covid-19 pandemic, CJ Chauhan had introduced the first mobile virtual court connecting system in Adilabad when he was serving as the Chief Justice of the Telangana high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-allows-anyone-even-children-to-seek-e-court-services/articleshow/85308927.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Agra||Law catches up with netas: NBWs issued to ex-minister & BJP MLA, BJP state secy & ex-SP MLA||Agra: An additional district and sessions court in Aligarh issued three non-bailable (NBW) warrants against former minister and BJP MLA from Barauli Dalbir Singh, UP’s current BJP state secretary Poonam Bajaj and former MLA of Samajwadi Party Zameerullah Khan a few days ago. The separate cases date back to 2017, 2006 and 1993. The order, issued to Aligarh SSP, stated that for all these years, the police never arrested them or produced them before the court “because of their influence”. The matter is old and needs to be disposed of quickly, the court order said. Talking to TOI, additional district government counsel Ram Kumar said that one warrant was issued against former minister and BJP MLA Dalbir Singh for a case registered in 2017, just before the assembly polls, at Gabhana police station for disobedience to order by a public servant. The next date of hearing in the case is September 7. The MLA had addressed a public meeting, using loudspeakers, on January 13, 2017 in violation of the model code of conduct. The case against UP’s current BJP state secretary Poonam Bajaj was registered in 1993, when she was a party worker, at Sasni Gate police station for rioting, wrongful restraint, assault on public servant and other charges. Bajaj had led a group of people to forcibly take possession of a house for one Arvind Kumar and had blocked the road and assaulted policemen when they tried to disperse them. The case against former SP MLA Zameerullah Khan was registered at Gandhi Park police station in 2006 for furnishing false information and disobedience to order by a public servant. Kumar told TOI that Khan was a mayoral candidate from Samajwadi Party in 2006 and had addressed a meeting at the Jama Masjid violating the model code of conduct. The next date of hearing for Bajaj and Khan is September 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/law-catches-up-with-netas-nbws-issued-to-ex-minister-bjp-mla-bjp-state-secy-ex-sp-mla/articleshow/85308932.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||IIT Bombay-led team’s infra-red blood test can foretell serious Covid||MUMBAI: A team of researchers led by an IIT-Bombay professor has developed a novel method of using infra-red technology to classify patients at risk of developing severe Covid. The technology could help doctors prioritise severe patients in regions with larger outbreaks or during triage at hospitals with higher volumes of Covid patients. This collaborative work of researchers from IIT-Bombay, Kasturba Hospital, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Australia, and Agilent Technologies was published in the journal Analytical Chemistry on Friday. The researchers used the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy as a rapid blood test for classification of severe cases in a cohort of 160 Covid patients at Kasturba. Infra-red spectroscopy is generally used to measure the levels of different chemical groups in any given sample. The test, performed with 85% accuracy in a small pilot study of Covid patients, could come in especially handy during triage — preliminary assessment of patients, usually to determine the urgency of care — in regions with larger outbreaks. “From our FT-IR study, we can say there is a correlation between blood chemical signature and Covid severity. However, we cannot conclude that slight differences in these chemical groups cause patients to become more unwell, but we can say there is an association,” said professor Sanjeeva Srivastava, head of the proteomics facility at IIT-Bombay, who led this study. Associate professor Michelle Hill from the Australian institute said: “We also found that having diabetes was a predictor of becoming severely unwell... so we fed clinical parameters such as age, sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension into the algorithm. We tested the algorithm on blood samples from a separate group of 30 patients from Mumbai and found it was 69.2% specific and 94.1% sensitive in predicting which patients would become severely ill.” Srivastava said: “The RT-PCR test does not indicate when a patient’s condition could deteriorate. Clinicians face a challenge in prioritising patients based on the available tests. Our study provides a simple and cost-effective solution to this problem.” Currently, tests such as D-dimer, C-reactive protein, WBC counts are used to investigate the severity of the disease, but a rapid test could be a game changer. Jayanthi Shastri, head of the molecular lab at Kasturba Hospital, said this blood-based test has shown promise during triaging. It is a translational research and application on a larger scale will depend on more trials with larger sample sizes and other validation processes. Arghya Banerjee, a doctoral student at IIT-B and the lead author, said: “We now need to test the method in additional patient groups to confirm whether the findings of this study can be applied to other populations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-led-teams-infra-red-blood-test-can-foretell-serious-covid/articleshow/85313743.cms||Yogita Rao

His advocate Sahil S Deshprabhu had told the court that the matter was urgent as he had a flight back to Kuwait and that he had filed the petition as he was left with no other option. The date of both the first and second doses were the same on his vaccination certificate. The Panaji urban health centre told him that correction was not possible at their end. He then tried to avail the services of the Co-Win website, but that too was in vain, as were his attempts to make the correction via helpline numbers. The earlier format of the vaccination certificate did not mention dates of both doses, but after foreign countries insisted on this, the new certificates with both dates came into existence, Deshprabhu told the HC. In another instance, Devidas Amonkar, who was issued a Covid certificate by the Corlim health centre, told TOI that he has not been issued a final vaccination certificate as his second dose has erroneously been registered as his first dose and hence shows his vaccination status as incomplete. He is thus left with two provisional certificates for Covid-19 vaccination on two different dates in April and August. “It’s an illogical thing and the mistake still isn’t being rectified. The health centre asked me to return and that they would try to correct it, but I have no time with my job as a provident fund inspector,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/man-gets-mistake-on-vax-cert-fixed-after-hc-petition/articleshow/85315809.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sena may use Marathi manoos card for polls||Mumbai: Shiv Sena may use the ‘Marathi manoos’ card, ahead of BMC polls. Party president and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray told Shiv Sainiks that ‘Marathi manoos’ were accused of being lazy or lagging behind in business, which may be true, but he would not leave the battle. This is what Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray had taught him. “Marathi manoos are always ready to fight against injustice and will not think of who is in front of them. I will not leave the battle, and will move ahead with the courage and teachings of Balasaheb,” said Uddhav. He was addressing sainiks on social media on the occasion of the 61st anniversary of the weekly cartoon magazine ‘Marmik’, started by the Thackeray brothers, Sena chief Balasaheb and Shrikant (father of Raj). This was the second anniversary of ‘Marmik’ celebrated online due to Covid-19. Thackeray said the movement behind formation of Shiv Sena had been built based on ‘Marmik’. “Initially, the sole purpose of ‘Marmik’ was to entertain people, but migrants started encroaching the space of ‘Marathi manoos’ and then ‘Marmik’ turned into a movement, which later formed Shiv Sena. ‘Marathi manoos’ will not be afraid of crises and taking responsibility,” said Thackeray. Thackeray, in a 20-minute speech, concentrated on the ‘Marathi manoos’ issue, indicating that the party was preparing for BMC polls scheduled in February 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-may-use-marathi-manoos-card-for-polls/articleshow/85311567.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Bagwal festival of Kumaon to be organised symbolically due to Covid||Pithoragarh: For the second year in a row, the traditional Bagwal (stone pelting) festival of Kumaon will be organised symbolically due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The decision was taken in a meeting between the Barahi Devi temple committee and the Champawat district administration. It was also decided in the meeting that an RT-PCR negative report, not later than 72 hours old, will be necessary to take part in the festival, even for fully vaccinated people. “A medical camp will be organised on August 19 and 20 at Balig, Devidhura and Pati villages for the festival. At the request of businessmen, we have permitted traders to open shops with Covid-19 protocols,” Vivek Tomar, district magistrate, Champawat, told TOI. The festival is celebrated every year at the Barahi Devi temple ground in the Devidhura village of Champawat district on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan. Traditionally, four different khams (groups of villagers) take part in the festival and throw stones at each other. It is believed that the goddess, Barahi Devi is pleased only after blood, equivalent to a human sacrifice, is shed during the sport. However, in 2013, the Uttarakhand high court had asked for stones to be replaced with fruits and flowers to minimise injury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bagwal-festival-of-kumaon-to-be-organised-symbolically-due-to-covid/articleshow/85309035.cms||Prem Punetha

A former journalist in the DMK organ ‘Murasoli’, Arunagirinathar went on to become the 292nd Adheenam in 1980. The monastery, said to have been established nearly 1,300 years ago, was revived by Saivite saint Thirugnanasambandar and is situated very near Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple. Though a religious leader, Arunagirinathar openly gave his views on politics and was a supporter of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. He was admitted to Apollo Speciality Hospitals on August 9 following lung-related ailments and put on ventilator, but he passed away on Friday evening. Occupants of the mutt sealed the room of the late pontiff on Thursday when his condition became serious. The successors to the Adheenam have always been controversial, with the late pontiff himself choosing two of them and later going back on his decision. In August 2012, the mutt ran into controversy when godman Nithyananda staked claim to be the 293rd pontiff of the mutt but was removed from this post in October. Extending his condolences, chief minister M K Stalin described the demise of the Adheenam as a great loss to spiritual people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-adheenam-chief-pontiff-dead/articleshow/85313826.cms||---

The original capacity of Vaigai dam which was commissioned in 1959 was 6,878 mcft but as the silt that deposited was not removed since then, its capacity was reduced by 900 mcft. Mullapperiyar-Vaigai project committee member K Thirupathi said the government’s budget announcement that Vaigai dam’s capacity would be restored is welcome. Steps should be taken to increase its water spread area by removing cultivations and encroachments if any on the northeastern side and also by breaking the rock surface on the west and northern sides, he said. The work should be carried out only after consulting the farming community, he said.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Hospitals pledge to continue organ donation drive||KOLKATA: The pandemic has slowed down the deceased organ donation movement, but hospitals and non-profit organisations on Friday, the World Organ Donation Day, pledged to carry on the work despite the changed circumstances. Bengal recorded only six donations in 2020, but this year, there have already been nine donations, five of which were in July. While SSKM Hospital has been the only government facility here from where patients’ families pledged organs of their brain-dead relatives, a good number of private hospitals have started declaring brain deaths to pave the way for organ donation. ROTTO joint director Arpita Ray Chaudhury pointed at the important roles of intensive care doctors, who could be game-changers by identifying brain death, that of transplant coordinators and the coordination between private and public healthcare. “Every year, around 50,000 patients suffer heart failure, many of them requiring urgent transplant. We, as doctors, can only do the surgery, but people should come forward to join hands in the cause,” said Narayana Superspeciality Hospital (NSH) Howrah cardiac surgeon Debasis Das. The ROTTO joint director was at the Howrah hospital on Friday. The hospital encouraged people to pledge their organs. Organizations, like Bengal Organ Donation Society and Manav Jyot, also travelled to the interiors of Champahati to create awareness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosps-pledge-to-continue-organ-donation-drive/articleshow/85311356.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Chennai||Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan bears the cross to lead Tamils to the promised land||CHENNAI: Four days after advocating a “once-ina-generation” leap of reforms to pull Tamil Nadu out of a fiscal abyss, finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Friday sought to take baby steps to lead the economy towards the promised land. “The revised Budget for 2021-22 will only impact the remaining six months of this financial year. The sheer magnitude of the second wave of Covid over the past few months and its health and economic consequences have further constrained the government’s flexibility in what was already a precarious fiscal position,” PTR said. Populism was limited to two decisions — lowering of petrol prices by Rs 3 a litre (against the promised Rs 5), which will cost the government Rs 1,160 crore, and waiving of Rs 2,756 crore loans to self-help groups taken from co-operative credit societies. He put on hold the crop loan and jewel loan waivers of the AIADMK government citing irregularities. This could result in a saving of Rs 10,000 crore. “The lack of adequate beneficiary data is the fundamental limitation in our government’s ability to efficiently implement welfare schemes in order to improve social and economic justice,” the finance minister said, while stressing on data-centric governance to reach benefits to targeted sections. For industry, there is a tax amnesty scheme, plans for land banks in backward districts, and a dedicated FinTech park in Chennai, originally proposed by M K Stalin when he was the deputy CM. Besides, there will be three more TIDEL parks and a few more Sipcot estates and food parks. Thiaga Rajan did not impose any new levies citing the pandemic. “Given that the economy is just recovering from the impact of successive waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, the time is not yet ripe for fiscal consolidation,” he said, while letting the “revenue deficit” climb to Rs 58,692 crore from the “unrealistic” interim budget estimates of Rs 41,417 crore. While blaming the increased revenue deficit on “exceptional times”, he emphasized the government’s commitment to fiscal rectitude and consolidation in the coming years, as indicated in the white paper. The urban poor will get an employment guarantee scheme, though the details have not been spelled out. The Budget promises drinking water to 1.2 crore households and to make the state becomes accident free in 10 years. The overall revenue expenditure is expected to be a little over Rs 2.61 lakh crore in the revised Budget estimates, while the total revenue receipt estimates have seen a downward revision to Rs 2.02 lakh crore in the revised budget estimates as against Rs 2.19 lakh crore in the interim Budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ptr-bears-the-cross-to-lead-tamils-to-the-promised-land/articleshow/85313830.cms||D Govardan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Deshbhakti colours to be up by R-Day with 500 high-mast flags||NEW DELHI: By the time the national capital celebrates the next Republic Day, all the 500 high-mast national flags, announced by Delhi government as part of its Deshbhakti budget, will be installed at different locations. Five of these flags have already been installed or are nearing completion. Delhi government had presented its budget on March 12, which had declared 500 tricolours will be installed across Delhi to celebrate 75 years of India’s independence in 2022. While most of the flag masts would be 35 metres in height, Delhi government has decided to install a sizable number of 50-metre-high masts as well and has floated fresh tenders for it. To ensure the high-mast flags are structurally strong to withstand weather elements, the government has laid down a long list of safety parameters for the material to be used to build the masts. The masts will have to be made of high-tensile steel sheets and the structure would be continuously tapered, with a polygonal cross-section of 20 sides. This will ensure its structural strength and will also look aesthetically pleasing.  The pole structure must also be suitable to sustain an assumed maximum reaction arising from strong gusts of wind and high wind speed. The structural design will also go through through wind tunnel tests. While the diameter of the top of the mast will be 200 mm, the base would have a diameter of 610 mm in case of 35-metre-high masts and 950 mm in case of 50-metre-high ones. The stainless-steel wire flag ropes would be 6 mm in diameter for 35-metre-high poles and 8 mm in case of the longer ones. LED floodlights fitted at the top of the poles will provide focus lighting for the flags, along with aviation obstruction lights for safety purposes. The contractors would be given a time of 150 days to complete the project for Rs. 85.6 crore. The design life of the masts shall be minimum of 25 years. While the project was announced earlier this year, the work got affected due to the exponential growth of Covid-19 cases during the second wave. However, five flags at East Kidwai Nagar, East Vinod Nagar, Rani Bagh, Kalkaji and Dwarka have been completed or nearing completion, just in time for the Independence Day celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/deshbhakti-colours-to-be-up-by-r-day-with-500-high-mast-flags/articleshow/85313807.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Ahmedabad||Pharma cos’ US revenues still sliding||Ahmedabad: The top Gujarat-based pharmaceutical companies have registered a strong growth in domestic sales, but their revenues from the US market have continued to decline, mainly due to the price erosion of existing products. Companies such as Cadila Healthcare, Alembic Pharmaceuticals, and Torrent Pharmaceuticals have reported lower sales from the US market in the first quarter ended June 30, 2021. These pharma majors had reported muted sales in the preceding January-March quarter as well. Vadodara-headquartered Alembic Pharma’s US revenues fell by 38% to Rs 369 crore in the first quarter of 2021-22 from Rs 596 crore in the same period last fiscal. Torrent Pharma’s revenues from the US dipped by 29% to Rs 266 crore in Q1 FY22 from Rs 373 crore in Q1 FY21. Cadila Healthcare, popularly known as Zydus Cadila, saw its US sales drop 11% to Rs 1,451 crore in the April-June quarter from Rs 1,623 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. “Generally, the prices were soft across product categories. The softness in prices was due to the stiff competition following least disruption in supply, which is a part of the US generics story,” said R S Baheti, director finance and CFO, Alembic Pharma. As for Torrent Pharma, its spokesperson stated that the decline in the US sales was mainly due to the lack of new product approvals pending USFDA (US Food and Drug Administration) re-inspection of manufacturing facilities. Additionally, the base business was impacted on account of high single-digit price erosion and the discontinuation of the Sartan portfolio, the spokesperson said. “We continue to file double digit ANDA (abbreviated new drug application), which will help in having double digit launches once we see the USFDA clear our facilities,” the spokesperson added. According to industry players, the competition in the US intensified with more and more generic products being approved. The new players are pricing their products aggressively, which is exerting pressure on existing players to reduce prices. Apart from this, the reduction in drug prescriptions in the US market also contributed to the dip in revenues. However, the pharma companies’ revenue loss from the US was offset by the strong growth in sales from the domestic market, said industry players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pharma-cos-us-revenues-still-sliding/articleshow/85313873.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Dehradun||It’s time the interest in hockey is built upon : Former India coach Mir Ranjan Negi||Dehradun: Former Indian goalkeeper and national women’s team coach Mir Ranjan Negi, whose life inspired the 2007 Bollywood sports drama ‘Chak De! India', said that the stellar performances by the men’s and women’s hockey teams at the recent Tokyo Olympics have led to a surge in the game’s popularity, but the hockey federation needs to sustain the current interest and “convert it into more participation at the grass-root level.” “No doubt, the game's popularity has increased exponentially but it needs to be built upon. There have been similar incidents of popularity surge in the past, which were not capitalised. In 1998, the team won gold at Asian Games, and there was a similar interest but the interest needs to be sustained by the hockey federation,” he said. The 63-year-old added that despite India not winning an Olympic medal in hockey for the past 41 years, the sporting public never lost its love for the game. “The onus is on the national federation now.They need to put aside their egos and the coaches should not be sacked at will like it has happened in the past decade,” he told TOI. Negi was blamed by many for India’s humiliating defeat to Pakistan in the 1982 Asian Games, where he was goalkeeper, and had to quit the game. After years, he made a spectacular comeback by coaching the Indian women’s hockey team to victory in the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Commenting on the recent incident of casteist slurs being hurled at hockey player Vandana Katariya’s house in Haridwar following the team’s semi-final defeat in the Olympics, Negi, who hails from the Almora region of Uttarakhand, said, “I don’t know how people stoop so low even in today’s times. They should at least respect an Olympian who is representing the country. I don’t believe in all these things of caste or creed. During our playing days, all of us used to share the same water bottle -- whether it was me or Rajinder Singh or Mohammed Shahid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/its-time-the-interest-in-hockey-is-built-upon-former-india-coach-mir-ranjan-negi/articleshow/85309070.cms||Mohammad Anab

There has also been an alarming rise in the number of young adults suffering from Type II diabetes, according to Diabetes Awareness and You (DAY).  “The number has seen a sharp rise during the pandemic due to lack of screening and treatment. Both Type and II (adult diabetes) numbers have proliferated since people have been staying at home and have rarely consulted doctors. Children and young adults have been the worst sufferers,” endocrinologist Debashish Basu. “On this 75th Independence Day, 75 children suffering from Type I diabetes will come together on a virtual platform to spread the word about juvenile diabetes,” said Indrajit Majumder of DAY.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lack-of-test-treatment-leads-to-spurt-in-diabetes-among-kids-youngsters/articleshow/85311421.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Nagpur||Many parents still sceptical about sending kids to school||Nagpur: Though the state government has given a green signal for reopening of schools in city from August 17, there is reportedly opposition to it from the Covid task force. Even if the decision is not scrapped, the final decision will be of local authorities who have to permit reopening based on various factors and there is no deadline to do so either. Both Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) commissioner Radhakrishnan B and collector R Vimala confirmed to TOI that no decision on reopening has been taken yet. While city schools are closed completely, in rural areas Std VIII-XII are open. The new government resolution permits reopening of Std V-VII as well in rural areas. Parents in the meantime had mixed reactions on whether or not to send kids to school if the institutions reopen. Wasima Khan said, “If given a choice, I would not send my kid to school because of the third wave looming over us. However hard we try to educate our kids about the protocols, they won’t be able to follow all the guidelines, thus increasing the risk of contracting Covid-19. Hence, I am not in favour of offline classes as a concerned parent.” Sarika Shah felt it is now relatively safe to reopen schools. “Being a parent, I’m happy that we are finally heading towards the unlock process which is beneficial for students. I will not be worried and will send my child to school willingly. Not only teachers but students should also follow all Covid norms properly. At the end, we need to be fearless and face the situation and need to grow with it,” said Shah. Manish Jain said, “I feel it is a risky step at the moment to reopen schools as students are not yet vaccinated. It would be better if the students study from home for now.” Vaishali Gandhi said, “Even though schools do educate students through online means, practically there is no replacement to the environment a classroom provides. There is a fear that safety guidelines might be flouted and it would be better if the schools allow students and staff only after they have been administered at least one dose of vaccine.” Santosh Mohanan said, “As parents, we are not willing to send kids to school during such a situation, as only adults are vaccinated. Kids are not that mature to understand the importance of these norms and it can cause the outbreak of a third wave. Hence, we need to be patient in this situation and wait for the right time.” Tanveer Rezvi said, “Taking into consideration the possibility of a third wave which could affect children, I am a little concerned about sending my ward to school. Even though the school will take care of Covid protocols, the children are not mature enough to understand the gravity, thus it may result in careless behaviour on part of the child.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-parents-still-sceptical-about-sending-kids-to-school/articleshow/85313885.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Expressing confidence that the metro rail would bring growth to the entire region with better connectivity, the trade bodies said that the state government should work on making it a reality instead of retaining the proposal on paper. Tamilnadu foodgrains merchants’ association limited said that the state government should not stop with the viability study on the project. “We insist that the study report may be taken into consideration in the upcoming financial budget to fulfil the project,” president S P Jeyapragasam said. President of the Tamilnadu chamber of commerce and industry N Jegatheesan said that the state government should identify the agency to conduct the feasibility study. “The detailed feasibility report should be completed before the next budget in February. The government should allocate a budget for bringing the project to instil hope that it will be fulfilled,” he said. The chamber pointed out that the state government has to bear 50% of the project cost. “We believe that infrastructure like metro rail will bring development for the region and not vice versa,” Jegatheesan said. Trade bodies said that the feasibility study on the viable routes should consider the views of the stake holders, including trade and industry bodies. They said that the project should be futuristic wherein suburbs like Thirumangalam and Melur could be part of the city in the next few years.

In such a scenario, the admission committee has once again proposed to extend the admission period by one week, said sources close to the development. “The registration will be announced for another week if approved by the education department,” said sources. Early registration for diploma courses was started after apprehensions were raised that there would be a huge rush this year due to mass promotion for Class 10 students this year. “Even after the admission committee has twice extended the deadline for registration, only about 36,000 students have registered,” said sources. According to the present criteria, the students who have cleared Class 10 after getting grace marks are eligible to participate in the admission process only after a few rounds of admissions are completed and seats are empty. The number of students who passed with grace marks is very high and hence colleges have requested the government to include such students from the first round. The proposal is under consideration, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-registration-date-likely-for-diploma-engineering/articleshow/85313934.cms||---
---||Mumbai||MahaRERA to set up spl cell to speed up recovery orders & clear backlog||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority has said mere conditional permission for conversion of an agricultural plot to a non-agricultural one outside urban areas without offering any infrastructure can be termed only as an ongoing project and hence is required to be registered under RERA. Permission to convert a plot from agriculture to non-agriculture use is only the beginning of the process and is completed when the tehsildar records that all conditions imposed stand fulfilled and that constitutes a “completion certificate”, clarified MahaRERA. Dealing with “plotted development” outside urban areas, MahaRERA on August 10 directed a developer to immediately register one such project on finding that conditions imposed in an almost decade old nod for non agriculture (NA) use by Raigad collector remained unfulfilled. “The very nomenclature of the completion certificate means that the premises are now complete and fit for human habitation’’ said MahaRERA chairperson Ajoy Mehta. It means the land must pass a ‘legal and usable’ test, he said. The NA use will commence when the tehsildar records all conditions are fulfilled, that’s when status of land changes from agriculture to non-agriculture.  Mehta also directed the promoter-developer not to advertise, sell or permit bookings of any NA plots in a project called Amarai in Kolad for sale of NA plots till it is registered under Section 3 of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA). He also imposed a penalty of Rs 50,000 to be paid to MahaRERA for flouting the provision of the Act in failing to register an ongoing project. “Facilities that were promised and those enumerated in the NA order have not been given, thus the property remains devoid of facilities to enable a reasonable human to enjoy it…hence the project does not have a CC till date,’’ said the order. Aamrai Kolad Plot Owners Welfare Association had last year filed a complaint before the MahaRERA and Sai Developers and others. According to their lawyer Zaman Ali, in May 2012, the Raigad district collector had in its conditional NA permission directed the developer to construct infrastructural facilities including roads, storm water drains, sewage lines, water supply and develop open spaces, within two years. Soon after the permission, the developer advertised the project, promising infrastructural amenities and possession period of one year on payment of development charges of Rs 50,000 per plot. The complaint is that despite the payment, the project ‘remained incomplete’’. After RERA came into effect on May 1, 2017, in October 2017, the developer issued fresh ads for remaining unsold plots offering amenities including a swimming pool. But with infrastructural facilities and amenities not provided, the project would fall under ambit of RERA as an on-going project, requiring registration, said the association. The developer through its lawyer Tanmay Ketkar argued the project was complete in 2014, having complied with all NA conditions, and all plots are sold, hence it is not an on-going project and the complaint is an “mala fide’’ harassment. Some of the members have even constructed bungalows and are residing in them. Mehta said in case of a plotted development, it was “mandatory’’ for the developer to inform the tehsildar of its NA use and that all amenities as agreed have been completed too. He noted that the developer failed to show that Tahsildar was informed of commencement of NA use of the project. Individual permission of plot holders specifically mentions that an NA order condition was unfulfilled, hence it is an on-going project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharera-to-set-up-spl-cell-to-speed-up-recovery-orders-clear-backlog/articleshow/85313963.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CBI plea for seized items in phone-tap case opposed||Mumbai: The state, through the Mumbai cyber cell, has opposed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) plea before the special court seeking certain documents and digital evidence related to the phone taps allegedly made by former commissioner of state intelligence Rashmi Shukla. The prosecution submitted that the evidence is what they have collected during their investigations and it cannot be shared with another investigating agency.Earlier, a magistrate’s court had rejected the CBI’s plea. The Mumbai cyber cell, Bandra-Kurla Complex, had registered an FIR on March 26 against unknown persons over “leaking” of Shukla’s confidential report dated August 20, 2020, on the alleged politician-police nexus on transfers and ‘powerful’ postings. The FIR was lodged under the Information Technology Act, the Indian Telegraph Act and the Official Secrets Act. The CBI too registered an FIR in April against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh under the Prevention of Corruption Act and sought the documents in connection with its investigation. Before the magistrate’s court, the CBI invoked Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code that empowers a magistrate to issue summons or order to the officer concerned to produce a document or other record in his possession which is necessary for an investigation, inquiry or trial.At that time, the state had opposed the CBI plea to seek the documents. Among the grounds, the state had submitted that the digital records were sent to a forensic laboratory for analysis, and that the CBI was going beyond what Bombay high court permitted it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-plea-for-seized-items-in-phone-tap-case-opposed/articleshow/85314070.cms||---

The deceased has been identified as 19-year-old Mahendra Negi, whose birthday was being celebrated, and his friend Sumit, 15. Their bodies were recovered by a team of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) late on Thursday night. Both of them had gone for a swim in the Kosi river during the celebrations and were swept away by the strong current of the river. Their friends raised an alarm and informed local police.

---||Goa||Navy abandons flag-hoisting at St Jacinto after outlandish claim||Panaji: The Indian Navy on Friday abandoned its plan to hoist the tricolour on Sao Jacinto island after a local politician claimed that it was trying to “capture the island” and drive away the locals. After state NCP president Jose Philip D’Souza made the bizarre claim, the Navy, to avoid any confrontation, cancelled the event, which was intended as part of ‘Azadi ka amrit mahotsav’ to mark 75 years of independence. The Union defence ministry had asked the forces to unfurl the flag at various places, including islands. “A team from the Goa Naval Area visited Sao Jacinto island as part of this pan-India initiative,” the Indian Navy said in a statement on Friday. “This initiative was taken nationwide to instil a sense of patriotism and celebrate the run up to the 75th year of independence.” After the naval officials visited the island, locals, led by D’Souza, questioned the need for them to organise a flag-hoisting ceremony. The Navy has restricted locals from visiting certain islands around Goa that are of strategic importance, and D’Souza used this to feed into the fears of the locals. “This is a plan to try and test our reaction before they capture this island,” said D’Souza after mobilising some of the locals. “Take for example our religious traditions on Bat island, which the Navy has stopped us, fishermen, from visiting and continuing our traditions. We will not allow the Centre or the Navy to capture this island,” D’Souza said. The Navy will be hoisting the national flag on 75 islands in the runup to August 15. On Friday, it was hoisted on various islands including Campbell bay in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Kavaratti in Lakshadweep and Minocoy islands, and the Anjadiv island off Karwar. The flag-hoisting was virtually attended by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh. Residents of Sao Jacinto questioned if naval authorities had obtained formal permission from local authorities to conduct the flag-hoisting ceremony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navy-abandons-flag-hoisting-at-st-jacinto-after-outlandish-claim/articleshow/85315923.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi lags in data sharing on pollution, finds study||1NEW DELHI: An analysis carried out by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) for 29 state pollution control boards (SPCBs) and six pollution control committees (PCCs) ranks Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) 15th across the country in terms of transparency in regards to environment and pollution-related data. Track the pollution level in your cityThe capital, according to the analysis, received a score of only 49.5%, faring poorly on sharing annual data on its website, for not having any data on electronic-waste (e-waste) and lack of data on plastic waste, which is mandatory as per the plastic waste management rules 2018. The report also looked at the role of annual reports in sharing information in the public domain. CSE analysed data shared by SPCBs and PCCs during 2016-21 and used several indicators to provide a broader indication on the type and amount of information shared. DPCC’s website was also found to not have any information on a public information officer for RTI purposes, while it has not uploaded an annual report giving a full account of its activities since 2010 despite it being mandatory under Section 39 of Water Act. The committee, however, fared well on giving detailed information on public hearings, sharing EIA reports and executive summaries, and minutes of meetings, and for having the Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) data on its website. DPCC also has the complete data on biomedical waste being generated in Delhi, how much is being treated and the waste treatment facilities. In terms of having information on laboratories and their accreditation, DPPC had information on their numbers and what parameters could be analysed in the labs, along with contact details. However, it did not have information on accreditation, the report said. Odisha and Telangana state pollution control boards jointly received the highest score of 67%, followed by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board at 65.5%. Delhi’s overall score of 49.5% placed it behind Rajasthan Pollution Control Board’s 50%. Lakshadweep Pollution Control Committee scored the lowest for not sharing any information. A Delhi government official said the DPCC website was regularly being updated, with public notices and new updates being posted on the home page itself. “More data will be added,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-lags-in-data-sharing-on-pollution-finds-study/articleshow/85314020.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The board, which released the provisional answer key on Friday, took this decision after finding errors in it. A total of 1.17 lakh had registered for the state-level exam that was conducted on August 6 for Class 12 science students. The exams were conducted over a duration of four hours in four main subjects after reducing the syllabus by 30%. The questions were in MCQ format and students took the test using OMR answer sheets. The two errors were found in the combined test paper for physics and chemistry subjects and all candidates who participated in the exam will be allotted two marks, GSHSEB said, while releasing the answer key. While one of the errors was for physics, the other one was related to a question in the chemistry section, it said in a note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/errors-in-question-paper-examinees-to-get-two-marks/articleshow/85314002.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Free homes for families of 1,800 retired cops in Mumbai: Min||Mumbai: Around 1,800 families of police personnel living in BDD Chawls post-retirement will get free housing under the redevelopment project, said state housing minister Jitendra Awhad. The state government has undertaken the redevelopment of BDD chawls at Worli, N M Joshi Marg and Naigaum in Dadar. The redevelopment project in central Mumbai is slated to be done over next eight years. The government has promised 500-sq-ft free flats for the chawl tenants who currently live in 160-sq-ft homes. “These families will be given flats meant for project-affected-persons (PAP) that are part of Mhada’s share of surplus flats,” he said. Awhad said that when some women from these police families had petitioned the government, they said that their men were working in the force for generations. “One woman said her grand father-in-law, father-in-law and now her husband were in the police force and the family has been living here since then. It was then we decided they must be provided free housing,” he said. Accommodation of these families will not impact the city police chief’s quota. CM Uddhav Thackeray performed bhoomipujan for the project on August 1, relaunching the project that was stalled for nearly four years. The MVAgovernment has claimed it will provide flats for phase I in three years. This week the state housing department issued a government resolution, extending deadline for eligibility for free housing to January 1, 2021. “This means anyone who has been paying rent as on January 1, 2021 will be eligible for free housing. The eligibility will be decided by the PWD, the rent collector, and permanent agreement with tenants will be signed by Mhada, the nodal agency for the project,” Awhad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/free-homes-for-families-of-1800-retired-cops-in-mumbai-min/articleshow/85314213.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops break door to arrest BJP leader Sajal Ghosh||KOLKATA: A large police force from the central division broke open the door of BJP leader Sajal Ghosh’s house at Santosh Mitra Square on Friday and took him into custody. Ghosh had locked himself up in the house, refusing to surrender though cases of threat, attack, theft and criminal intimidation were filed against him. The arrest and the drama around it signalled a power shift from the past, when Sajal and his father, Pradip Ghosh, influential leaders of central Kolkata and organizers of the Santosh Mitra Square Durga Puja, used to call the shots in the area. Ghosh’s arrest was followed by a clash between Trinamool and BJP workers outside the Muchipara police station. Trouble started with the alleged molestation of a resident on Thursday. The chain of events that followed built up to a case being filed against Sajal and a police team converging on his home on Friday, asking him to surrender. But Sajal refused to respond and the cops started kicking on the door, breaking it and arresting him. Sajal, who was with the Trinamool before joining the BJP, said he felt sorry he was once a part of Trinamool. He called the arrest “illegal” and the charges “fictitious”. Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said around 10pm on Thursday, Muchipara police station received information about a dispute on Raja Ram Mohan Sarani. A woman lodged a complaint of physical harassment by two men, Vishal Singh and Vikash Singh, while she went to buy medicines. It reportedly turned into a political dispute with local Trinamool men complaining that the accused, members of a BJP-controlled club, had harassed the woman and the BJP men alleging Trinamool laid siege to the club. The accused were arrested on the charges of molestation, threat, outraging the modesty of a woman and criminal intimidation. “Around 11.15 am on Friday, this police station got information that some people, including Sajal Ghosh and Kishen Singh, armed with weapons, committed theft and assaulted the employee of one Rajesh Singh of Scott Lane. A case was started under IPC sections 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons) 341 (threat) 380 (theft) 506 (criminal intimidation) and 25(1)(a) Arms Act. Ghosh was then arrested,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-break-door-to-arrest-bjp-leader-sajal-ghosh/articleshow/85314050.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||After 5 days of reopening, coaching classes shut down again||Nagpur: Association of Coaching Institutes (ACI) has expressed disappointment over being asked to shut down, just five days after getting permission to reopen. On Friday evening Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) issued a revised order in which coaching classes were categorized as ‘closed’. Officials in the civic body told TOI, “In the new order by the government it (coaching classes) is not mentioned. Let’s hope they (state) will relax further in the coming weeks”. Rajnikant Bondre, a coaching institute owner said, “Education fraternity is totally fed up with the government approach towards our sector. They have spoiled the entire academic session even though it could have been managed in a better way. Government should resign on moral grounds.” He said this move actually makes students more vulnerable to getting infected in public places. Bondre said, “These students, who could have been sitting for hours inside the safe environment of our coaching institutes, will now be roaming around in public places or visiting friends. Their parents are anyway back to office and these kids are unsupervised because even schools and junior colleges are closed.” Though permission had been granted to reopen from August 9, not all coaching classes had started physical operations. Most were planning to start full fledged operations after the long weekend. A coaching institute owner said, “There are a few holidays lined up next week, so thought it’s best to start a little later. Now it seems we did the smart thing because our Maharashtra government just does not want education to reopen. Restaurants, bars, wine shops, paan shops are all functioning but a safe and secure place like coaching institute will definitely spread the virus according to our policy makers.” Bondre, who is also president of Association of Coaching Institutes (ACI), said with competitive exam NEET coming up soon, physical coaching is need of the hour. “Strangely, students are free to visit restaurants, resorts and many public places. They are even attending schools in rural area but for some reason, they can’t attend coaching classes. There is absolutely no logic in any decision now,” said Bondre. Another coaching institute owner said, “Students’ mental health has been affected by staying indoors. Tuitions go beyond the regular classes at college and it is the value addition which they provide that can’t be replicated in online platforms. If schools or colleges were so effective then the entire tuition or coaching industry would have collapsed long time ago. By shutting down physical mode of learning in coaching institutes, local authorities and state government has proved that it does not care for students.” For ACI, the other issue in collector’s order is being clubbed together with schools. Bondre said, “We are a commercial venture, unlike schools that are a not-for-profit venture. How can we be put in the same category? We pay 18% GST and other professional taxes like every other business which has now been allowed to reopen but we are being kept closed,” said Bondre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-5-days-of-reopening-coaching-classes-shut-down-again/articleshow/85314040.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The swing carved out from 21kg pure silver was donated by devotees to Ram temple Trust, which received huge quantities of silver, gold and ornaments during the crowdfunding drive. Temple Trust secretary Champat Rai said, deities will remain on the silver swing till ‘purnima’ (full moon night) of August 22, when the festival of Raksha Bandhan is celebrated. Every year, ‘sawan jhula’ festival begins in Ayodhya from ‘sawan shukla tritya’ and deities are placed on swing also called ‘hindola’ or ‘jhula’, and carried to Mani Parvat temple, where according to belief, Lord Ram’s wife Sita would visit the holy mound during monsoon and use the swing. After over 500 years, Ram Lalla’s darbar is reliving its splendour after being placed under a tent for almost 30 years, said chief priest of the temple, Mahant Satyendra Das. Earlier this week, the Trust threw open the viewing gallery for devotees to get a glimpse of the ongoing construction activity. Trust member Anil Mishra said the temple construction work is being expedited and they have already filled 29 of 45 layers of compacted concrete in the foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/monsoon-fest-in-ayodhya-ram-lalla-placed-on-21-kg-silver-swing-first-time/articleshow/85315880.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

According to local residents, two children died of infection between Sunday and Monday before they could be taken to hospital. As many as 46 people, including 23 children, suffering from acute diarrhoea due to intake of dirty drinking water, have been admitted to Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Civil hospital since Sunday. TimesViewA dedicated helpline to resolve contaminated water supply complaints is a welcome step, but authorities will have to ensure that redressal is prompt. The common refrain of the people, including those of Baalu Adda, has been that their complaints of dirty water supply in the past have gone unheeded. A provision of third party verification in the helpline would make it more effective.Now, a team of doctors, including deputy chief medical officer and medical officers, has been stationed in the area for 24-hour monitoring. They have already given first aid to around 200 patients suffering from some form of gastroenteritis and other symptoms. “Around 190 people suffering from diarrhoea have been examined by doctors at the camp in Baalu Adda. Around 50 people with seasonal flulike symptoms have also received medical care at the camp,” said CMO Dr Manoj Agarwal. At the Civil hospital, four new patients, all of them adults, were admitted on Friday. Simultaneously, eight patients were discharged. “Seven children are still recuperating at the hospital, while others have been discharged,” said chief medical superintendent, Civil hospital, Dr SK Nanda. Fourteen adult patients are still getting treatment at the hospital. Stool samples for bacterial assessment of seven patients from the area, were sent to KGMU by the CMO office, of which four samples on Friday tested positive for cholera. The causative agent for this water borne disease, Vibrio Cholerae, was detected in four patients. Meanwhile, LMC carried out a cleanliness drive for the third consecutive day on Friday. Helpline on complaints of dirty drinking water:Jal Sansthan on Friday issued a helpline 6390260100 where people can lodge complaints related to dirty water supply in the city. Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia on Friday called a meeting with senior officials of Lucknow Municipal Corporation and Jal Sansthan regarding water supply and garbage collection in the city. According to LMC officials, Bhatia directed Jal Sansthan general manager to issue a helpline number and resolve complaints within 24 hours. She also asked Jal Sansthan to launch a drive to check drinking water in all localities of the city. The mayor further directed the civic officials to complete the remaining probe into the Baalu Adda case and submit the report at the earliest so that further action can be taken by negligent employees or agencies. Mayor directed LMC to make arrangements for timely collection of garbage from open dumping points and spray disinfectants at disease prone areas on a regular basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/four-more-baalu-adda-residents-hospitalised/articleshow/85315919.cms||---

Overall in 24 out of 52 districts namely Agar Malwa, Alirajpur, Anuppur, Ashoknagar, Bhind, Burhanpur, Chhindwara, Datia, Dewas, Guna, Harda, Jhabua, Khandwa, Morena, Narsinghpur, Neemuch, Rewa, Sehore, Shahdol, Shajapur, Sheopur, Sidhi, Singrauli and Umaria no new case has been reported in past 15 days between July 30 and August 13. And in 13 of the remaining 27 districts (27 as Tikamgarh and Niwari are counted together) namely Raisen, Betul, Shivpuri, Balaghat, Satna, Katni, Seoni, Dindori, Mandsaur, Khargone, Vidisha, Ratlam and Mandla only 1 new Covid-19 positive case has been reported in the past 15 days. Sources say that overall now at least 50% of the state is technically Covid-19 free as there are no active cases in more than 24 districts of the state. It is also important to note that other districts are also joining the league, as there are several districts who are though in the list where at least 1 new case was reported in past 15 days but even that case was reported more than 10 days ago, like in Raisen the last Covid-19 case was reported on July 31, likewise in Betul the last case was reported on August 1, in Shivpuri the last case was reported on August 2, and in districts like Satna and Balaghat last case was reported on August 3. Overall total of 203 new Covid-19 cases have been reported in the state in past 15 days between July 30 and August 13 and of these maximum 39 cases have been reported from Indore, followed by 35 new cases in Sagar and then 28 new cases in Bhopal, 26 new cases from Damoh and 24 new cases from Jabalpur, thus 75% of the total cases, which is 152 new covid-19 cases were reported from these 5 districts of the state. Sources said that this is definitely a positive sign, but caution is needed, at least till all the eligible population gets both the doses of the vaccine, however there have been several cities like Shahdol, Dewas and now Indore where each and every individual has at least received one dose of vaccine, but till both the doses are administered to each and every individual, Covid-19 appropriate behaviour which includes wearing mask, maintaining social distance and hand hygiene should be ensured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/half-of-mp-covid-free-with-no-active-case-in-15-days/articleshow/85314064.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: More deaths by suicide on tracks reported on CR & fringes of city||MUMBAI: Suicides on Mumbai railways in the first seven months of this year have exceeded those in pre-pandemic times of January-July 2019 by 57%. Thirty three individuals died by suicide on railways this year as against 21 deaths in January-July 2019. Nine deaths were reported during the same period in the lockdown year of 2020 when services were very few and entry to station areas was restricted. Mental health experts said the high number of suicides was the impact that the pandemic has had on people's mental and emotional state. One of the reasons for a high number of suicides occurring on railways is because they are likely to get clubbed as accidents in police reports and this translates into less shame for family members. In July, a homemaker from Ulhasnagar, Hemangi Repe, jumped to her death before a running train at Asangaon along with her two-year-old daughter, Sanskruti. A police investigation later established that Hemangi was being harassed by her husband and in-laws who also doubted her fidelity. "Instances of domestic violence increased during the pandemic," said psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty. "The focus has largely been on Covid-19 and resultant fatalities while the focus on mental health has been much lesser. The suicide figures are an indicator of a silent mental health epidemic," he added. Data also suggests that more suicides were reported on Central Railway, than on Western, and in the fringes of the city. A majority of the deceased (78%) were men. In April, an engineer who had recovered from Covid-19 developed respiratory trouble thereafter which pushed him to end his life. CCTVs at Dombivali station captured him sitting on the platform for a few minutes before leaping in front of Konark Express. "In the absence of clear CCTV footage or a strong statement from the motorman or eyewitness, it becomes difficult to establish if a death on the railways is suicide or not," said a police officer. At times, the police or the motorman might report a suicide as an accident so that the deceased's family can seek insurance, particularly when they are not doing well financially. "The pandemic has led to severe financial ruin, loss of jobs, unemployment, and lack of opportunities which has triggered feelings of anxiety and depression, helplessness, hopelessness as well as worthlessness. The government needs to involve mental health experts and create a nationwide media campaign to alleviate public distress and offer increased mental health support as part of the National Health Mission. They could involve NGOs and other mental health experts in helping identify people who are at risk by using standardised tools to measure "life stress." This will definitely help in managing the unnecessary loss of life," said psychologist Narendra Kinger. Overall, 926 fatalities were reported on the railways this year which is about 38% higher than those reported in January-July 2020. In the same period in 2019, 1554 deaths were reported. Illegal track crossing was the biggest killer in all three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-more-deaths-by-suicide-on-tracks-reported-on-cr-fringes-of-city/articleshow/85314133.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Bhopal||Collector asks hosps to update issues on oxygen||Bhopal: District collector Avinash Lavania asked the directors, deans and superintendents of government and private medical colleges and hospitals of Bhopal to apprise the district administration on any problem they may be facing in installing an oxygen plant in their premises. At a meeting held to take stock of the preparedness to face the potential third wave in the district collector office, it was informed that 9,500 beds are in readiness for any such eventuality, 2500 of them ICU beds.oxygen plants in several hospitals have also become operational. In all, 15 oxygen plants are being commissioned in different hospitals of the district, which have a capacity from 16 to 20 tonnes. Besides, storage capacity of 180 metric tonne oxygen has been achieved and 100 metric tonne of oxygen can be obtained from Inox. It was informed at the meeting that special emphasis is being paid to create facilities for treatment of children, 200 ICU beds are ready and the number of ICU beds is being further enhanced. Lavania said that special arrangements should be made for treatment of children in the age group of 0 to 10 years. Either of the parents will have to be allowed to stay with the child to take care of him, therefore special care would be required to be taken to ensure that treatment of children is not hampered in any manner, he said. He further asked the hospitals to impart special training to the nursing staff and entrusted the task to Chirayu hospital's proprietor Dr Ajay Goenka at the request of representatives from other hospitals. The training should include training in centralised oxygen supply, he said. Lavania said all the hospitals should arrange for training of all their staff as indoor treatment of children would require special acumen. Additional collector Sandeep Kerketta told the meeting that during the second wave of Coronavirus, the maximum demand of oxygen had been 98 to 100 metric tonne, as against this 300 metric tonne oxygen would be available daily in the event of a third wave of Coronavirus. All the major hospitals have oxygen plants of their own and the plants, which have not been commissioned as yet, would be ready in the next 15 days.All the plants would start generation and supply of oxygen by then. All the hospitals have also been asked to keep big cylinders ready for storage of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/collector-asks-hosps-to-update-issues-on-oxygen/articleshow/85314106.cms||---
---||Delhi||North Delhi corporation sold plot of land worth Rs 150 crore for Rs 34 crore: AAP||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MLA and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Friday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation has sold a plot of land worth Rs 150 crore for Rs 34 crore. “The complex was built on 1,100 sqm corporation land and its lease had run out. The land is commercial with a parking lot and a wide road next to it, a rarity in Old Delhi,” Bharadwaj said in a press conference, adding that a shop built on even 100 yards would cost Rs 30-35 crore in this location. He said the market value of the plot should have been between Rs 125-150 crore. Bharadwaj alleged that this sale was one of the biggest examples of how the BJP-led corporations continue to loot Delhiites in broad daylight. “It is estimated that had the MCD retained the land and built a shopping complex on it, it could have raked in about Rs 300 crore. BJP is aware that they will be thrown out of the corporation this time, so all they care about now is to fill their own pockets,” he claimed. The AAP MLA said that two bids were received for the land and there was a difference of only Rs 1 lakh between the bids. He said the winning bid was Rs. 34.75 crore and the losing one of Rs. 34.74 crore. “This cannot be a mere coincidence, either someone bestowed a sermon upon them or this was orchestrated,” he said. Former mayor and councillor from Sadar Bazar, Jai Prakash, said that the civic body attempted to lease out the property two or three times in the past but didn’t get any satisfying response. “As far as AAP’s argument goes that the civic body should have developed a shopping complex and then leased out the property, where is the money to do the construction work? We are already under financial crisis and can’t pay salaries properly. AAP has a habit of objecting to all the revenue projects of the north corporation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-north-corpn-sold-plot-of-land-worth-rs-150cr-for-rs-34cr/articleshow/85314123.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Youth dies after 2km run for life in Nishatpura||BHOPAL: A run of terror to save his life killed a 21-year-old youth in a Bhopal locality in the wee hours of Thursday. Police say Raja Rine was partying with a group friends when they got into a quarrel with residents of Parwa Kheda area in Nishatpura over causing too much noise in the pre-dawn hours. The group started running, fearing they would be beaten. Raja was found dead after running for 2km. The short post-mortem report revealed that his heart had expanded due to low oxygen levels while running and suddenly stopped beating, said police. There were no injury marks on his body, so the youths who were chasing Raja and his friends were cleared of his death, said police. Investigating officer SI Swami Nath Yadav said Raja lived in Motilal Nagar in Nishatpura. On Wednesday night, he joined the birthday party of a friend, Rasheed, in Parwa Kheda. From there, the group of five moved to Motilal Nagar square in the same locality to continue with the party and then to Badwai Jod. Here, at 4am, they parked their SUV in a residential area and went on partying, said SI Yadav A resident named Shawez approached them to ask why they were disturbing the entire area so early in morning. Finding him alone, the group began misbehaving with Shawez and he called his brother for help, said SI Yadav. Shawez’s brother rushed to his side and a quarrel broke out. In the faceoff, the SUV was damaged. Realising that the situation was out of control, Raja and his friends began running to save their lives, said the SI. After sprinting for around 2km, Raja stopped to drink water from a hand-pump near his house. While gulping water, he collapsed on the road where his friends found him unconscious, said Yadav. They took him to a nearby private hospital, where doctors declared him dead and informed police. Nishatpura SHO Mahendra Singh Chouhan said a case of assault was registered on the complaint of one of Raja’s friends, but the accused “hadn’t even touched Raja during the dispute”. He died after running a few kilometres and police investigation is on, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/youth-dies-after-2km-run-for-life-in-nishatpura/articleshow/85314137.cms||Arun Singh
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Apologise or pay Rs 5,000 crore for defamation, says company to AAP MP Sanjay Singh||LUCKNOW: Rashmi Metaliks, a company which AAP MP Sanjay Singh has claimed has been blacklisted by eight states despite which it has been given the contract for supplying pipes for the implementation of the Jal Jivan Mission in UP, has sought Rs 5,000 crore as defamation from Singh. The company has said that AAP has been issuing false and frivolous data to malign it at the behest of business rivals. It has also asked why Singh has not raised the issue of Rashmi Metalik’s pipes being used for works being executed by Delhi Government. The notice issued to Singh has said that he needs to issue a public apology to the company and remove all videos from all platforms “which contain the slanderous comments”. Company director Sudam Mitra has referred to the press conference held by Singh on August 8 in which the company was named on several occasions for having supplied poor quality products to the UP government. “Singh has proceeded to malign Rashmi Metaliks Limited by deliberately and/or at the behest of rival industries, giving false and frivolous data,” Mitra said. Interestingly, as Mitra claimed, the company has also supplied material to Delhi Jal Board under Delhi Government but Singh made no mention of this during any of his press conferences. “Perhaps it is because of the fact that Delhi Government is run by the political party to which he belongs,” Mitra said. He said that the company would also be approaching the Supreme Court and requesting for investigation by CBI or any other investigating agency to determine who was behind providing government documents and other details to Singh “after suppressing the updated and real facts” for their business gains and Singh’s political gains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/apologise-or-pay-rs-5k-cr-for-defamation-co-to-aap-mp/articleshow/85315938.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks reply of govts on plea to end begging by children||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Friday sought response from the AAP government and the Centre on a public interest litigation seeking eradication of begging by children. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Amit Bansal issued notice on a public interest litigation by Ajay Gautam and also sought responses from Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights and Delhi Police. In his petition, Gautam sought directions to the authorities to rehabilitate children who are beggars and to identify and arrest people who are “pushing women using toddlers, teenage girls and small children into begging and...crime” and exploiting young girls. Gautam has alleged that in spite of the presence of beggars in every part of the city, the authorities have failed to take any remedial step to curb the menace. He submitted that child beggars are almost everywhere in Delhi, most commonly at traffic signals, railway stations, bus stands, religious places, colleges and popular markets. “Everyone knows that begging mafia is actively behind this menace and they in fact kidnap, train, force and torture innocent children for begging,” the petition stated. “It has been commonly seen in winters that young girls hold toddlers without clothes to gain maximum sympathy. It is also not out of context to mention here that in many cases these gangs kidnap young girls and intentionally give sedatives to small children to gather sympathy of people risking lives of toddlers as young as 9-12 months,” the petition added. The petition argued that the Constitution of India mandates the state to make efforts to provide best opportunities for the development of children and ensure that they are not abused. The petition demanded that the authorities must file a status report in the court after every three months and identify the number of destitute children who are involved or pushed into begging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-reply-of-govts-on-plea-to-end-begging-by-children/articleshow/85314174.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2 doctors, 9 others chargesheeted in Kandivli society fake vaccine case||MUMBAI: A 2,000-page-long chargesheet was filed at a Borivli magistrate court on Friday in connection with the first instance of fraudulent vaccination at Kandivli’s Hiranandani Heritage housing society. As forensic reports of the contents of vials are waited, police have banked on circumstantial evidence—largely statements of the accused—to establish that saline water was injected into citizens instead of vaccines. The state had informed the Bombay high court, during the hearing of a PIL about streamlining vaccinations in city last month, they would be filing a chargesheet within two weeks. Among the 11 accused chargesheeted are Shivam Hospital owner Dr Shivraj Pataria, his wife Neeta Pataria, alleged mastermind Mahendra Singh, ex-Kokilaben Ambani Hospital (KDAH) executive Rajesh Pandey, event manager Sanjay Gupta, placement institute owner Dr Manish Tripathi, his student Karim Ali, Shivam Hospital administrator Rahul Dubey and three data entry operators Gudiya Yadav, Chandan S and Nitin Mode. “We have recorded statements of 500 witnesses, including 390 residents of the Hiranandani Heritage society where the fraudulent drive was conducted on May 30,” said an IPS officer. The police have recorded judicial confessions of six witnesses, including two of Tripathi’s students, Roshni Patel and Ajit Benwasi. The duo was roped in for allegedly injecting saline water. The chargesheet gives details of the money trail, a sum of Rs 5 lakh, collected from Hiranandani residents by Singh while the camp was set up by Pandey allegedly pretending he was doing so on behalf of KDAH. He was subsequently terminated from KDAH. Police have invoked charges of ‘attempt to commit culpable homicide’ under IPC, besides the Disaster Management Act, Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Epidemic Act. Yadav, Chandan and Mode have been booked under Information Technology Act for keying in incorrect data to generate forged certificates. A BMC report has been attached with the chargesheet which states no intimation was given to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-docs-9-others-chargesheeted-in-kandivli-society-fake-vaccine-case/articleshow/85314181.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Allahabad||12 August This fashion designer holds open chat with women on menstrual hygiene||Prayagraj: A Delhi based leading fashion designer, Priyal Bhardwaj, has taken up a crusade to create awareness among rural women and girls about menstrual hygiene and health and is holding open talks in the remotest villages of the Pratapgarh district. Priyal, who also runs an organisation called Sangini Saheli, wants to erase misconceptions among women regarding menstrual health and hygiene and is working tirelessly to bring a change in the lives of women across the country. Holding an open talk with women and girls at Basauli village in Pratapgarh district on Tuesday, she encouraged women to have open talks on menstrual hygiene. She said that it worries her that people in rural areas are still not open to learning or spreading awareness on menstrual hygiene openly even in the 21st century and that women had to suffer because of it. She says, “there is a strong need to have open chat on the issue and understand the pain and feelings of women on this issue.” The designer added that a woman takes care of two families including her parent’s house and husband’s house after marriage but that does not mean that she should overlook her health and needs. “Every woman has a right to know about sanitary napkins,” she said. Priyal, meanwhile, said that more can be done to create mass awareness around menstruation so that women and girls have access to safe products with dignity. While working for migrants during the Covid pandemic, Priyal realised that apart from food distribution, there was a need for another important essential that was being neglected throughout the cities which were menstrual hygiene products among women. She started visiting public places like bus stands, railway stations and distributed sanitary pads, realising that many women were also travelling back to their hometowns after the lockdown last year. Till now, the organisation has distributed over five lakh sanitary pads among women in the country. Priyal says, “sanitary pads are as essential as other daily items for a healthy and secure life of a menstruator.” In rural areas, there are uncountable women across the nation who are still unable to manage their periods safely due to lack of proper pads and the right knowledge.” “We noticed that around 25% of the women that we reached out to, had either no knowledge of sanitary pads or it is still a hushed topic for them,” said Piyal. “We keep on sensitizing and making them aware during open talks along with the distribution of sanitary pads,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/12-august-this-fashion-designer-holds-open-chat-with-women-on-menstrual-hygiene/articleshow/85287288.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Higher Secondary council president Mahua Das replaced by Jadavpur University pro-VC||KOLKATA: The state government on Friday replaced Mahua Das with Jadavpur University pro-vice-chancellor Chiranjib Bhattacharjee as the head of West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education. There was no word from the state government about the reason behind the change in guard. Das, however, said, “I have come to the end of my term, which is the reason the government has appointed another president. I have got love and cooperation from all.”  Some officials, however, said the protests by students who fared badly in Higher Secondary exams and Das’s highlighting of the religious identity of this year’s HS topper, Rumana Sultana, might have had resulted in the decision. After HS results were declared this year—the final scores were calculated based on a formula adopted by the council in absence of an exam amid the pandemic—close to 20,000 students were found to have failed the Class XII exams. As protests broke out across Bengal , the state chief secretary held a meeting with Das and education department officials and instructed them to redress the grievances. Earlier this month, Das met education minister Bratya Basu, following which it was decided that all HS students would be awarded pass marks. An education department official said the government was waiting to solve the HS failure problem before replacing her. “Her referring to the HS topper by her religious identity and the protests after close to 20,000 students failed HS caused embarrassment to the government. Top officials in the education department spoke to her and instructed her to do damage control. The decision to remove her was taken many days ago. The announcement came on Friday,” said the official.  Bhattacharjee, who has 25 years’ experience in teaching and research, is expected to join as the council’s president next week. He is supposed to play a crucial role in deciding if the state board and council should also adopt X and XII split exam system, like CBSE and CISCE. “I might join my new workplace next week,” said Bhattacharjee, after receiving the order. The JU VC has been requested to release Bhattacharjee immediately. Das, who was earlier the principal of Women’s College, took charge of the HS council in 2013. She will continue to be the vice-chancellor of West Bengal State University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hs-council-president-replaced-by-ju-pro-vc/articleshow/85314188.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The recently issued order would allow lactating women to get vaccine doses at the sites where they go for routine immunisation of their children. The order states that the medical officer and the vaccinator are already present in the health facility along with the vaccines, as these centres also serve as cold chain points. “Vaccination shall be done through Co-WIN portal in walk-in mode. Vaccinators must be trained to conduct these sessions. All efforts must be made to keep vaccine wastage to a minimum,” the order states. The directions aim to ensure enhanced coverage of pregnant and lactating women and district health officials have been requested to ensure immediate operationalisation. “Based on Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights’s recommendations, the health department has issued orders allowing lactating mothers to get vaccinated for Covid-19 at the same centres as their children’s routine immunisation. They no longer need to make separate visits now,” tweeted Anurag Kundu, chairperson, DCPCR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pregnant-women-to-get-vaccine-at-check-up-centres/articleshow/85314224.cms||---

Currently, more than 600 villages in 24 UP districts are affected by floods. Additional chief secretary Navneet Sehgal said that the flooding in UP was not due to excessive rainfall but because states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana had released additional water in the Ganga, Yamuna, Chambal and Betwa rivers. In Ghazipur, 1.5 lakh people in 32 villages are affected by floods. In Ballia, more than 1.4 lakh people in 112 villages have been affected by floods due to high water levels in the Ganga, Saryu and Tons rivers. After the aerial survey, the CM met with families hit by floods. At Ghazipur, the CM interacted with 186 families at a relief camp and distributed relief material and food packets among them. Thereafter, he held a meeting with public representatives and local administration and reviewed the arrangements made for relief and rescue work. He directed officials to review each flood affected village and asked the chief medical officer to ensure that sufficient medicines are available in all villages. “The CM said that as soon as the flood waters recede, sanitation should start in all the villages. He has also said that teams of SDRF, NDRF and PAC should be deputed in flood affected areas so that there is no delay in rescue and relief operations. A nodal officer should be deputed for each flood hit village,” a government spokesperson said. In Ghazipur, the flood level had been stable since Thursday night and by Friday, had started receding slowly. At this time, the CM said, it was necessary to be even more cautious as there is a higher risk of breaches in embankments. He directed the irrigation department to carry out preventive repairs where necessary. Yogi also cautioned against snake and scorpion bites and said that special care must be taken in relief camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-reviews-relief-rescue-works-in-flood-hit-ghazipur-ballia-dists/articleshow/85315953.cms||---

A parliamentary panel headed by Congress MP Anand Sharma has praised the government’s efforts at tackling violence against women. In a recent report, the committee said it “appreciates the initiatives, like interlinking of various departments and creation of a single-window system to help women victims of violence, taken by the state government of Uttar Pradesh”. It recommends that other states should also establish such “synergy and coordination among various departments concerned with the safety and security of women and children”. A government spokesperson said it has become clear by the report that UP has set an example for other states to emulate. “The state has established One Stop Centres in all districts to help women suffering from violence,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cong-mp-led-panel-hails-up-model-on-women-safety/articleshow/85315943.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Bhopal||No roads, villagers in Madhya Pradesh forced to tread muddy path for funeral rites||BHOPAL: Absence of roads in villages of Madhya Pradesh continues to make people’s lives miserable. In some places that people have to carry the sick on cots wading through knee-deep muddy water. A similar scene was witnessed in Morena on Thursday night where a funeral procession was carried out on mucky roads. Residents of Sangoli village — with a population of about 5,000 —in Morena district have been demanding construction of a small piece of road from village to funeral ground for the past 30 years. Come monsoon, the absence of this 1km road stretch is making the life of the villagers difficult. On Thursday, a funeral procession got stuck in the sludge. Ramdhar Singh Tomar, a resident of Sangoli village said, “For the past 30 years, this has been the main poll issue in the village; however, the road is yet to be constructed.” He added, “This time we will not allow the netas to step into the village until the road work is done.” Village sarpanch Jagdish Ojha said that, “We have no kuchcha road in our village and all the roads are tarred. Our panchayat cannot make the road that leads to the funeral ground. We have sought the help of MLAs and MPs for the construction of this road but all efforts have gone in vain.” Earlier this week, visuals of people carrying a cot over their shoulders and treading muddy pathways to take an ailing person to the nearest hospital had gone viral. The villagers have been demanding this road for the past several years but their voice is yet to be heard by the bureaucrats sitting at the state secretariat in Bhopal. It has not even reached the office of the district collector in Morena either. Earlier this week, about 50 villagers protested at the office of the district collector again and said they would not leave until the issue was resolved. They spent the night in the premises of the office under a shed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-roads-villagers-forced-to-tread-muddy-path-for-funeral-rites/articleshow/85314258.cms||---

The state revenue minister, Govind Singh Rajput met Union agriculture minister, Narendra Singh Tomar in New Delhi on Thursday and requested to send the central team as soon as possible. The Union minister assured that the team would visit the state after August 15. Rajput informed the minister about loss suffered to the public as well as private property in the state due to floods. Rajput apprised Tomar about the steps taken in the state to rescue people from the flood hit areas. He said the state government is making all out efforts, but the loss is at such a mass scale that assistance from centre is needed to bring life back to normal and rebuild the infrastructure. Earlier this month, the state government also wrote to the Union government for sending a team for loss assessment. The flood-affected districts of the state were mainly Gwalior, Morena, Bhind, Shivpuri, Sheopur, Datia and Guna. The assistance from the union government and army and air force was taken for the rescue work. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan apprised the Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the situation of excessive rainfall and floods in the state earlier this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/central-team-to-visit-for-flood-damage-assessment-after-i-day/articleshow/85314286.cms||---

He pointed out that China was able to grow its economy six times between 2000 to 2010 by focusing on manufacturing and partnership with the US, but in the current geopolitical context, India has an unprecedented opportunity to make strides in the world of technology because of the availability of its human capital and domestic market. He said India needs the right leadership and make the right investments to achieve its full potential. “I think if we seize this opportunity, we can become a world leader in technology. We have already proven that is possible in the field of IT services but now we can focus on hi-tech manufacturing, 5G, Artificial Intelligence, data analytics, robotics and a range of new areas which can be fuelled by R&D and investment in intellectual property ownership,” he said while addressing the e-graduation ceremony of the Indian School of Business (ISB). He pointed out that Covid-19 variants and vaccination rate will be key in determining the extent of the opening up of the country in the coming days. “Advanced nations have vaccinated 60% of their population with a single dose, whereas developing nations have achieved less than 30%. In India, we still have a long way to go. We have given single dose vaccination to one-fourth of our population…,” he said, adding that at the current vaccination rate he expects country to vaccinate 60% of the population by the end of this year and 90% by the middle of the next year. He also pointed out that vaccination is having a positive impact as the rate of hospitalisation and deaths in new cases have fallen significantly. “But we do need to watch out for variants because they may affect the efficacy of the vaccine,” he said. At the 20th graduation ceremony held at the ISB, 692 students from the PGP class of 2021, FPM (Fellow Programme in Management) and founding class of EFPM (Executive Fellow Programme in Management) graduated from the premier B-school. ISB dean Madan Pillutla stressed on the importance of contributing to society. “I believe we have the responsibility to contribute a lot more to India. The third decade of ISB should be about impact and transformation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-can-emerge-as-global-tech-leader-tata-sons-chairman/articleshow/85311718.cms||Swati Rathor

Garbage was also flung on the ‘airside’ zone from the adjacent Gaondevi slum in Vakola. Airside is the area beyond the terminal building where aircraft operations take place. It is not near the runway, the police said, adding that flight operations were not disrupted. Sniffer dogs and personnel from the bomb detection squad were pressed into action at the airport.  Officials of Vakola police station who are probing the case said that there have been similar instances of miscreants hurling junk from the slum area onto the airport. “The small bottle hardly contained 50ml of petrol. People living in the slums that skirt the airport boundary wall throw garbage across the periphery wall, deputy commissioner of police Manjunath Singe said, adding that officials of the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad did not find anything “dangerous in the garbage”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1-booked-for-hurling-bottle-with-petrol-at-city-airport/articleshow/85314403.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai University proposes 74 new colleges for 2022-23||MUMBAI: Mumbai University’s academic bodies proposed to start 74 new colleges for the next academic year of 2022-23 during a meeting held on Thursday. The colleges in different locations were proposed based on recommendations from the board of deans. Of the 74 proposed colleges in the new perspective plan, 17 are in Mumbai city and suburbs, 18 in Thane and the rest in Raigad, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Palghar. Last year, the university had proposed 36 new colleges for the academic session 2021-22 in its perspective plan. Later, the state government added 18 more to the list. Eventually, only 24 college managements showed interest and applied and got the final nod from the state. This year, more than double the number is proposed by the university, and, if approved, total affiliated colleges are likely to cross 900. The university's perspective plan—drawn to look at the overall academic and infrastructural expansion for the next academic year—has now recommended starting 46 new arts, science and commerce colleges, 15 law colleges, eight night and three women's colleges. While 12 locations have been identified in suburban Mumbai, five are in the city. The plan will be sent to the government after approval from the university’s senate. Once the locations are finalized, applications will be invited from interested parties willing to set up the college. Of the 74, almost 15 locations are from the previous year’s plan, said a university official. The plan, though, was opposed by several academic council members at the meeting. The Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU) has claimed several seats in existing colleges are already going vacant. Overall, the university has seen a 20% dip in enrollment in the pandemic year. Four BUCTU members recorded their dissent in a letter submitted to the vice-chancellor. “The plan seems to be very unscientific and illogical. The proposal has been put forward without a fundamental study, and without considering the precarious conditions and geographical locations,” they said. They further pointed out that the university students’ enrollment from 2019 has been falling and currently colleges in Konkan have not managed to fill even 50% of their usual enrollment. The members refused to be part of the proposed plan. An academic council member said the plan has been drafted based on demands from various stakeholders and local representatives. The state government may add or remove some of the locations from the proposed plan but eventually fewer managements apply, so there will not be a surplus, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-univ-proposes-74-new-colleges-for-22-23/articleshow/85314344.cms||Yogita Rao

Barwani SDM Ghanshyam Dhangar said that on Friday, a joint team conducted surprise inspection of ‘Vrindavan Maa Vriddha Ashram’ operated by Ujjwal Medical Foundation Kapadna (Maharashtra) in Navalpura, on the outskirts of Barwani. During inspection, the team found that against the 50 women registered there, only two were in the facility. When the team questioned them, the women revealed that they used to get Rs 100 per day to stay there from 9am to 5pm. SDM said that 9 out of 11 employees allegedly posted in the old age home were also found absent. He said that none of the rules of recognition conditions and operation were found to be followed in the old age ashram. SDM said that during the inspection conducted in July, 35 women were 'hired’ on wages. Women were forced to say that they reside in the ashram. He said that this institution, which has been running since 2019, has also received the first installment of a grant of Rs 11.44 lakh from Central Social and Justice Department. He said that after the panchnama, entire records of the ashram were confiscated and the investigation report was being sent to district collector Shivraj Singh Verma. He said that the ashram’s director and teacher Shashikant Patil and employee Kamal Gole have been taken to Barwani Kotwali for creating disturbance during the inspection. Collector Verma said that the team led by the SDM was sent for inspection in accordance with the instructions of the director, Social Justice Department to conduct verification before releasing the second installment to the institution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/women-hired-to-pose-as-old-age-home-inmates/articleshow/85314358.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: More Ujjwala beneficiaries in opposition bastions of Azamgarh & Rae Bareli than PM Modi’s Kashi||LUCKNOW: Centre’s flagship Ujjwala scheme, which entails free LPG connections to poor, has more beneficiaries in Azamgarh and Rae Bareli, the parliamentary constituencies of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in comparison to PM Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency Varanasi, as per data of UP food and civil supplies department. Data accessed by TOI details LPG connections given under phase-1 of the scheme launched by PM Modi from Ballia on May 1, 2016, just before the 2017 UP assembly elections. While 1,75,978 connections were provided in Varanasi, number of beneficiaries in Azamgarh and Rae Bareli stood at 2,23,580 and 2,19,542, respectively. Even Ayodhya and Mathura, the two Hindutva hubs, recorded lower number of beneficiaries under the scheme. While Ayodhya received 1,87,750 gas connections, 1,69,128 applicants were benefited in Mathura. In contrast, Prayagraj, another Hindu religious hotspot, saw a significant 4,63,765 applicants getting benefitted from the scheme. This was also second highest after Sitapur, where a maximum of 5,07,323 applicants got the LPG connection.CM Yogi Adityanath’s home turf Gorakhpur recorded 2,50,953 beneficiaries. In all, UP got over 1.47 crore LPG connections in first phase of Ujjwala. The second phase of the scheme flagged off by PM Modi on August 10 from Mahoba, is expected to provide 15 lakh LPG connections in the state, sources said. Significantly, Mahoba was at the bottom of the table with only 89,808 connections after Noida, where barely 33,414 connections were doled out in phase-1 of the scheme. In Amethi, where Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was defeated by BJP’s Smriti Irani in 2019 Lok Sabha elections recorded only 1,32,696 beneficiaries. So was the case with Kannauj, formerly represented by Akhilesh Yadav’s wife Dimple. Here, only 1,45,464 applicants got benefitted. Number of connections in Etawah and Mainpuri — home turf and parliamentary seat of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav — remained as low as 1,30,584 and 1,29,120 respectively. Same was the case with Rampur —bastion of senior SP leader Azam Khan — where 1,91,297 connections were provided. Officials said the trend vis-a-vis number of beneficiaries in different districts was a clear indication of the scheme being implemented as per need and “without political proclivity”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/more-ujjwala-beneficiaries-in-oppn-bastions-of-azamgarh-rae-bareli-than-modis-kashi/articleshow/85315974.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Surat||AAP leader issues extortion threats on female party worker, held||Surat: Pandesara police arrested Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) city unit’s general secretary on Thursday for allegedly issuing extortion threats on a female party worker. Accused Gautam Patel had allegedly threatened Sapna Rajput, who contested on AAP ticket in recent municipal election from ward 29, of spoiling her political career if she didn’t repay his loan of Rs10,000. Depressed from the constant harassment, Rajput even attempted suicide by consuming sleeping pills and also cutting her left wrist on Tuesday. Based on her plaint, police booked Patel for extortion under Indian Penal Code and also booked him under sections of Gujarat Money Lenders Act. According to police, the accused had lent Rajput’s husband Ajay, an insurance advisor, Rs 4,000 last year. Patel demanded the money back from Rajput and threatened to finish her political career if they failed to repay him Rs10,000 along with interest. When Rajput went to meet him with her husband, the accused threatened of making screenshots of his chats with her husband viral if they refuse to pay the money. Patel told Rajput that he had chat messages of Ajay in which he had expressed inability to repay due to the financial crisis. In her complaint, Rajput alleged that she returned the money but Patel continued to harass her. He allegedly sent Rajput the screenshots of the chats and threatened of sharing these with other party workers. “The woman had consumed sleeping pills and cut her wrist two days ago. In her statement she named Patel for harassment after which police registered the offence and arrested the accused,” said a police officer in Pandesara police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/aap-leader-issues-extortion-threats-on-female-party-worker-held/articleshow/85312368.cms||---

The burglars left the cops red-faced as they committed the crime during the night curfew when the police are supposed to be out on the roads for patrolling. According to the police, a gang of burglars broke into shops of garments, furniture and sports equipment near Kothi Crossroads. Usually there is a checkpoint at this crossroad during the night curfew to keep an eye on those who flout the rule. The gang first broke into a furniture shop and went around looking for cash. When they didn’t find any cash, they began breaking into other adjacent shops but couldn’t find any money. The police said that no valuables or any product was stolen from any of the shops. Interestingly, the cops didn’t file any FIR by saying that the shop-owners didn’t come forward to file a complaint. While two of the shops fall under the jurisdiction of Karelibaug police station, the rest are under Raopura and Sayajigunj police stations. The Raopura police officials, in fact, said that none of the shops come under their jurisdiction. But none of the cops could explain how the burglars moved around during the night curfew and broke into the shops located on the main road without being noticed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/six-shops-near-police-station-burgled-during-night-curfew/articleshow/85312178.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: 12% funds for tribal welfare unutilised, eligible should avail schemes, says CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: The state tribal bhavan project will be ready within two years, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday, after laying the foundation stone for the complex at Porvorim. The chief minister said that 12% of the funds earmarked for tribal welfare in the state are still lying unutilised and urged those eligible to come forward to avail the different schemes meant for tribals. “Our departments through their field workers are creating awareness about the schemes from time to time. No applications are kept pending. But 100% applications are not coming. Government is ready to give 100% of the earmarked funds, but 12% of funds are lying unutilised. The minister is doing everything in his capacity. But one needs to propose projects to him so it can be pitched under central and state government schemes,” Sawant said. He said those in accomplished positions from the tribal community should help raise awareness about the schemes in the community. “I was doing a review to check if benefits of the different schemes have really reached the tribal community. State and central government schemes and those of the ST commission. There are schemes available to the tribal community not just for education, but also for medical treatment or to start a business,” Sawant said. The complex will include facilities like hostel, auditorium, gymnasium and canteen, among others. “The hall will be given on rent and will be open to anyone to rent. Hostel and other facilities will be exclusively for tribal community. The hall is located in a prime location and will be open to all, so that from the rent we can carry out the maintenance of the complex. It is not enough to construct a project, it is important to maintain it and the hall will help in this regard,” Sawant said. On the sidelines of the event, Sawant said that he has instructed the deputy collectors and mamlatdars to expedite tenancy and mundkarial cases and those seeking regularisation of structures. “To regularise structures, we have given powers to deputy collectors, but they hesitate to use them. If there are 5,000 cases, they should be cleared within the next three to four months, I have given them target,” the chief minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/12-funds-for-tribal-welfare-unutilised-eligible-should-avail-schemes-sawant/articleshow/85315995.cms||---
---||Nagpur||HC quashes FIR against APCCF MS Reddy in Chavan suicide case||Nagpur: In a major relief to MS Reddy, suspended APCCF and former field director of Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court has quashed the FIR registered by the Dharni police against him in the RFO Deepali Chavan suicide case. Harisal RFO Chavan had committed suicide on March 25, 2021, by shooting herself with her service revolver, accusing suspended IFS officer Vinod Shivkumar of harassment. Along with Shivkumar, who is the first accused, the name of Reddy was also added as the second accused. Reddy, who was arrested and later granted bail by the high court on May 3, had filed a criminal writ petition seeking quashing of the FIR. Though the FIR has been quashed, he continues to remain suspended and a disciplinary inquiry is under way. His suspension is expected to be revoked now. Deciding the matter on Thursday, justice AS Chandurkar and justice GA Sanap, after perusal of the material collected by the police, ruled that there was no legal basis whatsoever to implicate the petitioner in the aforesaid crime under section 306 of the IPC. Arguing on behalf of Reddy, senior counsel SV Manohar and AS Manohar said the case was principally based on the three suicide notes and on perusal, it was clear that the deceased had specifically referred to first accused Shivkumar as the only person who was responsible for her committing suicide. Though there was some reference to the petitioner in the suicide notes, it could be seen that the deceased had reposed confidence in the petitioner and had written that whenever the petitioner was around, she felt assured. “Though at some places it was imputed that the petitioner did not take any action against Shivkumar to restrain him from committing various illegal acts, it was submitted that the statement to that effect in the said notes could hardly be a reason to proceed against the petitioner under section 306 of the IPC,” the Manohars argued. On the contrary, APP SS Jachak appearing for the respondent-police opposed quashing of FIR. According to Jachak, the deceased on various occasions had made a grievance with Reddy about accused Shivkumar but the former failed to take any action. “This inaction on the part of the petitioner amounted to an illegal omission which had driven the deceased to commit suicide,” she said. Abhay Sambre, counsel for the deceased’s husband Rajesh Mohite, too argued that the petitioner had indirectly dissuaded his late wife from submitting a written complaint against Shivkumar, despite the fact that on various occasions she made complaints against the first accused. However, after hearing all the parties, the court said in cases of alleged abetment to suicide, there must be proof of direct and indirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide. “Merely on the allegation of harassment without there being any positive action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused which led or compelled the person to commit suicide would not be enough,” the court ruled. “From the present case it becomes clear that mere allegations of harassment of the deceased by another person would not be sufficient unless there is such action on the part of the accused which compels the person to commit suicide.  “The suicide notes and other material collected by the prosecution are all woefully short to hold the petitioner liable for being prosecuted under section 306 of the IPC,” the court ruled. Welcoming the HC ruling, ex-APCCF SS Mishra said, “Things were politicized against Reddy. A few NGOs and forest unions thought of it as a golden opportunity to grind the axe because Reddy had shown them the door for their vested interest. So the first thing the forest department should do is to get him reinstated soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-quashes-fir-against-apccf-ms-reddy-in-chavan-suicide-case/articleshow/85314379.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Even my friend and Congress spokesperson, Sachin Sawant, had lodged a complaint with the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in this regard,” Munde said. Referring to the PILs being heard by the high court, Munde said as the matter was currently before court, he was hopeful of a decision in it.

---||Bhopal||Beware of Pak hack attack, MP cyber cops to media houses||BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh cyber cell headquarters has asked all print and television media in the state to conduct an immediate security audit of their portals following intelligence inputs that Pakistani hackers may try to take down their websites to flash the Pakistani flag on August 15. This is being done to ‘avenge’ similar alleged attempts by Indian cyber hackers in 2015, 2017 and 2020, say sources in intelligence agencies. These skirmishes are part of a defacement war in cyber space that has been on between hackers of the two countries for over a decade, they say. “We have issued an advisory to media houses to secure their portals against any possible hacking attempt. They have been asked to establish a physical firewall in their network with secure access. They have also been advised to reset their passwords,” state cyber chief Yogesh Chaudhary told TOI. On August 14, 2015, a group calling themselves the ‘Hell Shield Hackers’ claimed to have taken down around 100 Pakistani business websites as a “tribute to the Indian jawan”. Cyber cops warn against new wave of ‘hacktivism’They said it was payback for the hacking of many Indian sites by Pakistan hackers to mark Pakistan’s Independence Day on August 14. Two years later, on the same day, a group of Indian cyber hackers allegedly took down over 500 Pakistani websites, including some major government ones, and posted pro-India content, said sources in the intelligence agencies. In 2020, over 80 Pakistani websites were hacked and the Indian Tricolour was flashed on them. Some major Pakistani news channels said their websites had been hacked as well. “After a hack attack, the channel started broadcasting the Indian flag along with the message ‘Happy Independence Day’. The Indian flag and the text appeared on a commercial running on screen, which remained for some time and then disappeared,” said an official release by one of the leading Pakistani news channels in 2020. Intel officers refer to this cyber war as ‘Hacktivism’, saying these cyberattacks are fueled by an ideology which is intended at taking over government or media websites and posting defacing messages on them to embarrass rival targets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/beware-of-pak-hack-attack-mp-cyber-cops-to-media-houses/articleshow/85314416.cms||P Naveen
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Tigress checks-in at Tadoba resort, fails to find way out||NAGPUR: Forest officials were on the tenterhooks on Friday to flush out a tigress nicknamed Chhoti Madhu which had sneaked into a resort, hardly 400 metre from the tourism gate at Mohurli of Tadoba. The big cat was stuck at the resort till late night. The tigress from the Navargaon-Agarzari area was first sighted early morning by the resort employees who informed the forest officials. As the word spread, a motley crowd of villagers gathered near the spot to have a glimpse of the animal. The STPF teams and foresters soon took charge and monitored the animal. According to G Guruprasad, deputy director (buffer), the tigress is not injured and must have entered the sprawling resort during the night, perhaps while following a prey. “At the backyard of the said resort, there is a forest encompassing agriculture fields. The resort is completely fenced and it seems the animal could not find a way out. Fortunately, there were no guests in the resort,” he said. Till late night, a rapid rescue unit (RRU) led by a sharpshooter was trying to drive out the tigress and sources said it was 30-40 metre from the main gate of the resort. For the entire day, the tigress was hiding inside the resort spread in 11 acres and having 16 separate cottages. The good vegetation and shrubs grown due to rains have turned it a hiding place for the tigress. The animal also could not jump out due to heightened walls of fencing. Police patil Ramkrishna Sakharkar said that the tigress killed a goat tied as a bait and contrary to expectation, it did not leave with the prey. “The tigress has three two-month-old cubs that were sighted by tourists in Agarzari in August first week. People did not disturb the animal as sighting tigers near Mohurli is not new,” said the police patil. Naturalist Himanshu Bagde pointed out that the incident has brought focus on the state government directions issued on September 20, 2017, calling fortification of only 10% area of the resorts around built-up structures in the form of chain link without masonry walls, thereby keeping the remaining area for free movement of the wildlife. “With big carnivores frequenting the area, is it wise to fence just 10% area and keep remaining open?” he said. However, Guruprasad said that many resorts, though they have come up on the revenue land, these fall in the corridor. “Tigers frequently move between Tadoba and Mohurli. Earlier, notices were issued to resort owners to implement the urban development department’s notification of 2017.” State wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre said that cluster of concrete resorts have come up and several are under construction on the western side of the park near Mohurli, which is connected to Irai Lake, an important water source for animals. “Similarly, many resorts are coming up in the buffer zone near Kolara on the north-eastern side of the park. These resorts are blocking animal movement causing conflict,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tigress-checks-in-at-tadoba-resort-fails-to-find-way-out/articleshow/85314468.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||After min’s nod, resident docs to move finmin with fee-waiver demand||Nagpur: The resident doctors who worked on the front line during both the Covid-19 waves in Maharashtra recently met the medical education minister Amit Deshmukh along with in-charge secretary of Directorate of Medical Education (DMER) Dr Dileep Mhaisekar. The minister has in-principally accepted their main demand for fee waiver, they said. The final decision will be taken by finance ministry for which the doctors will soon meet state finance minister Ajit Pawar. Stating that fee waiver is not just a financial demand for resident doctors, Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale Patil, president of central committee of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), said that they literally sacrificed their academic years for Covid service. “As government hospitals and medical colleges were full of Covid patients, anyone of us hardly got opportunity to learn the super-specialty for which we had taken admissions,” he said. As their teachers and heads of departments were also busy in Covid work, these post-graduation students missed their classes, on-job training and practical work experience of their super-specialty. With third wave already projected, the residents are eyeing another year of academic loss. Dr Dhobale Patil said that resident doctors are ready to work even in the projected third wave and “another year of studies might be washed out due to it”. “We demanded that the state government should waive off fees for the year 2020 and 2021,” he said. Deshmukh assured them that the government is positive about their demands. “Considering the dedication and hard work of the resident doctors in the first and second wave of pandemic, I have assured them that the government is positive about waiving off their fees as well as sanctioning additional stipend to appreciate their work,” said Deshmukh. As sanctioning funds for the above demands is the prerogative of the finance ministry, the MARD central committee officials are now seeking appointment of Ajit Pawar. “We will be meeting Pawar soon. We are hopeful that the our effort will get due recognition,” said central MARD vice-president Dr Pranav Jadhav. Resident doctors are considered as backbone of the government hospitals and medical colleges. During pandemic, the young resident doctors were frontline Covid warriors. They were felicitated and awarded for their service. But, their long-pending demand of stipend revision, incentive for Covid service and fee-waiver are yet to be considered by the state government. DMER in-charge chairman has been given the responsibility to present the proposals for finance ministry’s approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-mins-nod-resident-docs-to-move-finmin-with-fee-waiver-demand/articleshow/85311581.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

A team, led by assistant inspector Vyankatesh Alewar, arrested Rahul Kasat, who has now been charged with getting his friend Suresh Karwa killed in an accident as he was proving to be a hurdle in hi alleged illicit relationship with the latter’s wife. The accused was arrested from Hyderabad and produced before the court on Friday. He has been remanded in nine-day police custody.Superintendent of police Jayant Mina said Kasat decided to get his friend killed in accident after his previous attempts to get him killed through contract killers proved futile. So far, five accused have been arrested in the case.On May 2, Karwa, a businessman from Manvat, was run over by a speeding truck on Siddhanath Borgaon Road. Accordingly, based on the complaint lodged by the deceased’s elder brother, an offence was registered against the truck driver on the charges of causing death due to negligence and rash driving.Few days later an audio clip, a conversation between the deceased’s wife and Kasat, was uploaded on the social media. While Selu police were on the verge of closing Karwa’s case as accidental death, the audio clip reached the then deputy SP Rajendra Pal who allegedly demanded Rs 2 crore in bribe for not naming Kasat as accused in the murder case.Unwilling to pay hefty bribe, Kasat lodged a complaint with Mumbai ACB and a trap was laid on the night of July 23 and caught police naik Ganesh Chavan red handed while accepting Rs 10 lakh on Pal’s behalf.The demand for such a huge bribe amount attracted attention of senior police officers following which young IPS officer Shravan Dutt and additional superintendent of police Mummakka Sudarshan were tasked to probe the case of accidental death. Soon it came to fore that Kasat was allegedly the brain behind Karwa’s murder. Soon he was named as an accused in the case. On learning about the development, Kasat went underground and moved an application for anticipatory bail.Vinod Ambhure, one of the accused, hired a truck on the pretext of transporting goods and asked Rajebhau Khandagle to carry out the task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/selu-dy-sp-bribe-case-complainant-held-in-murder-case/articleshow/85309586.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra Sadan scam: ACB objects to Chhagan Bhujbal’s plea for discharge, says there’s ‘evidence’||MUMBAI: The Anti-Corruption Bureau has strongly objected to the discharge plea of state cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal in the Maharashtra Sadan scam case. The prosecution in its reply has submitted that there is evidence that the NCP leader’s family members and he received kickbacks. His son Pankaj and nephew Sameer Bhujbal have also sought discharge, and their pleas have been opposed by the investigating agency. The family had denied allegations of irregularities. The court heard extensive arguments on Sameer Bhujbal’s plea on Friday. Activist Anjali Damania, the original complainant, told the court she wanted to intervene in the matter and oppose the discharge petitions filed by Chaggan Bhujbal and others. The hearing on the pleas will continue on August 21. Chhagan Bhujbal, who was PWD minister during the alleged scam, was briefly arrested in the ACB case in 2016 and granted bail. He is also booked in a separate case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, which was investigated by the Enforcement Directorate. He was in jail in the ED case. Recently, five accused were discharged in the ACB case. In the detailed order, the court had said there is no material, prima facie, showing there was a meeting of minds of all the public servants and as members of conspiracy they hatcheded a plan. The court had denied allegations that it was illegal to hand over the project to the developer without inviting tenders. The case concerns a contract that Chhagan Bhujbal allegedly gave a firm, K S Chamankar Enterprises, without inviting tenders in 2005 when he was PWD minister. Bhujbal is now cabinet minister in the MVA government. The builder got development rights of a slum on RTO land in Andheri, with the condition that Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi, RTO building in Andheri and a guest house on Malabar Hill be constructed in return. The firm is said to have entered into an agreement with another company for the work and afterwards sold development rights of the RTO land to a construction company. Bhujbal is accused of receiving kickbacks and is booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act. It was alleged that as a result of the contract, undue advantage was earned by the developer and losses were caused to the state government. Those discharged on July 31 were developers and architect Pravina Chamankar, Praneeta Chamankar, Prasanna Chamankar and Krushna Chamankar, along with former PWD engineer Arun Devdhar. The court said that at the outset, there is no evidence that Rs 13.5 crore was paid by the developer itself to Chhagan Bhujbal and his son, nephew, and staffers and their family members who are accused in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-acb-objects-to-bhujbals-plea-for-discharge-says-theres-evidence/articleshow/85314450.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The Yuva Sena is led by environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. Varun Sardesai, secretary of Yuva Sena and a close aide of Thackeray, is currently touring the state and holding programmes and events for Yuva Sena’s office-bearers and members through a programme ‘Samvad Daura’. The event in Beed was criticized for violating Covid norms, after which, Sardesai expressed his regret and added that he should be held equally responsible, if the administration finds any violation. During his visit to Aurangabad on Friday, he told TOI, “Despite all the odds, we managed to win all the 10 senate seats at Mumbai University. We have decided to contest all the senate elections across universities in Maharashtra.” He recalled at the Yuva Sena won the MU senate seats despite several factors, including BJP leadership stepping in to help their candidates. While stating that the youth wing has the largest number of active youth members in the state, he said that special programmes are being worked upon to train the youth workers to remain effective in the senate elections across the universities. Former deputy mayor and state office-bearer of Yuva Sena, Rajendra Janjal, said that there are instructions to raise all the genuine issues faced by students in rural or urban pockets. “Despite Shiv Sena being a ruling party, we have been asked to raise student and youth-related issues from nook and corner of the state,” said Janjal. Those privy to the development said that Shiv Sena has taken a serious cognizance of the dedicated membership drive being continuously run by Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/yuva-sena-plans-to-contest-senate-polls-in-all-universities/articleshow/85309632.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra: Battis Shirala residents worship snake idols under police watch||KOLHAPUR: The famous town of Battis Shirala in Sangli district had low key, indoor celebrations of Nag Panchami on Friday in a departure from its tradition of live snake processions and worship. Heavy police deployment and restrictions on movement meant that the festival was largely celebrated at homes using snake idols. On Friday morning, the mobile unit of police and forest department carried out march across the town. Over 150 police were deployed in the city and the entry points were sealed. The Sangli forest department arrested a 46-year-old man who was found handling a live cobra snake near Battis Shirala town on Friday. The suspect, whose identity was not been revealed by forest department, was found with a live snake at Kadvekar Mala, Kapri village near Battis Shirala. He was booked under section 9 of Wildlife (Protection) act 1972. The section deals with prohibition of hunting of scheduled wildlife animals. The snake has been released into the jungles, said Vijay Chavan, deputy conservator of forests. The town is famous for performing puja of live cobras on Nag Panchami. The tradition has been banned by Bombay high court as it goes against the Wildlife (Protection) act, 1972. Catching, possessing and procession of live snakes invites jail term up to three years and fine of Rs 25,000. In the run-up to the festival, 65 mandals and 10 individuals were served notices reminding them of the HC order and the local administration's prohibitory orders. As permitted by district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary, the puja in Ambamata temple was carried in presence of ten citizens. The palanquin with snake idol was worshipped inside the house of the traditional priests. Owing to Covid restrictions, Chaudhary banned procession of the palanquin. The non-essential shops were shut as per the order of local administration. The essential shops were allowed to open. Both essential and non-essential shops from the town will open on Saturday. The women carried out puja of snake idols or snake pictures at home. The forest department conducted drone vigilance to check anyone carrying out puja of live snakes secretly, however no such incidence was reported from the town. The forest department has deployed teams to keep an eye on residents between Friday to Sunday. They are using drones to track the suspicious movement of snake catchers in the nearby forest ranges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/battis-shirala-residents-worship-snake-idols-under-police-watch/articleshow/85309649.cms||---

Meanwhile, inoculation — affected for the last four days — will resume in NMC’s Covishield centres in the city on Saturday. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on Friday issued order of unlocking which will be implemented in the city from August 15. As per the order, completion of 14 days after the second vaccine dose is mandatory for directors/owners and staff of shops, restaurants, malls, establishments, offices, industries etc from August 15. NMC deputy commissioner Nirbhay Jain on Friday reportedly directed the nuisance detection squad (NDS) to start checking certificates of staff of all establishments from August 16. He asked the squad to give warnings during the first visit, in case of non-compliance of orders. He directed NDS to apply penalties and take action against violators during the second visit. Nagpur Residential Hotels Association (NRHA), in letters submitted to the district administration and the state government, said, “Some of the conditions imposed are not practical and logical at this moment. The order mandates completion of 14 days after the second dose for entire staff of restaurant and banquet halls. This is certainly a good requirement but we need to realize that the majority of staff, waiters and room-boys are in the age group of 18-45 years.” The letter added, “Vaccination for this age group started from May 1. Most of the staff took first dose in May end and June. Their next dose will fall in the last week of August. A gap of 14 days from second dose means after September 15. This condition should be waived.” Vice-president Ganesh Gupta requested to make mandatory only the first dose of vaccine for now, and the second dose in January 2022. NRHA secretary Deepak Khurana pointed out that keeping two windows or doors open in air-conditioned restaurants was also not practical as most of the star-category restaurant units are located in enclosed spaces. Meanwhile, affected for the last four days due to a lack of doses, vaccination will resume in 153 Covishield centres of the NMC on Saturday. The district on Friday received 1.53 lakh doses of Covishield and 5,600 doses of Covaxin. Vaccination will not happen on August 15 on account of Independence Day holiday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-begin-vax-check-in-shops-restros-from-aug-16/articleshow/85314524.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Business||Jayadev Galla takes over as Amara Raja group chairman||Tirupati: After founding and nurturing the Amara Raja group for over three decades, group chairman Ramachandra N Galla finally called it a day on Friday and handed over the baton to his son Jayadev Galla. The formal transition on the board will, however, take place on Saturday. The decision on his retirement was taken at the company’s board meeting in June this year, when Galla announced that he would be handing over the reins to vice-chairman Jayadev Galla and that his daughter’s sons Harshavardhana Gourineni and Vikramadithya Gourineni would join the board as executive directors. The US-based entrepreneur, who returned to India in 1984 to help develop his native Chittoor district, set up his first factory to manufacture industrial batteries at Karakambadi. Recalling those days, he said the first investment of Rs 6 crore made by the Gallas in the eighties had now grown to Rs 6,000 crore today. Also, starting from a paltry production of 60 million Ah (amp hours) in the first year, it has grown to 2500 million Ah today, he said. “The automotive battery plant started in 2000 is among the biggest such plants in the world today,” the outgoing chairman said. While refusing to be drawn into a conversation on pollution-related issues, the senior Galla said the company had always adhered to the highest standards, be it the environment, human resources and working atmosphere to deliver the best in terms of product, service and quality of life. The new chairman Jayadev Galla said after having made strides in industrial, automobile and tubular batteries (used for home inverters), the group has now added mobility as another core area of focus coupled with energy. “With enhanced focus on energy and mobility, we are working towards rolling out electric-powered vehicles in various formats,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jayadev-galla-takes-over-as-amara-raja-group-chairman/articleshow/85311863.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

It is high time that Koshyari appoints 12 eminent persons on the legislative council as per the recommendations of the state cabinet,” Thorat told TOI. Malik said it was unfortunate that despite the unanimous recommendation of the state cabinet in November last year, the governor was not taking any decision on the appointment of 12 persons from different walks of life on the legislative council. “The high court has made it clear that it can’t give directions to a person who is holding a constitutional post, but it has also observed that there should be better coordination between the government and the governor,” Malik said. Malik said it is a fact that no timeframe has been fixed for the government to take a decision on the recommendation of the cabinet, but now, in view of the observations of the high court, the NCP expects that the governor will take a decision as early as possible. “The governor must realize that he holds a constitutional post, and his decisions should be apolitical.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/expect-governor-to-decide-on-council-seats-soon-in-mumbai-cong-ncp/articleshow/85314567.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

He said the growth of the real estate sector in Hyderabad during the first half of 2021 has been well above the national average across all asset classes which is why when people get vaccinated and companies restart work from office or hybrid work schedules the demand for real estate will gain further momentum.

The police said one or two personnel would be deployed at each of the over 70 petrol pumps in the city to ensure that the motorcyclists abided by the regulation and did not create any ruckus at the fuel stations. Senior inspector Ashok Bhagat of the Panchavati police station said, “We have been explaining the petrol pump owners the concept behind floating the ‘no helmet no petrol’ rule at the filling stations. Accidents occur on the city roads on a daily basis. Most of the victims are bikers and the maximum number of people dying in road accidents were motorcyclists without helmets.” Personnel from police stations across the city have been holding meetings with the petrol pump owners to make the rule a success. “Bikers found arriving at the petrol pumps without wearing the helmets would have to fill a form, providing details such as name, phone number and address. The bikers also have to state in the form the reason for not wearing te protective head gear. The forms filled by the errant drivers would be sent to the traffic branch office for further action,” Bhagat said. The Motor Vehicles Act mandate a Rs500 fine for riding a two-wheeler without wearing helmets. No penalty would, however, be taken from the errant bikers at the petrol pumps, the police said. Senior inspector Pandharinath Dhokane of the Mhasrool police station said, “Beat marshals of the respective police stations would visit the petrol pumps in their jurisdiction at regular intervals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-helmet-no-petrol-in-nashik-from-tomorrow/articleshow/85309692.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The state has banned manufacture, use, sale, distribution and storage of plastic items. It’s been over three years since the restrictions came into place but could not be implemented completely. Despite raids carried out by local authorities, the banned items continue to be openly available in many areas. Officials of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) said the illegal entry of banned plastic from other states, particularly Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, has been a big hindrance in effective implementation of the ban in state. “The pan-India ban will ensure that single use plastic item is not manufactured in other states too, which will stop its entry in Maharashtra,” said AM Kare, MPCB regional officer of Nagpur. Stating that action was being taken, sub-regional officer AN Katole said, “On getting tip-offs, we would seize the banned items coming from other states. But they come in large quantities and it becomes difficult to catch hold of it all. While the organized sector has been largely following the restrictions, now the national ban will make the unorganized sector follow it too.” Activists are of the view that the ban can only be implemented successfully if alternatives are made available. “There should be affordable and feasible alternatives for the banned items as well as for the people whose livelihoods have been dependent on manufacturing and selling plastic since generations. Also, the onus should be on citizens, who despite being aware of the ban, continue to use the items,” said environment activist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani. Pointing out that just banning things won’t help, activist Wasudev Mishra said, “The implementation purely depends on the behaviour of people, how they adapt to this new change. Also, we need to work on a framework level change, where an alternative can help people change their mindset and understand the importance of our environment.” Chhabrani added that breaking the “vicious nexus” is also crucial. “The government needs to identify who are the manufacturers in states, who are the purchasers and dealers, and break this network. Only then the country can be rid of plastic,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nationwide-ban-will-finally-end-single-use-plastic-in-maha/articleshow/85314564.cms||Manka Behl

And this time the civic body, and not the city bus operators, will be paying the cost of conversion. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that of the 237 standard-sized buses, 54 have already been converted into CNG for which the operators are paying conversion cost of around Rs4 lakh. “The NMC is paying cost of service as per diesel rate, and not CNG, to the operators. So, they are able to recover the conversion cost,” he said. The civic chief further said that plan is to convert 146 more standard-size buses into CNG for a total of 200. “Plan is also ready to convert 150 midi and 45 mini buses into CNG. Operators have taken bank loans so there is hypothecation on the buses. Operators have been asked to get necessary approval from banks for conversion,” he said. Remaining 37 standard-sized buses will not be converted into CNG as they are not fit for it and being operated as spare buses. Radhakrishnan also said that the NMC will pay cost of conversion of around Rs4 lakh. “Rawmatt Industries Private Limited is converting buses into CNG and recovering cost in instalments from the operators. NMC will pay to Rawmatt Industries and then pay cost of service at the rate of CNG, and not diesel, to the operators. Thus, the NMC will recover the expenditure and save more,” he said. The NMC is operating six electric-run midi buses. Under central government’s scheme, it is all set to get 40 more such buses. With this all buses in Aapli Bus service will become eco-friendly. In 2015, city MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari had announced to make entire city bus service eco-friendly. With his initiatives, the NMC had also introduced ethanol-run buses but those were discontinued later. One of the city bus operators said termed NMC decision as correct which will benefit all. “Problem is the NMC is allowing only 200 of total 438 buses to ply citing pandemic. This is causing huge loss to the operators as well as the NMC and people. The NMC should run all buses,” he said. Making all buses eco-friendly is also likely to reduce financial losses for the city bus service to some extent. Currently, the service is incurring expenditure of around Rs13 crore per month while the revenue is Rs 6 crore per month — a loss of Rs7 crore per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-plans-to-run-200-big-all-195-midi-mini-buses-on-cng/articleshow/85314555.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The drive was carried out in Konkan, Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad regions. A total 1.4 lakh meters were checked, of which nearly 22,000 were found faulty with 0-30 readings. Konkan includes part of Mumbai metropolitan region. “We booked 849 consumers for power theft under section 135 of Electricity Act, 2003. As for the remaining faulty meters, they were found to be defective, dead, running slow or with display problems. We are replacing all such meters on an urgent basis,” said MSEDCL managing director Vijay Singhal. The meters include those of residential, commercial and industrial use. MSEDCL supplies electricity to over 2.6 crore users across the state. Sources said 43 lakh meters across the state were found to have low monthly readings, with most cases being of those not occupying their flats or have kept their business establishments shut. Of the 43 lakh meters, 1.4 lakh have been checked and the remaining will be checked too, an official said, although this could take time. Those checked include over 29,000 meters in Aurangabad, where 6,491 were found faulty and 52,000 in Konkan, of which 6,920 were found faulty. In Nagpur, over 35,000 meters were checked for 0-30 unit readings, of which 5,190 were found faulty and in Pune, over 20,000 meters were inspected, of which 4,000 were found faulty, an official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/849-booked-in-state-maharashtra-for-rigging-power-meters-to-show-only-0-30-units/articleshow/85311971.cms||Somit Sen
---||Nashik||Rly commuters raise pitch for monthly pass revival||Nashik: Train commuters of the district, who have to travel to Mumbai daily, have requested the Railways to reintroduce the monthly season ticket, which has been done away with due to the Covid pandemic. The Nashik city-based Nashik Pass Holders Wa Pravasi Welfare Association said the daily passengers, who are fully vaccinated, must be provided with the monthly passes, which is much more economical than buying tickets daily.“The state government allowing those, who are fully vaccinated in local trains in Mumbai, is a good thing. The railways should also take similar measures for intercity travellers, like giving the monthly season ticket to only those people who are fully vaccinated in the region,” said Rajesh Fokane, president of the organisation. The organisation has written to the railway board and the divisional railway manager of Bhusawal. The facility will help the people travel for their jobs and businesses and also help in the revival of the economy at a faster pace. There are over 2,500 such commuters in Nashik city, who travel frequently to Mumbai by trains. Of them, more than 700 are daily commuters like government employees and those in private sectors.“There is also a large number of business persons who use the train services and all of them are now suffering because they have to buy confirmed tickets only to travel to Mumbai,” said Kiran Borse, a regular traveller and member of the association. Ranjeet Khairnar, who is now working as a courier boy in Nashik after leaving his job in the construction industry in Mumbai, said, “At the time when Covid has affected the economy badly, the restrictions on MST has forced many people to leave their jobs. If MST is allowed again, even I will get the job again and will be able to support my family instead of depending on the state or the Centre.”The railway authorities said that they had received the letter from the organisation but announcing such facility was the subject of railway board’. The letter will be forwarded to the office and their decision will be implemented accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rly-commuters-raise-pitch-for-monthly-pass-revival/articleshow/85309731.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Both got hit by Shiva’s lorry coming at high speed, Keesara police said. Sudharshan was lucky to survive, cops said.

---||Goa||Restore licences of cabbies, they are bhumiputras, says Churchill||Margao: Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao on Friday urged chief minister Pramod Sawant to provide free digital meters to tourist taxi operators from Goa as was earlier assured to them. Stating that taxi operators and shack operators were the bhumiputras of Goa, Alemao said that they have suffered financial loss during the pandemic due to loss of business. “The chief minister had promised the taxi operators that they would be given meters for free. I am sure that the chief minister who has the interest of Goans close to his heart wouldn’t let them down,” Alemao said while addressing reporters. Pointing out that licences of some tourist taxi operators who couldn’t pay the amount for meters by the due date have been cancelled by the authorities, Alemao cautioned the government against doing so. “You have no right to cancel the licences of bhumiputras. Driving taxis is their traditional occupation. Please restore their licences and provide them the meters absolutely free. I am sure the chief minister won’t renege on his promise,” he said. Voicing his opposition to the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill that has been passed by the Assembly recently, Alemao said that he has already submitted a letter to the Goa governor raising objections to the Bill. “I have demanded that the Bill should be rejected. There can be no bhumiputras in the state other than Goans,” he said. He also expressed his disapproval over the manner in which the Calangute teenager death case was investigated by the police. Alemao said, “There appears to be a fault in the case. I ask the government that a detailed inquiry be conducted in the matter,” he said while replying to a query. Replying to another query he demanded that the western bypass should built on stilts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/restore-licences-of-cabbies-they-are-bhumiputras-says-churchill/articleshow/85316091.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: 25-year-old held for minor’s rape, murder||JAIPUR: The Jaipur rural police on Friday arrested a 25-year-old man who had lured a four-year-old girl and took her by a pond-side on his bike where he allegedly raped and then strangled her to death. Superintendent of police, Jaipur rural, Shankar Dutt Sharma, said that the accused was identified as one Suresh Balai. The alleged murder and rape has shocked the entire village after the girl’s body was found on a muddy spot alongside the pond on Thursday morning. A huge crowd gathered outside the Narena police station, demanding the arrest of the suspect. “The child knew Suresh because he used the same road near her house, to travel every day. On Wednesday evening, he abducted her by luring her to come with him on his bike, promising to take her to her family barn. He took her to a pond where he raped and then killed her,” Sharma said. The police said that on Wednesday, the girl’s father had already left for the barn located barely a few km away from her house. She also wanted to go there before she met the accused midway. The investigators said that the accused promised the child that he would safely take her to the barn on his own bike. The police said that prima facie, the death appears to be due to strangulation, however, they were waiting for the post-mortem report of the medical board to confirm the nature of injuries and the exact cause of death. A team of 700 police personnel including three additional SPs, five deputy SPs and 26 SHOs, had fanned out on multiple fronts to track the accused who had already got the whiff of the police pursuit. The police team clung to Suresh’s trail after all multiple circumstantial pieces of evidence indicated the possibility of his involvement. “The accused never used a phone due to which tracking him was a difficult task,” Sharma told TOI, adding that the protesters had given the local police an ultimatum to arrest the accused by Friday 8pm. The Jaipur rural police said that they have spoken to protesters to finally claim the body now that the accused is arrested. The officials said that a compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh will be given to the girl’s family. “This is a very heinous offence, therefore, we will submit a chargesheet as early as possible. We have also finalised that a special prosecutor will be arranged in the case,” Sharma said.

Kushwaha is an accused along with another former BSP minister, Naseemuddin Siddiqui, who was interrogated in July. Vigilance sources said, Kushwaha initially excused himself on health grounds and then cited an engagement with CBI. He did not respond to the third notice, but on Friday, he was grilled for several hours. The former cabinet minister had to face 100 questions prepared by officials to unravel wrongdoings in construction of memorials in Lucknow and Noida. Sources privy to the probe disclosed that Kushwaha did not cooperate when tough questions were tossed at him. Siddiqui too had been asked similar questions. “This was just the first round. Several more are in the offing,” said a vigilance officer. From next week, at least 20 government officials accused in the case would be interrogated. “After noting down replies, questions will be hurled at random to Naseemuddin, Kushwaha and accused officials in the final round,” said the official. On July 1, notices were served on 40 accused persons, including former BSP ministers Naseemuddin Siddiqui and Babu Singh Kushwaha and government officials for recording statements. In 2014, an FIR was lodged after the Lokayukta probed 199 persons, including the former ministers and 12 BSP MLAs in 2013 in the memorial scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/memorial-scam-vigilance-grills-ex-bsp-minister-kushwaha/articleshow/85316067.cms||---

Talking about the case, the lady cop from the 1990 batch, told TOI that she was on a holiday and was attending a private function in Thane when she was alerted by her team of the assault. “I promptly left for the spot in Kamothe slums and was horrified to see the toddler in bad shape. She was shifted to the hospital for medical attention,” she said. We immediately launched an investigation and spoke to family members and zeroed in on the brother-in-law of the toddler’s mother as we suspected him. “We frisked him and found bloodstains on him following which he was arrested under provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act, 2012,” said the cop. "The man confessed to his crime and despite limited resources, we gathered all evidence, including DNA samples, recorded statements and other details and submitted the charge sheet within a month’s time. The case was heard by the special court in Alibaug and within two years, the accused was convicted for the crime and sentenced to life imprisonment along with a penalty," she said. An elated Dsouza says the efforts of her team in getting the survivor justice and seeing her recover is a very rewarding experience for her in her several years of working in the department. “The credit goes to my team who helped me crack this case. After seeing the girl in severe pain, my only aim was to give her justice, which we did," sums up D'souza, adding that she has dedicated her medal to the survivor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-thane-lady-cop-gets-union-govt-award-for-probe/articleshow/85312125.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Mumbai||Trust governor will soon end MLCs nomination impasse: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday declared that the governor of the state is vested with an obligation by the Constitution to either accept or return the recommendation for nominated MLCs as made by the council of ministers, forming part of advice which he has to discharge “within reasonable time”. What should be reasonable time depends on facts of each case, the HC held, but added that the “impasse” has to end in Maharashtra as eight months seems to be beyond reasonable time and hoped that a decision on nomination of 12 members of the legislative council (MLCs) be taken soon. Observing that the governor is not answerable to the court, nor can the court issue him any directions, the HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni expressed “hope and trust” that things will be set right at an early date. Council seats can’t be kept vacant endlessly, says HCThe Bombay high court said on the issue of nominations to the legislative council that “given the “gravity of the issue involved and necessity to fill up vacancies immediately and to subserve the aims of the Constitution, it would be eminently desirable if the obligation in the present case is duly discharged without undue delay.” Rules of business bind both the government and the governor, the HC said on Friday. The judgment was passed on a public interest litigation filed by Ratan Luth, questioning the delay in governor B S Koshyari nominating the 12 MLCs. “It is not impermissible to read an implied authorisation in the provisions of clauses 3 and 5 of Article 171 for the Governor to examine whether recommendees ought to be nominated,” the HC said. On whether the governor has a “duty to speak”, the HC said, “We have held that if the saying that everything happens for a reason is to be believed, this court ought to assume that there were genuine reasons for the Governor not to convey his decision earlier.” It added, “However it is time that impasse is resolved. It is mature, sensible and responsible governance both at the Centre and in the States that the people look up to. Should there be any misunderstanding between two constitutional authorities or functionaries, the right steps ought to follow. Minor differences, if any, ought to be resolved including by a discussion between the Governor and the Chief Minister in the guiding spirit of the Constitution.” The HC said, “Indeed, if there are major differences, the same ought to be made known for ironing out the differences.” Seats cannot be kept vacant endlessly, said the HC in its judgment, whether by justifiable cause and much to the detriment of legislative functions. The HC said, "duty of the Governor to speak and let CM know the reservations about recommendees, if at all, within reasonable time has to be read with section 10 (2) (c) of the Representation of the People’s Act with Article 171 (5) of Constitution, or else the statutory the legislative intent would stand defeated.” Under Article 171 (3) (e) read with 171(5) of the Indian Constitution, “those nominated to the upper house shall consist of persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as the following, namely, literature,science, art, co-operative movement and social service.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-council-seats-cant-be-kept-vacant-endlessly-says-hc/articleshow/85314685.cms||Swati Deshpande

Experts in the field claim that the state is among the most proactive amongst the northern states of the country, especially with the initiative of organ donation pledge on driving licences for which around 2 lakh persons have given their consent. Organisations working to raise awareness about organ donation stated that there is positive response from the people, though 90% donors are from rural areas. According to government data, currently 311 persons are on the wait list for kidneys majority of whom are men. Bhavna Jagwani, trustee of MOHAN Foundation and member of state organ donation and transplant committee, Rajasthan, added, "in Rajasthan, counselling by NGOs has been extremely effective and although there was hesitancy amongst people in the initial years, the awareness has gradually evolved. In fact, 90% donors are from rural Rajasthan as possibly the villagers understand the concept of recycling. The state has been especially active and we are the only ones in the country to have a memorial for organ donors," said Jagwani who lost both eyes vision during her pregnancy due to a drug reaction though it was temporary. However, after losing sight completely for a month, she started an eye donation bank 20 years ago and seven years back MOHAN Foundation, an NGO, was started in Jaipur which promotes organ donation. Rajasthan transport department became the first in the country last August to make it mandatory to declare willingness or unwillingness for organ donation while applying for driving licence online. Apart from this, Jaipur Citizen Forum’s Rajiv Arora also met forest officials on Thursday to discuss development of a park to honor organ donors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/in-past-seven-years-42-donors-have-saved-150-lives-in-rajasthan/articleshow/85314632.cms||---
---||India||Twitter is biased, listens to what government says: Rahul Gandhi||NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused Twitter of “interfering” in India’s political process and making it the company’s business “to define our politics”. Rahul’s comments came a week after Twitter locked his account as well as those of many Congress functionaries and party units after they purportedly violated Twitter rules by sharing a picture of a Dalit family whose minor daughter had allegedly been raped and murdered. “This is an attack on the democratic structure of the country, this is not an attack on Rahul Gandhi. This is not, you know, simply shutting Rahul Gandhi down. I have 19-20 million followers. You are denying them the right to an opinion,” Rahul said in a video message that was widely shared by Congress on its social media platforms. Rahul also said Twitter’s move to lock his account was not only “patently unfair”, but also “breaching the idea that Twitter is a neutral platform”. “…For the investors, this is a very dangerous thing because taking sides in the (sic) political contest has repercussions for Twitter.… It’s obvious now that Twitter is actually not a neutral, objective platform. It is a biased platform. It’s something that listens to what the government of the day says,” he said. The brief video message saw Rahul ask whether companies must be allowed to “define politics” only because they are “beholden” to the government. Along with the video statement, he issued an Instagram post that read “Digital Dadagiri nahi chalegi (digital strongarm tactics won’t work)”. Later in the day, Congress fielded its spokespersons to question the Prime Minister’s “silence” on the alleged rape. They also claimed that Rahul did not violate any Twitter policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/twitter-is-biased-listens-to-what-government-says-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/85317627.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Ludh gets cracking on beautification goals, statues to come up near Jagraon Bridge||Ludhiana: Soon, the statues of martyrs and colourful lights will adorn the area near Jagraon Bridge. On a 100-foot tall flag post, national flag will also be unfurled. The civic body, under smart city mission, has handed over the work orders for these tasks and in next two months these works will be completed. Already lighting has been done at Clock Tower and Southern bypass flyover near MC zone D office. The beautification of MC zone D is also completed and now its trial is going on. A statue of Mahatma Gandhi will be placed near A zone office, statue of B R Ambedkar near Jalandhar bypass, Shaheed Kartar Singh Sarabha statue in Bhai Bala Chowk and statue of Flying lt Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon in DC office complex. As for the national flag, the officials claimed that it will be made of parachute material to prevent tearing and one additional flag will also be given to the officials. Requesting anonymity, one of the officials said, “These all projects are being carried out for beautification of city and by October these will get completed. We wanted to complete these by August 15 but works got delayed. Now, in the next two months these will get completed at any cost.” He said lighting at Jagraon Bridge and 100 feet tall national flag will cost Rs 86 lakh while four statues will cost Rs 84 lakh. He claimed that beautification of MC office is complete. However, the residents reactions are mixed — while stating that beautification is important, they also insisted that authorities should first provide better civic amenities to the residents. A resident of Model Town, Maninder Bedi, said, “It is good that civic body is thinking about beautification of the city, especially the statues. But first fix the roads and provide clean drinking water to the residents.” He said the lights will no doubt look beautiful but when people will pass from potholed roads then they will not be thankful to officials for beautification. Another resident from civil city Gurvinder Kaur said these statues should be shifted from roads to some museum or indoor place because martyrs and freedom fighters do not get enough honour. She said beautification should be done at that place where these statues should be shifted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ludh-gets-cracking-on-beautification-goals-statues-to-come-up-near-jagraon-bridge/articleshow/85314725.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Police suspect involvement of common robbers in Aurangabad, Jalna robbery cases||Aurangabad: Police teams probing two cases of daylight armed robberies at a beer bar in Jalna and a petrol pump in Aurangabad suspect involvement of common suspects in both the cases. The armed robbery of cash, liquor bottles and mobile phones of customers at the bar was committed on Wednesday at Shelgaon, a village on Mumbai-Nagpur highway. This was followed by a daylight robbery at an Aurangabad-based petrol pump in Maliwada from where they robbed Rs 1.26 lakh cash. In both the incidents, suspect robbers have been caught on CCTV cameras. A preliminary probe has revealed that the suspects stole a bike from Nanded before committing consecutive daylight robberies in these two districts. Jalna’s local crime branch inspector Subhash Bhujang said, “While working on the case, we found that these two suspects first stole a bike from Nanded before going on a robbery and theft spree along the highway passing through different districts.” The officer said that the possibility of these suspects committing some more property offences before striking at Jalna cannot be ruled out. Following an alert by Jalna police, their counterparts in Parbhani and Nanded have started checking for any minor property offences that these suspects might have committed after lifting the bike. Sources in the police said that the teams from Jalna and Aurangabad are already tailing the suspects who are feared of striking at other business establishments along the highway. An officer from Aurangabad city crime branch said that the suspects, from their body language, appear to be habitual offenders who are not locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-suspect-involvement-of-common-robbers-in-aurangabad-jalna-robbery-cases/articleshow/85309880.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Chandigarh||Civic body told to identify 10 spots for charging stations for e-vehicles||Ludhiana: To establish charging facilities for electric vehicles, the civic body has been asked to identify 10 suitable locations in the city by the transport department. A committee has been formed for this purpose and it will submit a report in the next two to three weeks. The use of electric vehicles has increased and many people are using e-bikes, e-rickshaws and even e-cars, said sources. Adequate charging stations are required if the authorities want to encourage the use of electronic vehicles to reduce pollution. A private firm will then check the viability and work on the total cost of the project for the implementation. The firm will bear the cost of entire project and profit will be shared with the owner of the land. While confirming the news, additional commissioner Aaditya Dacchalwal said, “The principal secretary transport department met virtually and asked us to first locate the sites where charging stations can be provided. So first we will check the land status. We prefer government land whether MC, Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority or any other government department.” Meanwhile, the MC also has plans to replace the pull carts with e-rickshaws. The garbage collectors who collect garbage from households will be given these e rickshaws to collect garbage from door to door. The officials are also planning to provide charging points for these e rickshaws in the zonal offices of MC. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabbarwal said tenders are also being floated for bringing mechanical sweeping machines under clean air programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/civic-body-told-to-identify-10-spots-for-charging-stations-for-e-vehicles/articleshow/85314756.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chandigarh||Bizmen welcome RoSCTL extension but urge centre to do more for boosting exports||Ludhiana: Central government’s notification on extension of Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) on exports is being welcomed by the exporters, but majority of them are of the view that government needs to do more to increase exports from India. The exporters are claiming that due to the fear of third wave of coronavirus in India and increase in number of coronavirus cases in the Western countries, slowdown has kicked in the export sector. In a statement issued on Friday on extension of RoSCTL scheme, Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), chairman A Sakthivel, said, “We are thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and commerce, industry and textiles minister Piyush Goyal for the notification to extend the RoSCTL scheme. With this, PM has taken the first step towards realising the target of $400 billion merchandise exports. The extension of RoSCTL till March 31, 2024, which was notified today, was approved by the Union cabinet on July 14 to make Indian textiles internationally competitive. The scheme will ensure refund of embedded taxes, cesses and duties. It will help increase exports of textiles and apparels, attract additional investment and provide direct and indirect jobs to lakhs of people, especially women.” According to Harish Dua, executive council member of AEPC, “We welcome the decision of the central government as it will add to the stability of the export policy of textiles. But at the same time government needs to take more steps at this moment, as slowdown in the exports sector is being witnessed due to the risk of third wave looming large in India and spurt in cases of the pandemic in other countries. Government should launch special Covid-19 package for exporters, which should include initiatives like capping the ocean freight on exports, introducing freight subsidy scheme for the exporters based in land locked states like Punjab and giving additional export incentives to manufacturers.” According to Vinod Thapar, chairman of the Knitwear Club, “RoSCTL extension will somewhat aid the ailing garment and textile exporters, but the Centre needs to do more to give required boost to the exports. Need of the hour is interest-free availability of short-term collateral-free credit for the exporters, which can provide required financial support to the exporters whose entire payment cycle has suffered due to lockdowns.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bizmen-welcome-rosctl-extension-but-urge-centre-to-do-more-for-boosting-exports/articleshow/85314848.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kochi||Kerala: 4 lakh new Covid cases likely by September 10, says report||KOCHI: Kerala, which has 2.6% of the country’s population and occupies 1.2% of the country’s land area is likely to add another 4.1 lakh cases by September 10, which is more than 50% of the estimated over 8 lakh new Covid cases projected for India, as per a new report. With increase in cases, the state is expected to contribute about 35 % of the total new Covid deaths in the country, ahead of Maharashtra that is expected to contribute about 21% deaths. “Covid-19: Wave 2: Trend Analysis and Projection” report prepared by Project Jeevan Raksha, a public-private partnership initiative of Proxima and Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), has been submitted to the state and central government. Every month, they have been coming out with projections and their accuracy so far in most states has been above 90%, including in Kerala. “High density of population is creating multiple challenges for the administration. All the 14 districts are equally affected which is a limitation to optimize the available limited resources. At this juncture, it is time for Kerala to use its community participation. It should become the driving force to enforce containment at the block level. In their own interest and the people around them, the local community leaders should drive 100% compliance of Covid-appropriate behavior,” said Mysore Sanjeev, convener, Project Jeevan Raksha. As on August 10, the state had 35,86,693 total confirmed Covid cases and 18,004 deaths. The projections show that post-Onam, the cases may go up if Covid management and micro-containment measures on the ground remain ineffective and inefficient, rising to a total of 40 lakh cases and 21,925 deaths. Kerala now on a daily basis sees 20,000-plus cases and its TPR is above 14%, with testing less than 1.5 lakh samples. On the positive side, like several states, under-reporting from Kerala is less “Last year, post-Onam there was a surge in Covid cases, with the state seeing a four-times increase in daily cases. From 1,800 cases per day it jumped to 7,600 per day after the festive season. This year, we are already at a very high plateau of 20,000-plus. But lots of things have changed now. Our susceptible population has significantly decreased from 90% to 50% and with vaccination, hospitalizations will hopefully be less. But unlike last Onam, when we had a milder Covid variant, this time we have three-times more transmissible delta variant. Double masking and avoiding closed spaces is key or we may cross the previous peak of 40,000 cases,” said Dr Padmanabha Shenoy, public health expert, who has been analyzing Covid patterns across India on a weekly basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/4l-new-covid-cases-likely-by-sept-10/articleshow/85312215.cms||Preetu Nair

Meanwhile, the three men arrested in the matter on Thursday night were released on bail on Friday. Among other things, the commission has sought information regarding the mental and physical well-being of the man’s daughter present with him during the assault and arrests made in the case so far. The commission has sought a response within a week. In its notice, the commission has further asked what action had been taken against the accused, who assaulted the person, besides how many persons had been arrested and sections under which the accused had been booked. The commission also asked about the preventive measures taken to avoid recurrence of such incidents in future to create an atmosphere of peace and communal harmony. “What action has been taken against the policemen in whose presence the person was being beaten up,” the commission questioned. Also, the Commission said that due to the incident, the rights of the child of the victim have been violated, and asked whether the mental and physical condition of the child has been evaluated after this incident. “If so, a detailed report may be furnished in this regard,” the Commission added. It went on to ask whether any statement of the child has been recorded. “A video clip of the same may also be furnished,” it stated further. Meanwhile, three persons, who were arrested on Thursday night for allegedly assaulting the 45-year-old man, accusing him of indulging in religious conversion in the Barra area of the city, were released on bail on Friday. “The three accused, Ajay Rajesh, Aman Gupta and Rahul Kumar, booked under sections 147, 323, 504 and 506 of IPC following a complaint by the victim Afsar Ahmed, have been released on bail,” said inspector Barra Harmeet Singh. He added, “As all the IPC sections are within the ambit of punishment less than seven years, all the three accused have been granted bail from the police station itself.” On Friday, Samajwadi Party national president and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav condemned the incident “of openly beating an innocent youth on the instigation of BJP”. “Such incidents are shameful for democracy. Law and order is completely destroyed in the state,” he added. The State Commission for Minorities has also expressed displeasure and wrote a letter to the police commissioner asking to reply in three days, and register a case and take strict action, besides providing security cover to the aggrieved family. To recall, a disturbing video clip of the incident showing the man’s little daughter crying and trying to cling with him and begging for mercy from a mob of assaulters, went viral on the social media on Thursday. Later, the police rescued the man and brought him to the police station. Police had said that the three main accused were arrested late Thursday night in connection with the Wednesday evening incident of assault and humiliation of Afsar Ahmed, an e-rickshaw driver. The Barra police had filed an FIR against a local man, who runs a marriage band, his son and around 10 unknown people based on a complaint by Afsar Ahmed. “Among whom, Ajay alias Rajesh Bandwala, Aman Gupta and Rahul Kumar were arrested,” police said. Meanwhile, in protest against the arrest of three persons, local activists reached DCP South office in the night and sat on a dharna. The officials assured them of a fair investigation following which they left. A woman resident of Kacchi Basti had accused her neighbours Saddam, Salman and one Mukul of molesting her daughter and getting her converted with the lure of Rs 20,000. The police had registered a case on July 31, but in the absence of evidence during preliminary investigation, the police did not file a section of conversion in the FIR. In protest against this, the local activists later created a ruckus at Ram Gopal crossing in Kachchi Basti in Barra on Wednesday evening. When Afsar, a relative of one of the molesters passed by with his seven-year-old daughter, the activists dragged and thrashed him severely. Later, a video of the incident also went viral. DCP South Raveena Tyagi later visited Afsar Ahmed’s house and met his daughter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-assault-case-minorities-panel-sends-notice-to-police-commissioner/articleshow/85316109.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Kochi||Kerala: Ex-officers get bail in Isro spy case||KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Friday granted anticipatory bails to two former Intelligence Bureau (IB) officers and two former officers of Kerala Police in the case over alleged frame-up of Isro scientist Nambi Narayanan in the 1994 espionage case. Granting them anticipatory bails, Justice Ashok Menon said the former officers should not be made to face a similar situation of being forced to undergo the ignominy of being incarcerated in prison for interrogation during old age after retirement for an incident that took place a quarter of a century ago. The court said there is no indication or material, apart from the rhetoric that a foreign power had a hand, and held that the petitioners are entitled to anticipatory bails. The officers are first accused Vijayan, second accused Thampi S Durgadutt, seventh accused RB Sreekumar, and 11th accused PS Jayaprakash. Vijayan was a special branch inspector at Vanchiyoor police station who allegedly submitted a report of overstaying by two Maldivian women and their links with Isro scientists. Durgadutt was the sub inspector of Vanchiyoor station who allegedly conducted the initial probe on the basis of the first accused’s report. Sreekumar, an IPS officer of Gujarat cadre who was part of IB, allegedly assisted the state police in the probe. Jayaprakash was a central intelligence officer who was part of the IB team that assisted the state police. A special investigation team headed by fourth accused Siby Mathews, who was DIG of Crimes, had conducted the probe and the IB officers were part of the team. In their anticipatory bail pleas, Sreekumar and Jayaprakash contended that they did not interrogate Nambi Narayanan. Vijayan and Thampi argued that they were junior officers who registered the case on reasonable suspicion of overstay by the Maldivian women and on suspicion of their links with high officials and scientists of Isro. All of them contended that they are retired and old. Assistant solicitor general SV Raju appeared for the CBI and advocate C Unnikrishnan represented Nambi Narayanan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-relief-for-four-former-cops/articleshow/85312350.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two days before Independence Day, cops seize over 50 pistols, ammo||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police's Special Cell has arrested four illegal arms traffickers and recovered 55 pistols and 50 live cartridges from them. One of the arrested men is a life convict, indicted in a kidnapping for ransom case and currently out on Covid-19 parole. Another was wanted in two murder cases in Delhi and Haryana. According to Sanjeev Yadav, DCP (Special Cell), the operations were carried in the span of a one week. Extensive watch was being kept on the gunrunners for the last fortnight in view of the security implications for the upcoming Independence Day celebrations. Technical and human surveillance were mounted. The focus was on groups based in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, particularly on the ones active in Khargone, Dhar, Sendhwa and Burhanpur areas. "Meanwhile, it transpired that a Firozabad-based arms supplier began actively providing illegal firearms to Delhi's criminals. On August 7, ACP Jasbir Singh's team received information about two UP-based arms suppliers coming with a large consignment of illegal weapons to a spot near Burari flyover in north Delhi," said DCP Yadav said. Accordingly, the cops prepared to intercept the two suspects, Rajveer and Dheeraj, at that spot. Subsequent to their nabbing, 25 pistols were recovered from them. Another team led by ACP Sanjay Dutt also arrested Vinod Bhola of Firozpur, UP, from the Najafgarh road and seized 10 pistols and 20 cartridges from him. Early on Friday, Dutt's team arrested another criminal named Dharmender, who had been supplying illegal weapons to gangs after acquiring them from Mewat and western UP. A cache of 20 pistols and 30 cartridges was recovered from him. The suspect was involved in a case of murder last year in Sohna City, Gurgaon, and another in southwest Delhi's Chhawla earlier this year. During interrogation, Rajveer disclosed that he was a truck driver and had come in contact with a weapon supplier from his village who lured him into the trade. He got Rs 8,000-10,000 per trip apart from fuel costs for ferrying the firearms. Dheeraj was a driver who worked on hire basis. Due to the Covid lockdown, he hadn’t been getting much work and so joined a gang on a per trip basis. Vinod had been arrested in 2007 for kidnapping a person for a Rs 20-lakh ransom and undergoing life sentence. He had got parole in April due to the pandemic. Vinod had ferried about four consignments of illegal firearms to different persons in Delhi in the six months he was involved in the racket. He procured illegal firearms and ammunition from big suppliers in Firozabad. He has been involved in more than a dozen criminal cases, including attempt-to-murder, abduction for ransom and under the Gangsters Act and Arms Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-days-before-i-day-cops-seize-over-50-pistols-ammo/articleshow/85312285.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Allahabad high court quashes detention of three cow-slaughter accused under NSA||LUCKNOW: Observing that “slaughtering a cow in the secrecy of one's own house probably because of poverty or lack of employment or hunger, would perhaps only involve a law and order, and not public order, issue,” Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has quashed a detention order passed under the National Security Act ( NSA) against three Sitapur residents, reports Ravi Singh Sisodiya. The court said that the three – Pervez, Irfan and Rahmatullah, who are brothers -- had been detained under the NSA for a solitary case under UP Cow Slaughter Act and that there was no evidence on record to show that they would repeat the crime on being released. The bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Saroj Yadav passed the order on August 5 allowing three habeas corpus writ petitions moved by Pervez, Irfan and Rahmatullah separately through another brother Imran and ordered their “release forthwith unless wanted in connection with some other criminal case”. The Sitapur police had booked the three under UP Cow Slaughter Act on July 12, 2020. According to the prosecution, the cops had acted on a tip-off by an informer who told them that beef was brought to the house of Rahmatullah and his brother after slaughtering a cow elsewhere. Two butchers had then made small pieces for selling. The accused could be caught on the spot if police acted swiftly, the informer had told the cops. On the basis of this information, a police party raided the house of Rahmatullah and found that five persons were cutting the lump of beef in small pieces. As soon as the police entered the house, they tried to flee, the prosecution said, adding “however, Irfan and Pervez were arrested on the spot. The two revealed the name of Rahmatullah and two other coaccused.” Thereafter, all accused were booked under the Gangster and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act and the police and administration moved to book them under NSA as well on August 14, 2020. Challenging the detention order, the petitioners’ counsel Narendra Gupta pleaded that it was not justified as NSA was slapped on the basis of a solitary incident where there was no material to infer that they might repeat the act. The state counsel pleaded that NSA could be imposed even on the basis of a single case and it is the subjective satisfaction of authorities on which detention order is passed. Considering that the accused were nabbed inside house while chopping the beef, the bench observed, “An act of slaughtering a cow in secrecy of one’s own house probably because of poverty would perhaps involve a law and order issue and could not be said to stand on the same footing where a number of cattle have been slaughtered in public view or an incident where aggressive attack is made by the slaughterers against the complaining public, which may involve infractions of public order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-quashes-detention-of-three-cow-slaughter-accused-under-nsa/articleshow/85316131.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Delta-plus toll in Maharashtra rises to five, all had comorbidities||MUMBAI: Deaths linked to the Delta-plus variant of coronavirus rose to five in Maharashtra as the state’s public health department confirmed three more fatalities from Ratnagiri, Raigad and Beed on Friday. The toll includes two deaths from Ratnagiri and one each from Mumbai, Raigad and Beed. Caused by a mutation of the virulent Delta strain, Delta-plus infections in the state touched 66 with one addition from Thane on Friday. All deceased, three men and two women, were above the age of 65 years and with multiple comorbidities. Two were fully vaccinated, two others had not received a single dose while the immunisation status of the fifth is under investigation. In a week’s time, the state’s Delta-plus tally has jumped from 21 to 66. Officials, however, said some of the deaths and cases dated back to June, and their genome sequencing reports have only just arrived. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said there was no reason to panic as the deaths were among those with comorbid conditions. “It is important to understand that Delta is still the dominant strain accounting for over 80% cases and vaccines can protest against Delta,” he said, adding people should continue to wear masks and maintain physical distance. On the spread of Delta-plus, immunologist Dr Vineeta Bal from the from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune said the strain doesn’t seem to be overtaking Delta the way Delta overpowered the Wuhan strain. But the scenario will be clear when more samples are sequenced. Both Ratnagiri deaths have been reported from the Sangameshwar taluka. The latest victim was a 73-year-old with a history of diabetes and hypertension. His symptoms surfaced on May 11 and he was hospitalised on May 26. He passed away on May 29 at Mumbai’s St George Hospital during treatment. His vaccination status is being investigated. District officials said he had a history of fever, breathlessness and loose motions at the time of hospitalisation. The state’s first Delta-plus death, reported in June, was also from Sangameshwar, where the victim was an 80-year-old. The district has also reported a dozen cases of Delta-plus, at least ten from Sangameshwar alone. The deceased from Raigad was 69 years old who was detected with Covid-19 in July and passed away on July 22 after 17 days of hospitalisation. A former journalist and resident of Nagothane, he had a history of diabetes and was vaccinated with both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine in May. “His oxygen levels were low and it was difficult to administer Remdesivir to him. He had low blood pressure and blood sugar level was fluctuating,” said Dr Suhas Mane, civil surgeon, Raigad, adding that four of his contacts have tested Covid positive and are recuperating. The district has reported two Delta-plus cases, including the journalist and a 44-year-old teacher from Uran who has recovered now. Both were fully vaccinated with Covishield. She didn’t require hospitalisation and five of her contacts have tested Covid positive and have been isolated. The 66 cases are spread over 17 districts but the highest have been reported from Jalgaon (13), Ratnagiri (12) and Mumbai (11). In certain districts like Gondia that have two positive cases, the officials said a full contact tracing operation has been started although the cases were from June. Both Delta-plus cases in Gondia were of women, who are housewives and between 18-44. One of them had a visitor from Hyderabad, officials said. Both patients in Palghar have recovered. One of the positive cases in Palghar was a pregnant woman. In Mumbai, 7 of the 11 cases reported to BMC this week were women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deaths-linked-to-delta-plus-variant-rise-to-5-in-maha/articleshow/85316128.cms||Umesh K Parida

---||Mumbai||Flights to non-metros soar at Mumbai airport||MUMBAI: Unlike other metros, Mumbai with its congested single-runway airport offered a rather poor choice of direct flights to several Tier-II cities, pre-pandemic. With new work, travel and leisure trends in the past one year, though, flights to non-metros have become increasingly prominent on the city airport’s radar. Till July this year, 64% of the passengers who passed through Mumbai airport were travelling to or returning from a non-metro on a direct flight, said a Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson. After the lull in domestic travel brought on by the due to Covid-19 second wave in summer, non-metro routes are back this month with the launch of four weekly direct flights from Mumbai to Bareilly and the relaunch of 18 weekly direct flights to Tier-II cities of Ajmer, Porbandar, Tirupati and Vishakhapatnam. Last month, Gwalior had joined Mumbai airport’s direct flight list.“Between January and July, Mumbai airport handled over 75 lakh domestic passengers, of whom over 48 lakh were flying to or from about 60 non-metros,” said a Mumbai International Airport ltd (MIAL) spokesperson. These included leisure travellers and passengers flying between home and their work city as is evident from the top three non-metro destinations out of Mumbai during this period—Goa, Ahmedabad and Varanasi, that is. But metro airports were the traffic kingpins with the overall top three domestic destinations out of Mumbai being Delhi, Goa and Bengaluru. Kapil Kaul of Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, an aviation consultancy firm said, “Non-metro to metro routes are increasingly seeing more flight deployment during COVID. Prior to Covid, flight operations from Mumbai, especially to non-metros were significantly constrained due to capacity shortage.” The spike in demand for flights to non-metros began last year after domestic flights were restarted on May 25 following a two-month ban. In the new normal, business travel was negligible, metro to metro travel was down as flights packed migrants fleeing cities for their homes in tier-IIs realigned domestic air traffic pattern. According to Airports Authority of India statistics, the Tier-II destinations recovered faster, they registered a lower drop in passenger traffic as compared to the metros by the end of last fiscal. For instance, while Mumbai airport saw a 71% drop in passenger traffic in 2020-21 as compared to the previous year, the corresponding drop was 57% for Lucknow, 51% for Ranchi and Raipur, 48% for Varanasi, 40% for Patna, 25% for Gorakhpur, 13% for Pathankot, and so on. Kaul said, “We will see more operations to non-metros as Mumbai airport now has capacity available and airlines like IndiGo are keen to broaden their network. “Prior to Covid, Mumbai airport’s lone runway handled about 950 flights in 24 hours. Today, it handles an average of 300 flights, less than a third of its capacity. A low-cost airline official said, “Regional connectivity scheme never really took off in Mumbai due to airport slot constraints. People bound for non-metros had to transit via Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata etc with no direct flights to smaller cities. But Covid has changed that, for now at least.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/flights-to-non-metros-soar-at-mum-airport/articleshow/85316152.cms||---

---||Delhi||Court orders Rs 2.5 lakh in interim relief to kin of 9-year-old; Delhi Police say no proof yet of rape||NEW DELHI: There was no eyewitness statement or evidence, including medical or scientific, that could be collected so far to confirm that the 9-year-old girl was raped before she was allegedly killed and cremated at Delhi Cantonment, Delhi Police told a city court on Thursday. The investigating officer (IO) said that the disclosure statements of the four accused have revealed that the accused Radhey Shyam, the priest of the crematorium, and Kuldeep Singh had allegedly raped and killed the minor girl. The other two accused, Salim Ahmad and Laxmi Narayan, had helped them cremate the deceased child. However, disclosure statements before the police are not admissible in court, unless supported by other evidence. “The IO has further admitted that neither any statement of eyewitnesses nor any evidence, including medical or scientific, could be collected so far to confirm as to whether the victim child was raped or not. He has further submitted that at this stage, he cannot conclusively say as to whether the victim child was raped or not,” Additional Sessions Judge Ashutosh Kumar said in the order. The police officer further stated that as per the postmortem report of the child’s body, “No definite opinion can be ascertained concerning any sexual assault or the cause of death, but it is clear that the body was burnt after her death.” Meanwhile, the judge said an interim compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh should be immediately disbursed to the girl’s family by the New Delhi Legal Services Authority under the Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme. The court, however, added that given the submissions of the IO, the additional interim compensation on the grounds of the alleged rape is not allowed at this stage. “However, liberty is granted to move a fresh application to that regard, in case the investigating agency collects further material or comes to the conclusion that the victim child was raped,” it said. The accused have been booked under sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape), 341 (wrongful restraint), 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and SC/ST Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-orders-rs-2-5l-in-interim-relief-to-kin-of-9-yr-old-police-say-no-proof-yet-of-rape/articleshow/85312353.cms||Usha Das

Law minister Malay Ghatak and Trinamool MP Santanu Sen are already camping there. The leaders met the families of five Trinamool workers “detained politically” by Khowai police and called for restoration of democracy in Tripura. The leaders will celebrate Independence Day in Tripura and on August 16, observe Khela Hobe Diwas, sending out signals that the BJP bastion was Trinamool’s next target. “Several football matches have been planned. We are trying to rope in as many clubs in Tripura as possible for Khela Hobe Diwas,” Ghatak said. He hinted that “a mega joining” of politicians from other parties would soon be held in Tripura. Sen, Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha MP now camping in Agartala, said several senior Congress leaders joined Trinamool on Friday and added that even a BJP Mahila Morcha leader had switched allegiance. “We will have a mega show on Independence Day. Flags will be hoisted at various blocks by Trinamool workers. We will build organisations in all the 3,238 booths in Tripura. Our party workers will ensure an end to BJP’s misrule,” Sen said. Education minister Basu appealed to Left supporters to join Trinamool. He said the BJP was creating a reign of terror in Tripura and the people of the state were looking up to TMC for deliverance. Meanwhile, BJP leaders in Tripura organised Dhikkar Diwas in Agartala on Friday to deplore remarks of Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee who had alleged that the attack on Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee was orchestrated following orders from Union home minister Amit Shah.

---||Vadodara||BJP, Congress demand probe into previous allotments||Vadodara: The chorus for an extensive inquiry into the allotments of houses under various housing schemes in the city grew louder on Friday. Leaders from both the opposition Congress and the ruling BJP have sought the probe. Since the issue of changing the lists of beneficiaries to accommodate names suggested by influential elected representatives came to light, many in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) had been suggesting that this might have happened earlier too. The names that were picked up in the draw on August 7 were subsequently changed by executive engineer Pramod Vasava and MIS operator Nishith Pithwa. They claimed that they did so under pressure. On Friday, the city unit of the Congress party gave a memorandum to the municipal commissioner seeking a comprehensive inquiry in the affairs of housing schemes. These range from draws over the years, delay in completion of projects, expenses above estimates on some schemes and other issues. But minister of state for urban housing and Narmada, Yogesh Patel, sprung a surprise on Friday. At an event in the city that was also attended by other BJP leaders including Mayor Keyur Rokadiya, Patel suggested in his speech that draws over the years should be looked into. “Many keep paying deposits repeatedly, but do not get a house even after five or six draws. The VMC should not only hold an inquiry, but take strict action,” Patel said. He added that he had discussed the issue with the chief minister who had said that a detailed inquiry will be done. Executive engineer Vasava suspended Vadodara: Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s executive engineer Pramod Vasava was suspended by the civic body and an inquiry will be held against him. The civic body has also sacked the MIS operator Nishith Pithwa.

---||Mumbai||UAE top spot for Indian students, Canada beats US to second place||Mumbai: The United Arab Emirates is home to the largest population of Indian students outside of their home country. Canada is a close second. And long-favourite America, after years of unfriendly visa regulations and unpopular policies for international students, has not only seen a decline in fresh enrolment but a compounding drop in the total Indian student population too. A total of 1.2 million Indian students are now studying in campuses abroad, more than twice the number that flew out a decade ago. Over time, therefore, the age to fly out has also gotten lower. Consultant Maria Mathai explained the subtle distinction between the two kinds of international students. Traditionally, they are those who fly away from family and home to join a campus beyond the borders of their country. “But many of the students in UAE or Saudi Arabia are those who have joined a campus there as their parents are working in those countries,” she explained. Then there are Indian universities that have set up campuses in the UAE and offer Indian students a two-campus experience. Under such an arrangement, students join the international campus towards the fag end of their degree programme. Post-school education has taken on a new meaning, experts say, from the times when last-benchers would be coiled in silence and aimlessly loitering in corridors to now, when few do not have a planned career for which they are preparing years in advance. An international degree, the diversity of classes and a taste of freedom, both academic and personal, are among the pulls of a foreign campus. And then, the intense competition to get a seat in a blue-chip Indian institutes also pushes many out. “Canada is a top destination for high-quality, globally recognised education in an open, tolerant, safe and multicultural environment. Our colleges are leaders in applied higher education, offering a variety of recognised credentials including university transfer programs, academic and applied degrees, and post-graduate diplomas,” Amanda Strohan, deputy high commissioner of Canada to India told TOI. She added that India is now the top source country for foreign students studying in Canada. A student-centric approach, flexibility for students, and innovative programmes to collaborate with industry offer an important headstart for students striving to become the leaders of tomorrow. All that, said Strohan, makes Canada one of the most preferred education destinations in the world. As numbers spiralled for Canada, USA, after years of falling student intake, saw an overall drop in the total population. “The Trump administration’s adverse immigration policies, which were not welcoming of students, pushed them to other countries like Canada, Australia, UAE. Also, students with a tighter budget also prefer the UAE, apart from the fact that with the large Indian expat community, a relative or friend is easy to reach out to in case of an emergency,” said education counsellor Karan Gupta.

He issued notices to the state survey, settlements and land records commissioner and four other survey officials in Hyderabad in a second contempt petition filed in respect of 40 acres of land at Lothukunta in Malkajgiri mandal. The judge, while hearing a second contempt petition filed by M Narasaiah of Shanta Sriram Constructions, also suspended the notice issued by the survey commissioner and his officials. The judge earlier held that the vendors of the construction company who gave their land for development to the company had proven rights over the land.  He said the state government and its revenue officials were trying to take away their land in survey numbers 1 and 2 of Lothukunta deceitfully by trying to eclipse an entire village from the records. The judge also ordered redelivery of possession of land to the vendors.  A contempt plea was filed last week by the company because the officials did not deliver the possession despite an order from the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-notice-to-land-records-chief/articleshow/85312362.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The vigilance sleuths seized Rs1.43 crore in cash, fixed deposit of Rs20 lakh and Rs53 lakh deposited in 15 separate bank accounts, gold and silver ornaments worth over Rs67 lakh. They also unearthed movable and immovable assets worth more than Rs1.47 crore amassed by the engineer in the name of his wife Rajni Kumari Sinha and two children besides his own. Armed with a search warrant after registering a disproportionate assets (DA) case against him on August 11, a vigilance team led by DSPs Sarvesh Kumar Singh, Aditya Raj, Pawan Kumar and Vikash Kumar Srivastava (probation) raided the engineer’s three-storey private residence, ‘Rajiya Niwas’, at Mohanpur in Punaichak locality of the state capital at 9.30am. The raid was going on till late evening. Ravindra was recently transferred from the road construction department at Hajipur in Vaishali district to the BRPNNL. The vigilance sources said they have also found two bank accounts, a PPF account and life insurance of Rs52.9 lakh in Kumar’s name. “Two bank deposits, a recurring deposit and a PPF account having Rs29.3 lakh have been found in his wife’s name. Life insurance investments worth Rs11.5 lakh have been found in the name of Kumar’s two children,” a source said. They said Kumar owns a 25.9 decimals plot at Jantipur, purchased in December 2015. Its deed price is Rs6.43 lakh. “A plot of 35.56 decimals at Kanhauli was purchased for Rs30.73 lakh in May 2014. Two plots of overall 65 decimals of Rs25.28 lakh was purchased at Vilaay in May 2013 in his wife’s name,” another senior officer said. He said three separate plots of 3.5 decimals, 3.74 decimals and 2.49 decimals of Rs4.95 lakh, Rs28.12 lakh and Rs18.75 lakh deed value in Danapur was purchased in his wife’s name in June 2008, March 2019 and May 2019 respectively. The vigilance sleuths had to requisition a currency counting machine from a nearby bank for counting the huge cash. “An evaluator has been called to weigh ornaments and tell their exact value. We will be able to tell the exact value of items recovered and seized only after completing the raid,” a senior vigilance officer said, preferring anonymity. He said besides cash, ornaments and passbooks of different bank accounts and life insurance documents, they are searching land deeds. The engineer said these were kept somewhere else, he said. Sources said the vigilance started gathering information about his assets in October 2019. They said his earnings from salary since joining service on August 4, 2004, is Rs1.21 crore, which includes Rs1.85 lakh loan. “At FIR stage, he was found to be in possession of immovable properties worth Rs1.23 crore and movable assets worth Rs98.86 lakh. His son and daughter study in a noted private school in Patna,” another officer said. He said Kumar’s estimated savings had been around Rs 73.85 lakh against the income of Rs1.21 crore. “Another plot of 15.62 decimal valued Rs8.75 lakh was purchased in his wife’s name at Bihta in March 2018,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/raid-on-engineer-in-patna-yields-cash-assets-worth-rs4-3cr/articleshow/85315059.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Announcing the judgment, additional district and sessions judge Subhash Singh imposed a fine of Rs 50, 000 on the convict and if he fails to deposit the sum, his prison term would be increased by another two months. In addition, the court ordered payment of Rs 40,000 to the survivor as compensation from the fine recovered from the accused. According to the prosecution, the girl had eloped with Akram alias Lalla from Galshaheed area of Moradabad in February 2018. Her father had registered an FIR against him for abduction. The girl was rescued from another city a week later. The youth had consummated the relationship. As she was a minor, it was an offence. Medical tests proved the same. A chargesheet was filed against Akram by police under IPC sections 363 (abduction), 366 (inducing woman to compel her marriage), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 376 (rape) along with Provisions of the the Pocso Act. Judge Subhash Singh found Akram to be guilty and sentenced him to 10-year RI besides slapping him with a Rs 50,000 fine.

---||Kochi||Deep, deathless shame can delay filing of complaint in rape case, says Kerala high court||KOCHI: When a woman is raped, a deep sense of deathless shame is caused to her rather than the physical injuries and this may make her reluctant to disclose the crime, the Kerala high court said citing a 1980 Supreme Court judgment by Justice VR Krishna Iyer. Justice V Shircy cited the notable judgment (Rafiq vs State of UP) by Justice Krishna Iyer, which prompted courts to look beyond physical injuries in rape cases, to point out that the victim of rape may be reluctant to file a complaint and such a delay need not be fatal to the prosecution case. In the judgment, Justice Shircy said, “When a woman is ravished, a deep sense of deathless shame is caused to her rather than the physical injuries. No doubt rape is one of the most heinous atrocities committed on a woman in our society. Sometimes she could not reveal her ordeal to anyone. The fear of social stigma, concern about the honor of the family, the family life leading by her, etc would make a woman extremely reluctant in disclosing an incident of rape. Of-course in criminal cases, one of the cardinal principles is registration of earliest information to set law into motion. But if plausible and credible explanation for the delay in lodging the complaint is there, it may not be fatal to the prosecution case. Therefore, mere delay in lodging the complaint cannot be considered as a strong ground to throw away the case of complainant.” The observation was made by the court while dismissing the anticipatory bail plea of 55-year-old CC Johnson of Muringoor in Chalakkudy, who is a pastor and trustee of Emperor Emmanuel Church at Mooriyadu and is accused of raping a woman during a house visit for prayers. The alleged incident occurred in 2016 while a complaint was filed only this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/deep-deathless-shame-can-delay-filing-of-plaint-in-rape-case-hc/articleshow/85312505.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal govt refused to share Ghatal master plan cost, says Suvendu Adhikari||MIDNAPORE: Leader of the opposition in Bengal assembly Suvendu Adhikari came down heavily on the Trinamool Congress government “for trying to pin the blame” of non-implementation of the Ghatal master plan on the Centre. “The master plan for flood control in vast stretches of Midnapore, Hooghly and Howrah could not materialise because the state government refused to share expenditure on a 50:50 basis. The state didn’t even acquire land for the project,” Adhikari said here on Friday, while inaugurating a football tournament organised by the Sabuj Sangha Club. The BJP MLA’s remarks come days after chief minister Mamata Banerjee asked Trinamool MPs from Midnapore and two state ministers — Soumen Mahapatra and Manas Bhunia — to meet the Union irrigation minister in Delhi and secure requisite sanction for the project. “People had come forward to offer land for the Keleghai-Kapleshwari-Bagui river project because I took the initiative to convince them. This didn’t happen for the Ghatal master plan,” he said. Adhikari also took a dig at the Trinamool government for “complaining about paucity of funds” to take up the project. “The CM gives Rs 1,200 crore as imam bhata. She gives Rs 700 crore to the clubs. She could have allocated Rs 1,200-1,300 crore from her own resources for the Ghatal master plan,” he said. On state water resources minister Bhunia’s comment that the Centre didn’t release its own share of funds despite a “technical go-ahead” to the master plan when Uma Bharati was the Union minister, Adhikari said: “There are two parts for sanction of a project. One is technical and the other financial. Let th.e CM and the water resources minister sit together and sort out the issue.” Kicking off the football tournament, the BJP leader said the programme was organised by the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Memorial Trust. “This is not a copy-paste of the Trinamool programme on the day of the ‘Great Calcutta Killings’ of August 16, 1946,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-refused-to-share-ghatal-master-plan-cost-suvendu/articleshow/85312396.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Pune||Corporators demand funds as Pune Municipal Corporation’s income increases||PUNE: Corporators across party lines have demanded more funds from the Pune Municipal Corporation for ward-level work after the revenue of the civic body increased in the last four months. The civic administration had introduced cuts in the municipal budget due to pandemic-induced revenue loss. The corporators have demanded cancellation of budget cuts as the PMC’s income has increased. The demand assumes significance ahead of the municipal elections scheduled early next year. “We have asked the civic administration to issue tenders for municipal works at the earliest. The civic projects proposed by corporators should be taken up on priority,” said Hemant Rasane, standing committee chairman. Around 40 % cuts were proposed in th last financial (2020-2021) after the pandemic started. The lockdown had severely affected the civic body’s revenue. But the situation has marginally improved now. The civic body data shows that the PMC has earned around Rs2,500 crore in the last four months. Nearly Rs1,300 crore is available in the PMC’s kitty. Around 30% cuts have been proposed and are being implemented. The spending on second priority works was kept on hold and priority was given to urgent projects,” said a senior official of the PMC. “A strict monitoring of funds’ utilisation is necessary. Many political leaders wish to spend money on projects just to become popular. It should be avoided,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizen group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/corporators-demand-funds-as-pmcs-income-increases/articleshow/85315050.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Congress legislators from urban areas meet Sidhu, seek power at Rs 3/unit||Chandigarh: Congress MLAs from urban areas met PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday and suggested giving financial relief for urban voters by way of cheaper electricity at Rs 3 per unit, with 300 units free, besides a one-time settlement scheme for regularisation of plots. In a three-hour meeting, they discussed financial losses and hardships faced by people in urban areas during the Covid-19 lockdown and low demand in markets. They raised issues of electricity supply, snapping of connections, outstanding bills, besides regularisation of buildings and plots with demand for a one time settlement for residential and commercial buildings, said a party spokesperson. The meeting concluded with a consensus that the party and government must act towards a priority agenda to give relief to urban people. Foremost among them was demand for 300 units of free power to all domestic consumers including general category, 24-hour supply of power, decreasing rate of power to 3 Rs per unit for domestic consumer and 5 Rs per unit for commercial and industrial consumers. This is above and beyond the 10,000-crore power subsidy already provided by Punjab, unlike Delhi which provides only 1,700 crores as power subsidy. The MLAs demanded that the state government should immediately provide relief through one-time settlement in cases of regularisation of plots and building, extending the scheme for regularisation of colonies and easing burden of NOC for registration of property, asking the PCC president to raise it with the government at an appropriate form. Cabinet ministers Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Sunder Sham Arora were present. Health minister Balbir Singh too attended the meeting but left early as Sidhu was running late. PPCC working presidents Pawan Goyal and Kuljit Singh Nagra were present in the meeting and “formulated party’s strategy to solve the issues closest to the heart of people of urban Punjab.” Cabinet ministers Brahm Mohindra, Manpreet Singh Badal and O P Soni did not attend the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-legislators-from-urban-areas-meet-sidhu-seek-power-at-rs-3/unit/articleshow/85315100.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mall rules eased in Mumbai: Under-18 can visit, one shot enough for staff||MUMBAI: Those below 18 years of age who are not vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus will be allowed to enter malls in Mumbai from Sunday. However all adults will be required to have two doses of the vaccine and a gap of 14 days after that for entering malls. However the staff of malls can enter malls even if they have just one dose of their Covid-19 vaccination. “However all shops and establishments will have to display the vaccination status of all their employees prominently stating how many of the staffers have taken the first dose and when the second dose is due. Since there is no vaccination for those below 18, we can't prevent them from going into malls,” said Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Chahal. “But for customers we will be very strict and only allow those who have taken two doses of Covid-19 vaccination to enter malls. However for staff we the first dose for now will be enough and as soon as they are due for the second dose, they must get fully vaccinated. The vaccination status will have to be displayed inside the premises. Since there is no vaccination for those below 18, we can't not let them enter malls,” Chahal said. Chahal said that nightclubs and discos will continue to remain shut. “All these places that operate beyond 10 pm will remain shut. I have made these suggestions to the state government and they will be incorporating them,” Chahal said. The Maharashtra government on Wednesday allowed malls to reopen with 50% capacity from August 15 for people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that people can visit malls only 14 days after they take their second dose. The timings of shops and restaurants have also been extended to 10pm. Earlier, shops and eateries were allowed to operate only till 8pm and 4pm respectively. The state government will soon come out with detailed standard operating procedures (SoP) for these establishments. Earlier Public Health Minister Rajesh Tope had said that it would be compulsory for the staff of these establishments to be fully vaccinated. With cases plateauing for over two months, there was pressure on the MVA government to relax curbs. Based on the Covid task force’s recommendations, CM Uddhav Thackeray had resisted extending restaurant timings until now. But once access to local trains was allowed, pressure to open up more sectors intensified. In fresh relaxations of Covid restrictions in the state, shops, salons, gyms, spas have also been allowed to remain open till 10pm. However, multiplexes and places of worship will stay closed. Tope said the state has laid emphasis on giving more relaxations to those who are fully vaccinated as it encourages vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mall-rules-eased-under-18-can-visit-one-shot-enough-for-staff/articleshow/85316167.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

I want to bring to the notice of the government that you are lucky that this Bill has been passed. You are now in a position to declare Dhangars as a scheduled tribe. Do it immediately and let the Dhangars which are socially, economically and educationally backward, enjoy the benefits of ST as early as possible,” Sardinha said while addressing a press conference at Congress’ South Goa district office, Margao. He further voiced his opposition to the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill that was passed in the Assembly recently. Pointing out to the huge pendency of cases under mundcarial and tenancy Acts that are lying in revenue courts, Sardinha advocated early resolution of the cases. As regards the study that detected presence of microplastics in tap water, Sardinha said that the government should ensure that water supplied to people should be “as pure as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-should-now-declare-dhangars-as-scheduled-tribe-sardinha/articleshow/85316183.cms||---

All the parakeets were released in Amangarh tiger reserve. Both types of parakeets are listed under Schedule IV of the Wildlife (Protection) Act. Chicks are often stolen from nests to be sold to customers who can raise them as pets and teach them to mimic sounds or sentences. The Alexandrine are better speakers than the Rose-ringed parakeets. M Semmaran, Bijnor divisional forest officer, said, "On a tip-off, a joint team raided a house at Dariyapur village under Najibabad forest range on Thursday. We have rescued 184 parakeets. A woman, Dana Devi, was arrested while her son, Dheeraj Kumar from Gallamandi village of Sitapur district, fled the scene. The accused are from Sitapur but reside here for trapping birds.

But metro airports were the traffic kingpins with the overall top three domestic destinations out of Mumbai being Delhi, Goa and Bengaluru. Kapil Kaul of Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, an aviation consultancy firm, said, “Non-metro to metro routes are increasingly seeing more flight deployment during Covid. Prior to Covid, flight operations from Mumbai, especially to non-metros, were significantly constrained due to capacity shortage.” The spike in demand for flights to non-metros began last year after domestic flights were restarted on May 25 following a two-month ban. In the new normal, business travel was negligible, metro to metro travel was down as flights packed migrants fleeing cities for their homes in Tier-IIs. This realigned domestic air traffic pattern. According to Airports Authority of India statistics, the Tier-II destinations recovered faster and they registered a lower drop in passenger traffic as compared to the metros by the end of the last fiscal. For instance, while Mumbai airport saw a 71% drop in passenger traffic in 2020-21 as compared to the previous year, the corresponding drop was 57% for Lucknow, 51% for Ranchi and Raipur, 48% for Varanasi, 40% for Patna, 25% for Gorakhpur, 13% for Pathankot, and so on. Kaul said, “We will see more operations to non-metros as Mumbai airport now has capacity available and airlines like IndiGo are keen to broaden their network.” Prior to Covid, Mumbai airport’s lone runway handled about 950 flights in 24 hours. Today, it handles an average of 300 flights, less than a third of its capacity. A low-cost airline official said, “Regional connectivity scheme never really took off in Mumbai due to airport slot constraints. People bound for non-metros had to transit via Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata etc with no direct flights to smaller cities. But Covid has changed that, for now at least.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tier-ii-flight-destinations-see-faster-recovery-than-metros/articleshow/85312609.cms||---

A few metres away, the artists and the community children brightened a dreary wall with images of vibrant flowers. Ahead of Independence Day, Indra Kalyan Vihar is getting a makeover based on the theme of children's empowerment, education and joy. As part of Kailash Satyarthi Children Foundation's initiative, artists and volunteers are engaging community children to beautify the area by painting murals at 25 spots. With the wall paintings showcasing children reading or playing, the artwork seeks to signify hope, civil rights and freedom. Aiming to make the slum cluster beautiful and children-friendly, a group of volunteers has involved community children to paint the murals. The initiative titled ‘Rang Badlav Ke’ (the colour of change) is an event engaging volunteers and the community that also facilitates an interaction between artists and the local community while uplifting the community with bright, colourful images. A 16-year-old volunteer, Anika Somaia, raised the money and supplies for the initiative, while an artist, Aftab Ahmed Shah, and his team of students are painting walls and teaching the art to the children of the slum cluster. Rakesh Senger, executive director, Bal Mitra Mandal, Kailash Satyarthi Children Foundation, said, “The idea is to develop a community-based model and child-friendly society.” He added that due to the pandemic, only 25 walls were currently getting a makeover when the original plan was to brighten up the entire cluster. Prahalad Kumar Choudhary, a Class VIII student participating in the exercise, said, “We are delighted that our area is being beautified and we are also getting to learn painting.” A similar event was organised at Sanjay Camp in Chanakyapuri in October 2018 and over 3,000 walls there were painted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mural-of-the-story-empowering-kids-with-stories-of-hope-rights-freedom/articleshow/85312538.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Party leaders are making concerted efforts to let the ‘Khela Hobe’ slogan, which was its battle cry to “protect Bengal from outsiders” during the assembly elections, the new mantra for Bengal’s youth. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had thrown footballs at supporters who had assembled during the poll campaign. Trinamool leaders are not willing to heed a BJP appeal to shift the Khela Hobe programme to another date because it coincides with the ‘Great Calcutta Killings’ of August 16, 1946. Many were killed in the city as a part of the ‘Direct Action Day’ call of the Muslim League. Hakim said the CM had announced the programme from an entirely different perspective. “This was the day when 16 football fans died in a stampede during the East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match at Eden Gardens in 1980. We want to remember the football fans through the Khela Hobe programme,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-ready-to-kick-off-khela-hobe-in-144-kmc-wards/articleshow/85312531.cms||---

A bench of Justices U U Lalit and Ajay Rastogi allowed the plea of the court-appointed receiver to treat those unclaimed flats as unsold inventory. The court said a final notice should be given to those buyers and if they fail to respond within 15 days, the receiver can proceed to cancel the allotment. Senior advocate R Venkataramani, who as a court-appointed receiver, is managing the affairs of Amrapali group and exploring all options to raise the funds to complete the unfinished construction of its projects, told the bench that a substantial amount could be raised by selling those unclaimed flats. “The receiver and NBCC have made several joint efforts to reach out to all homebuyers... As an outcome of the exercise, it has emerged that about 9,538 homebuyers have neither registered so far in the customer data mentioned by the office of the receiver, nor have made any payments, subsequent to the judgement of the Supreme Court in July 2019,” he said. Venkataramani also informed the bench that around 6,210 homebuyers, though now registered in the customer data, were not making any payments to clear their dues and they should also be asked to pay the amount. Benami booking of flats in Amrapali was also highlighted by forensic auditors who had said in their reports that posh flats were booked on sums as low as Re 1, Rs 5 and Rs 11 per sq ft in the name of over 500 people. They had issued notices to 655 people on whose names these flats were booked, but no one was found in 122 such locations. Raising further hope for Amrapali’s 46,000 homebuyer, the receiver informed the court that it was hopeful of getting funds from banks as many financial institutions have in principle agreed to infuse funds in the projects with some conditions. “Meeting with 10 banking officials along with their counsel was convened on August 9. Though several queries were raised at the meeting, banks showed their inclination in principle to extend funding on a share basis. The banks however, desired few comfort level directions to facilitate and expedite the process of fundings,” he said. Venkataramani added that UCO Bank had said approximately 3,000 homebuyers’ home loans were being sanctioned and roughly Rs 300 crore would be made available. The court on the last hearing had assured the financial institutions that their investment would be secure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/10k-bogus-homebuyers-to-lose-amrapali-flats/articleshow/85312590.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Parliament panel questions Centre over curbing funds for Dalit scheme||CHANDIGARH: Non-allocation of funds for the scheme of special central assistance to scheduled castes sub-plan for want of utilisation certificates and annual action plan to Punjab has left the standing committee on social justice and empowerment, ministry of social justice and empowerment unamused. Special central assistance to scheduled castes sub-plan is a central government’s scheme under which 100% grant is provided to the states/UTs as an additive to their scheduled castes sub-plan (SCSP). The Centre had held back grant of 13 states, including Punjab, for non-submission of utilisation certificates and annual action plan. In a report submitted in the Lok Sabha, the committee questioned the rationale behind withholding the funds of states like Punjab having the highest percentage of scheduled caste population in the country. Expressing discontent, the committee further asked that if the states with large scheduled caste population are not getting assistance from the Centre to run the scheme, what is the purpose of running this scheme. The committee observed that the schemes running under SCSP in states having a higher number of scheduled caste population would be hampered if these states do not receive adequate funds from the Centre. Gauging the implications, the committee recommended that the Centre should not stop the release of funds totally for the entire year, but release a proportion of the allocation to the states with higher SC population. The states should be given a time period and “pursued vigorously” to submit utilisation certificates and annual action plans as required. In response, the ministry submitted that grants under the scheme are released to the state governments as per the extant guidelines according to which further grants cannot be released to the States/UTs if the utilization certificate is pending beyond a prescribed period. The ministry appraised the committee that the annual action plan has been submitted by the government of Punjab during 2020-21 and allocation has been made from the financial year 2018-19 and onward. Grave concern over water pollution The standing committee on water resources of Union ministry of jal shakti took a serious note of water pollution in the Ganga Canal flowing from Punjab to Rajasthan and containing harmful and untreated chemicals discharged by the industries located in Punjab. The committee noted that villages located in Ganganagar and adjoining areas are facing serious health problems due to consumption of this water. “This is a grave issue having direct bearing on the health and wellbeing of rural villagers who are using this water for consumption and number of cancer cases are reportedly increasingly day-by-day,” the committee said. Expressing “grave concern” over the issue, the committee urged the ministry to take up the matter with the government for installing water treatment plants in Ganganagar district of Rajasthan and adjoining areas to ensure supply of clean and potable drinking water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parl-panel-questions-centre-over-curbing-funds-for-dalit-scheme/articleshow/85315134.cms||Vinod Kumar

The decision by a division bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly came on a petition by Christian Association and Alliance for Social Action. The court said it cannot interfere with the certification of a film merely on how it was named. It was contended by the organization that sentiments of the Christian community in the state were hurt by the advertisements about the movie’s release with the tag line, ‘Not from the Bible’. However, the bench said it cannot entertain a petition based on such flimsy grounds. The tagline and the title make it clear that it is not from the Bible and the tagline has been used to avoid confusion among the people, the court said.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pil-against-release-of-movie-dismissed/articleshow/85312573.cms||---

The Coordination Committee of 8393 teachers declared that seven of their members had climbed atop the water tank at around 2am and threatened to commit suicide one by one if their demands are not met by August 15. Taking Mohali administration and police aback, teachers chose this way of protest demanding examinations for recruitment of primary teachers. After receiving information, police reached the site and asked the teachers to climb down. The organisation’s Punjab coordinator Sukhchain Singh Mansa said the education department had advertised 8,393 posts of pre-primary ,teachers for which exam was to be held on June 27, which was cancelled. Teachers demanded that the exam for recruitment to the post be held as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Mohali administration has issued orders to allow peaceful protests at four designated places in the district. District magistrate Girish Daylan said protests could be held at Dusshera Ground, Phase 8, Mohali, Panchayati land at Chappar Chiri Kalan village, Mohali, football ground at Darpan City, Kharar and the vacant land near Focal Point, Mubarakpur Road, Dera Bassi. The DM said that the organisers and individuals involved would be personally liable for compliance. Failure to adhere to these directions would attract criminal penalty in accordance with provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/teachers-defy-dm-orders-climb-water-tank-to-protest/articleshow/85312566.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Zilla parishad officials fret as highway eateries flout safety norms||PUNE: Zilla parishad health officials, village heads and activists have raised concerns over eateries situated along highways blatantly violating Covid-19 protocols. Rural Pune, which comprises 13 tehsils, is majorly contributing to the district’s overall Covid positivity rate and has remained under Level 4 restrictions, even as the Pune and the Pimpri Chinchwad municipal areas and the cantonments have eased restrictions. As things stand, bars, food courts and restaurants in rural Pune are permitted to operate till 4pm at 50% capacity for dine-in, while home delivery is allowed till 10pm. Officials said many dhabas and eateries along state and national highways in the district do now follow these norms. “We are consistently acting against bars, food courts and eateries operating past the deadline,” Pune rural Superintendent of Police (SP) Abhinav Deshmukh told TOI on Friday. “The fact that rural Pune’s positivity is close to 5% cannot be ignored. I will advise the district administration to take appropriate steps to further bring down the positivity rate through effective monitoring and exercise of safety protocol,” Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the state government and member of the Covid task force, said. Prafulla Bansode, who permanently closed his eatery in Narayangaon over financial distress, said the authorities must consider why the errant eateries were flouting norms, “The survival of many eatery owners is at stake owing to prolonged restrictions. Many are willing to face action and run their business just to survive,” he said. Focus on enhanced testing Pune ZP chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said, “Authorities of 12 tehsils have been told to step up daily testing to 2,500-3,000 from the prevailing 800-1,000 tests. Aggressive testing has been our strategy for long. As we have 100 hotspot villages — with 10 or more cases — we will continue this strategy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-officials-fret-as-highway-eateries-flout-safety-norms/articleshow/85315137.cms||Sandip Dighe

UDF councillors staged a protest in front of the corporation office raising the issue of bad condition of roads. The road where the incident happened in Mattancherry is under the corporation’s responsibility. “We are sorry for the incident and have asked authorities concerned to fill the pothole immediately. We have also asked the officials to identify roads with potholes. Not many of our roads are in bad condition. Corporation has also invited tenders for three roads which require repair works,” said public works standing committee chairperson Sunitha Dixon. Even as the public works standing committee chairperson claimed that direction has been issued to identify the roads where potholes have developed, the engineering officials denied receiving any such directive. Earlier also two people had lost their lives in similar incidents. An elderly woman died in 2019 when an auto rickshaw she was travelling fell in the pothole and toppled over. Same year a 23-year-old bike rider died after his bike hit a barricade which was placed to hide a pothole on the road in Palarivattom. Meanwhile, PWD officials in the district said the complaints they receive on the mobile app are mostly related to the bad condition of roads belonging to Kochi corporation. “Most of the complaints in the city are from Kadavanthra, Sahodaran Ayyappan road, Chittur road and other corporation roads in the city. “We have arranged road works for Rs 1 cr on Chittoor road from Kacheripday junction. We have asked officials to identify the roads which require repair works,” said the official. Both the officials and people’s representatives blamed rain, election and Covid for the delay in taking up road repair works. District road safety council member John said half of the problem is with the bikers or pillion riders. “There should not be potholes on the road and the authorities should ensure it. Meanwhile, riders should also wear helmets properly. Even if you are on a well laid road an animal crossing the road could cause an accident. Under such circumstances if the rider or the pillion rider have not worn a helmet properly, it could result in fatal injuries,” he said. Meanwhile, the number of pillion riders travelling without wearing helmets is very high. Motor vehicles enforcement department had imposed a fine on 480 pillion riders and 658 bikers for travelling without wearing a helmet in July alone. As many as 361 pillion riders and 265 bikers were fined in August so far. Enforcement officials said they will further intensify the drive against helmetless riding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/oppn-stages-protest-over-bad-roads/articleshow/85312572.cms||---

Once favourite destinations for families, especially on weekends, with children accompanying their parents and grandparents and making themselves merry, malls have now turned into sombre adult-only zones. “Throughout the week, we have had less than 10% footfalls compared to when we opened after lockdown last year. We don’t think there will be a significant rise in visitors until children and teenagers and are allowed to step inside malls,” said a manager at a city mall. Retailers whose target customer base comprise children are facing the brunt of the restriction. “After reopening earlier this week, hardly 20 visitors have walked in. The store used to bustle with children checking out new products, but now it is devoid of their chatter,” said an employee of a children retail-chain store in a mall in the city. No entry for children is a major drawback for parents as well. “We loved to frequent malls on weekends. But now we cannot leave children at home and go. We shall wait for relaxations in regulations,” said Rajat Saxena, a resident of Tingrenagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jab-rider-keeps-children-out-malls-rue-biz-loss/articleshow/85315132.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

More than 30 years down the line, we now have a 40,000-tonne vessel, country’s first indigenously designed and built aircraft carrier which has nearly 10 times larger displacement. The hangar deck of IAC, which will be named as INS Vikrant, has the size of two football fields combined and it can accommodate 20 fighter jets. The flight deck can house 10 aircraft. “IAC is a floating military base and it is a moving township,” says Commander Manoj Kumar, a naval architect who is involved in the project. “With the 21,000 tonne steel used in the ship we can build three Eiffel towers. The ship could generate power needed for half of Kochi city. It has 14 decks with 2,300 compartments designed for a crew of around 1,700 people. Its kitchen is equipped with many facilities, including equipment that could make 1,000 chapatis per hour. The medical unit has an ICU, X-Ray and CT scan machines,” he said. “The INS Vikrant will be fully ready by mid-2022. The successful completion of its maiden sea trial is a major achievement,” Vice-Admiral A K Chawla, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, SNC, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/iacs-maiden-sea-trial-a-key-milestone/articleshow/85312604.cms||---

BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra said: “We were expecting ridership to go up significantly next week when local trains start for the fully vaccinated general public. But it came to me as a surprise when I found that the daily ridership has already gone up to 25 lakh this week.” It is a jump of 2-3 lakh commuters a day in less than a week, sources said. The rise in ridership was mainly due to private offices opening up and having staggered timings for employees who are now travelling to their workplace. A section of commuters include labourers and workers from unorganised sectors whose numbers have also gone up lately. Also, there are no vaccine certificate checks in BEST, so it’s a “hassle-free” ride for many, said an official. “Commuters who have to go to office but have got just a single dose of vaccine will still be travelling by BEST buses as train travel requires compulsory double vaccine (and 15 days after last dose),” the official added. While railways are issuing monthly season passes and not daily tickets, those who want to travel occasionally from one part of the city to another will opt for the red buses. Statistics showed that BEST daily ridership dropped early this year, from 25 lakh in February to 16 lakh in March. It subsequently hit a low at 8 lakh daily commuters and the number grew to 21 lakh during the ‘Break the Chain’ mission of the state government from June. The daily ridership rose to over 22 lakh in July and in August, it touched 25 lakh. The BEST has, however, been directed by the government not to carry any standees in buses. With the ridership going up, the BEST needs to improve its frequency and deploy more buses on busy routes, else it will not be able to cater to the rush during peak hours and the situation could be chaotic once local trains resume services for the fully vaccinated general public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-daily-ridership-touches-25l-set-to-increase-further-next-week/articleshow/85315245.cms||Somit Sen

In a letter to Sidhu, Chadha said: “I will take this opportunity to remind you and beseech you to stop acting like a leader of an opposition party. You are not in the opposition anymore; you are the ruling party.” Chadha also claimed that Congress had removed its manifesto for 2017 assembly elections from its website. In the letter, Chadha wrote: “It has come to my notice that your party has craftily removed the copy of your 2017 manifesto from the official website. Not to worry, I am appending a copy of the same for your kind perusal, so that even if you cannot locate it yourself and be willing to implement the promises. I humbly urge you to get over with your playtime and finally deliver on the 129-page manifesto. Otherwise, it will become clear that your infighting within the Congress was a fight for power and not progress of Punjab.” Chadha also congratulated Sidhu for taking over as the new PPCC chief after a “long, arduous and amusing power struggle”. He said the government led by CM Amarinder Singh had been indifferent to the welfare of people and it was not incumbent upon Sidhu to respond to legitimate queries. “After assuming power in the state, the Congress government, in which you were a prominent minister, shrugged their duty to comply with the vast promises made during the election campaign,” said Chadha. Chadha also tweeted a copy of the letter and wrote: “My letter to @sherryontopp (Sidhu’s Twittr handle) imploring him to fulfil manifesto promises made by Congress in the 2017 elections. With patronage from Congress high command, unequivocal support of all MLAs i.e. the entire legislative group - Sidhu Saab is the undisputed leader of ruling party of Punjab.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-to-ppcc-chief-stop-acting-like-leader-of-oppn/articleshow/85315169.cms||---

Private hospitals would only keep some doses to vaccinate those visiting their sites, while a bulk of vaccinations may be held at government sites in the coming time,” he said. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, the medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, “We have still not bought additional doses. We shall use the remaining stock for second doses of nearly 70,000 people, expected to get the shots from our hospital after August 15.” He said the current number of first jabs being administered per day at the private hospital sites was around 100-130 and fewer people were expected to show up for first jabs at private sites after September second week. “For many private sites, the main vaccination drive will be over by September 15. Smaller number of vaccinations will then continue,” he said. Dr Jitendra Oswal, the deputy medical director of Bharati Hospital, said, “The hospital recently transferred almost 10,000 doses to other private vaccination centres in Pune, Baramati, Kolhapur, Sangli and New Mumbai at the same rate as the hospital had bought them because there were limited takers for paid doses and we had thousands.” Dr HK Sale, the executive director of Noble Hospital, said the hospital would procure more vaccine doses only if it fell short of second doses for its corporate beneficiaries. “We would continue the vaccination for public, but on a smaller scale,” he said. Dr Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, said the 12 small hospitals involved in the drive currently would reduce vaccine purchases by about 70%. “Nearly 50 small hospitals from Pune had been linked on CoWIN to start the drive. But recurrent issues in getting the doses and changing government policies caused 38 of them to drop out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-sites-likely-to-play-minimal-role-in-inoculation-from-mid-september/articleshow/85315187.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Hyderabad||Bharat Biotech’s nasal vaccine gets Phase-2 trials nod||HYDERABAD: India’s first intra-nasal Covid-19 vaccine candidate — BBV154, which is being developed by Bharat Biotech along with the Washington University in St Louis (WashU), has received approval from the drug regulator for conducting Phase-2 human clinical trials. The Union ministry of science & technology said the intransal replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus SARS-CoV-2 vectored vaccine has not only become the first nasal vaccine to have received regulatory approval for Phase-2 trials in India, it is also the first of its kind Covid-19 vaccine to undergo human clinical trials in India. Bharat Biotech has received regulatory approval for conducting a Phase-2 randomized, multi-centric, clinical trial of heterologous prime-boost combination of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152 (Covaxin) with BBV154 in healthy volunteers, the ministry said. Bharat Biotech recently completed Phase-1 clinical trials of the chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine on healthy volunteers in the 18-60 years age group. The ministry said the doses administered to volunteers in the Phase-1 trial were “well tolerated”. “No serious adverse events (were) reported. Previously, the vaccine was found to be safe, immunogenic and well tolerated in the pre-clinical toxicity studies. The vaccine was able to elicit high-level of neutralizing antibodies in animal studies,” it said. The development of the intranasal vaccine has been supported by the department of biotechnology (DBT) and Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), it said. DBT secretary and BIRAC chairperson Dr Renu Swarup said Bharat Biotech’s BBV154 is the first intranasal vaccine being developed in the country to be entering into late-stage clinical trials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bbs-nasal-vaccine-gets-phase-2-trials-nod/articleshow/85312674.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Delhi||How armed robbery probe in Delhi ended in encounter killing||NEW DELHI: Amir Khan and Rajman, the two men killed in an encounter with the cops in the early hours of Thursday at Khajuri Khas, were both criminals who had no compunction about using firearms to press their demands. Khan was a travel agent and driver, but his meagre salary did not give him the life he yearned for. He even began purchasing motorcycles at low prices and selling them on OLX at inflated rates Even as a medical board has been constituted to conduct the post-mortem of the duo, the story of how their end came about began with Begumpur police station investigating an armed robbery case. When scanning CCTV footage, they stumbled upon Khan and Rajman in a clip and began trailing them, finally locating them to Shri Ram Colony in Khajuri Khas on Thursday. Constable Kalil Tomar who sustained a bullet wound in his leg during the gunfight said, “We coaxed the two men to surrender, but they insisted they wouldn’t. At no point did we expect them to have so many live rounds. Eventually, we asked a resident to provide us a hammer to break open the door of the room where they were hiding. The moment we used the hammer, the duo opened fire. My colleague, constable Sachin Khokar, suffered a fracture in his leg bone. We again persuaded the two men to give up, but they said they had 100 rounds and would continue firing, even kill themselves. We also retaliated. I don’t know when the bullet hit my leg. I only woke up on Friday morning.” For the families residing in the building, the cops knocking on their doors and urgently directing them to rush downstairs was a shock. As a second-floor resident said, “We didn’t know what was happening. I just gathered my children and ran down. Then we stood and watched what ensued. The accused pair had only recently shifted here and were very aloof.” Investigating officers said that Khan’s father was an ice cream seller. “Khan was doing part time jobs, but to earn more, he and some friends began purchasing motorbikes at lower prices and sold them, mostly on OLX, at high rates. They were inspired to deceit after seeing some episodes of TV series Crime Patrol and Savdhaan India and on YouTube,” claimed one officer. A few months ago, Khan went to Anand Vihar bus stand to purchase a bike from a seller on OLX and fled with the two-wheeler. He sold it on OLX using a fake registration plate and forged documents to a customer in Pilibhit. He followed this up with similar acts. The fake numbers he used belonged to bikes of the same model and he also used the names in the original registration. In case a customer enquired, they found the Transport Authority details matched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-armed-robbery-probe-ended-in-encounter-killing/articleshow/85312712.cms||Sakshi Chand

Bank transactions were also affected after the BSNL fibre cable at Quepem was damaged. BSNL telecom officer Sandeep Chowgule told TOI that the water supply department had damaged the cable while excavating mud using heavy machinery to repair the leaking pipe in front of a bank at Quepem. Earlier in June, PWD had damaged the 11KV feeder main incoming underground cable near Xeldem sub station, due to which entire wards in Quepem municipality and the neighbouring panchayat went without power supply for a whole day. Chowgule said that one cable has been repaired and the contractors are working round the clock to locate the fault of the remaining cable. However, telecom users in Quepem are unhappy over the frequent disruptions in internet service. “We had installed BSNL fibre connection specifically for our kids’ online classes as mobile connectivity on the private networks is poor, but we are witnessing regular interruption in the fiber connection as well,” said Amita Dias, a Quepem local. Another local Selvy Miranda pointed to the government’s shoddy planning for laying the BSNL fibre cable and new JICA funded water pipeline. Both these lines, including the Jio fibre and old existing pipe line, are laid parallel on each other, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parts-of-quepem-offline-as-fibre-cable-damaged/articleshow/85316185.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In four fiscals, 73 panchayats in the district had spent Rs 3.6 crore for implementing the animal birth control (ABC) project and the rural local bodies had allotted Rs 4.8 crore for the project during this period. Four panchayats Kottukal, Nagaroor, Azhoor and Anchuthengu accounted for 73% of stray dog bite cases in the district in two years. In Nagaroor alone, 46 stray dog bite cases were reported in the district, while Anchuthengu and Azhoor reported 10 and 8 cases, respectively. Coastal panchayat Kottukal reported 35 stray dog bite cases. The death due to stray dog bite happened in Chirayinkeezhu. The five urban local bodies in the district together earmarked 1.32 crore for implementing the ABC project in the district between 2019-20 and 2020-21. The urban local bodies in the district had made scarce utilization of funds earmarked for implementation of the ABC till 2019. Figures available till 2019 show that the city corporation allocated Rs 3 crore each for 2016-17 and 2017-18 under the ABC.  However, expenditure was limited to Rs 26.4 lakh in 2016-17 and Rs 13.9 lakh in 2017-18, respectively. However in 2018-19, Attingal municipality, which allotted Rs 1 lakh for the project, showed nil expenditure. Nedumangadu municipality had spent just Rs 87,203 in 2016-17 when the allocation was Rs 18 lakh. Varkala is another municipality which even made zero allocation for 2018-19. The amount being allocated for ABC has also shown a decrease in the last fiscals for each urban local body in the district. Attingal municipality which made Rs 3.98 lakh for ABC in 2016-17 cut down the allocation to Rs 1 lakh in 2018-19. In March 2021, a stray dog turned violent and bitten around 19 people at Kottukal. Assembly records presented in January show that 19 stray dog bite incidents were reported in the district in the past one year. The local bodies had to spend Rs 3.8 crore in one year as part of stray dog control measures in the district. Deaths due to stray dog bite were reported in 2016 and 2017 at Pulluvila in Karumkulam panchayat. In 2017, Josklin, 45, a fisherman had succumbed to injuries following a stray dog attack at Pulluvila. Siluvamma, 65, had died of blood loss after she sustained serious bite injuries at the beach at Pulluvila in 2016. Another woman was grievously wounded in the stray dog attack. Waste management is cited as the major reason for the rising number of stray dogs in coastal panchayats. It’s not just coastal panchayats, areas in the city and other rural panchayats have also reported stray dog bite incidents. Three members of a family, including a five-year-old kid, were injured in a stray dog attack at Kachani in 2018. An old man had succumbed to wounds from a dog bite at Varkala. A stray dog had attacked pedestrians recently in front of the Secretariat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/panchayats-report-134-dog-bite-cases/articleshow/85312645.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Security has been beefed up and search operations intensified across Amritsar after the discovery. The suspicious object was found inside a garbage dumpster at Ranjit Avenue’s D block. Amarinder is scheduled to inaugurate Jallianwala Bagh Centenary Memorial erected at Ranjit Avenue E block on Saturday. The grenade-like object was found by municipal corporation (MC) workers on maintenance duty and then handed to police. Amritsar police commissioner Sukhchain Singh Gill said a bomb disposal squad was called in and it took the suspicious object in possession for a forensic investigation. While discounting the possibility of the suspicious object being a live grenade, he said people often kept grenade-like decorative pieces and dummy grenades too, but the reality would be confirmed only after an investigation by experts. Gill said in the wake of August 15, police were not taking any chances and every suspicious object was taken seriously and a thorough drill was conducted. He said police found a suspicious tiffin box on Thursday, but it was later found that it had been mistakenly left in front of a house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/day-before-cms-asr-visit-grenade-like-object-found/articleshow/85315204.cms||---

The doses were handed over by IIL managing director Dr K Anand Kumar to Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella at IIL’s Genome Valley facility. According to sources, the drug substance (critical component of any vaccine) for about 1 million doses was handed over on Friday. “We will start supplying drug substance for 3-4 million doses of Covaxin per month from the repurposed facility and ramp up supplies to 10 million doses per month by December 2021 once the new dedicated facility for Covaxin becomes operational at Genome Valley,” Dr Anand Kumar said. IIL and Bharat Biotech inked four agreements for Covaxin in April 2021 after which IIL repurposed its BSL-2+ anti-rabies vaccines facility at Karakapatla to make Covaxin in record time and production commenced in July 2021. “The batches produced at IIL’s manufacturing facility have been tested at BBIL and IIL and meets the quality specification. The yields are more than expected,” he said. Calling the alliance a victory for ‘Team India’, the IIL MD said the company’s team worked tirelessly, round-the-clock to meet the committed timelines and product quality. “It is a proud moment for IIL to have played a vital role in supporting our nation’s interest during this unprecedented time,” he added. DBT secretary and BIRAC chairperson Dr Renu Swarup termed the loan license agreement by CDSCO for IIL to produce Covaxin drug substance as a major milestone that was achieved in a very short span of time. IIL was sanctioned a grant of Rs 60 crore for enhancing production capabilities as part of Mission Covid Suraksha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iil-begins-covaxin-drug-material-supplies/articleshow/85312697.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Income Tax department shows interest in high end flats at IT park||CHANDIGARH: While the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) has not received advance money from Punjab, Haryana and PGI for high-end flats for government officials at Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Technology Park (IT Park), the Income Tax department has expressed an interest in the flats for their officials. A senior CHB official said they had received a letter from the Income Tax department, seeking details related to flats, pricing and payment mode. He added that they would provide the details to the department at the earliest. Earlier, the board had written to Punjab, Haryana and PGI but no one submitted the 25% advance money. Although Punjab and PGI gave their affirmation, they have still not made any deposit. Sources said the high cost of the towers having the residential flats was the likely reason. The housing board is expected to construct 10 towers with 28 flats each having a base price of Rs 2 crore for each flat. All the three agencies are expected to pay Rs 66 crore each for their share of the flats. The project is to come up on 6.73 acres of land. In June, CHB officials delivered a presentation in Haryana assembly to speaker Gian Chand Gupta, chief secretary Vijai Vardhan and engineering department officials. Sources said that Haryana was now considering construction of flats in Panchkula. The CHB planned to construct luxury flats for officials and MLAs of Punjab and Haryana and for PGI as well as Chandigarh administration. To start construction, CHB wrote to Punjab, Haryana and PGI last year to release their share of 25% payment. In September 2019, CHB sought opinion from both the governments. In addition to Punjab and Haryana, PGI also expressed willingness to buy flats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/i-tax-department-shows-interest-in-high-end-flats-at-it-park/articleshow/85312682.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The lokpal has directed the minister as well as officials to file their replies by October 12, claimed Bir Devinder. Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma said that it is unfortunate that corruption has reached a level where all norms of following basic procedure were curtailed in the recent ‘land scam’ in Mohali. He claimed that Arora is a close associate of the GRG developers company which has bought the 31 acre land. “We demand, that keeping ‘dharma politics’ in mind, Arora should resign. If he does not, then chief minister Amarinder Singh should suspend him with immediate effect till the inquiry of the lokpal is not finished,” he said. Bir Devinder said that after various political parties collectively questioned this deal, the matter was referred to the advocate general and finance department by the chief minister and their reports confirmed not only the illegalities and irregularities but direct loss to state exchequer to the tune of Rs 125 crore. He added that the dismissal of the industries minister was demanded by almost all major political parties but the minister being the blue eyed boy of the chief minister, no action could be anticipated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-land-row-on-bjps-complaint-state-lokpal-notice-to-industries-minister/articleshow/85315271.cms||---

State minority minister Nawab Malik refuted the charge. In a letter to Muslim ministers and MLAs in the state, Azmi has said that purchase of land with the money of Central Haj Committee is gross misuse of funds collected from Haj pilgrims over the years. “We already have a Haj House in Mumbai and pilgrims now catch flights from different embarkation points in the country. If they really needed another Haj House and a separate terminal, the land could have been provided by the state as other states have,” said Azmi. “They want to shift the Haj headquarters from the present building.” Haj Committee’s CEO Dr M A Khan said 6,000 sq metres of Cidco land purchased for Rs 18 crore at Kharghar will be used to build a Haj Terminal and Camp Office (seasonal). “As many pilgrims from within and outside the state prefer Mumbai as an embarkation point..., Mumbai will see a huge rush of pilgrims and we need a Haj terminal and camp office,” said Khan.  “Haj House was built from money donated by Indian Hajis and other Muslims. No one can evict Haj offices from here,” said Congress MLA Amin Patel who too has received Azmi’s letter. “What is wrong if a Haj terminal is being built? After all, the state government is to provide better facilities to people,” said minority department minister Nawab Malik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/haj-camp-plan-in-kharghar-is-plot-to-vacate-sobo-bldg-in-mumbai/articleshow/85312838.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

At 1.44pm, Chanakyapuri police station received a call from a hospital that three men had been injured at a construction site inside the embassy and were brought there. “A police team reached the hospital and found that Kanchan, a 32-year-old worker, was declared dead at Primus Hospital, while two others, Mukesh (33) and Babulal (32), had sustained injuries and were getting treated. By the evening, Babulal also succumbed to his injuries. All of them came from Dausa in Rajasthan,” said a senior officer. During initial probe, police found that a lock of the crane did not close properly and collapsed on the labourers. “Further inquiry is underway to establish whose negligence has claimed the lives.

The KMC doctors associated with the Covid-combat programmes recently held a meeting with paediatricians, including Apurba Ghosh, to chalk out a strategy to prevent anticipated spread of the virus among kids. The experts, sources said, have advised the civic body to pay special attention to slums where the counsellors need to visit and interact with mothers to get medical history of the children. The visits to the slums and taking stock of the medical history of the children living there will enable the KMC health department to reach out to those children who may need immediate medical attention in the event of a third wave. “After consultations with eminent public health experts and paediatricians we may need to alert our team of doctors and health workers at the ward level to take stock of the health conditions of children in large slums located across the city. If we can prepare a list of vulnerable slums, we will keep our focus on them,” said a KMC health department official. This apart, the KMC medical officers posted at the urban primary health centres will be asked to go through the medical history of the children who regularly visit these centres along with parents and based on the history of ailments prepare a list of those who are suffering from respiratory diseases and need special attention if the civic body needs to provide maximum protection to children during a third wave. The civic body’s health department battling with the dreaded virus may also set up a pool of paediatricians among its medical officers and hire paediatricians if need be to build a task force to prevent a rapid spread of the virus among children. The KMC health department has already decided to ramp up its infrastructure to accommodate children who may need to shift to a safe home or isolation centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-focus-on-counselling-moms-with-kids-below-12-slum-children/articleshow/85312821.cms||Saikat Ray

Their relationship soured over time and they frequently quarreled over money. On Friday, Shadab allegedly shot dead Jyoti with a countrymade firearm during one such confrontation and fled. The sole witness to the crime is Jyoti’s seven-year-old daughter. The murder took place in Gohar Ali Khan locality of Afzalgarh area in Bijnor on Friday morning. Shadab was already married and many believe that he forged a relationship with Jyoti for money. The “couple” was having a heated argument over the transaction of Rs 15 lakh when Jyoti was shot dead. Jyoti’s daughter told police that Shadab arrived at their house, sent the domestic help to the market before going with her “ mother” to a room, where they had an altercation. “Suddenly Saddu (Shadab) shot my mother twice and fled,” the child said. Dharamveer Singh, Bijnor superintendent of police, said, “We have formed two teams to apprehend Shadab.

The estates would be taken over after paying fair compensation to the individual owners. The estates thus taken over would be converted into natural forests. Preliminary works have started towards the fulfilment of the plan. In the first phase, 13 estates would be taken over and more similar takeover would follow, he told the House. The minister said that timely revision would be made in the compensation given to farmers for attack and raid by wild animals on their farmland. In 2011, the agriculture department, according to the Union government guidelines, had revised the compensation amount. The minister said that financial constraints were the major reason for the delay in providing compensation to the eligible. Water resources minister Roshy Agustine told the assembly that his department has started preliminary work for removing sand and sediments from rivers to facilitate hassle-free flow of water. The work would be done after necessary studies and in cooperation with other departments, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/13-private-estates-to-be-taken-over-forest-min/articleshow/85312764.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Mann, accompanied by party workers, said the local MLA and “his coterie” were playing “cheap politics” during the vaccination drive by stalling camps in Phagwara. “Instead of ensuring that vaccination reaches all people, the MLA is interfering in the smooth execution of the camps by the health department and the latter is acting as a puppet in the hands of the MLA,” he said. He said camps should be organised where required. It is learnt the real bone of contention is that both Mann and Dhaliwal want vaccination camps to be organised as per their recommendations. Mann had lost the 2017 assembly election from Phagwara to BJP’s Som Prakash.

Self-defence to make women independent Self-defence is a way of becoming independent for women. Teaching women to take charge of their own safety, Syeda Falak, an international karate champion, is holding a self-defence workshop at Aditya Nagar Colony in Tolichowki on the occasion of the 75th Independence Day. The six-hour long workshop would teach students basics of self-defence techniques, general fitness and would also enlighten them about nutrition. “At a time when women are facing so many social issues, self-defence is a way of empowering women for their own safety. Even today, some women feel scared to step out alone. True freedom is to be confident enough to face any kind of situation,” said Syeda Falak. At the end of the workshop, the students would also be awarded a certificate. Syeda Falak is the first woman from Telangana to qualify and represent India at the world karate championship and win national karate championship in 2018. Cycling for freedom Covering a stretch of over 30 km, cyclists from various cycling groups across the city are set to join a ‘freedom ride’ on Sunday to celebrate the 75th Independence Day. Initiated by the cycling mayor of Hyderabad Santhana Selvan, it is a symbolic ride that identifies cycling with freedom. “Anyone irrespective of age, gender, caste, religion or income group can take to cycling. It definitely gives a sense of freedom to those who cycle. Our rally intends to spread this awareness so that more and more people take to cycling,” said Selvan. Starting from Narsingi at 5 am, the cyclists are set to cover several major areas such as Gachibowli, Alwyn Crossroads, Khairatabad and Charminar before culminating the ride at Golconda at 7.45 am where the state government would be observing the Independence Day celebrations. Extending support to neighbourhood talent Seven medals at the Tokyo, 2020 Olympics has inspired resident welfare associations (RWA) to encourage local sportspersons from their colonies this Independence Day. The Devinagar RWA has identified a few sports personalities in their colony who represented their school/college in sports at their young age. “Detailed information about them was circulated with their picture in our community. They will be felicitated and called upon as special guests for the Independence Day celebrations,” said BT Srinivasan, president of Devinagar RWA. Similarly, the Uttam Nagar RWA has decided to extend help to sportspersons from their neighbourhood with better kit or physical fitness equipment or by paying a few months of fees. “Following our country’s performance at the Olympics, we would extend help to the sportspersons in our colony. On Independence Day, we would be felicitating few such talents to encourage their performance in respective sports,” said Raghavendra Rao, resident of Uttam Nagar. Tri-colour display on yachts Marking the 75 years of India’s Independence, the Yacht Club of Hyderabad is displaying the tri-colour lighting up the very waters that also played a key role in nurturing the four Indian sailing Olympians at Tokyo 2021 during their formative years. “With 86 state and national medals, multiple national titles and three of our wards being selected for the Asian and World Championships, we reaffirm our dedication towards the nation on the 75th Independence Day through this gesture,” said Suheim Sheikh, president of the YCH Foundation. The tri-colour is being displayed on 25 yachts as part of the national ‘Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahautsav’ celebrations at Hussainsagar, Hyderabad.

The price cut in petrol was well-received by two-wheeler and car users as many who planned to fill fuel postponed it to Saturday when it is to come into effect. The drop in demand at petrol dispensers was visible from Friday afternoon after the announcement came. “I postponed filling my car’s tank that has a 35litre capacity to save Rs 105 on Saturday,” said V Manian of Bibikulam. Various trade bodies including Madurai district tiny and small industries association welcomed the cut as it would benefit workers using two-wheelers. On the other hand, farmers expressed unhappiness for leaving diesel price untouched. “Diesel price should also be reduced so that farmers who rely on diesel pump sets and diesel-run agriculture machineries can also cut down loss in the agriculture business,” said Thanjavur district Cauvery farmers’ protection association district secretary S Vimalanathan. He added that over 2.5 lakh farmers in waiting list for electricity connection and another 2.5 lakh farmers not applying for electricity depend on diesel for agricultural activities. Tamil Nadu food grains merchants association limited recommended cut in diesel price at par with petrol as it would benefit a larger section of the society. The association stated that it would lead to drop in transportation cost of goods by transporters, thereby benefiting the common man as well as trade and industry. Among the diesel consumers who were disappointed were mechanised boat owners who spend a few lakh rupees on diesel for every deep sea fishing expedition. “We need 5,000 to 7,000 litres costing Rs 4.77 lakh to Rs 6.68 lakh for a fishing expedition lasting three to six weeks. Even a small drop in tax on diesel by Rs 3 would have helped us save Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh a year,” P Dickson of Kanyakumari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-traders-fishers-want-price-reduced-for-diesel-too/articleshow/85312808.cms||---

According to the protesting students, now that the UT administration had given permission and many colleges were starting physical classes from next week, the varsity had no concrete reason to keep the campus closed. They pointed out that health department data suggested constant decrease in Covid cases. Also, they said, more than 90% of the population in the city had received the first dose of the vaccine. Main demands of students include reopening of campuses and hostel allotment and withdrawal of all fee notices till the beginning of physical classes. Students also demanded the intervention of university authorities to quash cases pending against protesting students. They said that the pending court cases had put their future at risk.

---||Kochi||RT-PCR -ve mandate: Kasaragod resident moves Kerala HC||Mangaluru: A petitioner has moved the Kerala high court seeking a direction to Karnataka to allow all travellers who have taken even one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to enter without the need to show a negative RT-PCR test report. In his writ petition, Jayananda KR, a resident of Bangra Manjeshwar in Kasaragod district, stated that the Karnataka government’s decision mandating negative RT-PCR test reports which are not older than 72 hours for interstate commuters from Kerala is a “violation of natural justice”. Jayananda, also secretary of Rastrakavi Manjeshwara Govinda Pai Smaraka Samiti and a social worker, said the RT-PCR negative report mandate has curtailed fundamental rights of the people of Kerala, especially those residing in Kasaragod. “People residing in Kasaragod are dependent on Mangaluru city for basic needs, besides medical help, as it is only 15km away from the border,” the petitioner said. “Daily travellers, including labourers, employees and students, including medicos enrolled in various colleges in Mangaluru are being deprived of the right to travel across the border daily. The RT-PCR mandate is a serious violation of fundamental rights.” The petitioner pleaded that immediate steps should be taken to allow passengers, who have a Covid vaccination certificate for even one dose, to enter Karnataka without restrictions. He also sought steps to ensure that all vehicles, including passenger vehicles, are not obstructed at Karnataka borders. The petitioner has made the central government, Union health ministry, Karnataka government, deputy commissioner of Dakshina Kannada, Kerala government, besides two others, respondents in the case. To curb rising infections, Dakshina Kannada district administration had made RT-PCR negative reports mandatory for people from Kerala from August 2. The government has also re-introduced weekend curfew in the district. While it is mandatory for travellers from Kerala to furnish a negative certificate to enter through any other port in Karnataka, the restriction has been most acutely felt in Dakshina Kannada district due to the sheer volume of daily commuters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rt-pcr-ve-mandate-kasaragod-resident-moves-kerala-hc/articleshow/85312854.cms||---
---||Delhi||Communal slogans: Court rejects bail plea of 3 accused||New Delhi: A Delhi court has dismissed the bail pleas of three persons, arrested in connection with alleged inflammatory slogans raised at Jantar Mantar, saying “scathing remarks which are undemocratic and uncalled for from a citizen of this country” have been made in the alleged video footage available of the incident. Metropolitan Magistrate Udbhav Kumar Jain dismissed the bail pleas of Preet Singh, Deepak Singh, Vinod Sharma and said prima facie perusal of all the material available on record failed to find support in favour of the accused. “In one of the clippings, applicant/accused, as identified by the IO (investigating officer) in the video clipping, can be seen with the other accused Deepak Singh, who in one of the video clippings has made scathing remarks which are undemocratic and uncalled for from a citizen of this country where principles like secularism hold the value of basic feature imbibed in the Constitution,” the court said in its order. It added that freedom to express oneself was indeed allowed to be enjoyed by the citizens to the fullest possible extent, yet with every right, there is a corresponding duty attached. “The principle behind Section 153A (promoting enmity based on religion, language, caste, etc) of the IPC is to preserve religious/communal harmony and it is the duty of every citizen that while he enjoys his right to express himself, he preserves religious harmony. This indeed is the positive aspect of secularism,” the court noted. It said that it was indeed difficult time for everyone during this pandemic and serious view should be taken against those who violated the guidelines/restrictions, to contain the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, yet the offences as far as breach of these guidelines were concerned were bailable in nature, which can be dealt by the trial court on merits. “Considering the fact that investigation of the present case is at a nascent stage, the nature of accusations levelled against the accused persons and also taking into account the overall facts and circumstances of the case, this court is not inclined to allow the present application at this stage,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/communal-slogans-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-3-accused/articleshow/85312894.cms||Usha Das
---||Chandigarh||SAD says sack sack Punjab minister Ashu, start CBI probe||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday demanded dismissal of Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and a CBI probe into what it described as “corrupt deeds” of the minister. SAD MLA Bikram Singh Majithia also demanded action against officials if the department headed by Ashu and its chief vigilance commissioner, Rakesh Kumar Singla. The SAD MLA said Ashu indulged in corruption worth thousands of crores and was responsible for allowing wheat from outside the state to be procured on minimum support price (MSP) in Punjab. He said wheat was brought from outside the state at Rs 1,000 per quintal and sold at Rs 1,883. He said a Punsup district manager had also indicted Ashu in his chat with an arhtiya which had gone viral last year. The SAD leader claimed that the chat saw the officer demanding commission from arhtiyas as well as money to arrange Rahul Gandhi’s visit at the time to Punjab. Majithia claimed that Singla was a tainted officer and his appointment as CVC had resulted in a loss of hundreds of crores. He said Singla had been indicted in a probe in October 2017 by the principal secretary of the department who held him responsible for corruption of Rs 85 crore. He said the principal secretary had ordered that Singla be demoted and also accused him of diverting stock received from the central government under various schemes. “It was also stated that Singla had secured permanent residency of Canada and could have sent his ill-gotten wealth outside the country,” added Majithia. The SAD leader said activities of all officers under minister and people associated with him should be probed by the CBI. He added the minister and his associates had now been working under Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-says-sack-sack-punjab-minister-ashu-start-cbi-probe/articleshow/85315384.cms||---

---||Trichy||Nod for Trichy city bus terminus ends long wait||Trichy: Finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan’s announcement in the revised Tamil Nadu budget that an integrated bus stand and commercial centre will be established in Trichy has come as a huge relief for city residents as their 27-year-old demand has been addressed . Ever since Trichy city was upgraded as a municipal corporation in 1994, the demand for an integrated bus terminus was being persistently raised. As the Central bus stand at Cantonment sprawling over five acres even after being expanded once in 2007 remains insufficient, the proposal for IBT was a poll plank in almost all elections of the past decade. The project was finally revived post the change of guard in the state recently. Trichy corporation sources said about 100 acres to 115 acres of land available at Panjappur on the Trichy-Madurai NH is most likely to be utilised for the terminus. The site was inspected by municipal administration minister K N Nehru in May, followed by senior bureaucrats in his department. “The project will not only benefit Trichy but the floating population using the city as a transit hub every day. There is scope for the city’s development in the suburbs,” Dr M A Aleem, member, Trichy district welfare fund committee, said. Several sites proposed for the terminus in the past 27 years including Devathanam, Pirattiyur, Ariyamangalam and Karur road did not materialise due to the lack of political will and limited infrastructure. “Authorities should ensure that the civil work for the bus stand is initiated and completed on time,” H Ghouse Baig, secretary of consumer protection council, Ponmalai branch, said. Trichy corporation officials said that a detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared to arrive at the project cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/nod-for-trichy-city-bus-terminus-ends-long-wait/articleshow/85312857.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Widow starts food biz as cops lend a helping hand||Nagpur: Meera Das, in her late 40s, wanted to earn a livelihood following her passion for cooking. She had neither money nor resources to materialize her dreams. It were the cops, especially Zonal DCP Lohit Matani and his wife Manjeet Kaur, who helped her fulfil the near-impossible dream by arranging almost everything and inaugurating her food stall at Bhim Chowk near Rani Durgawati Square on Friday. An accident had left Meera physically disabled to some extent. Death of her husband in 2019 was the second blow she had suffered in life. As Meera was trying to put the pieces of her life together by working at a canteen, some unpleasant experience had forced her to leave the job. But, Meera had by then already mastered some culinary skills to supplement her passion for cooking. Meera, who is now trying to make a turnaround in life with the help rendered by the cops from Pachpaoli police station, said she wanted some support from Kaur after learning about her social work through a police mitra. “I was expecting some support to invest, but what I got was much more. Unexpectedly, from crockery to the food cart to raw material were provided to me,” said Meera, who somehow managed to marry off her two daughters, but later was finding it difficult to arrange a square meal for herself. “I am fond of cooking and wanted to earn through it. My experience of working in canteen would help in cooking, serving and also in the business. Next, my goal is to go online,” she said. DCP Matani, who roped in support from senior inspector Sanjay Mendhe of Pachpaoli police station, said it was part of community policing with a focus on skill development. Matani’s wife Kaur recalled how several women in Amravati and Jalgaon were empowered and rehabilitated by her and husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/widow-starts-food-biz-as-cops-lend-a-helping-hand/articleshow/85312917.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Trichy||Budget fails to cheer up MSMEs in Trichy||Trichy: The revised Tamil Nadu budget offered a raw deal to industries in Trichy as the much-anticipated announcements to revive the pandemic-hit MSMEs were missing. A specific revival plan for engineering and fabrications units deprived of work orders and no investment announcement in Manapparai Sipcot complex have come as a disappointment for the district that has major public sector industries and premier technical educational institutes. Except for the announcement to establish a Sipcot industrial park in Nagapattinam and food park at Manapparai which was already in the pipeline for a year, the central region stands ignored in the budget as far as industrial investments are concerned. While the government has said defence industrial corridor project will be revived, a proposal was made only for Coimbatore to establish a defence component manufacturing park. While Trichy already has an OFT producing weapons, there were no announcements to help MSMEs to diversify their work area. “While MSMEs relying on Bhel are facing a downfall, it is imperative to give impetus to setting up new industries in Trichy and the central region,” said V B Jeganath, member, Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours (TIDES). City development organisations said the state must consider decentralising industrial investments to develop equal employment opportunities . Meanwhile, Tiruchirappalli District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association (Tiditssia) welcomed the announcement in the budget to accord pattas for beneficiaries in industrial estates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/budget-fails-to-cheer-up-msmes-in-trichy/articleshow/85312901.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Frame payout policy for infra project-hit communities: Bombay HC to state||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday directed Maharashtra government to frame a comprehensive statewide policy to compensate fisherfolk and any other community whose customary right to carry out activities for livelihood is impacted by infrastructure projects. The HC permitted construction of the six-lane Thane Creek Bridge III (TCB III) on Sion-Panvel highway, but observed that the work would impact the customary rights of fisherfolk and hence directed the setting up of a TCB compensation committee. The HC sought compliance after six weeks on both—framing the statewide policy and determination of compensation for TCB-IIIaffected fishermen. “Once the customary right to carry out an occupation for a means of livelihood is affected, the principles enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India will be invoked. This forms the basis of the state’s duty to compensate in such cases,” held a bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav. It directed the state to also set up a general compensation panel comprising a member each from the project implementing agency, project-affected persons, district collector, other state agencies and an independent expert. The panel will have to lay down principles to identify persons affected by projects, decide types of loss and determine the compensation. The HC ruling was in a petition seeking compensation filed by a society of traditional fishing communities from koliwadas, including the one at Vashi. Their counsel, Zaman Ali, said TCB III project is in an eco-sensitive zone of Thane Creek mudflats which will affect mangroves and flamingoes, besides disrupt fisherfolk’s livelihood. Amicus curiae (friend of court to assist on legal aspects) senior counsel Sharan Jagtiani said it may be necessary to frame a statewide policy for compensation of PAPs whose customary rights are likely to be adversely impacted by infrastructure projects. Advocate Saket Mone for MSRDC, executing the TCB III, said it is in public interest to connect Mumbai and Navi Mumbai and needs no additional nod. He said a TCB compensation panel was set up. The HC set out illustrations on how the panel has to assess loss type and compensation quantum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-to-state-frame-payout-policy-for-infra-project-hit-communities-in-mumbai/articleshow/85315388.cms||Swati Deshpande

You revealed the identity of a rape victim. So your account has been blocked. Tell that loudly and then protest and preach,” BJP general secretary B L Santhosh tweeted. The party said Rahul should use the new social media rules introduced by the Modi government to restore his account. BJP MP Tejasvi Surya said the same Congress was crying hoarse and attacking the government when it framed the new rules to “empower” social media users. BJP’s chief spokesperson and RS MP Anil Baluni said Rahul was unnecessary dragging BJP and the government into the issue. “This is between him and Twitter. I fail to understand why is he naming the government,” Baluni said, adding, “Instead of playing the blame game, Rahul should have admitted he had committed a crime.” As a senior leader of a national party, Rahul should have realised the consequences of disclosing the identity of a rape victim. “He defied the law for which he never expressed any regret. Instead, his party leaders did it again, which proved that Congress has no respect for the law of the land,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lifes-come-full-circle-bjp-reminds-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/85317801.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Theatres, cinemas likely to open from Sept 1||Nagpur: After markets and schools, now theatre and cinema halls are likely to re-open in Maharashtra from September 1. In a meeting with the representatives of performing artistes and folk artistes, minister of cultural affairs Amit Deshmukh assured that the state government is thinking to re-open theatrical activities and cinema halls from September 1 with proper Covid protocol. Final decision, however, will be taken by the chief minister. The meeting with the representatives of performing and folk artistes in Maharashtra was held in Mantrayala in which many from Vidarbha also participated. Disaster management minister Vijay Wadettiwar had facilitated this meeting for Vidarbha-based artists. “Cultural Affairs Minister has accepted several demands of the theatre and folk artistes foremost of which is of forming a welfare board for them. Minister also said that proper documentation of artists will be conducted on priority,” said theatre activist Avish Vatsal. According to him, the state-wide agitation of artistes held on August 9 built some pressure on the authorities and they called a meeting. Out of total of 13 demands, 12 were straightaway accepted in principle. Later, Minister Deshmukh tweeted about the same. Artists will soon get the welfare board on the lines of the laborers in unorganized sectors. Recently, the state also announced Rs 5,000 one-time Covid assistance to artists. But, the state still doesn’t have a list of the probable beneficiaries. Documentation of artists will start with the online registration process at the earliest, Deshmukh assured. “We also told about the incidents in Vidarbha where schools refused to admit artists’ wards as their parents could not pay last years’ fees,” said Umesh Thakur, who was also a part of the delegation. Folk artistes in Vidarbha insisted that their house-to-house visits of traditional artists like ‘Vasudev’, ‘Potraj’ etc. should be allowed. As all 11 districts in Vidarbha have quite better conditions, small in-house events organized in housing societies, one-act plays, mono-acts, mimicry, and solo singing performances should be allowed in restricted areas, the demanded. Minister Deshmukh said that government is positive about re-starting theatrical performances and artists may expect good news in September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/theatres-cinemas-likely-to-open-from-sept-1/articleshow/85313318.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||Landslide blocks flow of Chenab in Himachal’s Lahaul for over two hours||Manali: A massive landslide near Junda village of Himachal’s Lahaul-Spiti district blocked the flow of the Chenab river at about 9.15 am on Friday. A huge chunk of the mountain face suddenly collapsed and fell on the riverbed, blocking the flow of the water in the Chenab and a huge lake was formed upstream. Nearly two dozen villages, both downstream and upstream, were evacuated. Four houses were submerged, some livestock was washed away and two women trapped in water were rescued after a long struggle by the villagers. The huge lake was formed after thousands of tonnes of debris blocked the river flow for more than two hours. The water level became stable after the river managed to make its way through the debris, but the danger of lake outburst flood kept the authorities on high alert throughout the day. When the water level of the river rose dangerously, the district administration shifted people from lower villages to higher regions. Teams of police, disaster management authorities and officials of all the departments started evacuating villages both upstream and downstream of the Chenab. Residents of Jasrath, Tadgan, Galling, Lobar, Ratauli, Lower Kukumseri, Adhat, Lower Shenoor, Lower Kishori, Nepali colony of Salpat, Koraki, Lohani, Lower Chhating, BRO’s colony at Udaipur, lower portions of Udaipur and people from many other villages were shifted to higher areas. Two women from Junda village, Suman and Damyanti, who were trapped when the river water entered their house, were injured in their frightening ordeal. “I was completely inside water. I couldn’t breathe for a long time and was struggling to stay above the water level. I thought I’m going to die. Water had risen till Damyanti’s neck, We screamed for help. My brother Sushil and other villagers got information that we are trapped inside the house. They took a risk to save us. My hand got fractured and Damyanti too sustained injuries,” said Suman. “Taking precautionary measures, all the villages downstream and upstream of the river have been evacuated. The river water from the lake-like dam is now flowing over the debris. The situation is under control. The houses of Devi Singh and Sushil have submerged in the incident. Devi Singh’s three sheep and one cow have also washed away in the water. Till the last report, the water level had started receding below danger level after it started flowing over the debris,” Lahaul-Spiti superintendent of police Manav Verma said. The Chenab river is in spate these days due to heavy rains and the melting of the glaciers. The Chenab originates in the Lahaul valley when the Chandra and Bhaga rivers meet at Tandi village. The river flows from Himachal to Jammu & Kashmir before entering Pakistan. This is the first time that a landslide blocked the flow of the Chenab river, locally known as the Chandrabhaga. Before this, massive avalanches have blocked the flow of the Chenab. A few decades back, the Chenab was blocked for almost a day after a snow avalanche and lake outburst flood had wreaked havoc downstream as it damaged many bridges, washed away roads and agricultural land. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said a team led by cabinet minister Ram Lal Markanda was sent to the spot to take stock of the situation. “All possible efforts will be made to normalise the situation. Officials have been directed to ensure that there is no loss to human lives. People have been requested not to go close to rivers and landslide-prone areas.” Markanda along with chief secretary Ram Subhag Singh and police chief Sanjay Kundu carried out an aerial survey of the spot and met the affected people. “The landslide had blocked the flow of the Chenab for a long time. Had the water not made its way through the debris, it could have caused massive destruction. I met the affected families. Some houses have submerged and agricultural land has been damaged along with stranding crops. All possible help would be provided to the affected people,” Markanda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/landslide-blocks-flow-of-chenab-in-himachals-lahaul-for-over-two-hours/articleshow/85315394.cms||---

Under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which has difficult bail provisions, court has to have a prima facie view that no case is made out to grant bail. The HC granted him bail on a PR bond of Rs 1 lakh with a surety of like amount and directed that he appear before the NIA twice a week for the first month and then once a week for the next two months, apart from attending court for trial proceeding, and is not to hamper evidence or contact any witnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-held-booked-under-anti-terror-law-granted-bail/articleshow/85315453.cms||---

Cops are now trying to ascertain if the duo indeed took money to insert fraud names in the list. A local court on Friday remanded Pramod Vasava, executive engineer and Nishith Pithva, software expert, to three days of police custody. The case was registered at Navapura police station on Thursday and later investigations were transferred to the crime branch. “We will be questioning the persons whose name appeared in the fake list and try to find out if the accused took money from them,” V R Khair, crime branch police inspector told TOI. He further said that if it is established that they accepted money, their bank accounts will be checked for more evidence. “We have already seized their laptop that was used to make and upload the fake list of beneficiaries. The investigation will also focus on possible involvement of other VMC officials or politicians in the scam,” Khair added. VMC city engineer Shailesh Mistry had on Thursday filed a complaint of criminal breach of trust by public servant and forgery against Vasava and Pithva after their fraud act surfaced. The beneficiaries under PMAY were selected in a computer draw organized on August 7 as a part of the completion of five years of Vijay Rupani government. The draw was done to allot 382 housing units at an event held at Sir Sayajirao Nagargruh. The accused clandestinely changed the actual names replacing these with fraudulent ones on a fresh list on VMC’s website. Pithva blamed Vasava and said that the latter asked him to change the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/3-day-police-custody-for-accused-vmc-staff/articleshow/85312279.cms||---

---||Surat||Surat vendor arrested in anti-conversion case||SURAT: In the first case registered in the city under Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, the police arrested a 51-year-old man on Friday for allegedly marrying a 22-year-old woman after changing his identity. Accused Mohammad Akhtar Sheikh had developed friendship with the woman posing as Mukesh Mahavir Gupta and the duo got married in 2018. The couple has a one-year-old son and recently the woman, who sells snacks in a handcart on Ring Road, saw her husband’s Aadhaar card details in his phone where his real name was mentioned as Sheikh, a vegetable vendor. She approached the Dindoli police station and lodged a complaint against her husband accusing him of love jihad. The accused has been booked under provisions of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act as well as various sections of Indian Penal Code including subjecting the woman to cruelty by husband, voluntarily causing hurt, intentionally insult, criminal intimidation, marrying again, criminal breach of trust and cheating. In her complaint, the woman alleged that the accused met her in January 2018 to change the mobile SIM card when she was working as telecaller with a mobile service provider. The accused introduced himself as Mukesh. The complainant then asked him to help her get a few more clients for mobile number portability, after which Sheikh brought a few of his friends to port their numbers too. They exchanged phone numbers and Sheikh told her that he is a railway employee and unmarried. They developed a friendship and after a few weeks when Sheikh proposed her for marriage, her family too agreed. The woman continued staying with her parents after marriage while Sheikh would visit her often. After she noticed his Aadhaar card image in his mobile phone, she questioned him about it when Sheikh told her that she will have to convert and also adopt life of the women of their community. She was forced to wear burqa and also follow other rituals. The complainant also came to know that Sheikh was already married. “The accused was arrested following the complaint. The woman claimed that she has been tortured since she came to know about the religion of the accused,” said a police official at Dindoli police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-vendor-arrested-in-anti-conversion-case/articleshow/85312412.cms||---
---||Ranchi||OBC group seeks assembly resolution on increasing quota share||Ranchi: The OBC Arakshan Manch on Friday demanded that the state government should pass a resolution in the next state assembly session for caste-based census and also enhance the quantum of reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) and the scheduled castes (SC). While releasing the Manch’s resolutions, its president Kailash Yadav said there has been no official statement from the government regarding increasing reservation for OBCs from the present 14% to 27% and for the scheduled castes from 10% to 15%. “The government should also make its stand clear on the demand for a caste-based census. The state government should either conduct the caste-based census itself or send a resolution passed by Vidhan Sabha to the Centre,” Yadav said. Yadav further said, “We request chief minister Hemant Soren to break his silence on these issues. The CM should get resolutions passed in the coming state assembly session. It would bring about all-round development of the OBC and the SC communities.” He said the Manch would start an agitation from September 8 if the government failed to fulfill its demands. Notably, the monsoon session of the state assembly is proposed to be held from September 3 to 9. Yadav said that his organization has submitted a memorandum listing the demands to speaker Rabindra Nath Mahto, RJD chief Lalu Prasad, ministers Rameshwar Oroan, Alamgir Alam and Satyanand Bhokta, Ajsu Party chief Sudesh Mahto and several other leaders in Jharkhand and Bihar. Notably, in 2002-03, the then CM Babulal Marandi had reduced the share of reservation for OBCs from 27% to 14% and that of the SC category from 14% to 10%. The Manch also demanded that the proposal for increasing the number of seats in the state assembly to 150 be sent to the Union government. Moreover, it sought simplification of domicile policy, free enrolment for OBC, SC, ST and minority students in educational institutions and 27% reservation for OBCs in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha seats in the state, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/obc-group-seeks-assembly-resolution-on-increasing-quota-share/articleshow/85314561.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The university, which has 21 constituent and 12 affiliated colleges with 96,000 students, has currently 410 faculty members of which nearly 260 are on an adhoc basis and is affecting the teaching across the colleges. University spokesperson P K Pani said, “There is an urgent requirement of more than 350 new faculty members to ensure an unhindered academic atmosphere in its colleges.” He stressed that the last permanent appointments were made 12 years ago. “In 2016, the appointment process for faculty members in 11 departments had begun. The interviews were held in 2020 but the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) is yet to declare the results,” Pani said and added, “Even during the Covid times, we made sincere efforts to see that the quality of education is not compromised.” A teacher on adhoc appointment at the Jamshedpur Cooperative College said, “Before the Covid pandemic, several of our teaching staff travelled to far-off colleges in three districts on different days of the week to conduct classes. But the government has forgotten us.” Hemant Kumar, a student leader, said, “We have submitted representations to the government at different levels in the past several years, demanding appointments of teachers, but nothing encouraging has happened so far.” Earlier in the day, the university organised a cultural event at the senate hall to mark the foundation day. All officials of the university management, including V-C Gangadhar Panda and select students, took part in the function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/as-kolhan-varsity-turns-13-mgmt-rues-faculty-shortage/articleshow/85312316.cms||B Sridhar

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Groundnut farmers’ hopes sink as rains play truant in Saurashtra||RAJKOT: Delayed and deficient rainfall has raised serious concern for the groundnut farmers in Saurashtra region as many of them are staring at crop failure if the monsoon doesn’t revive in the next four to five days. Saurashtra is the largest producer of groundnut in the country with a harvest of nearly 32 lakh to 35 lakh tonnes. This particular period is extremely crucial as it is that time when the crop requires more water. According to farmers, roots of plants penetrate deeper into the soil and therefore the water requirement is high. The state government has announced releasing water from dams for irrigation, but groundnut farmers say it could be quite late for the crop. Pravin Patodiya, a farmer in Jetpur said, “Not many farmers in Saurashtra have irrigation facilities. They are mostly dependent on rain. Water from the dam will take at least five days to reach us, but by then the crop will have failed.” According to agriculture experts, groundnut plants require maximum water 45 days after sowing. At present, this is the second stage of growth and it takes around 90-120 days for yield. Barring the last 20 days, groundnut requires maximum water. Last year, farmers got good returns for groundnut because of high demand in China and this year too they were expecting handsome earnings, but the rain deficit might ruin their hopes. Samir Shah, president of Gujarat state Edible Oils and Oil Seeds Association said, “The average yield per acre is around 400 kg, but if the rains play truant over the next four-five days, it would fall to just around 150kg-200 kg per acre. This means that the overall crop yield would be between 15 lakh to 18 lakh tons.” National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) procures groundnut at minimum support price (MSP) every year and sells the stock to oil millors in this season. Last year was exceptional as the farmers got better prices in the market than MSP. The oil millers are currently importing groundnut for crushing from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal. Kishor Viradiya, president of Saurashtra Oil Mills Association (SOMA) said, “Saurashtra’s land is most suitable for groundnut but the majority area under cultivation is heavily dependent upon monsoon as there is no proper irrigation network. Looking at the current rain figures, we are staring at huge crop failure. For crushing, we will have to depend upon the crop of Maharashtra, south Indian states and Rajasthan.” Groundnut is cultivated in Junagadh, Amreli, Surendangar, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Porbandar and Devhbhumi Dwarka districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/groundnut-farmers-hopes-sink-as-rains-play-truant/articleshow/85312654.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Ranchi||Sonia invites Hemant to Aug 20 oppn meet||Ranchi: Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren is likely to attend a meeting called by Congress working president Sonia Gandhi after the latter formally invited Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) to join the meet of like-minded opposition parties on August 20. JMM sources told TOI on Friday that Soren is likely to attend the meeting of the opposition leaders to counter BJP. “Further rounds of discussions are expected to take place between our working president (Hemant) and leaders of various political groups in the coming weeks,” a JMM functionary in the know of things said. Gandhi’s invitation to like-minded opposition parties is being seen as an effort to build a united front to take on BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha election. Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, his West Bengal and Tamil Nadu counterparts Mamata Banerjee and M K Stalin are expected to attend the meeting. Earlier this month, NCP chief Sharad Pawar also rang up Soren and invited him to be a part of the conglomeration, which is being stitched by Congress and Banerjee to build a united national opposition alliance to take on BJP. Banerjee, RJD working president Tejaswi Yadav, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and DMK chief M K Stalin had attended Soren’s oath-taking ceremony in December 2019. However, Soren had a run-in with Banerjee during the West Bengal assembly election earlier this year. It was due to Pawar’s intervention that Soren refrained from fielding JMM candidates in tribal-dominated assembly constituencies of West Bengal. “Our working president has on several occasions stressed on the need to form a united opposition front to defeat the BJP. Any decision in this regard will be taken by the party leadership after detailed deliberations,” JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee said. In August last year, Soren had attended a virtual meeting of the opposition leaders which was called by Gandhi. “The country and its economy are not in a good shape right now. At this time, I have a feeling that the opposition has weakened. I urge all opposition leaders to come together as one and raise their voice in a resounding manner,” Soren had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sonia-invites-hemant-to-aug-20-oppn-meet/articleshow/85312586.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||BJP, Cong criticise JMM’s 100% job quota demand||Jamshedpur: The demand raised by some JMM MLAs from East Singhbhum district to reserve 100% jobs in both government and private sectors in Jharkhand for Adivasis and Moolvasis has come under severe criticism from BJP and ruling alliance partner Congress. The demand was particularly raised by Ghatsila MLA and senior JMM leader Ramdas Soren after Tata Steel, formerly TISCO, came out with an advertisement on trade apprenticeship. The central party leadership also said they are backing the demand so that Jharkhand get at least 75% reservation in the private sector. Later, the company said it will look into the demands made by Ramdas. Prominent among those who criticised the the demand are former BJP heavyweight and now Independent MLA from Jamshedpur (East) Saryu Rai, BJP Jamshedpur mahanagar president Gunjan Yadav, and senior Congress leader and state finance minister Rameshwar Oraon. Talking to TOI over the issue, JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee said, "In our manifesto for the assembly polls, we had clearly said jobs in both private and public sectors should be 75% reserved for Adivasis and Moolvasis. The party fully backs the demand raised by Ramdas and other MLAs of East Singhbhum region so that Moolvasis and Adivasis get 100% reservation of jobs in private companies." Bhattacharjee brushed aside the allegations levelled by another tribal party and BJP ally, Ajsu-P, that JMM was raising such a demand as the Hemant Soren government has failed to provide its promised five lakh jobs every year. Senior JMM leader and transport minister Champai Soren, who in past had led several agitations in the Adityapur industrial belt to press for the reservation of Adivasis and Moolvasis in private jobs, said the demands were justified and should be implemented. However, state Congress president Rameshwar Oraon said: "In our manifesto, we have said new private companies coming up in Jharkhand should recruit 75% locals." He said talks are on in this regard after the formation of the government in 2019. He added that Congress has not taken any rigid stand on hiring only Adivasis and Moolvasis. Oraon termed the demand raised by JMM MLAs in Jamshedpur as a decision of their party and Congress has nothing to do with it. "Private companies are independent to take decisions. Only moral persuasion can be done, but no law should be thrust on them to decide their hiring process," he added. East Singhbhum district Congress president Bijay Khan said, "Has the Soren government come to power by only securing Adivasi votes?" During elections, JMM seeks votes from all but when it comes to power, it works for the interest of only Adivasis, which is not fair." He added, "If only Adivasis and Moolvasis get jobs in Jharkhand, what will others do? Congress is always standing like a pillar behind the Adivasis to protect their rights but the party does not advocate to steal others rights." BJP Jamshedpur mahanagar president Gunjan Yadav said JMM is trying to create division among people by raising the demand. On Tata Steels' hiring process, he said, "Since the inception of the company here, people from all over the country have come and settled in Jharkhand and worked for its growth. People have lived in harmony and now JMM is trying to sow the "insider-outsider" seed to divide them." Independent MLA Saryu Rai said private companies are independent and can decide on their hiring policies. "Tata Steel should be given a free hand to decide whom to recruit and no party has the right to interfere in this." Rai, a former minister in the Raghubar Das cabinet and began his political career in Bihar, said every private company big or small should hire the best candidate according to his or her merit. Senior JD(U) leader Sharda Devi, too, said jobs in private companies should be open to all and there should be no kind of reservation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-cong-criticise-jmms-100-job-quota-demand/articleshow/85312225.cms||---

Political baiters are trying to malign my image,” he said.Giving brief background, Rathod said he runs an aided ashram shala having classes from Std I to Std XII at Shivpuri in Ghatanji tehsil. “Services of two teachers and a cook were terminated due to their prolonged absence from duty. After following due procedure, the vacant posts were filled,” he said.“One of the newly appointed teachers resigned on April 13, 2017,” said the MLA. The sacked employees had appealed against the termination before assistant commissioner of VJ/NT, which was dismissed. They have challenged the decision before the high court and the case is pending, said Rathod.Meanwhile, the teacher who had resigned voluntarily approached the school trust and requested for a chance to serve again, but the plea was rejected.“Since then, threat messages are being sent using different mobiles. This has been brought to the notice of Wadgaon Jungale station house officer,” said Rathod, adding when these tactics didn’t work, attempt is being made to malign his image. Superintendent of police Dilip Patil Bhujbal said a non-cognizable offence has been registered and an application is moved before the court for permission to collect information from mobile companies. After verifying the woman and MLA’s claims, the police would finalise FIR, he said.Yavatmal Zilla Parishad president Kalintabai Pawar, chairman of education committee Shreedhar Mohod, two district chiefs Parag Pingale and Rajendra Gaikwad were also present at the press conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-minister-rathod-junks-womans-sex-for-job-charge/articleshow/85313335.cms||---

---||Nagpur||In a first, tribal kids attend residential coaching camp in G’chiroli||Nagpur: Keeping up with the ‘tradition’ of innovations in the education delivery process, teachers in Maoist-affected Gadchiroli district successfully completed the first-ever residential coaching camp on Wednesday for small tribal kids. Aged around 11, these children were coached for Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) entrance exams in the remote Bhamragarh taluka for 10 days. The exam was originally scheduled for April, but due to the devastating second wave of Covid-19, it got shifted to August 11. This raised a red flag for all departmental stakeholders considering Bhamragarh’s topography and flooding issues during monsoon. Dharmanad Meshram, block education officer (Bhamragarh), said, “Our first concern was whether these kids will be able to reach Bhamragarh (exam venue) on that particular day because heavy monsoon showers can cut off access routes. Second was how to provide them coaching as physical schools were closed.” With academic future of students at stake, officials took a bold call. Meshram said, “We decided to hold a 10-day residential coaching camp which will allow us to achieve two goals.” First was that students would be brought to exam venue at Bhamragarh well in advance, thus leaving no chance of anyone missing the exam. “Second was that we could provide them focussed training on how to crack the entrance exam,” said Meshram. But he knew that such a never-been-done project, involving minors, was not an easy task. What followed was a well synchronized operation between departments of education, Integrated Tribal Development Programme (ITDP) and even Nagar Panchayat to ensure that kids from some of the remotest regions in Gadchiroli district got the best of coaching at zero cost. “ITDP project officer and assistant collector Shubham Gupta, tehsildar Anmol Kamble, block development officer Rahul Chavhan and Nagar Panchayat official Suraj Jadhav backed the plan and fully committed themselves to it,” said Meshram. As teachers went from village to village for creating awareness, they got an overwhelming response. A record 190 students enrolled for this camp, whereas in previous years (non-residential), the maximum enrolment was around 80. “We too were surprised but overjoyed with this record enrolment and knew that we had to live up to this now,” said Meshram. All the students were accommodated in state-owned students’ hostel, which was currently lying vacant. ITDP officials funded the lodging and boarding costs while the education department provided the human resources. Meshram said, “We had a pool of around a dozen teachers with four of them being present everyday. It was ensured that this group comprised two male and two female teachers.” From 8.30am to 5pm, students had a busy schedule which was interspersed with breakfast, lunch and snack breaks. An early dinner and bedtime made sure the kids were up bright and early next day. With the exam now over, students are back home with their parents. Meshram said, “There is a great desire for learning among our tribal kids and all they need is an opportunity and it is our duty to provide them that platform at any cost. We now await the results, dates of which have not been announced yet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-a-first-tribal-kids-attend-residential-coaching-camp-in-gchiroli/articleshow/85313463.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Tiwari likens razing of shops to karma of physically challenged||Nagpur: Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari’s alleged humiliation of differently abled persons has kicked up a storm.Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s ongoing anti-encroachment drive against roadside hawkers saw demolition of at least 15 shops of physically challenged persons across the city. Tiwari allegedly likened demolition of these encroachments as a punishment for their karma.The remarks drew sharp reactions from differently abled persons who resorted to a sit-in protest outside the mayor’s office from 1pm on Friday. The protest lasted for about three hours.The protesters also parked their tricycles surrounding Tiwari’s official vehicle so that he could not leave the office without resolving their long pending demand that the NMC should spare their kiosks during its anti-encroachment drive. “On the one hand, the NMC is providing various schemes for the ‘Divyang’ category and on the other, Nagpur’s first citizen has insulted us,” said Vidarbha Viklang Sangarsh Samiti president Giridhar Bhajbhuje and vice-president Sukhdev Dudhalkar while addressing the media.They claimed that when the samiti members sought the mayor’s intervention over the anti-encroachment drive, Tiwari said, “Aap logon ko apne karmon ki saza mil rahi hai (you are getting punishment for your karma).”The samiti has been demanding that the NMC construct kiosks for them along the lines of those made for cobblers across the city.The mayor and municipal commissioner only gave false assurances and did nothing to address our concerns, they alleged. “The mayor had assured us that no roadside shop of physically challenged persons will be removed by the NMC’s anti-encroachment squad. Despite the assurance, the civic body is taking action against our shops,” said Dudhalkar.As the sloganeering intensified and protesters got vociferous, the NMC summoned the police. Even a riot control team of Nagpur police reached there to prevent any untoward incident.After three hours of protest, the mayor appeared and ruled out any protection from the NMC’s anti-encroachment drive. Tiwari also claimed that he himself had stopped the NMC team from demolition of some of their shops. He refuted the allegation that the NMC was doing nothing for the Divyang section and clarified that a provision of Rs 7.5 crore had been made for them in the current financial year. Besides this, the NMC had been providing financial help to meritorious students and also sponsoring them for paralympics.To their demand to provide them shops on the lines of cobblers’ kiosks, the mayor clarified that it was the state government’s scheme. He further advised them to meet the district guardian minister Nitin Raut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiwari-likens-razing-of-shops-to-karma-of-physically-challenged/articleshow/85313516.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Goa||Goa: As Vasco’s Saptah begins today, devotees urged not to visit temple but pay obeisance virtually||VASCO: The 122nd Saptah of Lord Damodar at Vasco will commence with the installation of the ‘shreefal’ (coconut) by a member of the Joshi family on Saturday afternoon. The Saptah begins on the sixth day of Shravan. The Saptah, which this year will be observed by following all Covid safety guidelines, annually commences at 12.30pm with the installation of the shreefal near Lord Damodar’s idol and concludes 24 hours later. To ensure safety measures are followed, a team of policemen including two PSIs, 10 constables and two lady constables, will be deployed around the temple. Traffic police will block the road outside the temple on Swatantra Path and divert the traffic from St Joseph Vaz Road and F L Gomes Road. The temple committee has also asked the public not to visit the temple and pay their obeisance through their online platforms on YouTube and Facebook. The 24-hour bhajan programme will be recorded and put up online for devotees. During the saptah, groups of six communities participate in floats depicting scenes from the Hindu mythology and arrive at Damodar temple from different corners of the port town. However, this year, these six groups — Failwale, Nabhik Samaj, Daivaidhnya Bhrahmn Samaj, Bhajarkar Samiti, Vishwakrma Samaj and Gadekar Samaj— have been permitted to give their offerings as per schedule from 2.30pm to 5pm on Saturday with only three members of each group allowed inside the temple. As per legend, in 1899, when a plague claimed several lives in the port town and the outbreak was uncontrollable, a few Hindu families proceeded to Zambaulim temple of Lord Damodar, and carried a shreefal as a symbolic prasad and installed it in Vasco. It is believed that since then, Vascoites regained their health and Lord Damodar became the protector of the town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-vascos-saptah-begins-today-devotees-urged-not-to-visit-temple-but-pay-obeisance-virtually/articleshow/85315774.cms||Ruvina Khan

Officials here said Assam is the first state in the country to do so. The new law has been formulated on the basis of a Model Tenancy Act which was approved by the Union Cabinet on June 2 this year for adoption across all states and Union Territories. The bill was introduced in the assembly on August 9 and was passed on Friday. The earlier Assam Urban Areas Rent Control Act, 1972, stands repealed. The Act will provide a speedy adjudication mechanism for resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants through the establishment of a rent authority, a rent court and rent appellate at the district level. The Act also specifies the duties and obligations of landlords and tenants regarding maintenance and upkeep of premises. There will be no artificial cap in fixing the rent of a premises. The rent of a building will be market-driven and will be determined by mutual agreement between tenants and landlords. “Various contentious issues arise between a landlord and a tenant. Some do not respect agreements when it comes to leaving the premises. This results in landlords not letting out accommodation. After this Act comes into force, the letting-out process will become easie,” said Assam housing and urban affairs minister Ashok Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-first-state-to-set-up-rent-authority/articleshow/85317895.cms||Prabin Kalita

According to ACB officials, Kukma village sarpanch Kankuben Marwada and her husband Amrut Marwada demanded Rs 5 lakh from a company that owns mines in Kukma village for granting permission for carrying out construction near the mines. The firm had already paid Rs 1 lakh in bribe but the sarpanch and her husband were demanding Rs 4 lakh more. The firm’s management approached ACB and lodged a complaint against the couple. “We laid a trap on Thursday evening in which the sarpanch was asked to collect Rs 4 lakh from the firm’s office in Bhuj. Amrut Marwada and his two aides — Ravji Bochiya and Ritesh Bochiya — came there and we caught them accepting Rs 4 lakh bribe. We also arrested woman sarpanch Kankuben Marwada on Friday,” an ACB official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/sarpanch-her-husband-and-two-aides-held-for-taking-bribe/articleshow/85312763.cms||---
---||Nagpur||If teacher assaults student, principal too responsible: Court||Nagpur: While refusing to quash proceedings against a principal, a sessions court here ruled that being a head of the institution, he has the responsibility of anything happening inside the school premises between teachers and students. Additional sessions judge PY Ladekar maintained charges framed by the police against Suyash Convent principal Anurag Pandey under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act for alleged assault and misbehaviour by one of his teachers against girl students. “Undisputedly the accused is the principal of the said school. He was the person along with the managing body, who had employed the first accused teacher to teach dance to the students. Being principal/headmaster of the school, certainly he was having control over not only the students, but also the teacher,” the judge held. The court was hearing Pandey’s application for discharge from the offences registered under Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons) of IPC and JJ Act by the Hudkeshwar Police Station against first accused Manish Raut, a dance teacher from his school, who had allegedly thrashed the minor girls with an iron rod during practice, causing them injuries on November 30, 2011. The complaint was lodged by a father of a seventh standard girl. After the police filed a charge-sheet against both accused, Pandey moved an application for discharge from the crime before judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) through counsel Tejas Deshpande. However, while rejecting his plea, the JMFC held that though he wasn’t present at the spot when assault on girls took place, being a headmaster/principal, he was equally responsible for the offence against minors. The 38-year-old principal then challenged this verdict in the sessions court by filing a revision application through Deshpande. It was strongly opposed by assistant public prosecutor Pankaj Tapase who pointed out that four to five days prior to November 30, 2011, the aggrieved parents had met the principal and lodged a complaint against the dance teacher of alleged misbehaviour. However, Pandey failed to take any action against Raut. Pandey’s counsel contended that the JMFC had committed a grave error of law and evidence submitted by the cops was insufficient to make out a case against the accused. Deshpande said even the JJ Act was not invoked as the principal was not having actual charge of the students. “He has not assaulted, abandoned or neglected the girls. His involvement in the crime is not coming forward from the statement of witnesses,” he said, while stressing on quashing JMFC’s order. While partly allowing Pandey’s application, Ladekar discharged him from Section 324 of IPC, but maintained proceedings against him under Section 75 of the JJ Act. “Prima facie there are reasonable grounds to proceed against the revisionist for the offence under the JJ Act. To that extent, the order passed by the magistrate cannot be faulted with,” the judge said.

---||Goa||Goa gives Rs 2 lakh to 57 beneficiaries who lost family to Covid, CM Pramod Sawant says no death certificate required||PANAJI: Ex-gratia relief of Rs 2 lakh each was handed over to 57 beneficiaries, who lost family members to the virus, on Friday. Chief minister Pramod Sawant also handed over 125 forms to those from the unorganised sector hit by the pandemic to enable them to avail a benefit of Rs 5,000 each. The chief minister said that those who are unable to get the death certificate in time can also submit their forms for ex-gratia payment and the same will be verified and processed on the government's end. “Some people have probably not submitted their form for ex-gratia compensation because they have not received death certificate. Death certificate may be delayed. But even such family members should submit their claims and we will get it verified with GMC if the person's name is there in the Covid death list and process the claim,” said Sawant. He said if two brothers have passed away in the same family, the two families can claim the benefit separately. “I don’t claim that I have done a lot, but Goa is the only state that strived to extend financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh as Covid death relief benefit. It is disheartening that many people have lost their lives due to the pandemic. Some lost two or three family members. Some are suffering having lost an earning family member. So the government initiated steps to help them,” Sawant said. The remaining beneficiaries will get the benefit soon, once their forms are processed. Secretary for social welfare Y V V J Rajshekhar said that those who received the sanction orders will get their money transferred on Friday itself. “One-time package of Rs 5,000 will be given to those in traditional occupations in the unorganised sector like motorcycle pilots, who are hit by the pandemic. We will provide the package before Ganesh Chaturthi on September 10. Forms have been handed over to 125 persons today,” th eCM said. Sawant said as Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in a big way in Goa, he has already instructed deputy collectors to consult Sarvajanik Ganesh Mandals and submit reports so that SOPs for festival can be framed accordingly. “At present cases are still high and everyone should continue to follow all the Covid norms. Everyone should ensure that there is no crowding. They should ensure that they take vaccination as quickly as possible. Vaccination is the only solution,” said Sawant. He said he will begin his campaign for the upcoming assembly polls from Saturday from Saligao constituency. “The kind of response we are getting from the people, we are confident of being elected with full majority in 2022. We are sure of getting elected with 22 plus seats,” the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-gives-rs-2l-to-57-who-lost-family-to-covid-cm-says-no-death-cert-required/articleshow/85315819.cms||---
---||Nagpur||After 21 months, Sena appoints trustee in NIT, NCP yet to do so||Nagpur: Delayed for 21 months since Shiv Sena came to power in Maharashtra in 2019, the party has now appointed one of its leaders to the board of trustees of Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT). Sena has appointed party’s Nagpur district unit (rural) president Sandeep Itkelwar as trustee in the civic agency. He assumed charge in the presence of Ramtek MP Krupal Tumane, Ramtek MLA Ashish Jaiswal and others at the NIT on Friday. After the Maha Vikas Aghadi was formed in November 2019, it was decided to give one post each in the NIT board to the alliance partners — Congress, Sena and NCP. Accordingly, Congress had appointed West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre as trustee in December last year. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is yet to nominate its member. The appointments were delayed to a great extent probably due to uncertainties over giving back powers to the NIT, as the erstwhile BJP dispensation had dissolved the civic agency. The MVA government reversed the decision and granted planning authority powers to the NIT in February. NCP city president Duneshwar Pethe, who is also corporator, told TOI, “NCP follows a procedure for appointments to such posts. There will be an election in the city committee followed by issuance of order from the state unit. Decision is likely to be taken soon.” Two trustees also come from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). BJP is in power in the civic body. Therefore, the party has appointed its corporator Sanjay Bangale as trustee a few days ago. Standing committee chairman is always a trustee in the NIT board. Thus, the incumbent standing panel chief Prakash Bhoyar is trustee by default. With this, four of five posts of public representatives as trustees have been filled in the NIT board. During Devendra Fadnavis-led government, the BJP-Sena had failed to appoint two trustees throughout its full tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-21-months-sena-appoints-trustee-in-nit-ncp-yet-to-do-so/articleshow/85313770.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Following the inspection earlier this month, Goa Consumer Action Network pointed out several issues at the bus stand. They had pointed out the mechanical failure of the gate at the terminus’ parking lot and requested the removal of this gate.

A strong police presence prevented them from entering the station. “We have come here to see what the investigation is about. We cannot simply accept that it is a drowning case. How did the semi-nude body reach the beach? It is a shame for every Goan that something like this has happened. We’ve never seen something like this in Calangute,” they said.

---||Nagpur||NMC to commission 3 STPs on I-Day||Nagpur: In a unique way to celebrate 75th Independence Day, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will commission three mini sewerage treatment plants (STPs) in Shankar Nagar, Senapati Nagar and Mhada Colony gardens on August 15. “The NMC will not only use the treated water from Nag river for maintenance of greenery in its gardens, it will also earn revenue by selling it for construction activities,” said mayor Dayashankar Tiwari while addressing a press conference on Friday. Union minister Gadkari, district guardian minister Nitin Raut, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis among others will remain present during the commissioning of the mini STPs. A brainchild of former water works committee chairman Vijay Zalke, the civic body has planned to install mini STPs at its 12 gardens alongside Nag river and its tributaries across the city. These 12 STPs will help the NMC to reuse 1.05 lakh litres of water per day. Of the treated water, 79,000 litres will be used for gardens and the remaining 25,000 litres will be sold for construction activities, he said. The NMC will provide 4,000 litre water tanker for Rs500 per trip. The civic body has targeted to sell six tankers of water per day and expects to earn Rs3.60 lakh per annum from the sale of treated water. Already, the contractor operating these three mini STPs has deposited 40% of the targeted money which comes to around Rs1.30 lakh. The capital cost of installing 12 STPs was Rs1.14 crore and M/s Right Water Solution Private Limited has been entrusted with the work. “A 180-day deadline has been set for the firm to commission all the 12 STPs,” said the mayor. The Shankar Nagar plant will function on solar power. A red tanker will be used for transporting the treated water for non-potable purpose, said Tiwari and added that Gadkari has promised to provide a CNG-run tractor for transporting the treated water. “We have also approached Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI) for promoting use of treated sewage water for construction activities across the city,” the mayor said. This move will also help NMC to save around 4 crore litres ground water per annum. The mayor also said the NMC is generating Rs62 crore per annum from sale of 320 MLD treated sewage water to power plants in the district.

---||Pune||Pune jeweller held on charge of duping investors of Rs 5.09 crore||PUNE: Pranav Marathe (26) of Marathe Jewellers on Laxmi road was arrested on Thursday night and three members of his family were booked on the charge of duping investors of Rs5.09 crore by failing to repay promised returns on fixed deposits. The jewellery firm had started collecting deposits from people since January 14, 2017. It ran into severe financial trouble by the end of last year. The Pune police’s economic offences wing (EOW) told a special court on Friday that 18 depositors had so far come forward with grievances related to their deposits with the jeweller, ranging between Rs4 lakh and Rs96 lakh, besides investments in gold of varied quantity. The EOW has invoked provisions of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act in the complaint lodged by depositor Shubhangi Kute (59) from Paud road on March 13, apart from the regular penal charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust and common intention. Assistant inspector (EOW) U S Gaikwad and his team produced Pranav before the court of special judge (MPID Act) S S Gosavi, who ordered his custodial remand till August 19. Additional public prosecutor M B Wadekar, while moving a report on behalf of the police, had sought his custody for 10 days. On December 27 last year, Pranav’s father, Milind alias Balwant Marathe, shot himself dead in his office chamber behind their main showroom on Laxmi Road. Heavy financial losses, partly triggered by a prolonged lockdown, and “harassment” by lenders over return of their money were suspected to be the reasons behind his suicide. In April this year, the police arrested a woman lawyer on the charge of abetment in Milind Marathe’s suicide. The lawyer subsequently fell to her death from the eighth floor of the Covid care centre at Sassoon hospital under mysterious circumstances. Deputy commissioner of police (EOW) Bhagyashree Navtakke told TOI, “We arrested Pranav as the first suspect in the case as he held 20% partnership in the investment scheme floated by his firm. His name is in the FIR registered with the Kothrud police on March 11. He was arrested after his role, based on documentary and other evidence, was revealed in the crime.” The police had earlier served a notice to Pranav asking him to join their investigation, but he did not turn up before the EOW officials. His whereabouts were not known for some time as the police did not find him at his residence. On Thursday evening, he was arrested based on a tip-off. Prosecutor Wadekar told the court that Pranav’s custodial interrogation was essential to recover documents of investors like receipts and their transactions, identify bank accounts, to find out if the Marathe family had purchased moveable and immoveable properties after 2012 or invested in firms run by their relatives and others. The remand report stated that Pranav breached the terms and conditions of deed of partnership agreement and deed of securitisation agreement of July 1, 2014, and November 30, 2018. He had later quit the partnership firm. The police had conducted searches at his Erandawane residence and jewellery store, but cash and ornaments of investors were not found, the report read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-jeweller-held-3-kin-booked-on-charge-of-duping-investors-of-rs5cr/articleshow/85315634.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Ahmedabad||Vehicle scrapping policy unveiled; will boost circular economy, says Prime Minister Narendra Modi||GANDHINAGAR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched the national automobile scrappage policy. He said the move will promote a circular economy and make the process of economic development more sustainable and environment-friendly. The policy, aimed at recycling polluting and unfit vehicles, will give a fresh impetus to India's mobility and auto sector, Modi said while addressing the virtual launch of the initiative during 'Investors Summit' organized in Gandhinagar. “We are promoting a circular economy. Apart from reducing pollution, this policy will also make India self-reliant in automobile and metal sectors. We imported scrap steel worth Rs 23,000 crore last year because recovery of metals in our country is not enough. With this policy, we can now recover even rare earth metals in a scientific manner," said Modi. The policy would attract an investment of Rs 10,000 crore and create thousands of employment opportunities, the PM added. Policy based on fitness, not age of vehicle’Data shared by the Union transport ministry revealed that an estimated 1 crore unfit vehicles which can be recycled immediately in India. Of these, 4 lakh are in Gujarat. The summit, attended by potential investors and industry players, was organized to attract investment to set up vehicle scrapping infrastructure under the Voluntary Vehicle-Fleet Modernization Programme. The policy will give a new identity to India in the mobility and auto sector, Modi said. “It will play a major role in removing unfit vehicles from our roads in a scientific manner. It will modernize vehicular population on city roads,” he added. The policy will play a key role in the ‘Waste to Wealth’ programme, Modi said. CM Vijay Rupani and Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari were present at the event in Gandhinagar. Gadkari said the policy is based on fitness and not age of the vehicles. It will boost manufacturing, create jobs and help both Centre and state to earn up to Rs 40,000 crore each in GST, he added. "If we recycle on a continuous basis, we can recover 99% of the materials. As per an estimate, this will lead to a reduction of 40% in the raw material cost, reducing prices and pushing sales," said the minister. As per an estimate, states as well as Centre's GST income would increase by Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 crore each once the sale of vehicles picks up, he added. Sources said the timeline of the policy stipulates final rules of the policy be notified by September 25, 2021. By April1, 2023, mandatory automated fitness testing for heavy commercial vehicles should become effective. From June 1, 2024, phased introduction of mandatory automated fitness testing for all other remaining categories of vehicles should begin. State government officials said it could take a few months for players to set up scrappage infrastructure, after which it will issue specific guidelines on scrapping of vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vehicle-scrapping-policy-unveiled-will-boost-circular-economy-says-prime-minister-narendra-modi/articleshow/85318020.cms||---

Among the seven medal winners from different states, Haryana accounted for four that is three individual medals and two players were part of men’s hockey team. I urge the youth of the state to opt for any sports along with their studies,” said Dattatreya.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Mother murders son, her lover helps||AHMEDABAD: Worried that her three-year-old son would be an impediment to their relationship, a woman and her paramour allegedly killed the child by giving him poisoned milk at a guesthouse near Civil Hospital. The truth came to light when a report from the hospital mentioned that the child had died of poisoning. The police have detained the accused and are interrogating them. Jyoti Parmar, a 26-year-old Naroda resident, was allegedly in a relationship with Bhupendra Parmar, a native of Palanpur who works as sanitation worker in the post-mortem room of Palanpur Civil Hospital. As her three-year-old son Yuvi was an obstacle to their relationship, they decided to kill him. On August 5, Yuvi fell sick. He had high fever. “Jyoti got the idea that if Yuvi was killed while he was unwell, then no one would suspect her or her lover. She spoke to Bhupendra who told her to take Yuvi to a guesthouse near Civil hospital,” said police. On August 6, she told her father-in-law Magabhai that she was taking Yuvi to Civil hospital for treatment as he had high fever through the night “She brought Yuvi to the guesthouse where Bhupendra arrived with a pouch of milk, glucose biscuits and a bottle of pesticide. He mixed the poison with the milk and offered it along with the biscuits to Yuvi,” said police. After consuming the milk, the child fell unconscious and Jyoti returned home with him. “She told her father-in-law that he had fallen asleep. A while later, when Magabhai tried to wake Yuvi, he realized that the boy had high fever and rushed him to Shardaben hospital. Yuvi was admitted to the ICU ward where he died during treatment on August 8,” said police. The doctors told the kid’s father Ajay Parmar that prima facie it seemed as if the the kid had died of poisoning. Meanwhile, the distraught family buried Yuvi’s body at their native place in Palanpur. On August 9, Ajay’s brother-in-law Mukesh Parmar received a report from the hospital mentioning that Yuvi had died of poisoning. Mukesh questioned Jyoti, who confessed to her crime. Shaherkotda inspector K B Shankhla said, “Yuvi’s body was exhumed and a panel post mortem was conducted. Both the accused have been detained and investigation is on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-mother-murders-son-her-lover-helps/articleshow/85318086.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Admissions up in government schools, but funds for school education cut||CHENNAI: Government schools across the state have received 2 lakh more admissions in 2021-22 compared to the previous academic year, but budgetary allocation of funds has been cut by 5%, with teachers and activists saying new appointments and improving infrastructure will be affected. Presenting the state budget for 2021-22 on Friday, finance minister Palanivel Thiagarajan announced Rs 32,599 crore for the school education department, Rs 1,592 crore less compared to 2020-21, but said the sector was accorded the highest importance. P Patric Raymond, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers Federation, said the school education department had received increased budget allocation every year over the last several years. “With 2 lakh students additionally joining the government schools, the school education department may need more funds to develop infrastructure including putting up additional classrooms and more teachers. They may have to extend welfare schemes for all new students in government schools,” he said. Su Moorthy, state coordinator of Federation of Education Development, said the 2020-21 budget did not cut allocation of funds despite the pandemic. “The present budget could have avoided fund cuts as it would affect the appointment of new teachers to government schools. If the student strength increases by 1 lakh in elementary schools, more than 3,000 teachers need to be appointed in government primary and middle schools.” On Friday, the minister said the government will ensure 100% net enrollment in schools. “Even the 0.75% dropout rate at the primary level in 2019-20 will be eliminated and 100% net enrollment will be ensured.” The enrolment in government schools had fallen sharply from 76% of the total student population in 2012 to 53% in 2020, he said. “Quality of teaching in government schools will be accorded highest priority. The government is determined to ensure TN is brought within the first three states in terms of learning outcomes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-admissions-up-in-government-schools-but-funds-for-school-education-cut/articleshow/85318115.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad man is 10th arrestee in Rs 2,000 crore fake billing scam||AHMEDABAD: In connection with the Rs 2,000 crore fake billing scam, the state goods and services tax (SGST) department on Thursday arrested Kirtiraj Sutariya from Ahmedabad. Suspicious documents and evidence were found from the location from where he was arrested, and are being examined by the SGST officials. Sutariya was presented before the additional chief metropolitan magistrate on Friday and SGST officials have sought a 14-day remand. Sutariya’s is the 10th arrest in this fake billing scam, which was unearthed from Bhavnagar. His involvement and whereabouts were identified based on accounts of electronic documents and transaction details, obtained from the place of residence of Mohammad Abbas Meghani alias MM and Afzal Sajwani – who are the key accused in the case. Sutariya was involved in operating some 24 shell companies which illicitly claimed input tax credit (ITC) worth Rs 108.64 crore using fake bills worth Rs 577.32 crore. These fake bills were sold to several other traders for lump-sum amounts. The involvement of some 200 shell companies in the concerned fake billing scam is already being probed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-man-is-10th-arrestee-in-rs-2000-crore-fake-billing-scam/articleshow/85318121.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Budget was a tightrope walk, says finance secretary S Krishnan||CHENNAI: Given the pandemic backdrop, the revised Budget presented by the DMK government, which also happens to be its first, on Friday was a “tightrope walk”, said S Krishnan, state additional chief secretary-finance. “We are going through difficult times. The Covid second wave has led to revenue loss, while the state had to incur additional expenditure to meet exigencies. In addition, there is pressure on the new government to fulfil its poll promises. The revised Budget has been prepared taking all these into consideration,” he told reporters on Friday. “During a pandemic, either reducing expenditure or increasing revenue beyond a point will not help. Hence the tightrope walking exercise.” The approach will be datacentric governance to avoid losses and to manage government assets efficiently, while taking into account people’s expectations. “The focus will be to improve revenue management and to increase revenue,” Krishnan said, underlying the reforms that could be ushered in to ensure social benefits reach the targeted. TN borrowed Rs40,000 crore in past three months and is likely to borrow around Rs 90,000 crore this year. “The borrowings are in tune to handle government expenditures and not just to fund poll promises. Our focus will be to ensure that borrowed funds are spent on capital expenditure.” On lowering state’s own tax revenue by around Rs 9,000 crore, Krishnan said the growth was good in April and May, but fell in June, while July numbers are awaited. The state earns Rs 23,000 crore a year from petroleum products, Tasmac revenue is likely to retain 4% annual growth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-budget-was-a-tightrope-walk-says-finance-secretary-s-krishnan/articleshow/85318150.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: 17 districts report increase in Covid-19 cases, 34 new deaths||CHENNAI: Fresh cases dropped to 1,933 cases on Friday compared to 1,942 on Thursday. Thirty-four new deaths pushed the toll tally to 34,462, when cumulative case tally touched 25.84 lakh. After discharging 1,887 people, the state was left with 20,411 active cases. On Friday, at least 17 districts reported an increase, and the highest difference reported by any district in the last 24 hours compared to its Thursday tally was 13. Coimbatore, which had the highest number of fresh cases, reported the sharpest fall from 249 cases on Thursday to 236 on Friday. Salem reported the sharpest increase to 120 cases compared to 94 on Thursday, followed by Tiruppur, where cases rose to 105 cases from 83 during the same period. Six districts, Dindigul, Tenkasi, Thirupathur, Perambalur, Virudhunagar and Ramanathapuram reported cases in single digits. Besides Coimbatore, Chennai (211) was the only district to report more than 200 fresh cases. Two days after Greater Chennai Corporation reported a cluster of 23 cases from a religious festival at Kilpauk, it found the second biggest cluster of the week in two blocks of Ramaniyam Gaurav Apartment on Model School Road in Sholinganallur. “This one also has 23 cases including six children below 10 years,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan, who inspected the campus. While 17 people are in home isolation, five of them are in covid care centres and one person is hospitalised, he said. Investigations showed 11 people have taken both the doses of the vaccine, four of them have received at least one dose. “Vaccination has probably prevented disease in most people. But they were not able to contain the spread because some service providers such as security personnel are not vaccinated. The apartment does not disinfect frequently touched surfaces,” Radhakrishnan said. “Children are susceptible because they are not vaccinated. So, children below 5 years, who cannot wear a mask, should avoid stepping out. All others should wear a mask and maintain social distance,” he said. Of the 34 deaths, Coimbatore and Chennai reported five each. While Thanjavur and Tiruppur reported three deaths each, five districts reported two deaths, eight districts reported one death each and 21 districts reported zero deaths. Meanwhile, 2.5 lakh people took the vaccine on Friday taking the dosage tally in the government centres to 2.40 crore. In addition, 18.01 doses have been administered at private hospitals since May 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-17-districts-report-increase-in-covid-19-cases-34-new-deaths/articleshow/85318153.cms||---

As a mark of protest, the members walked out. “The chief minister during his election campaign had stated he would be to do away with NEET on priority. However, even after 100 days no clear advisory has been given to the students to get ready for the exams until the exemption for NEET is obtained. The government has caused confusion among students and parents,” Palaniswami said. The former CM said the finance minister has made baseless charges that there was a loss of receipt of Rs75,000 crore under the 14th Finance Commission and Rs 25,000 crore did not reach beneficiaries. “The benefits had been rolled out under the public distribution system. If there are any errors, the DMK could have made changes when they distributed Covid relief. We protest against the finance minister for accusing the AIADMK government of spending lavishly,” Palaniswami said. Palaniswami also condemned the DMK government for foisting cases against former ministers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-opposition-walks-out-over-vendetta-politics/articleshow/85318136.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Police lends helping hand to tackle rising crimes||Kolkata: Kolkata Police has started an outreach programme at three locations — Alipore, Panchasayar and Nadial in the Port area — to warn citizens of modern-day crime trends. At Alipore, police asked private bank officials to join them in spreading awareness on cyber fraud. In attendance were several traders, senior citizens and students. At Panchasayar, NGOs working on women and child rights and against trafficking were asked to speak on the signs of danger. At Nadial, cops focussed on every possible challenge — from new-age cyber fraud to regular crimes like trafficking. “Rather than having our officers speak on the dos and don’ts, we thought it would be better to involve those from the banks’ vigilance and anti-crime wings who can deliver the message directly. Hearing the advice from the horse’s mouth helps grab listeners’ attention,” said an officer from Alipore police. “We designed and distributed leaflets on the awareness campaign,” said Alipore OC Arup Kumar Banerjee. Police have already prepared a list of nine new-age modi operandi used by cyber frauds. “An awareness programme was organised involving around 25 guardians and 30 minor girls from Sahid Smriti Colony along with NGO ‘Gana Unnayan Parshad’ where we advised them on how to stop child marriage and trafficking,” said DC (East) Gaurav Lal. DC (Port) Zafar Ajmal Kidwai said: “Awareness is the key to fight against social injustice, like child labour, crime against women, child marriage, trafficking and cyber fraud. We will continue to spread awareness.” The citizens welcomed the initiative. “We will urge them to hold the camps on Saturdays or Sundays so that more people can participate,” said Bharat Shah, a resident of Sindhu Apartment. “My teenage granddaughter had recently lost Rs 8,000 to an online scam. Many elderly residents known to me have also been victims of cyber frauds in the last one year. We appreciate the cops for holding such campaigns and we will ensure there is maximum participation in the programme,” said Hansmukh Kundalia of Rameswaram Apartment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-police-lends-helping-hand-to-tackle-rising-crimes/articleshow/85315960.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Mangalkot TMC leader murder: CID arrests main accused||Kolkata: The CID has nabbed the mastermind wanted in the murder of Trinamool Congress anchal president Asim Das (45) in Mangalkot. CID homicide branch officers arrested Sheikh Raju from Delhi. According to CID sources, the killing was executed for Rs 5 lakh by contract killers. Although he was a native of Nanoor, Raju now lives in Mangalkot, said CID sources. It is known that he used to do brick business. CID is trying to find out whether any syndicate business deal or any political motive acted as the motive. After being produced in a Delhi court, he will be remanded in transit to Kolkata. According to CID sources, Raju had been on the run since July 12 and had turned off his mobile phone. He was using someone else’s phone. CID tracked that and reached the accused. The CID had earlier arrested one Rafiq Khan, a resident of Guskara, for being allegedly being involved in the murder. The breakthrough came less than a month after the investigating agency took over the probe. Police said technical evidence has proven that the accused was present near the scene of crime and had made important calls. Cops are ascertaining if Khan himself had contacted the hired killers. “We will take him in custody as we have found inconsistencies in his statements. We also need to establish his exact motive,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mangalkot-tmc-leader-murder-cid-arrests-main-accused/articleshow/85315891.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Baby sale cry puts Midnapore cops on alert||Midnapore: Reports of a newborn girl being sold off by her mother sent police and child services officers into a tizzy in Midnapore town on Saturday. A team from Kotwali thana took the woman and her four children, including the baby girl, into protective custody before the alleged deal could be sealed. The person who was allegedly buying the newborn is being detained for questioning. The district child protection department and the child welfare committee (CWC) have launched separate investigations. Preliminary probe suggests the mother — a resident of the Indakuri area — recently lost her husband. She is a rag-picker who reportedly gave birth to her fourth child on Saturday. Residents of Sepai Bazar apparently saw her handing over the baby to another woman and raised an alarm. District child protection officer Sandip Das and his colleague Jayanta Sinha, along with CWC members Anindita Sur and Sima De, spoke to the mother at Kotwali police station.  The woman spoke of abject poverty on camera and how she faced hostility from her in-laws. She was later sent to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital for tests. While a police probe indicates the involvement of two men — one a Sepai Bazar resident and another of Darjipara — the CWC has ruled out baby sale allegations. Sur said: “There was no child selli-ng case. The woman has four children. She gave the baby to be looked after by another woman. Three of her children will stay at a shelter till she returns from hospital. No complaint has been lodged.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/baby-sale-cry-puts-midnapore-cops-on-alert/articleshow/85336965.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Trinamool Congress panchayat member killed in Murshidabad||BEHRAMPORE: A Trinamool gram panchayat member was killed at Murshidabad’s Burwan while he was going for the morning market on Friday, sparking tension in the area. Miscreants waiting in the desolate paddy fields nearby hurled bombs and opened fire at Sheikh Mustafa (28), riding pillion on a bike of one of his loyalists. Burwan Police interrogated the traumatized loyalist who was taking the Kurunnurun gram panchayat member to the local Sundarpur bazaar. The Sundarpur incident is the second murder in Kandi subdivision in the last 24 hours. It came within a day of the killing of a poultry farm owner who happened to be the son of Rajibur Sheikh (31), the pradhan of the Trinamool-run Kumarshanda panchayat on Thursday morning. Though TMC leaders blamed a Congress-BJP conspiracy, locals were not sure of any opposition hand in the twin murders. Mustafa had survived a bomb attack in 2018. Kurunnurun panchayat pradhan Tapan Das demanded “punishment of the culprits”. Trinamool Burwan MLA Jiban Krishna Saha said: “I am in Kolkata and have asked police to identify the culprits. We suspect a Congress-BJP hand in the murder.” BJP Murshidabad president Gouri Shankar Ghosh refuted the charge. “The complaint is baseless. They (Trinamool) are saying all this to cover up conflict within the party,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-panchayat-member-killed-in-murshidabad/articleshow/85315955.cms||Sukumar Mahato

The river has already crossed the extreme danger level (EDL), and more damage is feared. The district administration has cancelled leave of all block and irrigation department employees amid allegation of inadequate relief. Over the last few days, the Ganga, Fulohar and Mahananda were on the rise owing to heavy rain in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The Ganga crossed EDL on Thursday and was at 25.5 metres level at Manikchak on Friday morning. Unprotected areas in Bilaimari, Mahanandatola and Bhutni were already flooded. Thursday night, the Ganga dyke was breached at Hiranandapur, resulting in cracks in 50m of the embankment. Water gushed into Ratua and Manikchak blocks, with over 500 families from the latter being affected. People are being shifted to safer places while repairs have kicked off urgently amid allegations of little help from the administration. Gram panchayet member Pradip Mandal said: “We have received some tarpaulins that were too few to meet the demand.” Meanwhile, erosion played havoc in Kaliachak-3 block. Hundreds of families in Birnagar, in Baishnabnagar police station limits, have lost their houses. The relief centre set up at the local school fell short of providing shelter to all. Many had to spend nights on the road under tarpaulins. District magistrate Rajarshi Mitra said marooned people were being shifted to safety and leave of employees had been cancelled. The government is monitoring the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ganga-breach-floods-30-villages-in-malda-district/articleshow/85316064.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Kolkata||BJP govt using Covid as plea to hide economic downturn, says Sinha||Kolkata: Former Union finance minister and Trinamool leader Yashwant Sinha on Saturday cited figures to argue that BJP was using Covid pandemic as a plea to hide the economic downturn since the Narendra Modi government assumed office in 2014. “The economy suffered a steep slide in terms of all tangible parameters such as growth rate, inflation and unemployment. India’s economy grew from 6.39% in 2013 to 8.26% in 2016. But from 2016, there has been a sharp slide taking away the momentum the economy gained. In 2020, the growth rate came down to -7.96% when the rate was a positive 3.09% during the global economic downturn in 2008,” Sinha said in Delhi. Sinha also dished out unemployment figures and inflation rate during the corresponding period to substantiate his argument. He held that Modi’s demonetisation policy was mostly responsible for the stagflation the country was going through when inflation kept rising despite a fall in growth rate. “If there is a single reason behind the downturn in the economy it is demonetisation, and not Covid. Mark the timing. The PM announced demonetisation in 2016. Figures suggest that the economy hasn’t picked up since then,” he said. The Trinamool leader revealed statistics to show how the BJP government made money at the cost of state revenues and the people at large. “In the 2020-21 financial year, the Modi government hiked petrol prices on 76 occasions and diesel prices on 73 occasions when international crude prices were softening. The excise revenues the Modi government mopped up during his tenure increased manifold, from Rs 75,000 crore to Rs 3.36 lakh crore,” Sinha said. The former Union minister also cited how the Centre increased the cess and surcharge component of taxes (that goes to the Centre) and “deprived” states from their share. “States have been cheated of their share of revenue in the Modi regime. The total cess and surcharge component in 2011-12 was Rs 92,537 crores. It rose to Rs 3,38,482 crores in 2019-20. Since cess and surcharge goes to the Centre, the increase shows how states have been deprived of their dues, Sinha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-govt-using-covid-as-plea-to-hide-economic-downturn-says-sinha/articleshow/85337021.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Scientific’ landfill at Joka to take load off Dhapa||KOLKATA: The city is set to have a new waste-dumping ground, with the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) embarking on a project to take the load off Dhapa, which has been taking the entire load of the city’s municipal solid waste for decades. The corporation has identified a chunk of land to set up a “scientific” landfill near Joka, which will cater to the waste generated in south Kolkata. This would not only reduce the burden on Dhapa, but would also lead to a more sustainable way of handling the city’s 4,500 tonnes of daily waste. A plot, measuring around 35 acres in Rashapunja near Joka, is set to be acquired by the state urban development department and then developed with help from the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to set up a sanitary landfill with adequate precautions to ensure that the “leachate” (a liquid that has dissolved environmentally harmful substances that may enter the environment) does not percolate into the ground water. Also, provisions will be made to prevent trapping of methane in the ground and causing fires, a problem in Dhapa for years. Sources in KMC’s municipal solid waste-handling department said the civic body had sent the proposal of a scientific landfill at Rashapunja to the urban development department and called for its early handover so that work on preparing the landfill could begin. When this landfill site is ready, wastes generated in large parts of south Kolkata, especially added areas like Behala, Garden Reach, Tollygunge and Jadavpur, would be transported to this site instead of being hauled all the way to Dhapa in east Kolkata. Dhapa itself is undergoing a major makeover, with the KMC beginning a reclamation project in which 60 acres would be converted into a sanitary landfill. This area would be carved out of the existing Dhapa dumping ground by bio-mining the waste that is already dumped there to recover metals and other non-biodegradable waste. According to sources, private firms have been engaged for the ambitious reclamation work. In all, 40 lakh tonnes of waste would be moved out in phases. “First, 9 lakh tonnes of waste will be removed, followed by 14 lakh tonnes and then 17 lakh tonnes,” an official said. The biodegradable waste will be converted into manure. Recovered plastic waste would be converted into moulded furniture. Two plants have been set up at Dhapa for this purpose. “At the end of the reclamation process, we shall change the entire area into a sanitary landfill site for a scientific disposal of waste,” said a KMC solid waste management department official. The Rs 260-crore project has been taken up following orders from the National Green Tribunal. Before the project’s completion, however, the KMC wants to make segregation of waste at source mandatory for households. “We will ensure segregation of waste in all 144 wards in phases. We can’t allow mixed waste to reach either Dhapa or Rashapunja once the makeover is complete. We may need to impose penalties on those who don’t adhere to the segregation rule,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/scientific-landfill-at-joka-to-take-load-off-dhapa/articleshow/85315946.cms||Saikat Ray

"We are just trying to help them. This is nothing but a humanitarian gesture," said a senior officer. “We are trying to rope in some volunteers — mostly teachers," added a senior officer at Lalbazar. "With classes closed for over a year, online classes have become a part of our lives. Not all children, however, have access to devices and the Internet.

---||India||Pushed on net-zero goal, New Delhi set to hit back||NEW DELHI: In what could lead to a diplomatic tug-ofwar between developed and developing countries over the ‘net-zero’ goal, India would tell big historical emitters, mostly rich nations, that the country is not responsible for the problem of global warming and it should get its fair share in the ‘carbon budget’ to take care of its developmental needs. The issue will be discussed with the COP26 (26th session of the UN climate conference) president and British MP Alok Sharma, who is visiting New Delhi next week. Sharma is expected to meet environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Wednesday. “Though India has made its point quite clear on several occasions, the meeting would be used to bring the country’s position more strongly in the backdrop of the recent IPCC report,” said an official, flagging that the India is and would always be part of the solution to deal with climate change through its multiple actions to reduce emissions even if the country was not part of the problem. The IPCC in a recent report has projected global average temperature rise would cross the critical 1.5  Celsius level in the next two decades and cause more extreme weather events across the globe. India’s point is going to dominate backroom parleys ahead of the COP26 in November in Glasgow, UK. Though the US, UK and EU are trying hard to bring India on board for a ‘net-zero’ goal (reducing emission of greenhouse gases to zero) by mid-century, the country has been resisting it, arguing that it needs ‘carbon space’ for economic development and meeting sustainable development goals, including poverty eradication, by 2030. India’s cumulative CO2 emissions are much lower, compared to developed nations in proportion to its population, and the country has used a much lower share of the global ‘carbon budget’ (referring to the allowed cumulative emissions of all GHGs) with respect to its population both in longterm (1850-1989), and shortterm period (1990-2017). The difference between actual emissions and the fair shares of the global ‘carbon budget’ of the major economies, shows quite clearly that only India has emitted less than its fair share in both time periods, 1850 to 1989 and 1990 to 2017. India had last month made its stand clear at the G20 ministerial meeting when it reminded the rich nations of their unfulfilled pre-2020 promises and asked them to first deliver on what they had pledged instead of “shifting goalposts” and "setting new benchmarks" (in the garb of ‘net-zero’ goal). Similarly, the country, while reacting to the IPCC’s projections, asked the developed countries to go for immediate deep emission cuts considering how their historical cumulative emissions have pushed the world to current crisis. “The report reaffirms India’s position that historical cumulative emissions are the source of the current climate crisis,” Bhupender Yadav had said while articulating the country’s position and response to the IPCC's scientific findings last Monday. Sharma during his visit is expected to take up the issue of raising ambition with stakeholders, including private industries, in an attempt to convince India to upgrade its NDCs (climate action pledges) under the Paris Agreement ahead of COP26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pushed-on-net-zero-goal-new-delhi-set-to-hit-back/articleshow/85317993.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The government described as absurd comments by Pakistan foreign minister S M Qureshi on the Dasu incident, saying this was yet another attempt by Pakistan to malign India to deflect international attention from its role as “the epicenter of regional instability and a safe haven for proscribed terrorists”. Qureshi accused India’s Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) and Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security of carrying out the attack.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mea-slams-pakistan-bid-to-blame-india-for-terror/articleshow/85318248.cms||---

Officials pointed out that as many as 54 districts recorded zero cases, while 12 districts of the state have become pandemic-free with the active case tally touching a zero. They, however, reiterated the importance of prevention stating that the risk of complications caused by the virus was still there. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that the state is now left with 469 active cases which is over 99% lesser than the peak of 3.10 lakh cases reported on April 30. He added that two persons died of the pandemic infection in the past 24 hours. ACS, information, Navneet Sehgal added that on an average, 2.5 lakh Covid-19 tests are being done in the state every day despite fall in the number of cases. Numbers show that test positivity rate for the past 24 hours was 0.01% and the recovery rate was 9.6%. The two officials advocated the need for prevention despite the decline in cases as the risk of pandemic infection and its complications was still prevalent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-covid-case-in-54-uttar-pradesh-districts-12-other-now-pandemic-free/articleshow/85318267.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Faceless scrutiny; taxpayers benefit, but bugs need fixing||AHMEDABAD: A year after faceless assessment of income tax (I-T) returns was implemented, people’s time has been saved and hassles reduced, but the system needs to get rid of a few technical glitches. Moreover, experts say, taxpayers sometimes experience difficulty in uploading appeals and the video-conferencing facility is at times erratic. A series of representations have been made to the I-T department seeking prompt resolutions of these concerns. “Faceless assessment has certainly improved tax compliance and made the process easy. However, certain aberrations remain,” said Mukesh Patel, an Ahmedabad-based tax expert. “For instance, the provision for hearing exists but it is left to the discretion of I-T department officials.” Patel added: “This is an unfair proposition in the scheme itself, not just for assessment but for appeal too, which must be corrected.” Varis Isani, a tax advocate, said: “A number of technical challenges such as glitches on the e-filing website remain.” Isani added: “Over the past two months, uploading appeals has been difficult due to some technical glitch on the website. Moreover, the video-conferencing facility is often not available.” In fact, following a slew of representations related to the faceless system, a grievance redressal system was introduced only last week for assessment, appeal, and penalty matters. After the tax reform was introduced on August 13, 2020, some 1.06 lakh faceless assessment orders have been passed as on April 2021 across India. Estimates by the I-T department in Gujarat suggest that at least 5% of these orders (roughly 1,000) were issued to taxpayers in Gujarat. With faceless assessment, there is higher dependence on big data analytics and artificial intelligence to identify cases for scrutiny. Tax practitioners said that a number of assessment orders have been framed in violation of the prescribed norms. “A taxpayer has the right to seek a hearing and cannot be compelled to go for an appeal straight up,” said Naitik Mehta, a chartered accountant. “This needs to be rectified in the current faceless assessment system.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-faceless-scrutiny-taxpayers-benefit-but-bugs-need-fixing/articleshow/85318254.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Hyderabad||Instant talaq is now through ‘khula’ in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh||HYDERABAD: The criminalisation of instant divorce or triple talaq has unwittingly led to a spurt in `khula’ cases in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Fearing jail term if they invoke instant divorce, many men, who want to divorce their wives, are forcing them to seek `khula’. ‘Khula’ is a process of separation of married couples in which the woman seeks divorce. Since ‘khula’ is granted on the woman’s request, the man cannot be held responsible for the instant divorce. Muslim religious scholars and qazis, who are authorised to solemnise marriages and grant divorce, blame the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 for the jump in ‘khulas’. Ayesha* was forced to settle for a ‘khula’ when -- after three years of mental and physical torture – she finally decided to raise her voice last year. This was when her unemployed husband, who had claimed to be a driver when they got married, insisted on getting a DNA test done for their just-born daughter. “He accused me of having an affair with someone and the child not being his. When I resisted, he and his mother beat me. I sought a divorce, but he refused. I had no choice but to take ‘khula’ for the safety of my child,” the 25-year-old said. She does odd jobs from her house in Golconda now, to make some money. That the number of ‘khula’ cases has increased is clear from the recent warning issued by the Telangana waqf board to qazis. Board chairman Mohammad Saleem warned qazis not to hurry through the ‘khula’ requests. Talaq cases drop but problem remainsQazis should check the veracity of the request and make it doubly sure it is not an altered case of triple talaq, before issuing ‘khula’ certificate,” he said. “Of course, there may have been a drop in cases of instant talaq, but the problem remains. The new legislation has further cornered Muslim women, particularly hailing from lower strata. Instead of a man pronouncing instant talaq, he is forcing his wife to take ‘khula’. Either way, the woman is the sufferer,” said Moulana Mohammad Hussamuddin Sani Aqil. Moulana Hussamuddin, who is popular as Amir-e-Millet-e-Islamia (leader of Muslim community), told TOI that increase in ‘khula’ cases is a cause for concern. Questions are asked when such a woman seeks remarriage as the prospective husband and his relatives make sure to know the reasons for ‘khula’. This is because many hold the woman at fault and responsible for the divorce. Aware of such social scrutiny, Sayeda* still decided to accept ‘khula’ when she found out her husband was having an affair with his sister-in-law. She had already been living away from him and wasn’t getting any monetary support. “He told me he was going overseas and will never have anything to do with me again. ‘Khula’ was my only choice; at least I can remarry now,” Sayeda said. Mufti Mastan Ali, a senior scholar of Islamic jurisprudence, and his wife, who is also a mufti, run ‘Shariah Panchayat’ to amicably resolve matters relating to Muslim personal law including divorce and ‘khula’ cases. According to him, there has been a two-fold increase in ‘khula’ cases while there is a drop to the same extent in triple talaq cases. “This means there is no letup in the cases of instant talaq. It has only changed its form to ‘khula’. Muslim women continue to suffer as before the passing of the new legislation,” Mufti Mastan said. The waqf boards in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh do maintain records of divorce as they are the authorised bodies to issue divorce certificates. But the records are not up-todate as many do not approach the board to get the certificate. They simply take the divorce forms from the local qazi.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: YS Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter alleges threat to her family||HYDERABAD: Former MP YS Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter Suneetha Narreddy has alleged that some persons did a recce of her house in Pulivendula town in Kadapa district and demanded that police do a threat analysis. In a complaint to Kadapa district SP KKN Anburajan, Suneetha said CCTV cameras recorded suspicious movements of certain persons near her house on August 10 evening. As the CBI has speeded up the probe into the murder of Vivekananda Reddy, the complaint of Suneetha gains significance. Vivekananda Reddy was murdered on March 15, 2019 at his Pulivendula home. “The CCTV footage shows a person going on a bike from the main road, crossing my house and further going to the end of the road. He returns in the opposite direction within two minutes, stops in front of my compound next door, finishes the phone call, goes inside briefly, removes the mask and appears to talk to someone. He then turns around and drives in the direction of the main road. There are no houses on this street,” she said in her complaint. Siva Shankar prime suspect: SuneethaShe said the person on the motorbike bore resemblance to a man in one of the flexis in the town. “The flexis were put up on the occasion of D Siva Shankar Reddy’s birthday,” she said. After Suneetha informed local CI Bhaskar Reddy on the suspicious activity of a person, the latter visited her house and collected the details. “The inspector brought the alleged person with him who waited outside the house. He said the person was Manikanta Reddy (28), a caterer looking for a place for his business,” she said. Suneetha, however, alleged Manikanta is a close confidant of Siva Shankar Reddy. “His photo was on the large flexis all over Pulivendula. The flexis were removed overnight by the time this complaint was made.” She further alleged that Siva Shankar Reddy was the prime suspect in the murder of her father YS Vivekananda Reddy. “I made this charge with every investigation officer since August 2019. I am not aware of the real intentions behind the movement of Manikanta Reddy. This appears more like someone doing a recce of the house and the surrounding areas,” she said. She also said: “My father’s was a political murder. I named several influential persons and politicians from this area as likely suspects. Due to the nature of the crime, security concerns of my family have been brought to the notice of police on several occasions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-ys-vivekananda-reddys-daughter-alleges-threat-to-her-family/articleshow/85318235.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt plans to tighten restrictions, but CM Basavaraj Bommai rules out lockdown||BENGALURU: Wary of a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections, the state government may consider reimposing some restrictions, especially now that the festive season has begun. Revenue minister R Ashoka suggested these curbs could kick in after August 15. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai is scheduled to meet senior health officials and experts on Saturday to discuss the pandemic situation and he will take a call on reintroducing restrictions, besides rethinking the decision to reopen schools for classes 9-12, sources said. However, Bommai has ruled out a lockdown. Although there has been no significant rise in fresh Covid-19 cases – daily infections in the state have hovered between 1,300 and 1,900 – for the past few weeks, the government is wary of letting its guard down, especially after the ferocity of the second wave. The government has already issued an order prohibiting congregations during Krishna Janmashtami, Muharram, Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Puja, and other celebrations and festivals. It has also banned the organisation of social, political, recruitment, cultural, and religious programmes during these festivals. Burden on peopleEarlier on Friday, Bommai, who was on an official two-day tour of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts, indicated there will not be a lockdown either in specific districts or statewide. While overall cases have not risen, Dakshina Kannada did see a rise in cases which was attributed to a spillover from neighbouring Kasaragod district in Kerala. “I don’t want to burden people by imposing a lockdown,” Bommai told reporters. “We are trying to prevent imposing one. We are reactivating collaborations with the private sector in the state to manage the pandemic. Health camps will be held in schools to reach out to children.” The CM cancelled a visit to checkposts near the Kerala borders in Dakshina Kannada after intelligence inputs suggested he could face the ire of protesters from Kerala. People on the other side of the border are upset with Karnataka’s decision mandating negative RT-PCR reports for anyone from Kerala to enter the state. Commuters Kerala are particularly incensed since Karnataka has made negative test reports mandatory even for fully vaccinated people. However, Bommai asserted that he has directed officials to allow people from neighbouring states only if they furnish Covid negative reports that are not older than 72 hours. With Dakshina Kannada and Udupi district did raise concerns over a rise in infections among children, Bommai had called for an emergency meeting with experts in Bengaluru on Friday but cancelled it soon after returning to the state capital. He said since experts have warned that children (0-18 years) will likely be the most affected during a possible third wave because they are not vaccinated, the state is taking adequate precautions to protect children. “We have already launched the ‘Vathsalya’ scheme in Udupi and Haveri districts to monitor the health of children continuously. We will organise paediatric health camps and will do all necessary to treat lack of nutrition and undergrowth,” he said. While health department data shows 543 children in the 0-19 age group in Bengaluru Urban contracted the disease between August 1 to August 11, health officials insisted there is no cause for alarm. Of the infected children, 210 children belonged to the 0-9 age group, while the remaining 333 were above 10 years old. Officials say a huge majority are primary contacts of infected adults. No Covid-19 related death in the age group 0-19 years has been reported and the infected children were mostly asymptomatic or only had mild symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-govt-plans-to-tighten-restrictions-but-cm-basavaraj-bommai-rules-out-lockdown/articleshow/85318294.cms||---

The armed forces are fully equipped to deal with any challenge that endangers the safety, security, unity and integrity of the country, the minister said, while flagging off a series of events to mark the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence being celebrated as ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’. Noting that the decisions aimed to promote ‘jointness’ among the armed forces will play a pivotal role in bolstering the national security infrastructure, Singh said that no stone is being left unturned to make the country self-reliant in defence manufacturing. The country’s dependency on imports has decreased considerably due to the measures taken by the government, including notifying two ‘positive indigenisation’ lists to promote self-reliance and defence exports, he added. Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, in turn, said that the armed forces are ready to deal with any challenge, stressing that efforts taken to increase jointness among the Army, Navy and the Indian Air Force will further enhance their combat capabilities. Among the events flagged off by the defence minister were the expeditions by the Army teams to scale 75 mountain passes. These include Saser La in Ladakh, Stakpochan in Kargil, Satopanth and Harshil in Uttarakhand, Phim Karnla in Sikkim and Point 4493 in the Tawang region of Arunachal Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-aims-to-be-self-reliant-powerful-says-defence-minister-rajnath-singh/articleshow/85318293.cms||---

It is being constructed at the Vaishnodevi Circle. A 6-lane flyover at this crossroad was recently dedicated to public by the Union home minister Amit Shah. The Rs 31 crore project is now being handled by the roads and buildings department of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) which is handling the 6-lane project of Sarkhej-Gandhinagar highway. NHAI officials said that the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) has given the funds and has directed the NHAI to construct the underpass running parallel on SP Ring Road. Construction work has already begun and it is likely to be completed by December this year, they said. An artist’s impression of how it will look after the construction is overThis underbridge along with the existing flyover at this junction will clear heavy traffic congestion issues witnessed there. Like the flyover, the underbridge will also be of six lanes, officials said. Around 85% of the traffic from SG Road and SP ring road passing from this junction go straight onto both these roads. Only 15 % coming from SG Highway turn on to the ring road and vice versa. SG Road has become one of the busiest roads of Ahmedabad city over the past 10 years and experiences traffic snarls often. “As both Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar are expanding towards each other, traffic to and from Gandhinagar has been on the rise,” said an AUDA official.” The multiple-laning of the road and a series of flyovers along with this underbridge will solve this issue, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-sp-ring-road-underbridge-to-be-ready-by-december/articleshow/85318296.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: 84% college pupils have taken first dose of vax||BENGALURU: ‘Marali Collegige’ (Back to College), Karnataka’s ambitious programme to vaccinate all its college-going students against Covid-19, has achieved 84% coverage. The drive kicked off on June 28 with the aim of inoculating over 24 lakh students. As on August 4, more than 19 lakh students have got at least one dose of the vaccine, official data accessed by TOI shows. Bengaluru City has recorded nearly 80% coverage, but three districts have recorded far lower coverage than average: Bengaluru Urban (45%), Vijayapura (51%) and Mysuru (61%). Students from other states who have come to Karnataka for academic purposes are also being covered, say officials. On-campus classes began in the state on July 26 and only vaccinated students are allowed to attend. More than 100%In some districts, the coverage has gone beyond 100%. In Bagalkot for example, data shows 67,156 students have taken the dose as against a target of 59,723 students. Ditto with 12 other districts — Chamarajanagar, Udupi, Uttara Kannada, Haveri, Kodagu, Mandya, Davanagere, Chitradurga, Raichur, Hassan, Gadag and Chikkaballapura — where coverage of first dose among college students is more than 100%. Asked how this is possible, officials involved in the exercise say: “Many students who have not yet returned to their campuses have taken doses in their hometowns or villages in other districts.” Officials also said the targets in several districts were revised downwards and the actual performance is not as bad as the data makes it appears. Health department officials in Vijayapura say the target was changed at least thrice, and they have vaccinated almost all eligible students. Supply crunchDr Rajkumar Yargal, district health officer (DHO), Vijayapura, indicated all students would have been inoculated had supply of doses been adequate. “We have to prioritise areas bordering neighbouring states along with vaccinating eligible people including college students. We need a higher supply of doses to organise and plan camps,” said Dr Yargal. Dr Srinivas GS, DHO, Bengaluru Urban district, said many students in rural areas of Bengaluru Urban district had already taken the vaccine in Bengaluru hospitals but their vaccination status was not reflected in the data the state has on vaccinated students. “Currently, we have 99% coverage among students,” said Dr Srinivas. CN Ashwath Narayan, minister for higher education, said there are some students who have taken vaccines in private hospitals on their own and this data is not reflected in data with the state. “Projection itself could be more like in Ramanagara district. The data was collated from college managements. If any district has shown poor coverage, we will follow it up,” he said. The minister said students are given the option to continue with online classes if they wish, but attendance has been made compulsory irrespective of whether students take classes online or on-campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-84-college-pupils-have-taken-first-dose-of-vax/articleshow/85318374.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The House was later adjourned sine die, ending the second session of the 15th legislative assembly, while opposition members formed a "protection wall" against corruption at the main entrance of the complex. As soon as the question hour began, the UDF MLAs started shouting slogans and raised banners demanding Vijayan to shed his silence on the charges. Speaker M B Rajesh said the matter was disposed of on Thursday itself. After nearly 20 minutes, opposition leader V D Satheesan announced boycott of the proceedings. The opposition MLAs marched out of the house and continued their protests there. After inaugurating the wall, Satheesan said the CM was scared of replying to allegations in the assembly. He will have to give a proper reply in the assembly, which is why he is keeping quiet. He is only interested in a monologue, where no one can respond to him,” opposition leader V D Satheesan said. The speaker had denied permission for an adjournment motion on the matter on Thursday, maintaining that assembly rules do not permit discussion of a subject under consideration of a court. “The privilege of MLAs to speak inside the assembly is above all such rules. Even Parliament discusses such matters and there are several precedents in the state assembly itself,” Satheesan said. He said the opposition had to organize a mock adjournment motion outside the assembly complex on Thursday. It will continue to fight corruption outside the assembly, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/opposition-boycotts-assembly-again-seeks-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayans-reply/articleshow/85318388.cms||---

The court, while admitting the arguments, has issued notices to the central and state governments, Madrasa Board, minority commission and both the education boards, central and state. Mukesh Jain moved the high court with a PIL seeking abolition of the state Madrasa Board Act 2020 while raising questions on its constitutionality and objectivity. In his petition, he stated that the Act was violation of the basic spirit of the Indian Constitution which terms India as a secular federal republic. “This Act acts as promotion to a specific religion and in any secular nation, no government can attempt to promote a singular religion,” the petition stated. He further stated that it was not a prerogative of any state to introduce such an Act and hence must be repealed as no other minority religion has been taken care of in this Act. Referring to education policy, the petitioner stated that there is a universal education policy in the country and all the institutions including madrasas are inclusive in this policy with no exception to madrasas. He also termed it unlawful to provide buildings and other resources to the minority communities by the state government. Allowing the petition, the division bench of chief justice Indrajit Mahanty and justice Vineet Kumar Mathur as PIL, has issued notices to the central government, state government, state Madrasa Board, minority commission, CBSE and RBSE seeking reply in four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/rajasthan-madrasa-board-act-challenged-in-high-court/articleshow/85318352.cms||---

The government is also hoping that the DNA vaccine the scientists are working on may see the light of the day in the coming months. The government also feels that expansion of manufacturing of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin will further bolster vaccine supplies in the months ahead. Data available with the health ministry show that in August, Serum Institute of India is expected to provide 15 crore doses of Covishield while 3 crore doses of Covaxin are expected. Besides over 1 crore doses of Sputnik are also expected. Covaxin is emerging as a point of focus for the long term as the government expands its manufacturing capacities. Also the government is awaiting the outcome of the efforts of scientists to make a DNA vaccine. If successful, it is expected to be a game-changer that would put India on the world map as the first country to come out with such a vaccine. Meanwhile, India’s cumulative Covid vaccination coverage crossed over 53 crore doses on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-government-expects-supply-of-20-crore-doses-of-vaccines-in-august/articleshow/85318422.cms||---

A huge chunk of the mountain face suddenly collapsed and fell on the riverbed, blocking the flow of the water in the Chenab and a huge lake was formed upstream. Nearly two dozen villages, both downstream and upstream, were evacuated. Four houses were submerged, some livestock was washed away and two women trapped in water were rescued after a long struggle by the villagers. The huge lake was formed after thousands of tonnes of debris blocked the river flow for more than two hours. The water level became stable after the river managed to make its way through the debris, but the danger of lake outburst flood kept the authorities on high alert throughout the day. When the water level of the river rose dangerously, the district administration shifted people from lower villages to higher regions. Teams of police, disaster management authorities and officials of all the departments started evacuating villages both upstream and downstream of the Chenab. Residents of Jasrath, Tadgan, Galling, Lobar, Ratauli, Lower Kukumseri, Adhat, Lower Shenoor, Lower Kishori, Nepali colony of Salpat, Koraki, Lohani, Lower Chhating, BRO’s colony at Udaipur, lower portions of Udaipur and people from many other villages were shifted to higher areas. Two women from Junda village, Suman and Damyanti, who were trapped when the river water entered their house, were injured in their frightening ordeal. “I was completely inside water. I couldn’t breathe for a long time and was struggling to stay above the water level. I thought I’m going to die. Water had risen till Damyanti’s neck, We screamed for help. My brother Sushil and other villagers got information that we are trapped inside the house. They took a risk to save us. My hand got fractured and Damyanti too sustained injuries,” said Suman. “Taking precautionary measures, all the villages downstream and upstream of the river have been evacuated. The river water from the lake-like dam is now flowing over the debris. The situation is under control. The houses of Devi Singh and Sushil have submerged in the incident. Devi Singh’s three sheep and one cow have also washed away in the water. Till the last report, the water level had started receding below danger level after it started flowing over the debris,” Lahaul-Spiti superintendent of police Manav Verma said. The Chenab river is in spate these days due to heavy rains and the melting of the glaciers. The Chenab originates in the Lahaul valley when the Chandra and Bhaga rivers meet at Tandi village. The river flows from Himachal to Jammu & Kashmir before entering Pakistan. This is the first time that a landslide blocked the flow of the Chenab river, locally known as the Chandrabhaga. Before this, massive avalanches have blocked the flow of the Chenab. A few decades back, the Chenab was blocked for almost a day after a snow avalanche and lake outburst flood had wreaked havoc downstream as it damaged many bridges, washed away roads and agricultural land. CM Jai Ram Thakur said a team led by cabinet minister Ram Lal Markanda was sent to the spot to take stock of the situation. “All possible efforts will be made to normalise the situation. Officials have been directed to ensure that there is no loss to human lives. People have been requested not to go close to rivers and landslideprone areas.” Markanda along with chief secretary Ram Subhag Singh and police chief Sanjay Kundu carried out an aerial survey of the spot and met the affected people. “The landslide had blocked the flow of the Chenab for a long time. Had the water not made its way through the debris, it could have caused massive destruction. I met the affected families. Some houses have submerged and agricultural land has been damaged along with stranding crops,” Markanda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/artificial-lake-forms-as-landslide-blocks-chenab-for-2-hours/articleshow/85318535.cms||Suresh Sharma

Making this announcement in the assembly in his maiden budget speech, Tamil Nadu finance minister Palanivel Thiagarajan said the scheme will be restricted to women with less than two surviving children with effect from July 1. The policy will help the state’s target of increasing the number of babies who are breastfed in the first six months of life. It will also help mothers get back to good health in a short period of time, said officials from the social welfare department. “Tamil Nadu provides cash benefits, free vaccination and nutrition supplement for mothers and babies.

Finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, presenting the revised Budget for 2021-22 to the assembly, announced the tax cut. “I am happy to inform the House that this government has decided to reduce the effective rate of tax on petrol by Rs 3 per litre and thereby provide major relief to the toiling working class people in the state. This measure will result in a loss of revenue of Rs.1,160 crore a year,” the Finance minister said. Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers Association president K P Murali said that in Chennai the price of petrol now is Rs 102.49 and it is sold up to a maximum of Rs 104.48 in other parts of the state. A cut of Rs 3 per litre would bring down the price commensurately in respective regions, he added. Tamil Nadu is the first to have cut tax on petrol following the spurt in retail fuel prices since May. Before the downward revision, the state levied 15% plus Rs 13.02 per litre tax on petrol, which translates into a tax of Rs 24.26 a litre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dmk-government-to-cut-tax-on-petrol-by-3/litre/articleshow/85318578.cms||---

The Election Commission of India has asked the CEO in Goa to cap the number of voters per polling booth at 1,000. He also informed the parties that Covid-19 patients, those who are above 80 and those with more than 40% disability will be able to cast their vote from home, through ballots. Representatives from BJP, Congress, MGP and Goa Forward Party were present for the meeting. “As per the guidelines of ECI and because of Covid, they have decided to cap the number of voters at polling stations to 1,000, which means new additional polling stations will be created. This is to prevent crowding at polling stations,” said GFP vice-president Durgadas Kamat, who was present at the meeting. Kunal informed the parties that the pre-poll process has begun, with the revision of electoral rolls set to commence from November 1. The revision and voter verification process will continue till November 30. “Covid patients, those who are disabled and those who are above 80 will be able to cast their vote from home. ECI officials will go to their home with ballot papers. The election commission has organised a special camp for those who do not have disability certificates, to help them get disability certificates,” said an official with the CEO’s office. The ECI has also launched an app, Suvidha, for political parties to seek requisite permissions during the elections. “An app called Suvidha has been created for all political parties to seek permissions through a single platform. All departments like police will be integrated with it, so it will save their time also and ours too. Like last time, we may not have to run around,” said Kamat. During the meeting, Congress reiterated its objection to the appointment of most BLOs in the Mormugao constituency from a single constituency. “We have raised a concern regarding Mormugao, where out of 29 BLOs, 16 are from one department, the electricity department, and this has been going on for quite a long time,” said state party vicepresident Altinho Gomes. Kunal has informed the political parties that similar meetings will be held every month to iron out any hiccups in the pre-poll process and to prepare for the coming assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-to-beat-covid-ec-to-add-polling-booths-let-80-above-vote-from-home/articleshow/85318602.cms||---

Referring to the 127th amendment of the Constitution, Jhorar said after this bill becomes a law, a new list of OBC (other backward castes) will be made by the state governments. He urged the coalition government of Haryana to include Jats in the OBC list. He said the right to prepare a new list of backward castes has been given to the state government, and chief minister Manohar Lal and deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala have got a golden opportunity to fulfill this demand of Jats. He demanded the inclusion of Jats in the list of backward castes, saying that Jats basically correspond to Yadav and Gurjar castes. The social and economic status of these three castes is similar. If the other two castes can get reservation then Jats should also get it, he said. The Khap leader, while highlighting the contribution of Jats from the freedom struggle to filling the country with foodgrains, said Jats have played an important role in the independence of the country and made the country self-sufficient in the production of foodgrains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/include-jats-in-obc-list-demands-jhorar-khap/articleshow/85315493.cms||---

Essentially, it means that the GDA can no longer impose the two cess on new projects in Raj Nagar Extension and will have to return the additional amount taken from some developers of the area. The GDA, however, has the legal option to move the Supreme Court against the high court’s division bench of justices Sunita Agarwal and Justice Vipin Chandra Dixit that dismissed its review petition on August 11. The development authority started charging Rs 750 per sqm as metro cess and elevated road cess in 2015, and has so far collected close to Rs 450 crore from the developers of Raj Nagar Extension. GDA’s contention was that since RNE residents stand to benefit directly from the Hindon elevated road and the Dilshad Garden-New Bus Adda metro projects, it was within its rights to impose the two cess. However, the high court in February this year ruled in favour of a consortium of 27 developers — Raj Nagar Extension N.H.58 Developers Association —that had challenged the GDA’s decision to impose the additional amount. “The consortium filed the case in 2017, and the ruling came after nearly four years,” said Gaurav Gupta, president of CREDAI’s Ghaziabad chapter. The RNE developers argued in the court that the metro and the elevated road are for everyone, “so why only RNE builders are made to pay”. GDA, on its part, said that the two projects cost the authority Rs 3,000 crore and it also had to take a loan of Rs 800 crore from the NCR Planning Board for its elevated road project. “While the Hindon elevated road has offered direct connectivity to RNE, the Hindon metro station was planned for the benefit of RNE,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, chief architect and town planner, GDA. “Since RNE is a direct beneficiary to these two projects, we were advised to impose the two cess on the developers of the area. Moreover, the two projects fuelled the sale of properties in the township. As for the court’s decision against us, we have not exhausted our legal options yet,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/raj-nagar-extn-cess-allahabad-hc-dismisses-gdas-review-plea/articleshow/85313217.cms||Abhijay Jha

Modi said, “A massive question of our past, present and future is if Shivaji Maharaj was not there, what would have been our situation. It is impossible to imagine India’s form, its glory without Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. What he did in his time, the same role was played by his legend, inspirations and stories after him... Veer Shivaji’s management, his use of naval power, his water management are still worth emulating,” Speaking in Marathi, the PM said his “prayer to Parmeshwar (God) was that He should give him the strength to follow the ideals established by Shivaji Maharaj and the teachings imparted by him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-talks-about-shivajis-hindavi-swaraj-in-video/articleshow/85318626.cms||---

The weekly postivity rate (WPR) of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) areas was 2.5% and that in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits was 3.7%. Pune rural areas this week registered a WPR of 4.9% — 0.6% less than the last week’s 5.5%. The positive vibe in the district’s WPR data before the weekly Covid review meeting in the weekend would strengthen the case of some business bodies seeking more relaxations. With all the three administrative units in Pune recording a slide in WPR, the final decision on whether the relaxations announced by the state government would be applicable to the district or not is expected to be taken in the review meeting. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao told TOI that any proposals on further relaxation in timings would be discussed in the meeting. “While the WPR has declined to almost the lowest ever over the past many months, we must remain very cautious, follow the Covid appropriate behaviour and maintain the restrictions as outlined in the orders. If there are any violations of norms, cases are bound to increase,” he said. Rao said the rural administration had been successful in identifying the hotspots and isolating those infected at the earliest. “The IEC (information, education, communication) activity propagating Covid appropriate behaviour has also yielded results. The stress on CAB (Covid appropriate behaviour), along with speeding up the vaccination in the areas with high positivity rate, will be the focus areas,” Rao said. The ward-wise monitoring and speeding up of vaccination in areas with high positivity rate helped bring down WPR in both PMC and PCMC areas also, he said. “Early detection, followed by early test results, helped. The death rate, too, has dipped and is 1.5% in Pune as against 2.2% for the state,” he said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe said one should not throw caution to the wind following a slight dip in WPR. He stressed on strict monitoring of Covid appropriate behaviour, double masking and vaccination. Ahead of the possible third wave of Covid-19, the district administration has slowly increased the bed capacity by 7,000 and pushed up the oxygen storage facility to 55,000 MT. On the vaccine shortage, the Pune divisional commissioner said, “We have the capacity to vaccinate nearly 1 lakh people daily. But there has been a delay because of vaccine unavailability,” he said. Analysing the breakthrough infections in the district after the first and the second dose of vaccine, it was found that the severe cases were associated with comorbidities, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/districts-weekly-positivity-rate-drops-to-7-month-low/articleshow/85315127.cms||Nisha Nambiar
