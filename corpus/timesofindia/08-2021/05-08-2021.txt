In his report, the deputy commissioner of Hassan said seven persons have been arrested so far and the postmortem report said it could be a case of asphyxiation or poisoning. Preliminary probe revealed since the monkeys were damaging their crops, villagers took the help of monkey catchers and while transporting them, the monkeys could have died due to suffocation. Submitting the DC’s findings, additional government advocate V Sreenidhi told the court the FSL report is still awaited. He said at least 10-12 monkeys escaped from a jute sack when a curious passerby cut it open on the night of July 28. After perusing the DC’s report, a division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka said some legal issues have to be looked into, especially the sections that need to be invoked against the alleged culprits. The hearing was adjourned to Monday. 56 cases in Bengaluru Urban since 2018-19The high court was informed on Wednesday that 56 cases of problematic monkeys have been recorded in Bengaluru Urban district since 2018-19. In his statement submitted in response to a PIL on monkey menace in the city, the deputy conservator of forest, Bengaluru Urban division, said BBMP has a helpline (080-22221122) for those saddled with ill and injured monkeys and rescue teams will rush there. A division bench said the authorities have to frame a proper policy for catching monkeys; it cannot be left to individuals alone, as is prevailing now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/sit-to-probe-monkey-deaths/articleshow/85049876.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Study hard, play harder: City toppers share their secrets to success||This has been a difficult year for all, especially for the students who appeared for their board examinations. With having to attend online classes, not getting to meet their friends, missing school premises, their board examination getting cancelled and constant anxiety about the results - students had to undergo a lot of stress. Now that the results are out, CT quizzed the six school toppers about their POVs on the education system, their suggestions to juniors and more. Read on... HARSHIT JAIN: Our education system should be flexible, practical and learning-oriented (picture above) School: The Heritage School, Kolkata Scored: 99.8% (Science) in ISC Study tips: I would advise my juniors not to take too much pressure. They should keep their concepts clear and work hard. No one needs to study all the time to get good marks. Instead, one should be methodical and consistent in studying. One should have fun too. I expect the education system to be such that’ll urge students to explore outside the pre-set syllabus. Students should fall in love with the idea of learning and not just focus on getting good marks. It should be flexible, practical and learning-oriented. Hobbies help relieve stress: When I am not studying, I listen to music and watch television shows. I play football and it serves as a great way to release stress. I am a social person and often go out with my friends or parents to chill. Lessons learnt during the pandemic: The pandemic made me realise that we should be flexible with our plans and be ready for any disasters in life. No matter what, we must deal with the situation and make the most of whatever comes our way. However, I regret the fact that my final year of high school was online. ANWESHA GHOSHAL: It is important to take breaks as much as it is essential to work hard School: MP Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School Scored: 98.2% in ICSE Study tips: Let us focus our energy in doing something worthwhile, let us be sincere and be the best version of ourselves in whatever we choose to do. It is important to take breaks as much as it is essential to work hard. I want the education system to nurture the natural inquisitiveness and interests of every student. Rather than focusing on a student's marks and percentage, the education system should hone one's potential and prepare them for the future. Hobbies help relieve stress: I always had a passion for music. So, I either listen to music or sing during my free time. Dancing and reading storybooks are effective ways to beat the stress as well. Lessons learnt during the pandemic: The pandemic taught me that we take things too much for granted. I realised how much I missed going to school and that even in this crisis, life must go on. Initially, online classes felt odd. I missed interacting with my teachers in person. However, I got used to it and everything turned out well. I’m grateful to live in an era where we can interact with our friends and family even without stepping out of our houses. MAYUKHI GHOSH: The Education Boards should start considering alternatives to the traditional three-hour exam modelSchool: Modern High School for Girls Scored: 99.5% (Humanities) in ISC Study tips: One should try a lot of different activities, explore new subjects, participate in events and identify what suits him/her the best, regardless of whether that activity features in the academic list or not. The next step would simply be to focus on that activity and honing your skills, constantly adapting and upskilling yourself. The education system must offer varied opportunities to all its students and facilitate exposure to challenging and stimulating environments. I believe the Education Boards have to seriously start considering alternatives to the traditional three-hour exam model. The one thing that I would like to change about the education system is the rigid curriculum, especially for higher secondary students. By making a small portion of the syllabus choice-based, students will be able to explore the subject in-depth and develop a more research-based interest in the subjects. Hobbies help relieve stress: I feel happy reading a book in my free time. I indulge in playing the guitar or I paint when I have time. Lessons learnt during the pandemic: The pandemic made us look at things with a renewed perspective, be it the way we interact with our peers or classroom learning. The biggest lesson we learnt was that we must keep working on ourselves so that we can face any challenges in life. While this year was certainly testing, my difficulties feature very low on the spectrum. PRASHANT JHAWAR: It is important we realise that intellect is what a one must strive for, not marks School: Apeejay School, Park Street Scored: 98 % (Humanities) in CBSE (Class 12) Study tips: A winner is made of one's efforts rather than results and it's just a matter of realising our potential. We should never doubt ourselves. Do what you are good at. Education is perceived as a rat race by a lot of students. Marks get more importance than knowledge. It is important we realise that intellect is what a student must strive for. Every student learns in a different way. Since all of us are special in our own ways, it is likely that we all require special ways of learning instead of a single method. Hobbies help relieve stress: In my free time, I watch various OTT contents, play the guitar or ride my bicycle to lighten my mood occasionally. But above all, I think I enjoy sleeping the most. Lessons learnt during the pandemic: The lockdowns provided me with an opportunity to work upon my drawbacks in various subjects. It also gave me a chance to instill spirituality, which is known to bring peace of mind. But I really missed my last and supposed-to-be memorable year at school, got separated from my teachers and friends and that was upsetting. SIDDHIKA SWARUP: It is essential to introduce an analytical approach for learning instead of rote learning School: La Martiniere For Girls Scored: 99% (Science) in ISC Study tips: Keep working, don’t think about results. There will be times when you will want to give up. But that’s also the time when you need to believe in yourself and move towards your goal. I believe finding the correct balance in life is essential. You should not only work hard but also play harder. The education system should shift its focus to a more holistic way of assessing candidates rather than considering the marks on just one set of examinations. With the introduction of technology and the availability of information on our fingertips, it is essential to introduce an analytical approach for learning instead of rote learning. Hobbies help relieve stress: During my free time, you will often find me reading a book while sipping a cup of coffee. Other times, I enjoy calligraphy, trying out various recipes, and swimming. I am also a trained Kathak dancer. Lessons learnt during the pandemic: The pandemic has helped me value the simple pleasures of life. The importance of spending time with our loved ones has become prominent. The significance of both mental and physical health has become paramount. Despite the difficulties in adjusting to online classes and not being able to meet our friends in person, I feel that the lockdown had multiple benefits too. The time that was usually spent in travelling could be utilised in pursuing various hobbies. RIK RAUNAAK:Our education system lays a greater emphasis on our memorization abilities rather than knowledge, which in my opinion should changeSchool: The Future Foundation School, Scored: 98.6 % in ICSE Study tips: The only suggestion I have for my juniors is that they must engage in extracurricular activities. All of us have a passion — be it visual arts, performing arts or even sports! Pursuing this passion benefits us in the long run. Studies are important, no doubt, but these interests of ours are what keep us going. Our education system lays a greater emphasis on our memorization abilities rather than knowledge, which in my opinion should change. I expect our education system to educate every student about what is going on around the world, in different fields and sectors, in a fun way. Hobbies help relieve stress: I am an avid listener of Indian classical music and also a voracious reader. Other than that, I love playing my musical instruments. Lessons learnt during the pandemic: Being disciplined and using time judiciously are certainly among many things that the pandemic has helped me learn. Adjusting to this new normal was distressing. Meeting with our friends, virtually, did not fill the void of not going to school, but certainly did ease the pain. Cancellation of the Board Examinations was the toughest part, but things worked out just fine in the end. ARNAJA CHATTERJEE: I would want online education to spread across regions in our country, as that’s our future School: South Point High SchoolScored: 99.6% in CBSE (Class 10) Study tips: I want to advise my juniors that learning is more important than the marks we get. Don’t stress too much as it can affect your health. Online education has become the future for students in this current situation. So, I would want online education to spread across regions in our country. I want all our students to be taught about mental health in their classes. Hobbies help relieve stress: I do a lot of things in my free time. I read storybooks, listen to music. I am also an ardent fan of films and TV series. Lessons learnt during the pandemic: The pandemic taught me the value of life and health. Online classes were a new concept to all of us. So, it was quite difficult for me at first to cope up with it. As time went by, I realised that online classes also have their own pros and cons. Finally, I am grateful to my school for teaching and helping us in every way possible during these tough times.

---||World||Will new CDC moratorium keep tenants housed?||BOSTON: After a federal eviction moratorium was allowed to lapse this weekend, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new moratorium Tuesday on evictions that would last until Oct. 3. The new moratorium aims to keep millions in their homes and prevent the spread of the coronavirus’ delta variant. The order cites the fact that there are lower vaccination rates in areas most at risk for eviction. The moratorium also give states additional time to get out nearly $47 billion in rental assistance, most of which has yet to be distributed to tenants and landlords. Who benefits from the new moratorium? Most tenants facing eviction and who counted on the CDC moratorium in the past should be protected. The new ban would temporarily halt evictions in counties with “substantial and high levels” of virus transmission and is expected to cover areas where 90% of the US population lives. The number of tenants protected is likely to change, however, since it would stop being applicable in counties that go 14 days without seeing substantial or high levels of coronavirus transmission. Counties that are not covered now, but later experience spikes, would also fall under the moratorium when that happens. There are concerns among advocates that judges, especially in rural areas, may ignore the CDC moratorium as some did earlier in the pandemic. Already, a lawyer in North Carolina said Wednesday that a judge refused to accept it as a defense because the Administrative Office of the Courts has not provided any guidance on it. How can a tenant use the moratorium to prevent an eviction? Just like the original CDC moratorium, a tenant facing eviction for nonpayment of rent must fill out a form and present it to their landlord or the owner of the property. The new order makes clear that someone protected by the original CDC order would still be protected. It also says that anyone in court for nonpayment of rent but whose case has not yet been completed would be protected by the order. But as was the case previously, the order would not protect someone who engaged in criminal activities, damaged their apartment or threatened the health and safety of other residents among other violations Will this order survive legal challenges? After pushing the CDC to reconsider its options, President Joe Biden acknowledged Tuesday that he wasn’t sure the new moratorium could withstand lawsuits about its constitutionality. Landlords had successfully challenge the original order in court. When the US Supreme Court allowed the eviction ban to remain in place through the end of July by a 5-4 vote, one justice in the majority, Brett Kavanaugh, wrote that Congress would have to act to extend it further. Landlords groups reacted to the new order as they did the old one, criticizing it as an unfunded government mandate. They have yet to detail their legal strategy, though most housing advocates are counting on more lawsuits. Even if the order is overturned in court, advocates are hopeful it gives states enough time to get rental assistance out. What more could be done for tenants? Housing advocates have called the extension the best option given the current situation. Most would have liked Congress to take up the issue and pass a comprehensive eviction moratorium. But that is unlikely in the current political climate. The other option is for states and cities to pass their own moratoriums, as many did during the pandemic. California, New York and New Jersey are among a handful of states that still have moratoriums in place. But it’s unlikely that states or cities will enact their own, especially with the CDC extension in place. For most advocates, the focus remains on getting states to speed up the distribution of rental assistance — seen as the best long-term option to keeping tenants housed over the long-term and making landlords whole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/will-new-cdc-moratorium-keep-tenants-housed/articleshow/85049756.cms||---

Continuing with their demand for a debate on these issues, leaders of 14 opposition parties said the responsibility for the deadlock in Parliament lies squarely with the government and urged it to respect parliamentary democracy by accepting their demand for a discussion on them. In the joint statement, 18 leaders from 14 parties said it is unfortunate that the government has "unleashed a misleading campaign to malign the combined opposition" and blaming it for the continued disruption of Parliament proceedings. "The responsibility for the deadlock lies squarely at the doorsteps of the government, which remains arrogant and obdurate and refuses to accept the opposition's demand for an informed debate in both the houses," the statement said. The statement issued by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, DMK's T R Balu and Tiruchi Siva, Congress' Anand Sharma, Samajwadi Party's Ramgopal Yadav, Derek O' Brien and Kalyan Banerjee of Trinamool Congress and Sanjay Raut and Vinayak Raut from Shiv Sena, urged the government "to respect parliamentary democracy and accept the demand for discussions". Manoj Jha (RJD), CPM's Elamaram Kareem, CPI's Binoy Viswam, AAP's Sushil Gupta, IUML's Mohd. Basheer, NC's Hasnain Masoodi, RSP's N K Premachandran and LJD's M V Shreyams Kumar were also among the signatories of the joint statement. The opposition statement comes after the government attacked Congress and other opposition parties for the disruptions in Parliament since it opened for the monsoon session on July 19. PM Narendra Modi had on Tuesday led the attack asking BJP MPs to "expose the party (Congress) before the public and the media". The statement said: "The opposition parties stand firm and united on their demand for a discussion on Pegasus issue in Parliament, replied to by the home minister, as this has national security dimensions."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-a-show-of-unity-14-parties-counter-govt-on-parliament-logjam/articleshow/85050630.cms||Mohua Chatterjee
---||World||Trial opens over gruesome killing of 4 in North Dakota||FARGO, ND: An attorney for a man accused in the gruesome killings of four people at a North Dakota property management firm said Wednesday that the case amounts to a rush to judgment based on bad information that led to the wrong conclusion. A prosecutor, though, said every piece of the puzzle leads to the defendant. Chad Isaak, 47, of Washburn, is on trial for the April 1, 2019, deaths of RJR Maintenance & Management co-owner Robert Fakler, 52, and co-workers Adam Fuehrer, 42, and spouses Bill and Lois Cobb, 50 and 45. He pleaded not guilty to four counts of murder and three other counts. It was one of the most heinous crimes in North Dakota history, defense attorney Bruce Quick acknowledged in his opening statement. Three of the victims were shot and stabbed. Combined, the four of them were stabbed about 100 times. Prosecutor Karlei Neufeld began the trial being livestreamed from Mandan by describing the horrific crime scene and said evidence would include photos, surveillance video, lab reports, bullet fragments, and a knife and other things found during searches of the suspect's home and vehicle. "Each piece of evidence you will receive in this case will be like a piece of a puzzle,'' Neufeld told the jury. "And ... as you start putting them together, you'll be able to see a clear picture of what took place.'' Quick spent a good chunk of his opening pointing out what evidence was overlooked or not investigated. Law enforcement was under a "tremendous amount pressure to solve this case'' and only took four days to decide that Isaak, a Navy veteran and chiropractor, fit the description of the killer, he said. Among the numerous possible suspects were people who have either been evicted or sued by RJR, as well as a long list of disgruntled RJR employees who were fired, Quick said. The longtime defense attorney from Fargo said police failed to check out the hot-headed ex-husband of a woman who allegedly had an affair with Fakler. "This case is a rush to judgment based on erroneous information that led to erroneous conclusions,'' he said. Quick accused law enforcement of contaminating the crime scene by in many cases failing to wear protective gear or signing a log book indicating they were there. One of the prosecution's key witnesses, a woman who allegedly identified Isaak as the man she saw outside of a McDonald's near the crime scene, estimated the man to be about 5-foot-9 when Isaak is 6-foot-4, Quick said. Quick ended his opening statement by listing numerous items connected to Isaak that either showed no DNA link to him or relevance to the case. Earlier, Quick noted that nobody has been able to find a motive for the slayings. RJR managed the mobile home park where Isaak lived, but he has been described as a model tenant who paid his rent early with a credit card. "This is not a case about what happened, this is a case about who did it,'' Quick said, later adding that "there is no why."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trial-opens-over-gruesome-killing-of-4-in-north-dakota/articleshow/85050447.cms||---

Instead of tourists, the Hotel Ciego de Avila will hold up to 240 low-risk pediatric patients, officials say, while the Las Canas Motel will have 53 beds for pregnant women with the coronavirus. They are also ordering isolation of whole households when a virus is detected. "The people are very frightened. Every day, more sick, more deaths - a relative, a neighbor, a friend," said Mayi Del Valle, a 49-year-old library worker from the town of Ceballos in the province, speaking by phone Wednesday. "There are people treating Covid in their houses based on herbs.'' Cuba's national director of epidemiology, Francisco Duran, said Wednesday that the province accounted for 23 of the 98 new deaths from Covid-19 recorded the previous day in the country of 11 million people - the nation's highest death toll yet in the pandemic. The province of some 430,000 people had about twice as many deaths as in the capital of Havana, a city of 2 million. The west-central province of Matanzas, famed for the beach resort Varadero, was the center of infection last month, but the wave there seems to have receded. Deputy Prime Minister Jorge Luis Tapia and health minister Jose Angel Portales were sent to Ciego de Avila, about 400 kilometers (240 miles) east of Havana, and government news media said official were sending more ambulances and 100 bicitaxis, which can be used for logistical support. Since the start of the pandemic, Cuba has recorded 3,091 deaths and 422,614 confirmed infections, a huge share of them just in recent weeks. The country had been highly successful in keeping the virus at bay last year, but cases began shooting up after a brief period of relaxed controls at the start of 2021. The Pan American Health Organization also expressed concern Wednesday about rising infections in Cuba. "This is due to the delta variant, which has been reported by authorities in various places in the country," said Ciro Ugarte, director of health emergencies for the organization, during a news conference in Washington.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/hotels-become-hospitals-as-cuba-battles-soaring-covid-cases/articleshow/85051210.cms||---
---||World||Huge California fire grows as heat spikes again across state||GREENVILLE, CALIFORNIA: California’s largest wildfire exploded again after burning for nearly three weeks in remote mountains and officials warned Tuesday that hot, dry weather would increase the risk of new fires across much of the state. Firefighters saved homes Monday in the small northern California community of Greenville near the Plumas National Forest as strong winds stoked the Dixie Fire, which grew to over 395 square miles (1,024 square kilometers) across Plumas and Butte counties. “Engines, crews and heavy equipment shifted from other areas to increase structure protection and direct line construction as the fire moved toward Greenville,” the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, said Tuesday morning. Evacuations were ordered for the community of about 1,000 people as well as for the east shore of nearby Lake Almanor, a popular resort area. About 3,000 homes were threatened by the blaze that has destroyed 67 houses and other buildings since breaking out July 14. It was 35% contained. Crews contended with dry, hot and windy conditions “and the forecast calls for the return of active fire behavior,” Cal Fire said. Similar weather was expected across Southern California, where heat advisories and warnings were issued for interior valleys, mountains and deserts for much of the week. Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. More than 20,000 firefighters and support personnel were battling 97 large, active wildfires covering 2,919 square miles (7,560 square kilometers) in 13 US states on Tuesday, the National Interagency Fire Center said. Dry conditions and powerful winds made for dangerous fire conditions again on Tuesday in Hawaii. Firefighters gained control over the 62-square-mile (160-square-kilometer) Mana Road Fire that forced thousands of people to evacuate over the weekend and destroyed at least two homes on the Big Island. About 150 miles (240 km) west of California’s Dixie Fire, the lightning-sparked McFarland Fire threatened remote homes along the Trinity River in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The nearly 25-square-mile (65-square-mile) fire was 5% contained Tuesday. In southern Oregon, lightning struck parched forests hundreds of times in a 24 hour-period, igniting 50 new wildfires as the nation’s largest blaze burned less than 100 miles (161 kilometers) away, officials said Monday. Firefighters and aircraft attacked the new fires before they could spread out of control. No homes were immediately threatened. Oregon’s Bootleg Fire, the nation’s largest at 647 square miles (1,676 square kilometers), was 84% contained and is not expected to be fully under control until Oct. 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/huge-california-fire-grows-as-heat-spikes-again-across-state/articleshow/85051707.cms||---
---||World||Facebook shuts out NYU academics' research on political ads||Facebook has shut down the personal accounts of a pair of New York University researchers and shuttered their investigation into misinformation spread through political ads on the social network. Facebook says the researchers violated its terms of service and were involved in unauthorized data collection from its massive network. The academics, however, say the company is attempting to exert control on research that paints it in a negative light. The NYU researchers with the Ad Observatory Project had for several years been looking into Facebook's Ad Library, where searches can be done on advertisements running across Facebook's products. The access was used to "uncover systemic flaws in the Facebook Ad Library, to identify misinformation in political ads, including many sowing distrust in our election system, and to study Facebook's apparent amplification of partisan misinformation,'' said Laura Edelson, the lead researcher behind NYU Cybersecurity for Democracy, in a statement. Facebook's action against the NYU project also cut off other researchers and journalists who got access to Facebook data through the project, Edelson said. The researchers offered Facebook users a web browser plug-in tool that let them volunteer their data showing how the social network targets political ads. But Facebook said the browser extension was programmed to evade its detection systems and vacuum up user data, creating privacy concerns. In a blog post late Tuesday, Facebook said it takes "unauthorized data scraping seriously, and when we find instances of scraping we investigate and take action to protect our platform." Facebook sent a cease-and-desist letter to Edelson and another researcher, Damon McCoy, in October but didn't shut down their accounts until Tuesday, hours after Edelson informed the platform that she and McCoy were studying the spread of disinformation on the platform about the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, the researchers said. Mike Clark, Facebook product management director, wrote in the blog post that the Menlo Park, California, company welcomes research that holds it accountable but that doesn't compromise the security of the platform or users' privacy. "While the Ad Observatory project may be well-intentioned, the ongoing and continued violations of protections against scraping cannot be ignored and should be remediated," he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/facebook-shuts-out-nyu-academics-research-on-political-ads/articleshow/85051913.cms||---

One, BJP honoured its word by inducting maximum number of turncoats and two, the credibility of the Jarkiholi brothers is on the wane. On Wednesday, 10 of the 12 ‘outsider’ MLAs who made it to the cabinet were beaming on air. As expected, the new government did see some casualties with those considered ‘weaker links’, including Shrimanth Patil, R Shankar, AH Vishwanath and H Nagesh, being shunted out despite being among the 16 legislators who defected from the JD(S) and Congress to propel BJP to power. Nonetheless they are likely to be accommodated in posts of chairpersons for boards and corporations. However, Congress has already started to cash-in on Patil’s exit by projecting his drop from the cabinet as an insult to the Maratha community. Patil was with Congress before switching camps. Khanapur Congress MLA Anjali Nimbalkar, who is also from the same community, said on social media: “Maratha community is neglected by the BJP time and again by denying cabinet representation. They removed the only Maratha minister for no reason and insulted Marathas. Marathas will never forget the use-and-throw political policy.” It may be recalled that Maratha votes were split in the Belagavi Lok Sabha bypoll due to the entry of Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES), which reduced MP Mangala Angadi’s victory margin over Congress to just 5,000 votes. However, despite being a Maratha from Belagavi and textiles and wakf minister in the previous Yediyurappa government, Patil was nowhere to be heard or seen during the campaign. On the other hand, the central leadership’s decision to not induct either Ramesh or Balachandra Jarkiholi into the new cabinet suggests that the credibility of the Belagavi saukars’ family has taken a beating. This is the first time in over 17 years that not one of the five politically active brothers made it to the cabinet. Since 2004, either Satish, Balachandra or Ramesh Jarkiholi have held ministerial berths from either of three parties — JD(S), Congress and BJP. But after the sex CD scandal earlier this year allegedly involving Ramesh, the brothers were shunted out by BJP. In fact, Satish Jarkiholi who is with Congress lost by a narrow margin at the Belagavi bypoll and failed to become an MP. Sources within the party say Balachandra’s name was not considered even the second time. Earlier, his name was rejected by Yediyurappa on account of Ramesh being embroiled in the CD case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bjp-keeps-its-promise-inducts-ten-outsider-mlas-jarkiholis-miss-bus/articleshow/85051983.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The entire complex, which in totality will occupy 110 acres and includes the 66 acres granted by the Supreme Court, is likely to be ready sometime in 2025. The complex will include a museum explaining the manuscripts and legal history of the Ram temple as court disputes date back to the British administration. The final cost of the temple is expected to be in the region of Rs 900-1,000 crore. It is likely to open to the public a few months ahead of the schedule of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. In a background briefing, sources said the year since the foundation stone ceremony on August 5, 2020 has been spent in sorting out important issues of foundation materials and readying the site for construction. "It may seem that an year has gone by and there is no construction over ground. But it was found that the debris below the site was as deep as 12 metres," said the source. The deep pit needed to be filled with roller compacted concrete comprising mainly of fly ash with aggregate sand and cement. It is yet to be decided if the idol to be placed at the garbha griha will be the one kept under a makeshift structure post demolition of Babri Masjid in December 6, 1992. "This decision will be taken by the sadhus. Of course, the (existing) idol of Ram Lalla will be in the temple," the source said. The main temple will have three floors and five mandaps and its length will be 360 feet, width 235 feet and height of each floor will be 20 feet. The shikhar will rise to 160 feet from the ground. Heritage structures like Kuber tila and Sita koop will be preserved and developed. Since it may take around 3 hours for a devotee to reach the sanctum, the complex is being developed in a manner that there will be sites of interest as visitors wend their way to the inner part of the temple. The stone needed for construction is being sourced from Bansi Pahadpur area in Rajasthan. Mining had been stopped there, but the stone needed for the temple is being procured in exchange for afforestation.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Dissidents lose out as do some BS Yediyurappa loyalists||BENGALURU: Detractors of former chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who were identified as dissidents of the previous government, have been left out in the cold as they couldn’t make it to the new cabinet headed by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. The troika of rebels — Aravind Bellad, CP Yogeeshwara and Basanagouda Patil Yatnal — seems to have been left high and dry after all their ‘hard work’ to dislodge Yediyurappa. They did not gain anything politically except for seeing him unseated. In fact, there is a sense of greater heartburn since Yediyurappa’s confidant Bommai finally benefited from their rebellion. While this may appear as a consolation for Yediyurappa’s supporters, who were all along opposing the proposal to take the dissidents into the cabinet, in reality there is little for them to cheer since the former CM could not get his son BY Vijayendra a berth. Yediyurappa even failed to make his close aides MP Renukacharya and SR Vishwanath ministers. BJP senior functionaries said this reflects on the strong policy of the high command aimed at discouraging indiscipline and groupism within the party. “The message is that nobody can dictate terms to the party when it is under the strong leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Most of the party loyalists have welcomed the move,” said MLC Lahar Singh Siroya. Bellad had been projected as the CM candidate to replace Yediyurappa despite his zero experience in administration. The point that was being highlighted in favour of the two-time MLA from Hubballi-Dharwad west was that he is a young face representing the politically dominant Panchamasali sub-sect of the Lingayat community. Dharwad district politics too seems to have come in Bellad’s way with veteran Jagadish Shettar backing another Panchamasali legislator, Shankar Patil Munenkoppa (Navalgund), as his choice of minister from Dharwad. “I think Bellad was made a scapegoat. After projecting him as the next CM, they did not even make him a minister. This shows there is entrenched faction politics and budding leaders like Bellad are falling prey to this,” said GB Patil, national general secretary, Jagatik Langayata Mahasabha. Yatnal, who was a vocal critic of Yediyurappa and Vijayendra, hoped to be rewarded with a ministerial berth for his rebellion. He shaved his beard after the ouster of Yediyurappa as a mark of ‘mission accomplished’ and even openly expressed his desire to be minister in team Bommai. But the high command chose to send a strong message against indiscipline by excluding him. The wound Yogeeshwara is nursing is deeper as he lost his ministerial post just before completing seven months in office. He seemed to have paid the price for criticising the chief minister despite being a minister. “I was confident that I would be inducted into the cabinet as my fight was against corruption and aimed at protecting the clean image of BJP. But the ups and downs are nothing new to me. I will handle it,” said Yogeeshwara. But two party loyalists KS Eshwarappa and V Sunil Kumar were taken on board despite them criticising Yediyurappa. Party leaders said their unquestionable loyalty towards BJP worked for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dissidents-lose-out-as-do-some-bsy-loyalists/articleshow/85052125.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka cabinet expansion: Old guard stands firm, younger lot waits in vain||BENGALURU: The party objective to encourage young blood yielded limited results as chief minister Basavaraj Bommai didn’t induct many younger persons reportedly due to pressure from various quarters. Some members of the state core committee said the next elections will be fought under a young, collective leadership and the brass wanted at least 50% of the cabinet to be first-timers. However, of 29 ministers inducted on Wednesday, just six are first-timers and only three are between 45 and 50 years — V Sunil Kumar (45), K Sudhakar (48) and B Sreeramulu (49). While the majority are 60-plus, four are over 70 and 10 are in 50-60 age group. Although Bommai and the leadership took a lot of time to prepare the list and give preference to new faces, sources said they had to compromise due to political compulsions. “The party wanted to make the best use of the experience of seniors for organisational work. We relieved some seniors who make way for younger legislators,” Bommai said. Before Yediyurappa stepped down, the party’s intent to drop seniors caused a flutter. In a purported audio clip, state president Nalin Kumar Kateel said seniors like Jagadish Shettar and KS Eswarappa would not be in the new cabinet and more young legislators would get an opportunity. A miffed Shettar opted out, while Eshwarappa briefly raised the banner of revolt. Some mutts representing Kurubas threatened BJP that it wouldn’t get the community’s votes if Eshwarappa was kept out.This prompted the party to strike a compromise and only five ministers were dropped. While CP Yogeeshwara lost out due to his dissident activities, Laxman Savadi, Aravind Limbavali and S Suresh Kumar were given party responsibilities. Some dissidents said a few senior functionaries have been repeatedly chosen for the cabinet since 2006, when BJP joined hands with JD(S) to form a coalition government depriving youngsters the opportunity. “A few have been considered this time. I hope more youngsters will get the opportunity in future,” said Sunil Kumar, a first-time minister now. However, many party functionaries are upset. Senior MLC Lahar Singh Siroya said: “Seniors should have taken a cue from Shettar and voluntarily made way for younger legislators. The aim was to develop a new crop of leaders, but the number of younger people in this cabinet is not enough.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/old-guard-stands-firm-younger-lot-waits-in-vain/articleshow/85052158.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||World||This year's summer of climate extremes hits wealthier places||WASHINGTON: As the world staggers through another summer of extreme weather, experts are noticing something different: 2021's onslaught is hitting harder and in places that have been spared global warming's wrath in the past. Wealthy countries such as the US, Canada, Germany and Belgium are joining poorer and more vulnerable nations on a growing list of extreme weather events that scientists say have some connection to human-caused climate change.  "It is not only a poor country problem, it's now very obviously a rich country problem," said Debby Guha-Sapir, founder of the international disaster database at the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters at Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. "They (the rich) are getting whacked."  Killer floods hit China, but hundreds of people also drowned in parts of Germany and Belgium not used to being inundated. Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the US had what climate scientist Zeke Hausfather called "scary" heat that soared well past triple digits in Fahrenheit and into the high 40s in Celsius, shattering records and accompanied by unusual wildfires. Now southern Europe is seeing unprecedented heat and fire.  And peak Atlantic hurricane and US wildfire seasons are only just starting.  When what would become Hurricane Elsa formed on July 1, it broke last year's record for the earliest fifth named Atlantic storm. Colorado State University has already increased its forecast for the number of named Atlantic storms - and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Wednesday said it was expecting one or two named storms more than it predicted in May.  For fire season, the US West is the driest it has been since 1580, based on soil moisture readings and tree ring records, setting the stage for worsening fires if something ignites them, said UCLA climate and fire scientist Park Williams.  What happens with US hurricane and fire seasons drives the end-of-year statistics for total damage costs of weather disasters, said Ernst Rauch, chief climate and geo scientist for insurance giant Munich Re. But so far this year, he said, wealthier regions have seen the biggest economic losses.  But when poorer countries are hit, they are less prepared and their people can't use air conditioning or leave so there's more harm, said Hausfather, climate director of the Breakthrough Institute. While hundreds of people died in the Pacific Northwest heat wave, he said the number would have been much higher in poor areas.  Madagascar, an island nation off East Africa, is in the middle of back-to-back droughts that the United Nations warns are pushing 400,000 people toward starvation.  Though it is too early to say the summer of 2021 will again break records for climate disasters, "We're certainly starting to see climate change push extreme events into new territories where they haven't been seen before," Hausfather said.  The number of weather, water and climate disasters so far this year is only slightly higher than the average of recent years, said disaster researcher Guha-Sapir. Her group's database, which she said still is missing quite a few events, shows 208 such disasters worldwide through July - about 11% more than the last decade's average, but a bit less than last year.  Last year, the record-shattering heat that came out of nowhere was in Siberia, where few people live, but this year it struck Portland, Oregon, and British Columbia, which gets more Western media attention, Hausfather said.  What's happening is "partly an increase in the statistics of these extreme events, but also just that the steady drumbeat, the pile on year-on-year...takes its cumulative toll on all of us who are reading these headlines," said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb.  "This pattern of recent Northern Hemisphere summers has been really quite stark," said University of Exeter climate scientist Peter Stott.  While the overall temperature rise is "playing out exactly as we said 20 years ago, ... what we are seeing in terms of the heat waves and the floods is more extreme than we predicted back then," Stott said.  Climate scientists say there is little doubt climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving extreme events.  A new study using satellite images of global flooding since 2000, shows that flooding worldwide hits 10 times as many people as previously thought.  Wednesday's study in the journal Nature finds that from 2000 to 2018 between 255 and 290 million people were directly affected by floods - which lead author Beth Tellman of the University of Arizona says is based on 913 floods with thousands more not counted because of satellite image problems.  Previous estimates showed far fewer people hit by flooding because they were based on computer simulations, rather than observations. The new study finds that population within flooded areas grew 34% since 2000, nearly twice as fast as those outside flooded areas.  Tellman identified 25 nations that are "climate surprise" countries that will have to cope far more with the flooding problems than they do now. Those countries include the US, as well as Germany, Belgium and China, which were hit by flooding this summer.  Aside from dramatic floods and fires, heat waves are a major risk to prepare for in the future, Guha-Sapir said.  "It's going to be a very big deal in the Western countries because the most susceptible to sudden peaks of heat are older people. And the demographic profile of the people in Europe is very old," she said. "Heat waves are going to be a real issue in the next few years."

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Minister Shankar Patil Munenkoppa takes oath second time after gaffe||BENGALURU: In a first for Karnataka in recent times, newly sworn-in minister Shankar Patil Munenkoppa faced embarrassment when he had to take the oath twice in four hours on account of a gaffe by him — he read the oath of office twice but forgot to read the oath of secrecy. Munenkoppa was all smiles as he was a surprise inclusion in the Basavaraj Bommai government. However, he appeared quite serious at the time of taking oath. While governor Thawarchand Gehlot administered the oath, Munenkoppa read the oath of office first. He read it again, thinking it was the oath of secrecy. It’s said he forgot to turn the page. No one realised the faux pas and Munenkoppa signed in the ministers’ registry as per protocol and took the blessings of party seniors. Though he hadn’t been sworn-in technically, he even attended his first cabinet. However, soon Raj Bhavan officials called chief secretary P Ravi Kumar and alerted him of the gaffe. Kumar, according to sources, rushed into the cabinet hall and alerted Munenkoppa and the CM about the issue, asking the former to head to Raj Bhavan to take the oath again. “It was extremely embarrassing for the government as we had to redo the entire act. Munenkoppa was sworn-in in front of the governor for the second time and ensured that this time both the oaths were recorded,” said a government official. Munenkoppa was unavailable for comments at the time of going to print. “...Shankar B Patil Munenkoppa while taking oath of office and secrecy as minister has taken oath of office twice and has not read oath of secrecy. He was recalled to Raj Bhavan and the governor administered the oath of office and secrecy once again,” read a communique from Raj Bhavan. Lone woman minister rushes from Delhi to take oath Shashikala Jolle, the lone woman minister in the new cabinet, rushed to Raj Bhavan in Bengaluru half an hour after her flight from Delhi landed and was allowed to move in zero traffic from the airport. Jolle, a Lingayat, was among the 29 ministers who took oath. She had been inducted as cabinet minister in the Yediyurappa government, but there were reports she would be dropped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/min-takes-oath-2nd-time-after-gaffe/articleshow/85052236.cms||---
---||World||Man who fatally stabbed Pentagon officer had troubled past||WASHINGTON: As officials seek clues about what prompted a Georgia man to fatally stab a Pentagon police officer, details of the suspect's troubled past emerged Wednesday through interviews and court records. Austin William Lanz, 27, was arrested last April for a break-in at a neighbor's home and drew police attention months earlier for an ongoing harassment campaign involving sexually explicit photos and messages, according to interviews and records obtained by The Associated Press. Investigators have not revealed a motive in the ambush-style killing of Pentagon police officer George Gonzalez. But Lanz's past brushes with the law, and neighbors' accounts of recent menacing behavior, appear to suggest the violence was more likely the act of a troubled, violence-prone individual than part of a broader conspiracy. "I wish there was a better way to address those mental health issues that people have,'' said Phillip Brent, who shared a backyard fence with Lanz in Georgia and describes repeated harassment directed at himself and his then-fiancee. "It feels like it was just a clear failure of our system to help someone out who needed that help.'' The FBI on Wednesday said the burst of violence began around 10:40 a.m. Tuesday when Lanz exited a bus at the Pentagon Transit Center and immediately stabbed Gonzalez without provocation. The two struggled and Lanz shot himself with Gonzalez's weapon. Other ``officers engaged the subject, who ultimately died at the scene,'' the FBI said. Gonzalez was a "die-hard" New York Yankees fan and an Army veteran who served in Iraq and joined the police force in 2018, the Pentagon Force Protection Agency said Wednesday. Lanz died after being shot at the scene, officials said. The attack temporarily placed the US military headquarters on lockdown and rattled the nerves of a region already primed to be on high alert for violence and potential intruders outside federal government buildings, particularly after the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said flags at the Pentagon would be flown at half-staff while the White House saluted Gonzalez as having ``lost his life protecting those who protect the nation.'' Investigators were examining Lanz's background, including his criminal history, jail records, financial information and any online accounts, in search of a motive, a law enforcement official said. It remained unclear why Lanz picked the Pentagon area for violence. Lanz had enlisted in the Marine Corps in October 2012 but was "administratively separated'' less than a month later and never earned the title Marine, the Corps said. One episode of likely interest to investigators is an April arrest in Cobb County, Georgia, in which Lanz was accused of breaking into Brent's home in the Atlanta suburb of Acworth in the middle of the night with a crowbar. He was recorded on video by the security system roaming the house for 13 minutes, turning on all the lights and leaving what were described as "inappropriate photographs and notes.'' He left without taking anything, according to arrest reports and court filings. After the homeowner provided the video to law enforcement, Lanz was arrested and booked on charges of burglary and trespassing charges. When informed he was being charged, Lanz objected to the arresting officer, saying, "but I didn't take anything,'' according to the arrest report. He then went on to make statements to a police officer about how planes had been flying over the neighborhood and tracking his cellphone. As he was being processed at the county jail, Lanz, who was listed as 6 feet, 3 inches (1.9 meters) tall and roughly 190 pounds (86 kilograms), is alleged to have attacked two sheriff's deputies in the intake area without provocation, including one who sustained a chipped bone and torn ligament in her knee. After he was restrained, Lanz reportedly accused the officers of being ``gay'' for teaming up on him and asked to be uncuffed so he could fight them one-on-one. A judge reduced his bond in May to $30,000 and released him, imposing some conditions, including that he not take illegal drugs and that he undergo a mental health evaluation. The charges against him are still listed as pending. A spokesperson for the Cobb County Sheriff's Office confirmed that Lanz had been held at the agency's detention center but referred all other questions to the FBI. An attorney who represented Lanz in the Georgia cases didn't immediately respond to a phone message and email seeking comment. Messages left with family members at Lanz's home in Acworth were not immediately returned. The April break-in was the culmination of a harassment campaign that involved sexually explicit and ``vaguely threatening'' messages that Lanz was caught on surveillance camera slipping into the mailbox of the neighboring home where Brent and his then-fiancee lived, Brent said. The harassment briefly stopped after the police, presented with the video footage, confronted Lanz with a warning, Brent said. But it later resumed, including in the form of a cardboard sign that was duct-taped on Brent's front door and said, cryptically, on one side: "I'm done wondering for real" and "Wut is the point of that'' on the other. By the time of the break-in, Brent said, he was so unnerved that he had taken to sleeping at his sister's house. One day, around 4 a.m., he was alerted that the alarm company had reported a break-in at his home. He pulled up the video camera on his phone, "and I was like, oh, it's Austin.'' He said that Lanz had broken into the home with a sledgehammer and, though it is not mentioned in the police report, was also carrying a handgun. Brent and his former fiancee, Eliza Wells, said they were frustrated with the criminal justice system, which they say failed to initially take the harassment claims with appropriate seriousness and then permitted him to be out on bond. Brent said he learned from a prosecutor that Lanz's lawyer was seeking a bond modification that would permit him to travel to the Washington, D.C., area to work with his father, who did not return messages seeking comment. "It just causes me to wonder what could have been done differently to help Austin, mentally, and give him practical tools and resources if he needed, instead of just letting him out on bail and allowing him to travel out of state, and that sort of stuff,'' Wells said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/man-who-fatally-stabbed-pentagon-officer-had-troubled-past/articleshow/85052531.cms||---
---||World||Judge: Preserving evidence key to Florida collapse probe||Preservation of evidence is critical to understanding why a Florida oceanfront condominium collapsed and to protect the legal rights of victims and others, a judge said Wednesday.  Miami-Dade County is expected later this month to hand over control of the Champlain Towers South site to a court-appointed receiver. That receiver, attorney Michael Goldberg, said discussions are ongoing regarding how experts such as engineers will gain access to the property and the building's steel-and-concrete remains, some of which are stored in a local warehouse.  "We are not going to be delaying this," Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman said at a hearing. "Everyone will have the opportunity to do the investigations they need. We don't want to be in the position of being accused of spoiling evidence."  The 12-story condominium building in Surfside collapsed for unknown reasons June 24, killing 98 people and leaving dozens more homeless. The cause of the collapse, one of the deadliest of its kind in US history, is still under investigation.  The hearing conducted remotely Wednesday concerned lawsuits filed by family members of victims, unit owners, mortgage holders and others seeking damages for their losses.  Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said access to evidence by experts could help officials avert similar building disasters by understanding what happened at Champlain Towers South.  "It has to be done a lot sooner than later. There are lives at stake," Burkett said.  One survivor, Sharon Schechter, said she barely escaped from her unit on the 11th floor but raised concerns at the hearing that renters such as herself might be left with little or nothing despite losing their possessions.  "I don't know where I stand. I lost everything I had," Schechter told the judge. "Everything was working great and then my life was turned upside down."  Hanzman said Schechter and other tenants will have a claim for their losses as the lawsuits move forward. They are likely to be consolidated into a single class action affecting all of the collapse claims that will be filed in mid-August.  But Hanzman said even with the proposed sale of the Champlain Towers property and insurance payouts, there probably won't be enough money to go around.  "There will likely not be enough to compensate everyone for what their claims may be," the judge said. But he cautioned attorneys to make sure their cases are ironclad. "I'm not interested in 'hail Mary' claims."  Another hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/judge-preserving-evidence-key-to-florida-collapse-probe/articleshow/85052684.cms||---
---||World||Over half NY Assembly wants to oust Cuomo if he doesn't quit||ALBANY, NY: A majority of state Assembly members support beginning impeachment proceedings against governor Andrew Cuomo if he doesn't resign over investigative findings that he sexually harassed at least 11 women, according to an Associated Press count Wednesday. At least 82 of the body's 150 members have said publicly or told The AP that they favored initiating the process of ousting the third-term Democratic governor if he doesn't quit. A simple majority of Assembly members is needed to authorize an impeachment trial. Cuomo has denied that he made any inappropriate sexual advances and insisted the findings didn't reflect the facts. But while political pressure grew, so did the potential for criminal charges against Cuomo, who basked in national attention last year as the blunt-but-relatable voice of fighting the coronavirus in an early US hotspot, only to see his political future imperiled a year later. District attorneys in Manhattan, suburban Westchester and Nassau counties and the state capital of Albany said they asked for investigative materials from the inquiry, overseen by Democratic state attorney general Letitia James. James' investigation found that Cuomo had violated civil laws against sexual harassment. Making no conclusions about whether he should be criminally charged, investigators left the door open for local prosecutors to bring cases. "We are reviewing the deeply disturbing findings,'' said Joyce A Smith, the acting district attorney in Long Island's Nassau County. She pledged her office would "thoroughly and expeditiously investigate any potential crimes'' that happened there. After James released her report Tuesday, Democrats from the statehouse to the White House called for Cuomo to go, with President Joe Biden saying the governor should resign. But he showed no signs of heeding them, saying that some episodes described in the report never happened, others were misconstrued or mischaracterized and the whole exercise was tainted. "Politics and bias are interwoven throughout every aspect of this situation,'' he said in a recorded video response. Assembly Democrats, who lead the chamber, debated virtually for hours Tuesday about whether to impeach the governor now, wait to see whether he resigns, or give the Assembly Judiciary Committee time to wrap up its wide-ranging investigation into topics from sexual misconduct to the Cuomo administration's monthslong obfuscation of the total number of nursing home residents who died from Covid-19. At least 40 of the Assembly members who say they are ready to start impeachment proceedings are Democrats. As New York went through a harrowing coronavirus surge in spring 2020, Cuomo's daily briefings garnered him fans around the country and an International Emmy Award. Casting himself as a tough-minded yet compassionate leader who steered the state through its biggest public health emergency in a century, the governor even wrote a book about it. Now, that book itself is among the focuses of investigations into Cuomo, with James examining the role some of his aides played in producing it. As complaints and investigations accumulated in recent months, Cuomo became an embattled but unabashed figure. He often still touts the state's handling of the pandemic despite now-rising infection rates amid a national surge in the more infectious delta variant. If the Assembly votes to impeach Cuomo, the state Senate could launch an impeachment trial "in weeks,'' deputy majority leader Mike Gianaris told The Associated Press. Gianaris, a Democrat, said the chamber has been preparing for a potential impeachment trial for months. "We'll be ready to go if and when the impeachment articles are sent over,'' he said. "It could happen very quickly." The 150-member Assembly would need 76 votes to impeach Cuomo and send articles of impeachment to the Senate. The Assembly includes 106 Democrats, 43 Republicans and one Independent. At least two dozen Assembly Democrats called for impeachment in public statements issued Tuesday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Some said the Assembly should vote for impeachment now, while others said the chamber should impeach Cuomo if he doesn't resign. Assembly Republican leader Will Barclay urged speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat, to convene an emergency special session to vote to impeach Cuomo. James' investigation, conducted by two outside lawyers, painted what she called a "clear picture'' of a governor who touched or made sexually inappropriate comments to a series of women, many of whom worked for him. One is a state trooper whom Cuomo successfully sought to have assigned to his security detail. While many of the allegations against Cuomo involve verbal comments, some women have also alleged that he gave them unwanted kisses or touches. One aide said the governor reached under her shirt and groped her breast at the governor's mansion in Albany. The governor denied Tuesday that he ever inappropriately touched anyone, said that he never intended harm and cast doubt on the political motivations of investigators, accusers and critics. To date, Cuomo has rebuffed calls to step down and has moved ahead with plans to run for a fourth term in 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/over-half-ny-assembly-wants-to-oust-cuomo-if-he-doesnt-quit/articleshow/85052752.cms||---
---||World||Some Florida school districts defy DeSantis, require masks||MIAMI: Despite a ban by Gov. Ron DeSantis, two Florida school districts have decided to require masks when children return to classrooms because of dramatic rises in coronavirus infections, with the state leading the country in hospitalizations.  School boards in Duval County, home to Jacksonville, and Alachua County, home to Gainesville, made the decision based on rising hospitalizations and new cases of the coronavirus. The surge has hit parts of northeast Florida particularly hard.  The Duval County School Board voted late Tuesday to require students to wear masks unless parents submit paperwork to opt out. The Alachua County board said it had voted to require masks for the first two weeks of school, adding that the decision will be reevaluated in two weeks. Students in both districts go back to school next Tuesday.  "We applaud the school boards of Alachua and Duval County for listening to and following the advice of the doctors in their community," the Florida Education Association said in a statement. "We hope other school districts will also heed the advice of the trusted medical professionals."  Duval County flipped Democratic in the last presidential election, after decades of being a Republican stronghold in the Old South. Democrats also won big in Alachua County, which houses The University of Florida.  In Arizona, at least three school districts are also defying the state on masks, despite a recently enacted law barring mask requirements. Other states such as Arkansas, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah have also banned mask mandates in schools.  In Florida's capital, the superintendent of the Leon County school district sent a heartfelt letter to DeSantis asking him to allow a temporary mask requirement.  "I have stood firm in my belief that a mask mandate was the wrong course of action. With that said, I believe that new data and information as well as student instructional models compels us to rethink mask protocols," said Superintendent Rocky Hanna, who, like DeSantis, said he was concerned about how mask-wearing was impacting children emotionally.  Hanna said that only in the past 10 days, and before classes resume, four school-aged children in Leon County had been admitted to local hospitals with Covid-19 and two pre-K teachers were fighting the virus in intensive care units.  "Because the Covid-19 landscape continues to evolve, as superintendent, I'm learning that no matter how far you may have gone down a road, it is never too late to turn back and make a choice that is best for the community as a whole," he wrote.  The governor of Arkansas turned back. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson called the majority-GOP Legislature back into session to revert a state law he signed earlier this year prohibiting school mask mandates. Hutchinson expressed some regret about signing the ban but said the state's cases were much lower when the bill passed.  "Everything has changed now," he said Tuesday. "And, yes, in hindsight, I wish that it had not become law."  Last Friday, DeSantis issued an executive order ordering school districts not to mandate the use of masks or they could risk losing state funding. The order cited a Brown University study that looked at schools in New York, Florida and Massachusetts, but with a caveat: It analyzed cases associated with schools and not cases spread in schools.  One of the authors, Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University, said she was not consulted by the governor's office and said the study relied on data prior to the emergence of the more contagious delta variant.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation's top public health agency, last week recommended that masks be worn indoors at schools nationwide -- by teachers, staff, students and visitors -- regardless of their vaccination status.  Before vaccines became available at the end of 2020, masks were seen as a key way of reducing spread. One study involving Florida's own Health Department found that mandatory mask last fall use appeared to be a factor in lower infection rates among students, while another found that Wisconsin schools with mask requirements and other measures had fewer cases than their surrounding communities in the first few months of last school year.  The CDC said the need for returning to masks has become greater with the spread of the more contagious delta variant, which has fueled a surge in cases in Florida. On Wednesday, more than 12,000 patients were hospitalized with Covid-19, and nearly 2,500 of them were in ICU beds.  On Tuesday, the CDC added more than 50,000 new Covid-19 cases in the state over the previous three days, pushing the seven-day average to one the highest counts since the pandemic began, an eightfold increase since July 4.  In total, the state has seen more than 2.6 million cases and 39,179 deaths.  While some school districts decided to require masks, others have backpedaled.  The Broward County School Board, representing one of the largest districts in the state, had voted to require masks after hours of contentious debate that included a screaming match from angry anti-mask parents who set fire to masks and held picket signs outside. The board reversed course Monday over fear of losing funding, but on Wednesday said in a statement on Twitter that they are "waiting for guidance" in light of the governor's orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/some-florida-school-districts-defy-desantis-require-masks/articleshow/85053076.cms||---
---||World||Nursing home to workers: Get vaccine or lose your job||NEW YORK: The nation’s largest nursing home operator told its workers this week they will have to get Covid-19 vaccinations to keep their jobs — a possible shift in an industry that has largely rejected compulsory measures for fear of triggering an employee exodus that could worsen already dangerous staffing shortages. The new requirement at Genesis Healthcare, which has 70,000 employees at nearly 400 nursing homes and senior communities, is the clearest sign yet that such places may be willing to take that risk amid the surging delta variant and the fact that more than 40% of US nursing home workers still have not gotten the shot. Some experts are calling for mandatory vaccinations at nursing homes, warning that unprotected staff members are endangering residents. Even residents who have been inoculated are vulnerable because many are elderly and frail, with weak immune systems. More than 1,250 nursing home residents across the US were infected with Covid-19 in the week ending July 25, double the number from the week earlier, and 202 died, according to federal data. “It’s so easy now to say, ’Well, Genesis is doing it. Now we’ll do it,’” said Brian Lee, who leads Families for Better Care, an advocacy group for long-term care residents. “This is a big domino to fall.” Lawrence Gostin, a professor of health law at Georgetown University, said he likewise foresees a “snowball effect.” He said resisting vaccination mandates at this point is “unconscionable.” Some local governments are taking the decision out of the industry’s hands, with Massachusetts and Denver announcing mandatory vaccinations at nursing homes this week. The question has become more urgent as the highly contagious delta variant drives up new Covid-19 cases in the US to about 90,000 a day on average — the most since mid-February — and sends hospitalizations surging in states like Florida and Louisiana to the highest levels since the pandemic began. Despite the terrible toll taken by the disease at nursing homes, many of the nation’s 15,000 such institutions have rejected mandatory vaccinations for fear large numbers of workers will quit. Nearly a quarter of nursing homes are already short of nurses or nurse’s aides. But Associated Press interviews this past week with managers at 10 mostly smaller nursing home operations across the nation that are requiring vaccines found that the threat of workers quitting en masse over the shots may be overblown, with those numbers far lower than expected. After Canterbury Court in Atlanta announced a mandate in January, CEO Debi McNeil was so fearful of a “massive walkout” that she brought in medical experts to talk to workers, met with holdouts one-on-one and invited staff to gather in the community room for meetings that occasionally got heated. In the end, only 10 of 180 workers quit, and McNeil said Canterbury’s nursing home, independent living and assisted living facilities have reported no new Covid-19 cases since February. “It was a gamble that paid off for us,” McNeil said. “I thought more people would have mandated it by now.” At Jewish Home Family in Rockleigh, New Jersey, only five of 527 workers at its nursing home and assisted-living facilities quit. Westminster Village in Bloomington, Illinois, lost only two out of 250. “It’s important to educate, but at some point we have to end this pandemic,” said Scott Crabtree, CEO of Lambeth House in New Orleans, which lost only 10 of 200 workers after it started requiring shots when they became available last year. “When do we say, ‘Enough is enough?’″ More than 130,000 nursing home residents in the US have died from Covid-19, making such institutions by far the deadliest place to be during the pandemic. About 80% of residents have been vaccinated, double the rate for staff, according to the government. Some workers have rejected the vaccine because they think it was rushed into development and is unsafe, or they feel protected because they already got Covid-19. “It’s too soon to put that crap in my body,” said Christina Chiger, a nurse’s aide at a nursing home in Tampa, Florida. “It took how many years to perfect the polio vaccine? This was done in months.” Others have been swayed by false rumors that the vaccine was made from dead babies or contains microchips or will make you infertile. That last notion concerned Michaela Murray, a nurse’s aide at an Alabama nursing home that made vaccinations mandatory. “I was kind of worried, but I talked to the doctors and they put my mind at ease,” said Murray, who agreed to get a vaccine to keep her job at Hanceville Nursing & Rehab Center, which had only six of 260 workers quit. “I had had Covid and didn’t want to go through that again.” Pennsylvania-based Genesis said volunteer vaccinations were appropriate earlier in the pandemic, but not now, as the more infectious variant spreads and only 65% of its staff has received shots. Genesis is giving employees until Aug. 23 to get their first shot. “To succeed against the delta variant is going to require much higher vaccination rates,” said Chief Medical Officer Richard Feifer. “Our tactics in the fight have to change.” Jennifer Moore of Hollywood, Florida, whose husband is living at a nursing home where only 35% of the staff is vaccinated, said it’s also a matter of ethics. “Whenever I see a story about somebody being anti-vax, I just want to scream,” said Moore, whose husband, Thomas, has Parkinson’s disease. “I understand people have concerns about the vaccine, but these people are working with the most vulnerable population. They have a duty to their patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nursing-home-to-workers-get-vaccine-or-lose-your-job/articleshow/85052931.cms||---

Pfizer spokesperson Pamela Eisele said the company was taking the initiative in order to "to protect the health and safety of our colleagues and the communities we serve." Employees with medical conditions or religious objections can seek accommodations. Outside of the United States, Pfizer will strongly encourage employees who are able be vaccinated in their countries to do so, Eisele said. At the end of 2020, Pfizer had around 29,400 US-based employees. With US coronavirus cases rising sharply again due to the highly transmissible Delta variant, companies like Alphabet Inc and Walt Disney Inc have started putting vaccine mandates in place for their employees. As of Tuesday, 70.1% of US adults had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data from the US centers for disease control and prevention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pfizer-to-require-us-workers-receive-covid-19-vaccine-or-regular-tests/articleshow/85053105.cms||---
---||India||MHA for action against ex-CBI chief Alok Verma||NEW DELHI: The home ministry has recommended disciplinary action against former CBI chief Alok Verma for having misused his official position and also for violating the service rules. Verma, a former Commissioner of Police, Delhi, was formally removed as the head of the premier investigating agency in January 2019 in the wake of corruption allegations against him. The disciplinary action, if okayed by UPSC, may entail a cut in Verma's pension or permanent withdrawal of his pension and other post-retirement benefits.  Sources confirmed to that the home ministry had written to DoPT recommending disciplinary action against Verma, who had chosen not to join his posting as DG, Fire Services, Civil Defence and Home Guards, following his removal as CBI director. Verma's ouster from CBI- okayed by the selection panel comprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, then CJI nominee Justice A K Sikri and then Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge- in January 2019 was based on the recommendation of the Central Vigilance Commission. The Commission had, after its inquiry on the Supreme Court's directions into the allegations against Verma, stated that some of the allegations contained in a complaint against him forwarded by the cabinet secretary were prima facie established and that "they are of very grave nature impacting on the integrity of the officer concerned and the institution". Just before he was removed, Verma had leveled serious allegations against the then special director Rakesh Asthana. The vigilance panel also told the Supreme Court that it had noticed that the secret note dated October 21, 2017 placed by Verma before the selection committee that considered and approved Rakesh Asthana's appointment as special director may have been forged to block his appointment. In fact, in its recommendation for removal of Verma as CBI director, CVC listed production of fabricated documents before the selection committee as a ground, saying it reflected complete lack of integrity and fairness on his part. Just before he was removed, Verma had leveled serious allegations against Asthana, leading the latter to retaliate with accusations against the then CBI chief. Later, a probe cleared Asthana of all the charges. CVC, in its summary findings into the allegations against Verma, said while there was no direct evidence of a bribe being paid to Verma by Hyderabad-based businessman Satish Sana in the Moin Qureshi case, his conduct was “circumspect/suspicious”. It said it could be reasonably concluded that Verma had deliberately excluded the name of key conspirator Rakesh Saxena, IRCTC director, from the FIR in IRCTC case. CVC said the inquiry into allegation regarding smuggling of gold at IGI airport, New Delhi, being probed by ACB, CBI, Delhi, found that Verma as the Delhi police commissioner had not taken vigilance action against then ACP Raj Kumar in spite of noticing a grave misconduct. CVC also said allegations that Verma inducted “controversial” officers R P Upadhyay and Rajeev Krishna into CBI were also substantiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mha-for-action-against-ex-cbi-chief-alok-verma/articleshow/85053425.cms||Bharti Jain
---||World||Pompeo got $5,800 whisky gift from Japan, but where is it?||WASHINGTON: The State Department said Wednesday it’s looking into the apparent disappearance of a nearly $6,000 bottle of whisky given more than two years ago to then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo by the government of Japan. Pompeo knows nothing about the gift or an inquiry, a representative said. In a notice filed in the Federal Register, the department said it could find no trace of the bottle’s whereabouts and that there is an “ongoing inquiry” into what happened to the booze. The department reported the investigation in its annual accounting of gifts given to senior U.S. officials by foreign governments and leaders. The department’s Office of Protocol is required to record gifts given to US officials and keep track of their disposition. Recipients have the option of turning gifts of a certain value over to the National Archives or another government entity or purchasing them for personal use by reimbursing the Treasury Department for their value. The Japanese whisky was valued at $5,800 and was presented to Pompeo in June 2019, presumably when he visited the country that month for a Group of 20 summit that was also attended by President Donald Trump. But unlike other gifts, the department said there was no record of what had become of the bottle. “The department is looking into the matter and has an ongoing inquiry,” it said in the Federal Register notice. The notice offered no additional detail. A representative for Pompeo said Pompeo “has no knowledge of the gift and has not been contacted by anyone regarding an investigation of it.” Pompeo also reported receiving two carpets worth a total of $19,400 from the president of Kazakhstan and the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates. Both floor coverings were transferred to the General Services Administration, the notice said. The filing said Trump and his wife, Melania, received more than $120,000 worth of presents from foreign leaders in 2019, compared with $88,200 the year before. In Trump’s first year in office, in 2017, they reported receiving more than $140,000 in gifts. There was no significant common theme to the 2019 gifts. At least three foreign leaders — from Australia, Egypt and Vietnam — presented Trump with photographs or portraits of himself that collectively were valued at more than $10,000. Trump received a painting of himself on “dual pane glass” from then-Vietnamese President Nguyen Phu Trong that was worth an estimated $5,250, according to the filing. It also says Trump got a “large double frame carved from black stone with image of President Donald J. Trump in precious metal on one side and the coat of arms of Egypt on the reverse” worth $4,450 from Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison gave Trump a framed photo of himself and his wife worth $470. Other more expensive gifts Trump received included an Ottoman Empire rifle valued at $8,500 from the prime minister of Bulgaria, a bronze sculpture of an Arabian horse from the crown prince of Bahrain worth $7,200 and a gold, onyx, emerald and diamond statue of an Arabian oryx worth $6,300 from the emir of Qatar. All of those gifts, including the portraits and photograph, were turned over to the National Archives, according to the report. Another significant recipient of gifts was now-retired Gen. Joseph Votel, commander of US Central Command until March 2019; that command oversees American military operations in the Middle East. The government of Qatar lavished Votel with nearly $37,000 in luxury watches in 2019, including one Rolex timepiece valued at $14,995, according to the report. Votel turned those watches over to the GSA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pompeo-got-5800-whisky-gift-from-japan-but-where-is-it/articleshow/85053621.cms||---

Between July 25 and 31, Kerala reported 24 deaths per million per week, while Maharashtra came second with 12 deaths per million per week, followed by Odisha's 9 deaths per million per week. India's average is about 2 deaths per million per week. "Kerala's case fatality ratio (CFR) on May 15 was 0.3% and it increased to 0.49% by July 31. But Kerala continues to have one of the lowest CFRs in the country," said public health expert Dr Padmanabha Shenoy, who has been analysing Covid patterns across India on a weekly basis. Kerala's seven-day average daily growth rate in cases is 0.61% while India's is 0.13%. The state's R-naught (reproduction rate) is 1.28, with its daily active cases and deaths now highest in the country. Coronavirus pandemic live updatesOn Monday this week, Kerala reported the highest number of deaths in the country with 28% (118) of the total 420 fatalities. However, on Tuesday, Maharashtra with 177 deaths again overtook Kerala (148) in the daily toll. "Kerala's Covid-19 mortality rate is going up and it is a matter of concern. The mortality rate in the second wave has been bigger than that in the first wave," said health economist Rijo M John. Since the last few days, almost on a daily basis, Kerala is reporting about 50% of the new Covid cases in the country. The daily deaths average around 20% to 25% of the countrywide toll. "Death is inevitable when there is increase in cases. But Kerala has been able to control preventable deaths - due to lack of oxygen, ventilator, vaccination etc - to a large extent," said Dr Arun N M, internal medicine expert who has been analysing Covid trends in Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/at-24-kerala-covid-deaths-per-million-per-week-highest-in-india/articleshow/85053943.cms||Preetu Nair
---||World||Taliban warn of more targeted attacks as Afghan forces defend besieged cities||KABUL: The Taliban warned Wednesday of more attacks targeting Afghan government leaders, a day after the defence minister escaped an assassination attempt and as the insurgents fought to take control of a string of besieged cities across the country. A bomb-and-gun attack on defence minister Bismillah Mohammadi Tuesday night brought the war to the capital for the first time in months. But fighting has raged in the countryside since May, when foreign forces began the last stage of a withdrawal due to end later this month. The Afghan and US militaries have stepped up air strikes against the insurgents, and the Taliban said Wednesday the Kabul raid was their response. "The attack is the beginning of the retaliatory operations against the circles and leaders of the Kabul administration who are ordering attacks and the bombing of different parts of the country," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on social media. It represents a major escalation by the Taliban, who have largely refrained from large-scale attacks in the capital since starting talks with the US on their troop withdrawal. A first bomb exploded in the centre of Kabul, sending a thick plume of smoke into the sky, AFP correspondents reported. Less than two hours later, there was another loud blast followed by smaller explosions and rapid gunfire, all near the high-security Green Zone that houses several embassies, including the US mission. The minister was safe and Afghan forces repelled the attackers, but interior ministry spokesman Mirwais Stanikzai said eight people were killed and many more wounded. A security source said the insurgents detonated a car bomb before storming a lawmaker's house, from where they attacked the minister's home. After the first blast, thousands of people in several cities heeded a social media campaign to chant "Allahu akbar" (God is greatest) to show support for the government. "The Taliban justified this attack as the start of retaliatory attacks against government personnel for their indiscriminate bombings," Ibraheem Bahiss, a consultant with International Crisis Group, told AFP. "However, it is equally possible that the Taliban has been caught off guard by the prevalence of anti-Taliban sentiments in Afghanistan's urban centres," he added. There was little respite in Kabul early Wednesday, with police saying another blast injured three people. The Taliban threat came after the Afghan military launched a counterattack in the southern city of Lashkar Gah, where insurgents have infiltrated several parts of the city in numbers. The army told the city's 200,000 people to evacuate on Tuesday as they prepared their offensive. Resident Saleh Mohammad said hundreds of families had fled, but many were caught in crossfire. "There is no way to escape from the area because the fighting is ongoing. There is no guarantee that we will not be killed on the way," Mohammad said. "The government and the Taliban are destroying us." The insurgents have taken control of vast swathes of the countryside and key border towns, taking advantage of the security vacuum left by the withdrawal of US forces. They are now targeting cities, with fierce fighting for a week around Herat, near the western border with Iran, as well as Lashkar Gah and Kandahar in the south. "Those families which had financial support or a car have left their homes," resident Halim Karimi told AFP. "We don't know where to go or how to leave. We are born to die." The loss of Lashkar Gah, the capital of southern Helmand province, would be a massive strategic and psychological blow for the government. The United Nations said it had received reports of mounting civilian deaths and damage to critical infrastructure in Helmand and Kandahar. "Hospitals and health workers are becoming overwhelmed by the number of wounded people," UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told a press briefing on Wednesday. The UN also urged donors to fund the Humanitarian Response Plan for Afghanistan, which Dujarric said had received less than half of the needed $1.3 billion to date. Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, accused the Taliban of "summarily" executing captured soldiers, police and civilians accused of having ties to the government in areas they had seized. The rights group said it had also obtained a list of 44 people killed by the Taliban in the town of Spin Boldak, the town on the border with Pakistan the insurgents captured last month. "Taliban commanders with oversight over such atrocities are also responsible for war crimes," Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at HRW, said in a statement. The US and Britain have also accused the insurgents of committing atrocities they said may amount to "war crimes" in the town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-warn-of-more-targeted-attacks-as-afghan-forces-defend-besieged-cities/articleshow/85054006.cms||---
---||World||Biden plans shift in arms export policy to favor human rights||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden's administration is preparing an overhaul of arms export policy to increase the emphasis on human rights, a departure from former President Donald Trump's prioritization of economic benefits to US defense contractors, four people familiar with the initiative said. Defense companies and activists scrutinize such policies for insight into the administration's posture as it balances the commercial interests of exporters like Lockheed Martin Co (LMT.N) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX.N) against the country's stated commitment to human rights. Two State Department deputy assistant secretaries will brief congressional staff on Biden's draft Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy on Friday, said two of the people familiar with the situation, with a formal unveiling expected as soon as September. The administration briefed a smaller group of congressional aides about two weeks ago, outlining a State Department desire for a "more robust" review of weapons sales with more input from the department's human rights bureau, an administration source and a congressional aide who participated said. Details of the proposed shift have yet to be finalized and are being circulated to other, more export-friendly agencies like the Department of Defense, the people said. The Pentagon has traditionally advocated for putting weapons in the hands of allies so US forces can rely on them more heavily in overseas conflicts. One congressional aide involved in briefings on the matter said he expected any policy change would have the most impact on sales of smaller weapons such as assault rifles and surveillance equipment, which can be used by police or paramilitary forces against domestic populations. A senior administration official confirmed that the new CAT policy was being worked on and "will help us build and maintain strategic partnerships that best reflect the values and interests of the United States." The new policy would also "more robustly discuss" connections between arms transfers and human rights, the official said. The revamped policy could affect sales to countries like the Philippines, where human rights groups have called for investigation of police use of lethal force during raids. Sales of major systems, such as air defense systems or naval systems, could be slowed although they likely would still go ahead. "In some cases it will add an extra layer to getting to yes on a particular case," the congressional aide said. Progressive pressureAdvocates of a stronger emphasis on human rights said the shift could affect sales to countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, especially given pressure from the progressive wing of Biden's Democratic Party over the toll on civilians of their raids in the civil war in Yemen. "A new U.S. approach to arms sales is sorely needed. We must move beyond approaching arms sales as purely a transaction," said Rachel Stohl, vice president at the Stimson Center in Washington. "Overall, the Biden people seem to be in the same mode as the Trump people in promoting arms exports," the congressional aide said, noting that the tempo of weapons sales under the Biden administration is about the same as under Trump. The United States is easily the world's biggest arms merchant, selling over $100 billion in weapons, services and training a year. Trump, a Republican who favored weapons sales as a way to create US jobs, rolled out in 2018 a new version of the CAT policy that gave commercial concerns as much weight as human rights in deciding whether to approve weapons sales. U.S. weapons manufacturers backed Trump's strategy, which called for Cabinet secretaries to act as closers on major arms deals and sent top government officials to promote US weapons at international air shows and arms bazaars. Trump himself promoted arms deals in meetings and conversations with foreign leaders, including pressing the emir of Kuwait to move forward with a $10 billion fighter jet deal. He controversially cast aside congressional review of major arms deals to push through a massive sale of smart bombs and other weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, despite concerns about the Yemen war and murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump said Riyadh was spending billions "on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors" and canceling the contracts would be "foolish."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-plans-shift-in-arms-export-policy-to-favor-human-rights/articleshow/85054216.cms||---
---||World||Major Red Sea coral study put off after hitting reef: Organisers||JERUSALEM: An Israeli-European scientific expedition that sailed from Israel towards Sudan to study Red Sea corals was forced to cancel its mission after the boat was damaged, organisers said on Wednesday. With six scientists and four crew members, the expedition's ambitious goal was to create a first-ever comprehensive study of the corals in the entire Red Sea, possibly yielding precious information on the long-term viability of reefs. Scientists from Sudan were to join the study for what would have been the first-ever major academic collaboration with an Israeli researcher, less than a year after the countries normalized ties. But just one day after setting sail, the ship hit a reef passing the Straits of Tiran, a narrow passage between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, organisers said, and the Egyptian navy evacuated the crew to Sharm el-Sheikh. The Transnational Red Sea Center, created by the Ecole Polytechnique Federale in Lausanne (EPFL) with the support of the Swiss government, had launched the Swiss-flagged Fleur de Passion from Israel's resort city Eilat on July 20. The delegation, headed by Maoz Fine of the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat and EPFL's Anders Meibom, who also directs the TRSC, was set to reach Port Sudan four days later. After it became clear the Fleur de Passion could not be fixed in good time, Meibom said on Wednesday that they were forced to postpone expedition to next year. "This postponement is certainly regrettable, but it does not call into question the project as a whole," Meibom said in a statement. While coral populations around the world are undergoing bleaching caused by climate change, reefs in the northern Red Sea, where the Gulf of Eilat lies, have stayed stable because of their unique heat resistance. For years Fine had said that a comprehensive study of the Red Sea reefs was necessary to fully understand the variation from north to south. The project was set to take place over three years, aiming to involve additional Red Sea countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/major-red-sea-coral-study-put-off-after-hitting-reef-organisers/articleshow/85054097.cms||---

The proceedings were initiated based on a complaint filed by the dentist’s wife with Ulsoor police in Bengaluru in 2017 and an FIR was registered for offences under sections 406 and 325 of IPC and also sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. The couple had met in Bengaluru where the man was doing MDS in a private college; the woman worked in a private company and both fell in love. The complainant alleged her husband ill-treated her after their marriage in 2012 and made insensitive remarks when she fell ill, implying that children born to her will be even more sick. She even alleged that her husband had a relationship with another doctor. However, appearing for the petitioner-husband, advocate Prabhjit Jauhar pointed out that every marriage goes through a period of wear and tear and on a reading of the complaint, it appears the complaint is nothing but an attempt to blow out of proportion the usual arguments and disagreements between a couple going through a rough patch. Perusing the records, Justice G Narendar noted that apart from self-serving statements, there is absolutely no material placed by the complainant to demonstrate any such illicit relationship. “The very fact that the complainant (wife) was sponsored on a dependent visa would only go to demonstrate that the third petitioner (husband) voluntarily offered to support her during her stay in the US. Dependent visa is granted by the country of destination only when the sponsorer has got sufficient means to support himself and his dependent and also has permission to remain in the country. That very fact that she was permitted into the US on dependent visa is sufficient to discard her allegations,” Justice G Narendar observed in his order. The judge pointed out that in one breath, the complainant states how she begged and pleaded with her in-laws to permit her to stay in her matrimonial house and again claims, “I was too scared and hesitant even to stay in their house” . The judge added that the case on hand falls within the exceptional cases carved out by the Supreme Court in the state of Haryana and others vs Bhajan Lal and others, which demand exercise of inherent powers of the high court under section 482 of CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/poking-fun-without-motive-to-cause-hurt-is-no-cruelty-hc/articleshow/85054542.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||India||Krishna water sharing: AP spurns mediation offer, CJI recuses self from case||NEW DELHI: The Andhra Pradesh government on Wednesday spurned CJI N V Ramana's practical suggestion to resolve the dispute with Telangana on apportionment of Krishna river water shares through mediation, saying it would prefer a legal battle in the Supreme Court to stop the neighbour from "usurping water" in excess of its share. The CJI had on Monday suggested that the two states resolve the dispute over apportioning of the river water through mediation instead of spending time and energy over litigation. However, he caveated it by saying, "If Andhra Pradesh wants adjudication of legal issues raised in its writ petition, I will recuse and post the petition before another bench." The CJI, who had as an advocate represented the undivided Andhra Pradesh from which Telengana was carved out, said, "I belong to both the states. I can arrange for mediation and supervise it for a possible resolution of the Krishna water sharing dispute." On Wednesday, AP counsel G Umapathy informed the court that the YS Jagan Reddy government would prefer adjudication of the issues raised by the state in its writ petition, which pushed the CJI to make good on his words and recuse from hearing of the petition. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said the Union government has full faith in the CJI and that it would like the CJI-led bench to hear the writ petition filed by AP. However, Justice Ramana remained firm and ordered the case to be posted before another bench. In its writ petition, Andhra Pradesh has accused Telangana of depriving people of AP of their legitimate share of Krishna water. The bigger of the two neighbours alleged that Telangana was not following decisions taken on river water management in the Apex Council constituted under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act of 2014 as also the directions of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) constituted under the 2014 Act and directions of the Centre. It has also blamed the Centre for not notifying the exact jurisdiction of KRMB. "This is resulting in illegal acts on part of Telangana," it said. However, a day after AP moved the SC, the Centre on July 16 notified the Godavari and Krishna river management boards, giving them more teeth to administer, regulate, operate and maintain projects listed on these two rivers in Telangana and AP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/krishna-water-sharing-ap-spurns-mediation-offer-cji-recuses-self-from-case/articleshow/85054499.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

M Lakshminarayana, a contractor from Jalahalli, and his son, L Anjan, in his 40s, were on their way to JC Road in a Maruti Brezza. Around 6.30pm, they entered Ballari Road at Kodigehalli and were heading towards Hebbal flyover when they realised their car had a flat tyre. Lakshminarayana had kept his cash bag, files relating to contract work, cheque books and other documents on the back seat and was sitting in the front passenger seat, while Anjan got off the car to change the tyre. After an hour or so, Anjan finished his work, washed his hands and was entering the driver’s seat when two men stood on both sides of the front windows. Speaking in Hindi, they asked the route to KR Puram. Anjan was speaking to the man standing next to him. “As my son was explaining the route, some movement in the back caught my eye. Suddenly I turned and saw one of the men grabbing the bag from the seat. I leaned forward and caught his hand. At the same time, I shouted at the top of my voice. The man pulled back his hand and started running with my bag. His associate too joined him. My son and I started chasing them. Some passersby joined us and we caught hold of the duo after running for some 50 metres.” Later, police found that when Anjan opened the door to get into the vehicle, one miscreant opened the backdoor knowing the central locking system would be unlocked. The duo then engaged Lakshminarayana and his son in a conversation. The accused were later handed over to Amruthahalli police. An officer said: “We suspect that these two are part of an attention- diversion gang. Similar incident in 2020On the same stretch, a techie-couple had bravely fought two muggers in July 2020. The techie had sustained 20 stab wounds in the incident. The du was headed to Chikkamagaluru, when the man saw two miscreants robbing two motorists at knifepoint. It was at 5 in the morning.  As the man stopped, one of the muggers approached them and attacked him with a knife. While the husband firmly held the attacker’s, the wife, sitting next to him, pressed the clutch, shifted the gear and moved the car. The muggers, meanwhile, ran away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/66-yr-old-man-son-chase-nab-robbers-fleeing-with-cash-bag/articleshow/85054571.cms||---

He was arrested by JC Nagar police on drug peddling charges early on Monday. The postmortem report did not mention the cause of death and samples of vital fluids have been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory. Before the postmortem, a posse of officials from the embassy of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Delhi, visited the mortuary and had a look at the body. The body was handed over to embassy officials later in the evening. Documents relating to Joan, including his visa that expired in 2015 and passport in 2017, were also handed over to the officials. “We will wait for the FSL report to ascertain the reason for his death. After that, we will decide our future course of action. Doctors who carried out the postmortem said there were no physical injuries on the body,” an investigating officer said. Following his death, fellow nationals staged a protest outside JC Nagar police station on Monday afternoon. According to them, Joan was a student in the city and participating in a birthday party when police picked him up. Cops resorted to lathicharge after some protesters allegedly attacked them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/samples-sent-to-fsl-to-ascertain-reason-for-congolese-mans-death/articleshow/85054577.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: 29 ministers inducted in CM Basavaraj Bommai cabinet, 23 from BS Yediyurappa government||Bengaluru: A week after taking over as chief minister, Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday expanded his cabinet by inducting 29 ministers. He retained 23 ministers from the 33-member Yediyurappa cabinet — including the lone woman minister — while bringing in six new faces. The ministers were administered oath of office and secrecy by governor Thaawarchand Gehlot at Raj Bhavan in the afternoon. The sanctioned strength of the state cabinet is 34; the current strength is 30. Bommai said portfolios would be allocated in a day or two. The much-awaited expansion bears the stamp of former CM BS Yediyurappa as many of those inducted are closely associated with him, including the 10 legislators who joined BJP after quitting the Congress-JD(S) coalition in 2019 and helped the saffron party form the government. However, contrary to speculation, Yediyurappa’s son and BJP vice-president BY Vijayendra failed to make it to the ministry. “The party’s central leaders, including party president JP Nadda and BJP in-charge for Karnataka Arun Singh, have spoken to Yediyurappa and Vijayendra. I can only say his name (Vijayendra’s) is not on the list,” Bommai told reporters ahead of the oath-taking ceremony. While two of three former deputy CMs — Govind M Karjol and CN Ashwath Narayana — are part of the new cabinet, the party has decided to do away with the post in what is being seen as a move to strengthen Bommai’s hands and curb new power centres. After the oath-taking ceremony, Bommai held a cabinet meeting in the evening and reiterated that the focus is on tackling Covid-19 as a potential third wave looms large in the state. The cabinet decided to revamp the state’s Covid task force with some new members. It was led by Ashwath Narayana. The new cabinet will respond to the needs of the people, earn their trust and deliver good governance,” Bommai said. Asked about four ministerial berths being vacant, he said cabinet expansion will happen in states and regions left unrepresented will get priority subsequently. He dismissed the brewing dissent in the party unit, saying BJP is a “national party with a strong leadership”. On senior ministers from the previous cabinet being dropped, he said the high command has decided to rope in those with organisational experience for party work. Prominent omissions from the previous cabinet include Laxman Savadi, S Sureshkumar, Aravind Limbavali, CP Yogeeshwara and Shrimanth Patil. While the cabinet composition appears to balance political and caste equations, regional representation remains badly skewed. The ministry includes 9 Lingayats (including the CM), 7 Vokkaligas, 3 Kurubas, 3 ministers from scheduled castes, 2 each from Brahmin, Billava communities and one from scheduled tribes. In this make-up, 14 of the 31 districts of the state remain unrepresented, while Bengaluru claims the lion’s share of seven ministers. In Yediyurappa’s cabinet too, there were seven ministers from Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/29-mins-inducted-in-bommai-cabinet-23-from-bsy-govt/articleshow/85054595.cms||ManuAiyappa Kanathanda
---||World||Quad nations on track to produce 1 billion doses of Covid vaccine: US||WASHINGTON: Quad countries are on track to produce at least 1 billion doses of Covid vaccine in India by the end of 2022, the White House said here as it reiterated its commitment to provide free jabs to the needy across the world without any strings attached.  The Quad grouping comprises Australia, India, Japan and the United States.  In March, leaders of the Quad, during their first virtual summit, committed themselves to provide one billion vaccines to Southeast Asia.  "Our Quad partnership is on track to help produce at least 1 billion doses of Covid vaccines in India for the Asia region by the end of 2022," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference. '  She said so far the United States has provided 110 million vaccines to the world.  "That is more than any other country has shared combined. We also made clear that is the beginning and we also started to donate the 500 million doses of Pfizer we've purchased. We will start to donate those later this month," Psaki said.  Asserting that the US has taken "far more" action at the global level than any other country, she urged the world community to step up.  "We saw some action at the G7. More needs to happen," she said, adding that according to health experts, 11 billion doses are still required.  "So, I think our effort is going to be continuing to make this a front and centre discussion at global engagements meetings, whether it's the UNGA or G20 or meetings we will have in future, because it is going to require all of the richest countries in the world, including the United States, to step up, to increase vaccine donations, to increase manufacturing capacity," Psaki added.  The United States, she asserted, can not only provide vaccines to its people but also donate to other countries as well.  "We believe we can do both. We also, in this country, have enough supply to ensure that every American has access to a vaccine. We will have enough supply to ensure if the FDA decides that boosters are recommended for a portion of the population, to provide those as well. We believe we can do both and we don't need to make that choice," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/quad-nations-on-track-to-produce-1-billion-doses-of-covid-vaccine-us/articleshow/85054685.cms||---

Thanks to the initiative, 80% of its tourism service providers have been vaccinated and are safe to welcome travellers from far and wide, eager to strike J&K off their bucket list. Interestingly, tourism has been looking up in J&K with the Union territory having received one of its highest footfall of tourists between November 2020 and April 2021. As per figures shared by J&K government, tourist arrivals jumped threefold from 36,728 during November 2019-March 2020 to 1.11 lakh tourists between November 2020 and March 2021. This was largely on account of travellers who could no longer fly to international destinations like Switzerland for a ‘white winter’ experience, in view of the pandemic. Gulmarg offered them an attractive alternative closer home. The relativelly improved security situation in J&K and safety of visiting a destination where all incoming passengers are tested for Covid upon arrival, an official pointed out, only seem to have ensured that hotels and resorts in Gulmarg had their rooms full during the ‘white’ season. Srinagar too benefitted as it is the connecting point to Gulmarg. Next on the cards is release of the J&K Film Policy, 2021 by LG Manoj Sinha on Thursday, which shall offer a host of incentives to the film industry to shoot in its scenic locales. Government sources said films shot in J&K will help promote the place as an attractive tourist destination, apart from showcasing normalcy in the region. An official said security arrangements will be made free of cost to ensure that filmmakers can complete shooting. As part of its efforts to create a vibrant film ecosystem in J&K, the UT government plans to set up a nationally competitive infrastructure; offer administrative assistance to ease filmmaking in J&K; lay down attractive schemes of financial support and exemptions; and offer local talent to assist in film-making. Meanwhile, festivals and cultural events are back on the J&K tourism calendar- Shivratri was celebrated in Jammu in March 2021, as was spring at Badamwari garden in Srinagar on March 20, 2021. A musical event titled ‘Fulkari’ was organised on March 27 at Mansar and on March 28, 2021 in Jammu city. ‘Chenab’ Tulip festival was held at Jammu in March, 2021. Tulip festival and Wazwan festival was also held at Srinagar’s famous tulip garden April 4, 2021. An event titled “Tapping the Tourism potential of Kashmir- Another day in Paradise” was jointly organised by Ministry of Tourism GOI, Department of Tourism J&K and FICCI in Srinagar on April 12 and 13,2021. Foundation of Tirupati Temple has also been laid in Jammu in June, 2021, which is bound to attract pilgrims headed for Vaishno Devi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-admins-initiatives-keep-tourism-afloat-amid-pandemic/articleshow/85054769.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||Amid the din over Pegasus issue, Rajya Sabha clears 3 legislations, Lok Sabha passes 2||NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday suspended six TMC MPs for the day for carrying placards while protesting along with other opposition MPs over the Pegasus spying issue. In the midst of the din, the House passed three bills in an hour. Naidu threatened to invoke rule 255 against those holding placards. As the members refused to budge, he ordered that those "disobeying the chair and raising placards shall leave the House under rule 255". Later, a parliamentary bulletin identified the six MPs as Dola Sen, Md Nadimul Haque, Abir Ranjan Biswas, Shanta Chhetri, Arpita Ghosh and Mausam Noor. Amid the protests, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman first introduced the Limited Liability Partnership (Amendment) Bill, which seeks to encourage start-ups and improve the ease of doing business. The bill was passed in 25 minutes. Times ViewMuch of the monsoon session has been marred by disruptions and adjournments. This doesn’t speak highly of either the Opposition or the Centre. It is equally worrying that bills are being hastily passed in such a situation. This defeats the very purpose of having a Parliament, whose job is to discuss and legislate. Proper discussion brings out the pros and cons of any bill and that’s very important for any democracy.Similarly, the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Bill was passed in about 15 minutes. The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill 2021 moved by the civil aviation minister, in turn, was passed in less than 20 minutes. Deputy chairman Harivansh did give a chance to a few opposition MPs to speak on the bills but they instead chose to raise other issues, making him cut them short and move on with the proceedings. Lok Sabha passed two legislations amid opposition protests- the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Bill, 2021 and the Coconut Development Board (Amendment) Bill, 2021- within a matter of a few minutes as opposition parties continued to shout slogans over the Pegasus issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-the-din-over-pegasus-issue-rs-clears-3-legislations-ls-passes-2/articleshow/85054962.cms||---
---||World||Biden nominates Mark Brzezinski as US ambassador to Poland||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden has nominated Mark Brzezinski, an Obama-era diplomat with deep ties to Poland, to serve as his ambassador to Warsaw. If confirmed, Brzezinski would be dispatched to Poland at a moment when Central and Eastern European allies of the United States are closely watching the Biden administration’s approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Biden administration announced last month that it had reached a deal with Germany that will allow the completion of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Europe without the imposition of further US sanctions. That project allows Moscow to bypass Ukraine, Poland and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe that collect transit fees on the energy. Brzezinski served in Barack Obama’s administration as the first executive director of the White House’s Arctic Executive Steering Committee and as the US ambassador to Sweden. He also served on the White House National Security Council during Bill Clinton’s administration, first as a director for Russia and Eurasia and later as director for the Balkans. Brzezinski spent time in Poland as a Fulbright scholar and is the author of “The Struggle for Constitutionalism in Poland.” Brzezinski is the son of Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter. His sister, Mika Brzezinski, is a host of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” Zbigniew Brzezinski was born in Warsaw, spoke fluent Polish and was well known and respected in Poland. The White House also announced that Biden is nominating four more career foreign service officers to ambassadorial roles: Elizabeth Fitzsimmons to Togo, Rebecca Gonzales to Lesotho, Brian Shukan to Benin and David Young to Malawi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-nominates-mark-brzezinski-as-us-ambassador-to-poland/articleshow/85054974.cms||---

Among the arrested, one from Ullal is learnt to be the relative of a former MLA. NIA registered suo motu case against seven known and other unknown accused under sections of IPC and and UA (P) Act on March 5 pertaining to alleged terrorist activities of Mohammed Ameen alias Abu Yahya of Kerala and his associates. They have been accused of running Islamic State propaganda channels on social media platforms such as Telegram, Hoop and Instagram to propagate violent Jihadi ideology and radicalise and recruit members. The agency conducted searches and arrested three persons — Mohd. Ameen, Dr Rahees Rasheed and Mus’Hab Anwar — in this case in March. Investigation revealed that after the decline of the IS Caliphate in Syria/Iraq, Mohd. Ameen visited Kashmir in March 2020 for hijrah (religious migration) and for terrorist acts. He raised funds in association with Kashmir-based accused Mohammad Waqar Lone alias Wilson Kashmiri and his associates. As part of the conspiracy, funds were also transferred to Mohd. Waqar Lone by the accused through banking channels and digital payment methods on the directions of Mohd. Ameen, sleuths aid. Mohd. Ameen and his associates were radicalising youths to join jihad and unlawful activities in India and had expanded the network in Kashmir and parts of Kerala and Kar nataka. Searches were conducted at the premises of the accused who were in touch with Ameen and aides. Several digital devices including laptops, mobile phones, hard disk drives, pen drives, SIM cards of different service providers and documents were seized.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka cabinet expansion sparks dissent within BJP||BENGALURU: Troubles are mounting for CM Basavaraj Bommai after he expanded his cabinet on Wednesday as several partymen openly criticised him and the leadership. While some expressed their unhappiness to mediapersons, some took to social media to vent their feelings. Soon after the list of ministers was made public, deputy Speaker Anand Mamani threatened to resign. In a video released to his supporters, he said : “I have been a member of the BJP since 2008 and a three-time MLA. I am working hard to develop the constituency and for the welfare of the people. I demand to be made a minister.’’ Hiriyur MLA Poornima Sreenivas, whose name was reportedly removed from the final list at the last minute to accommodate ex-minister Shashikala Jolle, expressed her displeasure on Facebook. “I have been a sincere party worker and never indulged in antiparty activities. My name never figured in any scams. Yet, I was denied the ministry to accommodate Jolle whose name did the rounds in the alleged cash-for-eggs scam.’’ Senior BJP MLA SA Ramadas said he’s upset at not being considered but said he’d focus on strengthening the party. In Kodagu, former minister and BJP MLA M Appachu Ranjan said it’s disgraceful that his district has been neglected yet again. In Chikkamagaluru, MP Kumaraswamy expressed his displeasure on social media, saying Bommai had promised him ministership. Though there are eight BJP MLAs in Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, Kodagu and Hassan, none made the cut, while sole legislator from Mandya KC Narayanagowda retained his post. GH Thippareddy, SA Ramadas, Abhay Patil, M Satish Reddy and Nehru Olekar expressed unhappiness. Several ministers dropped from the cabinet, including Laxman Savadi, S Suresh Kumar, R Shankar and Aravind Limbavalli, are reportedly upset. Protests galore:Hitting out at Bommai for not inducting him, Haveri MLA Neharu Olekar said, “I'm from the SC community. I have got elected three times and despite being a party loyalist, I haven’t been made minister..It’s because Bommai feels that I'm inferior.” Stating neither Yediyurappa nor the high command came to his support, he said: “...I will not quit the party and will try to bring things to the notice to central leaders and Sangh Parivar leaders.” Olekar’s supporters protested in Haveri. Yediyurappa confidant and MLA MP Renukacharya said injustice has been done to Davangere as there is no representation from the district in the cabinet. Supporters of Kalaburagi South MLA Dattatraya Chandrashekhar Patil Revoor staged a protest accusing BJP of not giving adequate representation to Kalyana Karnataka. Supporters of Shorapur MLA Narasimha Nayak (Raju Gouda) also protested. Aland MLA Subhash Guttedar’s supporters hit the streets, and they were detained. MLA’s supporters block NH:Supporters of Hiriyur BJP MLA Poornima Srinivas staged a protest and blocked the Pune-Bengaluru highway at Hiriyur on Wednesday, after the lawmaker failed to find a place in the cabinet. They raised slogans against the Centre and state for denying ministerial berth to the only woman MLA from the Yadava community in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/expansion-sparks-dissent-within-bjp/articleshow/85055426.cms||---

As per the higher education department’s plan, the system will track a student’s journey from admissions to awarding of degrees. It will have calendar of events announced by colleges and universities, mode of admission (direct/merit), seat matrix, fee structure and minimum cut-offs, entrance exam, interview and quotas. The department had asked government, aided and private unaided colleges to start admissions from August 4 on this platform. However, it issued an order on Tuesday postponing the process. “Since colleges are reopening only on October 1, there is time for admissions. Work on multi-disciplinary courses, as mandated by National Education Policy, is on,” said Pradeep P, commissioner for collegiate education. Candidates should provide personal information, category, education details and documents. Colleges will verify the documents uploaded during admission. UUCMS has the provision to generate combination-wise rank list in each college for UG, departmentwise rank list for PG and for each field in PhD. Based on seats available and candidate’s priority inputs, seats are allocated to candidates. Once principals verify the application, a student’s registration number is generated. After completion of all rounds of allotment, allotted seat details will be sent to the university for approval. In case candidates cancel the seats, the registration number remains dummy. Students will not be allowed to hold on to more than one seat at a time. The system will have data integration from the PU board, DigiLocker, Karnataka Examinations Authority, ComedK and MobileOne. Fees can be paid through PayGov. While many private colleges have informally completed admissions for the year, they have to upload student data on the platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-to-launch-unified-system-for-universities/articleshow/85055429.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

A high court division bench noted the Covid situation has improved since the cabinet decision and said assembly elections were conducted even during the pandemic. Prima facie, it said, the government’s decision does not bind the SEC, a constitutional authority duty bound to conduct timebound elections. Appearing on behalf of SEC, senior advocate KN Phanindra said a meeting was held on July 28 and a decision will be taken shortly on holding elections to city corporations of Belagavi, Kalaburagi, Hubballi-Dharwad and city municipal councils of Doddaballapur and Tarikere. Next hearing of the suo motu PIL is on August 13. The petition was initiated after noticing that elections to a large number of municipalities are not being held as per Clause (3) of Article 243(U) of the Constitution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/shrines-open-why-defer-polls-hc-asks-govt/articleshow/85055432.cms||P Vasanth Kumar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka testing 30% more than 2020 peak; border districts in focus||BENGALURU: In the past four months, Karnataka has been testing at least 30% more than its 2020 peak in November when average daily testing was 1,589 per million. With a slight increase in cases in the past few days, testing may be prioritised in border districts Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu, among others, while maintaining a healthy number across the state, with Bengaluru still being a priority. The overall testing in the state has been reasonably higher than in 2020, but it does not compare too well with Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and Delhi, whose weekly average of tests per million is much higher. The first four days of August have seen 2,158 tests per million (TPM) daily, which is 36% more than the 2020 peak. It was 2,108 in July, 2,235 in June, 1,993 in May and 2,082 in April. Dr CN Manjunath, nodal officer for Covid testing in Karnataka, said: “The number of tests we have been doing is by no means bad. There needs to be focus on districts bordering Kerala in the coming days along with Bengaluru which will continue to be a priority.” Since April this year, Karnataka has been conducting over 40 lakh tests per month with June posting record 45.3 lakh. On average, the state has been testing 1.2 lakh samples each day with some days – like August 1 – seeing more than 1.5 lakh tests. “If need be, the available infrastructure can be pushed to conduct up to 1.8 lakh tests per day. This has been achieved in the past on some days when the cases were surging. Doing it daily will lead to backlogs and affect the overall handling of the pandemic,” Manjunath said. After having peaked in November 2020 with nearly 31.2 lakh monthly tests, Karnataka’s testing had dipped in the next three months — 29.7 lakh in December 2020, 29.5 lakh and 17.6 lakh in January and February 2021, respectively — before picking up again from March 2021. From a low of 17.6 lakh in February, testing jumped to over 26 lakh in March, during the end of which cases had begun to surge. From there, it has been over 41 lakh tests a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-testing-30-more-than-20-peak-border-dists-in-focus/articleshow/85055435.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||India||False impotency allegation ground for divorce: SC||NEW DELHI: Making baseless and false allegations against one's spouse regarding impotency of life partner amounts to cruelty and divorce can be granted on that ground, the Supreme Court has said and upheld a Delhi high court order allowing divorce on that ground. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose declined to interfere with the HC verdict and dismissed the plea of a woman who had made the allegation against her husband in the court and challenged the divorce granted on his plea. The couple got married in 2012. But soon after the marriage, the man moved the court seeking to declare the marriage null and void on the ground that it could not be consummated due to the woman's alleged impotency. Countering his allegation, the wife submitted in family court that the man was suffering from impotency (erectile dysfunction) which was the true cause of non-consummation of marriage and also that her in-laws demanded dowry and she was cruelly treated. The man thereafter sought divorce on the ground of cruelty for making false allegation against him. As the wife's allegation was found baseless after examining medical report and taking into account the statement of a medical expert, the family court allowed the divorce plea of the man. The woman then moved the high court, which turned down her plea and said her allegations were "grave and serious", and was likely to adversely affect the man's mental well-being. "Thus, having regard to the law on the subject, we find no infirmity in the findings and observations of the trial court that the allegation of the appellant (wife) in the written statement with respect to the impotency clearly falls within the concept of cruelty as defined under law," the high court had said. The wife approached Supreme Court and pleaded that divorce on the ground of cruelty be quashed and she be allowed to get divoce through mutual consent. But her plea was opposed by her husband's advocate, Prabhjit Jauhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/false-impotency-allegation-ground-for-divorce-sc/articleshow/85055527.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||In IS module probe, NIA searches five sites in J&K, Karnataka||NEW DELHI: NIA on Wednesday conducted searches at five locations, including three in Jammu and Kashmir and two in Karnataka, in connection with its probe into an ISIS module led by arrested accused Mohammad Ameen alias Abu Yahya, r/o Kerala. The module was allegedly propagating ISIS ideology via social media platforms like Telegram, Instagram and Hoop and radicalising and recruiting new members from Kerala, J&K and Karnataka. Subsequent to the searches, which were conducted in coordination with the state/UT police concerned, four accused persons associated with ISIS were arrested - Obaid Hamid r/o Bemina, Srinagar, Muzammil Hassan Bhat r/o Bandipora, Ammar Abdul Rahman r/o Ullal, Mangalore and Shankar Venkatesh Perumal r/o Bengaluru. They were involved in raising funds and radicalising and motivating people to join ISIS, said NIA. The 'ISIS Kerala Module case' was registered suo-motu by NIA on March 5, 2021, against seven known and other unknown accused persons under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and IPC. It pertains to terrorist activities of Mohammad Ameen, who had returned to India from Bahrain in the wake of decline of ISIS Caliphate in Syria/Iraq, with a view to creating a local module here by radicalising and recruiting vulnerable youths from J&K, Kerala and Karnataka. He had been camping in Delhi for two months before he was arrested in March 2021 and was reportedly making connections with J&K-based terror operatives. Ameen, soon upon his return from Bahrain, visited Kashmir for hijrah (religious migration) and to engage in terrorist acts. He also raised funds in association with Kashmir-based accused Mohammad Waqar Lone @ Wilson Kashmiri and his associates. As part of the conspiracy, funds were transferred to Mohd. Waqar Lone by an accused in the case through banking channels and digital payment methods, on the directions of Mohd. Ameen. The searches on Wednesday were conducted at the premises of accused/suspects who were continuously in touch with Mohammed Ameen and his associates through various groups/channels on encrypted chat platforms and had raised funds for furtherance of activities of ISIS. During searches, several digital devices including laptops, mobile phones, hard disk drives, pen drives, multiple SIM cards of different service providers and incriminating documents were seized. Two others, Dr Rahees Rasheed and Mus'Hab Anwar, were earlier arrested along with Mohd. Ameen by NIA in March 2021, following raids at 11 locations including eight in Kerala covering Kannur, Mallapuram and Kasaragod districts; two locations in Bengaluru and one in Delhi. The ISIS module had allegedly identified certain individuals in Kerala and Karnataka for targeted killing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-is-module-probe-nia-searches-five-sites-in-jk-karnataka/articleshow/85055815.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Dehradun||Haridwar: Casteist slurs, abuses thrown at Olympic star Vandana Katariya’s family||HARIDWAR: Hours after India went down to Argentina in the women’s hockey semi-final at the Tokyo Olympics on Wednesday, two upper caste men began circling Vandana Katariya’s home at Roshnabad village in Haridwar. They burst crackers, danced in mock celebration and hurled caste abuses at her family, saying that the team had lost because it had “too many Dalit players,” Vandana’s family told TOI. One of the accused has been detained by police. “We were upset after the loss. But the team went down fighting. We were proud of that,” Vandana’s brother Shekhar told TOI. “Suddenly, right after the match, we heard loud noises. Crackers were being burst outside our house. When we went outside, we saw two men from our village -- we know them and they are upper castes -- dancing in front of our house.” When they saw Vandana’s family step out, they unleashed a stream of casteist abuses. “They used caste slurs, insulted our family and said the Indian team lost because too many Dalits have made it to the team. They went on, saying that it’s not just hockey but every sport that should keep Dalits out,” the complaint filed by Shekhar said. “Then, they took some of their clothes off and started dancing again … It was a caste-based attack.” An FIR is yet to be registered on the basis of the complaint at the time of filing the report. “One man whose name came up has been detained,” SHO of Sidcul police station LS Butola told TOI. He didn’t say who the person was. “We have received a complaint and inquiry is on, after which a case will be filed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/casteist-slurs-abuses-thrown-at-oly-stars-family/articleshow/85055970.cms||MS Nawaz

---||Patna||Number of aspirants for VC & pro-VC posts declines in Bihar||PATNA: Sounds strange, but the craze for the coveted office of the university vice-chancellor in Bihar seems to have declined considerably in recent years. The number of applications received in response to the advertisements issued by the chancellor’s secretariat some time past clearly indicate that very few academics want to become VC or pro-VC today. Hardly 10 to 15 candidates have reportedly applied for these coveted posts this time, while earlier hundreds of candidates used to show interest to hold such a post. According to informed sources, in 2013, the chancellor’s secretariat had received more than 3,000 applications from different parts of the country in response to the advertisement for the appointment of VCs and pro-VCs in altogether 11 universities of the state. This was for the first time, when the process of appointment of VCs and pro-VCs in the state universities, through open advertisement, was introduced in Bihar following the Supreme Court direction. In 2016, the chancellor’s secretariat received more than 500 applications for the post of VCs and Pro-VCs in 11 universities of the state. And, the number of applicants for the two posts in different universities has gone down far below this time, sources said. The chancellor’s secretariat has already started the process of interviewing the shortlisted applicants through a duly constituted search committee, headed by L N Mithila University VC Surendra Pratap Singh and comprising B R A Bihar University VC Hanuman Prasad Pandey and noted litterateur Ram Bachan Roy (government nominee). So far the interaction of candidates with the search committee for the appointment of VCs of Purnia, Munger, Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian and Nalanda Open universities has already been completed. Interviews for the posts of VC of Patliputra university and pro-VC of Nalanda Open University are yet to be held. Sources said the process of interaction of candidates for all the vacant posts advertised by the chancellor’s secretariat is likely to be completed by the end of the current month after which the appointment of VCs and pro-VCs from amongst the names figuring in the panels submitted by the search committee would be made by the governor in consultation with the chief minister. Commenting on the declining craze among the academics for these coveted posts in the universities, former principal of Patna College Nawal Kishore Choudhary observed that the dignity of VCs and pro-VCs has been eroded considerably with their frequent removal on flimsy grounds. Academics aspiring for vice-chancellorship of any university in Bihar are not sure whether they would be appointed purely on merit without any “favour” of the powers-that-be, he said. Bihar Public Service Commission’s former member Shiv Jatan Thakur said several aspirants for the post of VC and pro-VC are skeptical about the composition of the search committee with the two sitting VCs of universities from within the state. And, these search committee members have been officiating as the VC of three or four universities simultaneously in blatant violation of the Supreme Court ruling, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/number-of-aspirants-for-vc-pro-vc-posts-declines-in-bihar/articleshow/85046734.cms||B K Mishra

---||Kolkata||Some colleges allow scanned e-mark sheets for UG application, others to decide soon||Kolkata: Many colleges in Kolkata have decided to accept scanned copies of downloaded mark sheets at the applications stage as students of many boards have not received the hard copies of their Class XII score cards yet. The colleges have decided to make this concession only for the application stage. A lot of students have not received their mark sheets till now due to various reasons ranging from floods, to lack of commuting options due to pandemic-related restrictions and delay by the boards. But those who secure admission will have to produce the original mark sheets for verification and registration with the university. Last year, many colleges had discovered that several mark sheets submitted online were not genuine. Mark sheets of students who have passed their ISC have not arrived from Delhi and the case is the same for several CBSE schools too. Many students from the state board have not been able to collect their mark sheets due to the floods in their areas and lack of travelling options due to pandemic-related restrictions. The policy of accepting scanned and attested copies of downloaded mark sheets has already come into effect at Lady Brabourne College. “It is not the fault of the students that they have not received the hard copies of the mark sheets. Other factors are responsible for this. So students must not suffer. This is the reason we have decided to accept the scanned and attested copies of the downloaded mark sheets at the application stage. During the pandemic, we need to be friendly and sensitive towards the students. Those who secure admission will, however, have to show the original mark sheet at the time of verification and during registration with the university,” said Siuli Sarkar, principal of Lady Brabourne College. Colleges have started receiving applications from Monday. The entire admission process is online this year and, for every subject a student has applied to, he or she will have to upload the scanned copies of the score card and other documents. The students will have to produce the same documents in physical form for verification if they secure admission. St Xavier’s College, too, will accept the online mark sheet at the applications stage. “Since many students have not received the hard copies of mark sheets, they can apply with their online mark sheets,” said an official. Loreto College accepts digilocker mark sheets. Digilocker is a cloud-based platform for storage, sharing and verification of important documents. Once the students receive the hard copies, they need to produce them when required by the college for verification and registration. Many other colleges will finalise and share information by Thursday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/some-colleges-allow-scanned-e-mark-sheets-for-ug-application-others-to-decide-soon/articleshow/85049370.cms||Zeeshan Javed

They will ensure that the infants get their required vaccines on time and adequate nutrition. The minister said that the department is focusing on bringing down the mortality rate of children under five years of age (U5MR) as well as infant mortality rate (IMR) in the state. Initially, this home-based care of newborn and young children (HBNC) will be started in 13 districts like Katihar, Nawada, Sheikhpura, Muzaffarpur, Purnia, Begusarai, Jamui, Aurangabad, Gaya, Sitamarhi, Banka, Khagaria and Araria and later all the districts will be covered. At present, home based care by Asha workers is only being given to newborn and their mothers according to specified schedule up to 42 days of life. Pandey said, “The extension of HBNC to children upto 15 months will improve the nutrition status of children in Bihar. “Proper care and nutritious food can only help in improving the health of a child and this is the reason for starting such a programme. It will also reduce the mortality of children. Asha workers, who will visit the homes, will see to it that these children are breastfed, vaccinated on time, live in hygienic condition and get additional nutrition and do not suffer from anaemia. In case of any health-related issues with small children, parents will be given proper advice.” As a part of this HBNC programme, Asha workers will make five visits to the home of children which will commence when the child turns three, then at six months, nine months, 12 months and 15 months. Sharing the data on U5MR and IMR, Pandey said the state has witnessed improvement in both the categories. He said as per the data of sample registration survey, while U5MR was 35 in 2017, it has reduced to 32 in 2018. Similarly, IMR was 28 in 2017 and it came down to 25 in 2018. However, health experts feel the state has a lot to do in terms of providing nutrition to children as many kids in Bihar are malnourished As per NFHS-4, Bihar was at the top in this category with 48.3% stunted children. This came down to 42.9% in NHFS-5 survey and Bihar was in the second position among the 22 states surveyed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/asha-workers-to-focus-on-home-based-care-of-kids/articleshow/85047206.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Dehradun||Do prisoners have 'right to procreate'? Uttarakhand HC to find out||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court will explore whether the Constitution of India provides people incarcerated in prisons with the 'right to procreate' following an inmate’s bail application which sought his short-term release to start a family. The court on Wednesday said it would also explore whether such a right is absolute or conditional and what these conditions or reasonable restrictions would be. The court would also look into the rights of a child born out of the union since he would be deprived of a “father figure”. The bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma was hearing an application for short-term bail filed by an inmate’s wife which sought his release on the grounds that the couple wanted to have children. Two of his bail pleas had been rejected by the high court earlier. The inmate, identified only as Sachin, is serving a 20-year sentence and has been in prison for the last seven years. According to his wife’s petition, the couple had only been married for three months when Sachin was arrested and they never had the chance to start a family. The bench remarked that apart from the rights of the incarcerated person, it would also explore the rights of the wife, the rights of the child born out of such an arrangement as well as the rights of bachelors since one can argue whether someone can be denied a right because he is not married. “The child would say I have the right of company of my father who is incarcerated. But then the question is, shall we permit a child to be brought into the world whose upbringing will be difficult because the mother is a single parent... What about the psychological impact on the child who is asked to live without a father figure? Therefore, the rights of the child need to be decided although the child is neither conceived nor born,” said the chief justice. The bench added that if the inmate is indeed permitted to procreate and if his wife does give birth a child then could the state be obliged to look after them since the mother might argue that she has no means to raise the baby. “Now do we burden the state to look after the child? Because the mother can say she has no means to bring up the child," the court said. The court has asked the amicus curiae, J S Virk, as well as the counsel for the petitioner to inform the court about the conventions and policies being followed in countries like the US, Canada, Australia and England. The government has also been asked to explain where it stands on the issue. In October 2020, the Patna high court had released a life convict on parole for the purpose of procreation, holding that the ‘right to procreate’ survives incarceration. It had quoted provisions of individual prison cells in Brazil and Czech Republic that allow intimate contact. In a similar case in 2015, the Punjab and Haryana high court had ruled that the “right to procreate” of a convict falls within the Right to Life and Personal Liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, but had added that it was not an absolute right. The court was hearing a petition filed by a prisoner couple held guilty of murder. The bench declined procreation right to them because the circumstances that led to their incarceration were “far grave in nature”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/do-prisoners-have-right-to-procreate-ukhand-hc-to-find-out/articleshow/85047827.cms||Prashant Jha

The sensex rallied 546 points or 1% to close at 54,370 points. At the close of session, the Nifty also rallied 126 points, or 0.8% to close at 16,259. Investors are also bullish as several states are relaxing their Covid-induced restrictions, raising hopes that the struggling domestic economy could weather the negative impact of the second wave better than earlier estimated. End-of-the-session data on the BSE showed that foreign funds were net buyers at Rs 2,829 crore, adding to a Rs 2,100-crore net inflow on Tuesday. According to a top exchange official, with the Chinese administration coming down heavily on a large number of technology-driven companies in recent weeks, several foreign fund managers are eyeing the Indian market. Top market players are optimistic that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to continue to buy in the Indian market, reversing their Rs 11,308-crore net outflow in July. After a two-day rally that added over 1,000 points to the sensex, there are signs that Thursday could see some correction. Tuesday’s rally was concentrated among large-cap stocks. But Wednesday’s rally was skewed in favour of frontline stocks. Within the 30 sensex stocks, 14 closed higher, while in the broader market there were 1,086 advances to 2,176 laggards, an advance-decline ratio of more than 1:2 in favour of the declines. As a result, investors’ wealth, measured by BSE’s market capitalisation, also fell by about Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 242 lakh crore, official data showed. In addition, on the Wall Street, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices each were down between 0.4% and 0.9% in mid-session as job scenario in the world’s largest economy deteriorated. This could also have some impact on the investor sentiment on Dalal Street, market players said. Technically too there are mixed signals. According to a note by Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities, on daily charts the index has formed breakout continuation formation, which is broadly positive for the market. “But intraday charts and momentum indicators suggest a temporary overbought situation and traders may take cautious stance near 16,300 -16,330 levels. We are of the view that in the next few trading sessions buying on dips and sell on rallies would be the ideal strategy for the day traders,” the note said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-hits-54k-for-1st-time-as-china-wary-fpis-bet-on-india/articleshow/85053962.cms||---

The accused had abducted Meet Soni, an 11-year-old kid, from outside their house on his motorcycle. Police started chasing him from Sheoganj in Sirohi and caught him near Dhola village in Pali district and rescued the boy safely. Sirohi SP Dharmendra Singh Yadav said the missing complaint of Meet was received by Sheoganj police at 11.30 pm on Tuesday night. His parents were asked to pay a ransom of Rs 1.5 crore or gold equivalent to the amount. “The abductor called boy’s father Laxman Soni at 11.13 pm stating that his son was under his possession and asked him to kep Rs 1.5 crore or gold equivalent to it ready in half-an-hour,” said Yadav. “The accused warned that if he informed police, he would sever the legs and hands of the boy and told him to wait for further directions for receiving the ransom,” said the official. The abductor, identified as Devesh Soni (39), rode his motorcycle to Jodhpur with the boy and kept calling his father from the eateries enroute from phones of others. He also got the boy talk to his father once. Following these signs, police began chasing him and caught him finally near Dhola village in Pali district about 1.30 am and took the boy in its custody. Yadav said that Devesh, who was known to both the boy and his father, had picked up the boy from Sheoganj under the pretext to collect some parcel for his father on his motorcycle. Since the boy knew him, he did not doubt his intentions. The boy, however, sought clarification on riding such a long distance, but became silent when Devesh scolded him. Further interrogation revealed that Devesh had run into huge debt during lockdown and hatched this plan to recover money in one shot. Since he knew Laxman and that he could easily fulfill his demand, he chose him as a target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jeweller-held-for-abducting-son-of-fellow-businessman/articleshow/85052450.cms||---

Usually “market makers” are large, well-capitalised brokers, who are backed by regulators and exchanges to boost investor participation. Sebi is working with various stakeholders to put in place the rules for such entities, it said in its annual report for fiscal year 2020-21. With the regulator looking to diversify sources of funds for the infrastructure sector, Sebi has been focusing on creating a vibrant secondary market for investment grade corporate bonds. “Sebi has rolled out several measures in the recent past to facilitate liquidity in the secondary market. One additional proposed step is aimed at creating a set of market makers who will be present in the market most of the time both on the buy side as well as the sell side of investment grade corporate bonds,” it noted in its annual report. Sebi is working to put in place the right eligibility criteria for such ‘market makers’ to ensure that financially sound entities with the expertise are encouraged to participate. It is also working to create a repo market for corporate bonds that could in turn fund the inventory holding of the market makers, it noted. Sebi plans to revamp the corporate bond database which is accessible to all investors. “This database will make available more granular level information about debt covenants to investors in the debt market,” the annual report noted. As the low-cost passive investing that is sweeping through the developed markets, Sebi is also working to put in place the right infrastructure for such funds, the most popular being the exchange traded funds (ETFs). “Passive funds in India have tremendous scope to grow as the assets under management under passive funds in India is still low as compared to its global peers,” it noted. Sebi is looking at ways to develop the passive investing segment like increasing liquidity for ETFs on the exchange platforms by efficient market making, better disclosures and transparency regarding these funds and introduction of new products. Meanwhile, Sebi has collected over Rs 155 crore from settlement orders during FY21, a three-fold jump over Rs 51.8 crore it collected in FY20. However, the collections got a boost from the one-time settlement scheme that it had introduced on August 1, 2020 and ran till December 31, 2020. Its annual report also revealed that its total inflows during fiscal 2020-21 was Rs 811.3 crore, up 30% over fiscal 2019-20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-aims-to-deepen-bond-etf-mkts-with-new-tools/articleshow/85054559.cms||---

Anwar was addressing a seminar on ‘Burning Challenges of Indian Democracy’, organized by the Rajiv Gandhi Study Circle in a city hotel here, where he was present as the chief guest. The seminar was inaugurated by state Congress president Madan Mohan Jha. “Constitutional bodies of our country are in danger and those who speak the truth are being silenced by the government and even threatened. Even the media is being stopped from speaking the truth. Our ancestors, who fought for the Independence, chose the democratic system so that each and every individual could enjoy his or her rights. Now, it is very important for people to unite as the democracy is being weakened by the present government,” Anwar said. “RSS is an unconstitutional body and it has imposed its undemocratic ideology through the NDA government,” the Congress general secretary added. He also criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government on the Pegasus issue and alleged they could stoop to any level only to remain in power. State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha urged the youth to come forward to strengthen the democracy. He said every individual needs to understand his responsibility towards the country. State Congress working president Shyam Sundar Singh Dheeraj said raised the issue of inflation and demanded the present government to ensure that each and every child can get proper education.  Rajeev Gandhi Study Circle state coordinator Ramayan Prasad Yadav in his address said that democracy is not only a system to run a government but it is also a system to protect the basic rights of an individual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/constitutional-bodies-of-country-in-danger/articleshow/85047252.cms||---

Temple officials admitted that there is no track record of gold and silver ornaments donated by devotees since 2009. Some devotees even suspected that a few gold ornaments donated to the deity may have gone outside the temple in the 12 years since the last appraisal, benefiting a section of employees. Devotees also expressed their anger with the temple management, terming it a ‘negligent attitude’ in protecting the ornaments. Speaking to TOI, executive officer of SimhachalamTemple, M V Suryakala, said that as per practice, jewellery in the possession of the temple should be updated every three years. But, due to various reasons, the gold audit was not done for 12 years. The EO said a two-member team of the endowments department from East Godavari began the exercise to assess the value and weight of each gold ornament. Tne process is likely to be completed within two days. Officials added that the team verified some of the ornaments listed in the 2009 AR. It will also verify the ornaments that are with the temple priests for adorning the deity and inspect and assess the ornaments that are with the temple assistant executive officer and in the strong room. As per practice, devotees hand over gold and silver ornaments to the temple priests, officials issue a receipt to the donor and the donation is recorded in the interim register (IR). Some ornaments listed in the IR have not been updated in the AR since 2009. The teams will continue assessment till all ornaments are verified and allotted anumber in the appraisal register. After finalising the AR, officials will update the property register that will have details of the total extent of temple land, ornaments and other temple properties. Later, details of the property register will be submitted to the assistant commissioner of endowments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/simhachalam-temple-takes-up-gold-audit-after-12-yrs/articleshow/85049761.cms||Nalla.Babu

They burst crackers, danced in mock celebration and hurled caste abuses at her family, saying that the team had lost because it had “too many Dalit players,” Vandana’s family told TOI. One of the accused has been detained by police. “We were upset after the loss. But the team went down fighting. We were proud of that,” Vandana’s brother Shekhar told TOI. “Suddenly, right after the match, we heard loud noises. Crackers were being burst outside our house. When we went outside, we saw two men from our village -- we know them and they are upper castes -- dancing in front of our house.” When they saw Vandana’s family step out, they unleashed a stream of casteist abuses. “They used caste slurs, insulted our family and said the Indian team lost because too many Dalits (the men used a specific caste slur) have made it to the team. They went on, saying that it’s not just hockey but every sport that should keep Dalits out,” the complaint filed by Shekhar said. “Then, they took some of their clothes off and started dancing again … It was a caste-based attack.” An FIR is yet to be registered on the basis of the complaint at the time of filing the report. “One man whose name came up has been detained,” SHO of Sidcul police station LS Butola told TOI. He didn’t say who. “We have received a complaint and inquiry is on, after which a case will be filed.” Watch Shocking!

A 40-km-long ring road around Muzaffarpur town would also be constructed to ease traffic congestion. CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday approved the alignments of four major highway projects after reviewing a presentation made by the road construction department (RCD) additional chief secretary Amrit Lal Meena. The projects include construction of a greenfield four-lane highway from Mokama to Munger, another greenfield four-lane highway from Buxar to Varanasi via Chausa, four-laning of the existing Barauni-Muzaffarpur national highway, including construction of a 40-km-long ring road around Muzaffarpur town and the four-laning of Buxar-Haidariya (Ghazipur, UP) road to provide direct connectivity to UP’s Purvanchal Expressway. “A sum of around Rs10,000 crore would be spent on the construction of the four projects,” Meena told TOI on Wednesday. He said as the alignments of these four projects had been approved by the CM, the department would now finalize their detailed project reports (DPRs). Meena said the Mokama-Munger greenfield highway would be 92-km-long. This also includes a 20-km-long link road from Sarmera to Manoharpur. The greenfield highway would cross through Manoharpur and south of Lakhisarai town. Meena further said the required land for the Mokama-Munger highway was available, whereas the government would start land acquisition exercises for the other three projects. Giving details about the Muzaffarpur ring road project, Meena said all national highways entering into Muzaffarpur town would now be linked through the proposed ring road. “The Muzaffarpur-Barauni highway would be linked to the Muzaffarpur-Hajipur highway through a 5-km-long bypass road. Similarly, the Muzaffarpur-Barauni highway would be linked to Muzaffarpur-Darbhanga east-west corridor through an 11-km-long bypass road. The Muzaffarpur bypass road will be linked to the east-west corridor by a 1.6-km-long road,” Meena said. At the meeting, Nitish also approved the RCD’s proposal to send a recommendation to the Union government for inclusion of the proposed seven new four-lane highways under the Bharatmala phase 2. The proposed projects include the four-laning of 552-km-long India-Nepal border road (currently being constructed as two-lane), Patna-Kolkata Expressway, Buxar-Arwal-Jehanabad-Biharsharif highways (Buxar to Arwal part will be a greenfield project), Dalsinghsarai-Simri Bakhtiyarpur highway, Dighwara-Masrakh-Piprakothi-Motihari-Raxaul highway, Sultanganj-Deoghar highway and Masrakh-Muzaffarpur highway. After reviewing the new road projects, Nitish said these have been prepared for further strengthening of the road infrastructures in Bihar and were superior. The CM asked the RCD officials to ensure proper maintenance of existing roads while constructing the new highways and four-lane roads. State RCD minister Nitin Nabin, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan and development commissioner Amir Subhani were also present at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-approves-alignments-of-four-highway-projects/articleshow/85047091.cms||Madan Kumar

The HC bench, headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya, expressed displeasure over the manner in which the case has been handled by the respective departments. The bench also took a serious note of the application filed by the principal secretary (finance) S S Rawat seeking to dispense with his appearance before the court on the day of hearing. The Chief Justice said the manner in which the application was filed, stating that he could not attend the court because of “unforeseen and unavoidable reasons” without giving any specifics, cannot be accepted. On July 15, the court had directed the government to clear all pending bills by August 4. On Wednesday, advocate general S Sriram submitted that part payments have been made where there was no dispute. As the vigilance enquiry found discrepancies in the works done, they could not make payments as directed by the high court. Special government pleader C Sumon further submitted that the total amount payable is Rs 1,794 crore, out of which payments of Rs 413 crore have been made for works valued less than Rs 5 lakh. Senior counsel P Veera Reddy, arguing for the petitioners, contended the claims. “The government is claiming they made payments of Rs 413 crore, but as per my information, only Rs 43 crore has been paid so far,” he said, and urged the bench to direct the government to place records of payments made. Considering his request, the bench directed the government to place all records pertaining to the payments made so far.

---||Business||HDFC Secs to start low-cost brokerage platform||Mumbai: HDFC Securities is working on an alternate tech-led platform to take on low-cost digital broking firms. The target segment for the new platform are digital-savvy millennials and generation Z individuals who are taking to the stock market in large numbers. This segment is comfortable with service without human intervention, is cost-conscious and participates in low-value transactions. The broking arm of HDFC Bank, which is among the top full-service brokerage firms in the country has historically been tapping customers of its parent bank. This allowed the group to provide a three-in-one account where the parent’s savings and depository participant account enabled seamless transactions. Speaking to TOI, Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO, HDFC Securities said “We are a full-service brokerage firm. We are seeing over 92% of our customers are using digital channels for transacting and over 85% of our revenue comes from digital channels. We have seen a good increase in the last year” “We are also upgrading to cloud-native technology which will enable much larger volumes in terms of transactions,” said Relli. He added that the transition was likely to be completed by the end of the fiscal year. According to Relli, there is a new opportunity opening up for these young customers who are cost-conscious. A key difference in the offering would be the unbundling of the three-in-one accounts where customers can link their brokerage accounts. Until last year HDFC Securities was linking the trading account to demat accounts of HDFC Bank. Last year the bank got demat account on its own. The new offering will allow the customers to link their trading account with any bank or demat account and enable transactions through a payment gateway. “We do expect some cannibalisation of existing customers as the cost-conscious may move to the new platform,” said Relli. However, most customers are expected to stick around because of the value it provides through value-added products and a common relationship executive. According to industry sources, HDFC Securities has the highest revenue per customer among the large brokerage firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-secs-to-start-low-cost-brokerage-platform/articleshow/85054412.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Lucknow||Madrassa students in Uttar Pradesh may be eligible for army jobs soon||LUCKNOW: If a madrassa student wants to enrol in the army, their certificate of education from the UP Board of Madrassa Education is not considered valid enough by the armed forces. A number of other higher education and employment bodies also do not allow madrassa students to join their ranks based on their certification. To tackle this problem, the UP government has applied for membership of the Council of Boards of School Education in India (COBSE) of which 67 state boards are already members. A second proposal put up by the state madrassa board to help its students with higher education is to provide degrees to kamil and fazil (graduation and post-graduation) madrassa students under the Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Language University. This method is followed by Bihar Madrassa Board which gives higher education degrees through Maulana Mazharul Haque Arabic and Persian University, Patna. There are about 16,000 recognized madrassas in the state, including the 560 government-aided ones. Around 18 lakh students are enrolled in these institutions from 1st to 8th standard (tahtaniya/faukaniya) to secondary (munshi/maulvi), senior secondary (aalim), kamil (graduation) and fazil (post-graduation). “It was recently brought to our notice that the armed forces and several other employment agencies and educational institutions do not accept our board’s education certification for enrollment with them. They ask for COBSE registration from the candidates which the UP Board of Madrassa Education does not have as of now. We have now applied seeking COBSE accreditation,” said board registrar RP Singh. He also added that a major problem was faced by students in higher education when the kamil and fazil degree was not accepted as equivalent to graduation and post-graduation by a number of institutions. “For this a proposal has been put forth that the Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Language University create the syllabus, conduct the degree-level examinations and give degrees to our students,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/madrassa-students-may-be-eligible-for-army-jobs-soon/articleshow/85054488.cms||Yusra Husain

Two police teams have been formed for round-the-clock patrolling in the river by boats and steamers in two shifts, especially near Koilwar bridge. The efforts have started yielding positive results, locals say. “Special teams have been formed for the evening and night patrolling in Sone river to curb illegal sand mining. I personally monitor the night patrolling. Boats and steamers have been pressed into service for the patrolling. The illegal sand mining will not be allowed at any cost,” Bhojpur SP Vinay Tiwari said. The police have arrested 74 persons engaged in illegal sand mining and seized more than 30 boats in the past six days. New SHOs have been posted at Koilwar, Barhara, Sandesh, Ajimabad and Chandi police stations under which illegal sand mining had been most rampant. The action has been initiated after the recent suspension of two IPS and many other officers, including the then SPs of Bhojpur and Aurangabad, Rakesh Kumar Dubey and Sudheer Kumar Porika, respectively, for their alleged nexus with the sand smugglers and their failure to curb the menace, resulting in huge loss to state exchequer. Bhojpur DM Roshan Kushwaha, SP Tiwari, Sadar SDO Vaibhav Shrivastava, Sadar SDPO Vinod had jointly launched the river patrolling last week. for about four hours to find out the modus operandi of the sand smugglers. Several seized boats have been been weaved like a barrier and sunk around the pillar number 10 of the old Koilwar bridge to prevent illegal mining and transportation of sand. Most of the sand-laden boats used to cross the river near the 10th pillar due to maximum depth of water there. A local boatman admitted that the blockade near the crucial pillar number 10 has succeeded to a large extent in curbing illegal sand mining in the river.  But the sand smugglers are still trying their best to carry their operation. On Monday, a police constable, Ratan Kumar, was injured in stone-pelting by the sand smugglers near Paharpur village under the Garhani police station area. The police had gone to intercept about 10 overloaded sand-laden tractors. Garhani SHO Santosh Kumar said: “An FIR has been lodged against the tractor owners and the drivers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhojpur-cops-launch-24x7-patrolling-in-sone-to-check-illegal-sand-mining/articleshow/85047296.cms||---

They were speaking at a workshop on ‘Protect Breastfeeding: A Shared Responsibility’, organized by state resource centre, state health society and UNICEF to mark the ongoing international breastfeeding week. Integrated child development services (ICDS) director Alok Kumar said breast milk was a weapon for children to fight against diarrhoea, pneumonia and malnourishment and this message needs to be spread across the society. State programme officer (child health) Dr BP Rai stressed on creation of breastfeeding corners at workplaces for working women and said, “People should also be told about the harmful effects of substitute milk.” NMCH superintendent and paediatric department head Dr Vinod Kumar Singh said proper breastfeeding could bring down the infant mortality rate by 15% and proper diet along with breastfeeding after six months could help in reducing the mortality rate by 20%. “At present, newborns are facing three challenges — malnourishment, climate change and Covid-19. In such a situation, breastfeeding needs to be promoted,” he said. Another paediatrician, Dr Nigam Prakash Narain, called for the need to sensitize male partners in this regard. PMCH paediatric department head Dr AK Jaiswal said it was very important for newborns to have physical contact with their mother and her breast as it leads to developing breastfeeding habits in the infants. UNICEF programme manager Shivendra Pandey said the policies related to breastfeeding needs to be reviewed and the lactating mother and her family should be made aware of its benefits. UNICEF nutrition officer Dr Shivani Dar said there was no substitute to mother’s milk. She further said other family members of lactating mother and hospital staff should also be sensitized about the importance of breastfeeding and its early initiation. Dr Sarita, Dr Supriya Jaiswal, Dr Anil Kumar, Dr BP Jaiswal, state nodal officer of poshan abhiyan Shweta Sahay and UNICEF’s Mona Sinha also discussed the importance of breastfeeding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/breastfeeding-reduces-infant-mortality-rate/articleshow/85046649.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Prison officials said that two of Gujjar’s cellmates were discovered to have injuries and are being treated as suspects. Police have initiated the inquest proceedings into the gangster’s death while treating his case as one of “unnatural death”. The cops are waiting for the autopsy report and the judicial inquiry report to decide a further course of action. Police officers said they received a communication about the death of an inmate at Tihar jail around 9.15am on Wednesday. The police team reached the spot and found Gujjar, a murder accused, lifeless in the jail dispensary. Two brothers, Gurpreet and Gurjeet, who are imprisoned in a case related to a 2018 murder and shared the cell with Gujjar, were noticed to be bearing injuries and are suspected of being behind the murder. They are being treated at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital. The two are implicated in multiple criminal involvements. Gujjar’s family alleged that the murder was the outcome of the extortion racket being run by jail officials and that an assistant superintendent was miffed with Gujjar over non-payment of money to ensure a hassle-free time in jail. The Tihar administration is already facing a CBI inquiry in another case of murder in jail, with the role of jail officials under the scanner. After a phone was found inside Gujjar's cell a few days ago, the family maintained, the jail officials demanded Rs 1 lakh from the gangster to suppress the fact. The family disclosed they had sent Rs 50,000, but Gujjar’s brother accused the jail officials of beating the man to death when the remaining money wasn’t paid in time. Staging a brief protest outside the jail on Wednesday, the family demanded the autopsy be conducted in any hospital other than the designated DDU Hospital. While releasing recording of calls they made to the PCR for help, the family said that the jail administration was now pressuring Gujjar's cellmates to confess to the murder. Sandeep Goel, DG, Tihar, said an internal inquiry was being conducted apart from the investigation being carried out by Hari Nagar police in west Delhi. Gujjar was alleged to have slain BJP leader Vijay Pandit in Greater Noida in 2016 while working for Sundar Bhati. UP police had shot him three times in the leg during an encounter and arrested him. The criminal had joined hands with gangster Rohit Chaudhary and was arrested in the Saket shootout of 2019 that caused the death of Chaudhary's rival. Recently, he was taken on remand by the Crime Branch to be questioned about his assistance to Chaudhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gangster-found-dead-inside-tihar-cell-kin-allege-he-was-murdered/articleshow/85052560.cms||---

Surplus stocks of wheat and rice from various states are moved to deficit states to meet the requirements under the National Food security Act, 2013 by the FCI. Andhra Pradesh produces an average 130 lakh tonnes of paddy every year. According to official statistics, the production of paddy in the state is estimated at 134.15 lakh metric tonnes in 2020-21 as against 137.10 lakh MTs in 2019-20. The FCI, in the draft report of the Committee on Public Undertakings (2020-21), mentioned that Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh are surplus states in terms of wheat procurement vis-a-vis their own consumption. Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Odisha are surplus states in terms of rice procurement vis-à-vis their own consumption. According to the report, about a decade back, nearly 90% of stocks were moved from the north, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, which has now come down to 72%. This is due to an increase in procurement of rice in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and West Bengal, and wheat in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The area under paddy in kharif 2020-21 in Andhra Pradesh was 16.90 lakh hectares against 15.26 lakh hectares in 2019-20, representing an increase of 10.7%. Similarly, the production of paddy in kharif 2020-21 was 71.37 lakh tonnes compared to 80.13 lakh tonnes in 2019-20, marking a decrease of 10.9%. The area under paddy in rabi 2020-21 was 8.81 lakh hectares compared to 8.3 lakh hectares in 2019-20, translating to an increase of 6.1%. Similarly, the production under paddy in rabi 2020-21 was 61.89 lakh tonnes against 56.97 lakh tonnes in 2019-20, showing an increase of 8.6%. Andhra Pradesh, on its own, procured 34,49,067 MTs of paddy with a value of Rs 6,286 crore from 2.22 lakh farmers in 2019-20. Similarly, in kharif of 2020-21 (October 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021), a quantity of 47,49,844 MTs of paddy, valued at Rs 8,900 crore, was procured from 5.18 lakh farmers. The gross area irrigated in Andhra Pradesh increased to 38.13 lakh hectares in 2019-20 from 36.35 lakh hectares in 2018-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/in-3-years-over-63l-tonnes-rice-ferried-to-other-states/articleshow/85049949.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The high court observed that it found no substance in the arguments of the petitioners and promoting them to second year while having backlogs in first year would defeat very purpose of the new regulations brought in by the Medical Council of India (MCI) that are applicable to all medical students across the country. Justice U Durga Prasad Rao pronounced the judgment dismissing the interlocutory applications moved by the MBBS students who were not promoted to second year because of not passing in all subjects in the first year. They moved the high court seeking 20 per cent grace marks as the question paper given to them was not in accordance with the guidelines given by MCI. The students argued that according to the MCI guidelines, the question paper should contain multiple choice questions for 20 per cent of total marks. However, the question paper given to them by Dr NTR University of Medical and Health Sciences was not in the prescribed format and consequently they failed in the examination. As the guidelines prescribe 20 per cent marks, they sought directions to add the marks to them as grace marks and promote them to second year. They filed an interlocutory application to promote them to second year without referring to passing of first year subjects pending disposal of the petition. Justice Durga Prasad Rao dismissed the interlocutory application and issued notices to the respondents to file counter affidavits with regard to the issue of adding grace marks.

---||Business||SBI reports its highest ever quarterly profit of Rs 6,504cr||Mumbai: SBI reported its highest quarterly net profit of Rs 6,504 crore for the three months ended June 2021, an increase of 55% over Rs 4,189 crore in the year-ago period. The increase was on the back of a 24% jump in non-interest income to Rs 11,803 crore from Rs 9,497 crore in the previous year, which included a Rs 1,692-crore recovery from Kingfisher Airlines. SBI chairman Dinesh Khara said that the bank does not see the exposure to Vodafone Idea as stressed. However, the bank was taking steps to insulate the balance sheet from any possible threat. The bank’s shares rose by over 2% to Rs 457 on Wednesday. SBI has seen an increase in stressed accounts in the retail segment due to the second wave. The bank’s net non-performing assets (NPAs) rose to Rs 43,153 crore as of June 2021 from Rs 42,704 crore a year ago. The increase was significant compared to its March 2021 figure of Rs 36,810 crore. Of the Rs 15,666 crore of slippages, Rs 1,008 crore came from corporates, Rs 6,416 crore from SMEs, Rs 2,920 crore from the farm sector, Rs 5,268 crore from personal loans and Rs 54 crore from international. Despite the slippages, Khara provided a positive outlook, citing improvement in credit pushing up interest income and a rebound in collections in July. SBI has a significant recovery pipeline of written-off loans, that are in an advanced stage of resolution and could add to other income in coming quarters. The bank’s home loan portfolio that crossed Rs 5 lakh crore last year saw more than half a percentage point rise in bad loans. Khara said that the slippages in retail loans were transitory and that the bank would continue to grow its home loan portfolio. “Hopefully, we should see less than 1% NPA in home loans,” he said. The bank had similarly seen slippages on its gold loan portfolio, but Khara said that the NPAs would fall as fast as they rose as customers have been returning to the branches to make payments in July after the lockdown ended. Expressing hope on the pace of vaccination, Khara said that the bank was better placed in the event of a third wave as it could now deliver most of its products digitally to customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-reports-its-highest-ever-quarterly-profit-of-rs-6504cr/articleshow/85054334.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Allahabad||HC seeks details of power scam in 144 Jhansi villages||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has directed the UP government’s counsel to inform the court about the status of investigation and the arrest made so far in the alleged multi-crore scam, which had taken place while electrifying around 144 villages of Jhansi in Bundelkhand region under Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojna. The court further directed the state counsel to find out whether till date any material evidence has been collected to find the truth of the allegation because a large number of villages were made part of the investigation. “If the evidence has been collected in reference to those villages, whether accused thereupon have been arrested, if the bail was not granted and if they have not been arrested, the reason thereof,” the court further added. Hearing a PIL filed by one Girraj Singh on July 26, Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Ajai Tyagi directed to list this case on August 5, 2021 for the next hearing. According to the petitioner, a contract was given to a Hyderabad-based company under Rajiv Gandhi Vidyutikaran Yojna to electrify as many as 144 villages in Jhansi of Bundelkhand region. It is alleged that the Hyderabad-based company in collusion with engineers of the state electricity department obtained payment without completing the work. When the scam came to limelight, an FIR was lodged in this connection on July 5, 2019, at police station Navabad in Jhansi district. Subsequently, the vigilance department of the state was entrusted with the task of investigating this scam involving several crores of rupees. In the present PIL, the petitioner has alleged that the vigilance department is not doing its investigation properly. Hence, the petitioner has requested the court to direct the vigilance department to complete the investigation at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-details-of-power-scam-in-144-jhansi-villages/articleshow/85053534.cms||---

NCB sleuths apprehended Prakash Patel, a chemist who used to manufacture mephedrone (MD), a party drug, along with another man named Sonu Ramniwas, who used to sell it. According to NCB officials, they had received information that a drug syndicate was operating in Vapi. Based on the information, a team of NCB officials started surveillance in Valsad district few days back.  “We were tracking the accused and identified the factory where the manufacturing was taking place. Once we got confirmation, we raided the residential premises when the delivery of the drug was taking place,” said SK Mishra, zonal director of Ahmedabad zonal unit of NCB. NCB sources said that this is the first time that a manufacturing unit has been busted in Gujarat. Patel had come to deliver 4.5kg of MD to Ramnivas at his residence when NCB officials swooped down on them. During the initial questioning, Patel told the cops that he was a chemist by profession and was using his knowledge to manufacture MD. However, NCB is yet to know about the ownership of the factory where Patel was making the contraband. Officials said that more details will be revealed once they get custody of the duo from the court. “Since when were they manufacturing and who else is involved in the racket will be unearthed during further investigation,” Mishra added. It is suspected that the duo used to sell MD within Gujarat and in Mumbai too. “In the past seizures done by us were all from carriers or peddlers,” sources said. Following the duo’s arrest, NCB raided different places owned by the accused and seized Rs 85 lakh cash. “At one property. we found Rs 60 lakh while at another, we seized Rs 20 lakh cash. The entire cash is unaccounted for, and we suspect that it is proceeds from the sale of the drugs,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mephedrone-factory-busted-in-vapi/articleshow/85047335.cms||---

He moved the high court for bail arguing that a false case has been foisted against him with an intention to bypass the Supreme Court’s guidelines, which state that under 41A of CrPC notice has to be given if the punishment is less than seven years. Rao’s counsel Posani Venkateswarlu argued that none of the sections which prescribe more than seven years punishment are applicable in the present case. He said his client was the one who was attacked in the alleged incident, but ironically, a case has been registered against him. The counsel for the complainant and the government pleader argued the case is still under investigation and police are seeking custody of Rao. Justice K Lalitha allowed the petition filed by Rao and granted him bail with certain conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/court-grants-bail-to-ex-min-devineni/articleshow/85051033.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The bus conductor, driver and other staff fled from the spot. The daily wager was coming from Varanasi and was going home in Sitamarhi district. The incident took place on NH-77 near village Dariyapur Kafen under Turki police outpost in Muzaffarpur district. Even after 24 hours, police were yet to receive a written complaint in this connection to lodge an FIR. Turki outpost in-charge Ramvinay Kumar on Wednesday said the deceased was identified as Maharaj Das, 47. “He was a native of Singhchauri village under Nanpur police station area in Sitamarhi. He along with at least 12 more daily wagers from Sitamarhi were returning home from Varanasi via Patna,” he said. Kumar said police are investigating the matter from two angles — whether the conductor puhsed him out of the bus for fare or he fell from the moving bus accidentally and got crushed under its rear wheels. “The bus was seized. The body has been handed over to his family after postmortem,” he said. Kumar said the other daily wagers in his group first reached Patna from where they were going to Sitamarhi when the incident took place. He said police are trying to trace the bus conductor and the driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-pushed-out-of-bus-for-not-paying-fare/articleshow/85047148.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Patna HC fears derecognition of many medical colleges||PATNA: The Patna high court has expressed its apprehension that the state government’s medical colleges may get derecognised as 2,083 out of the 3,309 posts of assistant and associate professors and professors were lying vacant at these institutions. The bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh on Tuesday made the oral observation while hearing two writ petitions filed by 11 teaching staff of these colleges. The petitioners were earlier appointed by the health department as assistant professors, associate professors or professors in different government medical colleges across Bihar in the last 10-12 years. Those who were appointed as assistant or associate professors were even promoted to professor rank. Later, they were selected through Bihar Public Service Commission for the assistant professor post despite becoming professors over the years. The petitioners, represented by counsels PK Shahi, YV Giri and Shashi Bhushan Kumar, moved the high court in December last year urging that the authorities concerned be directed to take into account their experience and appoint them as professors against the lrge number of vacant posts in that rank. The bench on July 12 had sought from the state government the details of sanctioned and vacant posts of assistant professors, associate professors and professors. The government, through a supplementary affidavit, submitted that there were altogether 3309 sanctioned posts of the three ranks in the government medical colleges in Bihar and 2083 were lying vacant. There are 1788 sanctioned posts of assistant professors against which 409 are working as regular appointees, 306 are working on contract and the rest 1073 posts are vacant. Similarly, there are 1039 sanctioned posts of associate professors, of which 257 are filled up with regular appointments, 100 through contract and 682 posts are lying vacant. In the professor rank, 91 are regular appointees, 63 on contract and 328 posts are lying vacant against the 482 sanctioned posts. The court was also apprised that all necessary steps are being taken by the health department to fill up the vacant posts. However, the bench remained dissatisfied and directed the chief secretary to reply as what steps are being taken to fill up the vacant posts in all three ranks and action being taken to address the grievance of the petitioners, who were already working on a higher position. The bench also observed that a division bench of this high court had passed an order last year that vacant posts be filled up by regular appointments and not on contract. The court would hear the matter again on August 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-fears-derecognition-of-many-medical-colleges/articleshow/85046455.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Bihar: Lalu Prasad ready to play active role in opposition unity||PATNA: If the political developments of the last one week occurring nationally are any indicator, the chessboard has seemingly been laid for the moves and countermoves to be made by the aspiring kings and kingmakers from the fast-emerging political formations as a build-up to the 2024 parliamentary elections, observers feel. Also, from the BJP’s rival camp, RJD chief Lalu Prasad has not only begun to play his most famous role of being the well-known kingmaker, but also enjoying it, they said. Indications are that the emerging political formations are bipolar, one led by the BJP and the other by the Congress, in which Lalu appears to be trying to bring in Samajwadi Party and other like-minded outfits to give credible battle to PM Modi in UP, Bihar and Jharkhand, which together account for the whopping 134 parliamentary seats. For, in the last one week, if Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar called on him to inquire about his health, Lalu himself was closeted with Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav at his residence in the presence of former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav on Monday, and then followed it up by calling on well-known socialist leader ‘Sharad Bhai’ (Sharad Yadav). Asked about his opinion on the attempts being made for the formation of a ‘third front’ (which the BJP would rather relish), Lalu said on Tuesday, without giving too much of what his own actual position was: “If it is being forged, then it is good. There should be an alternative.” Indeed, the same day, Lalu’s representative from the RJD participated in the breakfast meeting of around 16 parties on Tuesday hosted by Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP Rahul Gandhi, who stressed on the unity in the opposition parties. The meeting was the result of months of discussions and parleys held by poll strategist Prashant Kishore, besides the hands down victory of TMC chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee in her state’s April-May assembly elections. She also canvassed for the opposition unity last week. Lalu and his son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav are already in her loop. Incidentally, on the face of it, the rallying cry of PM Narendra Modi and all other BJP leaders before 2019 was for a ‘Congress-mukt Bharat’ (Congress-free India), which, however, has come a cropper. Today, the Congress is leading opposition parties in their demand for a probe into the Pegasus spyware scandal. That brings into picture yet another big political player from Bihar, JD(U) leader and CM Nitish Kumar, who has already been projected as ‘PM material’ by his party leader Upendra Kushwaha and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi from the HAM(S). Nitish has also demanded a probe into the Pegasus snooping incident, besides insisting on caste-based census like other parties (barring the BJP), and has his own reason to oppose the population control law, all of which help him to prepare his pitch independent of the BJP. Asked about Nitish as ‘PM material,’ Lalu said: “(PM) Narendra Modi has to understand what it means, and the BJP has said that there is no vacancy for the post of PM for 20 years.” Lalu also said he did not foresee Nitish coming close to him in the present situation. Overall, as at present, to be vying for the country’s top post as ‘PM material’, which his party men see in him, will have to cobble up his own political combine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-ready-to-play-active-role-in-opposition-unity/articleshow/85049576.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Business||Container shortage, rising logistics cost hit auto exports: ACMA||Chennai: Over-dependence on Chinese container manufacturers and foreign shipping lines is beginning to pinch the auto industry with container availability and cost becoming an issue for auto exporters. Last week, TVS chairman Venu Srinivasan said that the company’s two wheeler exports in Q1 were hit by container availability. On Tuesday, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) president Deepak Jain said that auto component exporters are facing a ‘4x to 6x increase in logistics cost due to the container issue’. ACMA announced that component exports have fallen 8% in FY21 compared to the year before though the good news is exports to China have seen a small increase. “The container shortage began in H2 of FY21 but now the pinch has sharpened and the rates for a 40ft container to the US has gone up from $2,000 last year to $6,000 now,” said Jain. “A 40ft container to the EU used to cost $1,500 which is now $5,000. Given that the US and EU are our top export destinations, this has hit exporters badly,” he added. Component exports from India have dipped (for the second year in a row) by 8% from $14.5 billion in FY20 to $13.3 billion in FY21. It was $15.2 billion in FY19. India’s top export destinations are the US, Germany, Thailand, Turkey and the UK. Exports to the US (26% of total exports) have come down 6% from $3.7 billion to $3.5 billion. Europe too is down 4% from $4.36 billion to $4.2 billion. The good news is China has entered the top 10 export destinations with $360 million in Indian exports, up 14% from $320 million in FY20. According to Jain, the container shortage is hitting Indian exporters more because “container services to and from India are dependent on foreign shipping lines and container manufacturing is entirely China dependent,” he said. The current waiting period for a container is now 1-2 weeks from just 24-48 hours before.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/container-shortage-rising-logistics-cost-hit-auto-exports-acma/articleshow/85050400.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Headhunters say startups are wooing senior talent to set up better governance systems as they scale, and in some cases to launch new products and even help take them public. Startups are becoming the go-to option for C-suite talent in large enterprises looking for a change, with sales heads, heads of finance, marketing and chief business officers being a few in-demand roles, they said. Given the public market’s appetite for tech startups and the way valuations are soaring, CXO talent too is keen to negotiate higher ESOP components along with attractive hikes in pay, they added. Some marquee executive moves from large brands to startups include Microsoft’s Gangadhar Kodandaram moving to AI startup Vernacular.ai as chief revenue officer, and media veterans Ratan Singh Rathore (previously INCA) and Neha Nagpal Chatterjee (previously at ByteDance) at ShareChat. Fresh off a Rs 530 crore fundraise, beauty startup MyGlamm too bolstered its senior leadership with industry veterans from Unilever, Myntra, Godrej, L’Oreal, and OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei’s consumer tech stratup Nothing wooed former Samsung executive Manu Sharma as India head. Other appointments include recent unicorn GupShup appointing Sudesh Vasudevan (former executive at Evercore and Deutsche Bank) to senior ranks to help chart the company’s IPO roadmap. Short video platform Lomotif added former Zee5 CEO Tarun Katial, and Ken Cheung, former APAC head at Facebook & Instagram partnerships, as senior advisors. Alok Kumar, senior director, Manpower Group, said that for top talent, wealth creation is faster at startups and larger share of ESOPs in compensation packages has been a major draw. “The autonomy to innovate and ability to build things from scratch is also acting as a motivator,” he said, adding that the HR firm has been getting mandates from startups that have raised funds recently looking for senior hands in their sectors. Kamal Karanth, founder of staffing firm Xpheno says that since Zomato’s stellar listing, every time a startup announces a fundraise, senior talent in finance enquire about opportunities at the company with an interest to be part of their growth journey. “The salary expectations of CXOs are being exceeded by startups as they sweeten the cash component, and ESOPs too are a major attraction,” he said. Social commerce startup DealShare, for instance, said it recently hired senior leaders from Medlife, Flipkart, and Udaan at a minimum 30% pay hike for the roles. Teamlease notes around a 30% jump from pre-Covid times in mandates from startups for CXO candidates. “The C-suite talent are today mainly quizzing startups about their valuation and future fundraising plans including IPO, and some entrepreneurial candidates are also taking a pay cut,” Kaushik Banerjee, VP and business head, Teamlease.com, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/startups-woo-cxos-with-hikes-esops/articleshow/85050496.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Top leaders of the Congress, including Revanth, former deputy chief minister Damodar Raja Narsimha—who is the Huzurabad election in charge—and senior leaders from Karimnagar district met here on Wednesday to shortlist candidates for the bypoll. The problem for the Congress is that many of the second rung leaders too have either joined TRS or there are allegations from the local party cadre that they are discretely working for the ruling party. After the meeting, Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy made it clear that no one will be spared, including him, and that stringent disciplinary action would be taken against those indulging in anti-party activities. However, the election strategy committee did not announce the names of probable candidate for the bypoll. It was decided that former MP and election strategy committee chairman Damodar Raja Narasimha would finalise the name and announce it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-struggles-to-find-face-for-ensuing-bypoll/articleshow/85054457.cms||---
---||Patna||HC to BCI: Accommodate students if colleges fail to fulfil affiliation criteria||PATNA: The Patna high court has orally asked the Bar Council of India (BCI) to accommodate students studying in the state government or private law colleges which might not be fulfilling the affiliation criteria. The division bench Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar was hearing a batch of writ petitions filed by Kunal Kaushal, Vivek Kumar Gupta and Syed Arif Quli on Wednesday. The court also directed the 27 law colleges in Bihar to submit petition within one week before BCI for carrying out inspection to know if they fulfil the basic criteria for getting affiliation or not. The court directed the BCI to carry out inspection within the next two weeks after they submit their petitions to decide on granting affiliation to those who fulfil criteria and then accommodate their students accordingly. The bench has fixed August 24 for hearing the matter again. The high court had stayed the registration for fresh admissions in all these colleges on March 22 this year after it came to know from the BCI inspection report that except the CNLU in Patna and Central University of South Bihar in Gaya, none of the 27 colleges fulfil the affiliation criteria because of severe shortage of teaching staff and other infrastructure. These colleges have yet not been able to get relief as the stay on the registration for session 2021-2022 continues. Kaushal had first moved the high court urging it to direct the authorities concerned that all permanent posts of teaching staff in the law college under Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University be filled. The court came to know that the law college in-charge principal was actually a history teacher and the post had been vacant since 1992. It has only two professors. The court increased the ambit and ordered the BCI to inspect all law colleges and submit its report. The BCI report said 450 out of 584 posts of law faculties were vacant and three law colleges were running without any faculties, eight didn’t have qualified principals and 19 colleges were not even covered by the UGC payscale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-to-bci-accommodate-students-if-colleges-fail-to-fulfil-affiliation-criteria/articleshow/85046516.cms||---

---||Business||RBI extends current a/c freeze deadline||Mumbai: The RBI has given banks time until October 31 to comply with its circular on introducing discipline in the opening of current accounts. The RBI has said that banks should escalate to the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) any issues they face in implementing the directive, and if it still remains unresolved they should be forwarded to the RBI for regulatory consideration. According to a PSU bank chief, the RBI in its meeting with public sector lenders made it clear that the circular needs to be implemented in spirit but if there are operational issues faced by customers, they should be resolved at the industry level. In a fresh circular on the guidelines for current accounts, the RBI reiterated that it does not apply to borrowers who have not availed of cash credit (CC) or overdraft (OD) facility and the banking sectors exposure to them is below Rs 5 crore. In the case of borrowers who have not availed of CC/OD facility from any bank and the exposure of the banking system is Rs 5 crore or more but less than Rs 50 crore, there is no restriction on lending banks to such borrowers from opening a current account. Even non-lending banks can open current accounts for such borrowers though only for collection purposes. According to bankers, technically there is no reason for a borrower with CC/OD facility to undertake transactions through another account. Bankers said that the main reason why many borrowers sought to keep a separate current account was to control their collections. “Many customers choose to transfer funds from their other account to repay their loans as they fear that using their loan account for collections could lead to problems when they are short on funds,” said a banker. However, several businessmen said that while they have old loans with public sector banks, they need the technology-based products of private banks particularly in the area of trade finance. The central bank’s circular comes at a time when some customers in Kerala initiated legal action to stall the implementation of the RBI directives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-extends-current-a/c-freeze-deadline/articleshow/85054713.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||NMC earns Rs1.59L from compost generated at Bhandewadi in 3 months||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started generating revenue through sale of compost. In the first three months of this fiscal, it has earned Rs1.59 lakh through the sale of compost manufactured at Bhandewadi dumping yard. On March 31, 2021, the civic body had entrusted M/s Shree Sai Bio Organic on experimental basis for producing compost from wet waste. Against garbage generation of around 1,000-1,200 metric tonnes (MT), NMC is treating only 150-200MT waste for preparing compost. The firm is supposed to pay Rs100 per MT from the sale of compost. In the first three months of this fiscal, the firm paid Rs1.59 lakh to NMC as its share towards sale of compost generated at Bhandewadi dumping yard. NMC’s public health engineering department (PHED) has submitted a proposal to the standing committee to extend the tenure of Hyderabad’s M/s Shree Sai Bio Organic firm for three months (from April to June). The standing committee meeting will be held on August 6. NMC had roped in M/s Hanjer Biotech on April 15, 2009, to recycle waste and produce compost from it on build, operate and transfer basis. Hanjer was expected to process up to 600MT waste per day. But it could never treat more than 200MT waste. Since the beginning, there were allegations regarding the firm’s functioning. Ruling party corporator and lawyer Dharampal Meshram had also exposed several irregularities in the functioning of the firm and NMC’s failure to check the same. Now, PHED stated in its proposal that the civic body has planned to treat 600MT of the 1,200MT waste being generated by the city. As per PHED’s proposal, NMC has received a nod from the state government to implement a revised solid waste management project worth Rs268.68 crore. The civic body aims to treat 600MT waste daily to manufacture compost and the process to invite tender for this will take another three to six months. So, until then, the tenure of the Hyderabad firm should be extended, the proposal stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-earns-rs1-59l-from-compost-generated-at-bhandewadi-in-3-months/articleshow/85047845.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The action follows a vigilance inquiry against the officials in the secretariat. Section officers Kasireddy Varaprasad and D Sreenu Babu too were suspended. They have been directed to stay put in the headquarters and not leave without the permission from the government. The government has also decided to initiate further disciplinary action against the officials as per the service rules. Principal finance secretary SS Rawat said that the government found conclusive evidence against the three officials passing on sensitive and confidential information from the department by violating the service rules. “The vigilance inquiry was ordered in the light of a series of news items published against the government in newspapers. It has been reported that Nagulapati Venkateswarlu and Kasireddy Vara Prasad passed on confidential information to another section officer D Sreenu Babu, who in turn passed the information to the media,” said Rawat. He said the role of Venkateswarlu in leaking the confidential data has also been indicated. He added that Venkateswarlu was fully aware of the sensitivity and confidentiality of the information, but still caused unauthorised transmission of information, which primarily gave rise to suspicion of deliberate leakage of information. The government stated that disciplinary proceedings are being initiated against Venkateswarlu for violating the rules. “After careful consideration of the available material and having due regard to the circumstances of the case, the government is satisfied that it is necessary to place Venkateswarlu, Varaprasad and Sreenu Babu under suspension. The orders will come into force with immediate effect and they shall continue to be under suspension in public interest until conclusion of disciplinary proceedings,” said Rawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-suspends-three-finance-dept-officials/articleshow/85051728.cms||Samdani MN

The project, which aims to avail digital gadgets to the students, will be implemented through the coordinated efforts of various departments. An action council has been formed with district panchayat president Ullas Thomas, district collector Jafar Malik, deputy director of education Honey G Alexander, etc. The officials of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, rural development department and Kudumbashree will also be part of the project. The plan is to collect the gadgets, mainly tablets, with the help from public and sponsorships. Those who are interested in sponsoring can buy the tab and gift it or can donate the money required to buy the gadget. Malik said that three committees — purchase, technical and finance & auditing — will be formed to monitor the purchase and distribution and ensure transparency. The details of sponsors will be completed by Tuesday. Also, the list of deserving students will be prepared by the education department. The verification of the list will be held through various meetings which will be attended by school heads, elected representatives, etc. The project will be launched on August 15 and will be completed within a month. Even though the state government has been taking several measures to ensure access to online education for all students, digital divide is still an issue for many of the students. The district education department has earlier launched 36 Common Learning Centre (CLCs) in Kothamangalam taluk to cater to the needs of students who have no access to online education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/campaign-to-minimize-digital-divide/articleshow/85049868.cms||---

According to University Police, the woman lodged a complaint against Kasam Iqbal Khumbhia under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 354 (d) (follows a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact such woman to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest by such woman) and sections of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and launched a probe. The singer and tabla player Kasam used to work together in an orchestra and during that time they fell in love. A few months ago, Kasam got married to another woman so the singer discontinued relationship with him. Despite being married, Kasam insisted on continuing their relationship and kept sending messages to the woman through social media, the singer alleged in her complaint. Even after the singer got engaged recently, Kasam did not stop sending messages to her and approaching her. Tired of the harassment, the woman lodged a police complaint against Kasam.

The statement came on a day the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) hit out at the incumbent Congress in the state over the development. When contacted, Sidhu said, “I will not be responding in the media but through official channels to the letter. However, STF has acted correctly as per court directions in the case and there is no delay on the part of the STF.” AAP Punjab affairs incharge Jarnail Singh said before the 2017 assembly elections, chief minister Amarinder Singh had promised to root out drug trade in the state. “But this development shows the way a failure of the state government is being covered up. The home portfolio is with the CM himself. There are references to big fish in the letter from the home department. But people had voted for the Congress by believing in the promises made by the CM. MLAs of both Congress and Akalis are known to be involved in the drug trade,” he added. He added Congress state president Navjot Singh Sidhu had himself been pointing out the failures of the state government. “It is his responsibility to give answers to these questions; otherwise, people will give a reply on the performance of the ruling Congress,” he added. ACS (home) Anural Aggarwal has said in the letter to the STF that it does not require any government or HC order to probe drug trafficking matters. “Moreover, in this case, there are no stay orders from the HC. In case the STF has cogent evidence against the said ‘big fish’ or even otherwise, if the STF is of the view that the matter needs to be investigated, nothing stops you from doing so. The entire delay is on part of the STF,” the letter said. Though the Congress government has claimed that there has been decisive action against drug trade, the issue has been flagged by many party MLAs to the AICC panel. It was later included in the 18-point agenda conveyed to the chief minister for action. A section of Congress MLAs has also demanded that the names of certain influential people mentioned by the STF in a sealed report to the court should be made public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stf-chief-counters-punjab-home-depts-claim-of-delay-in-action-against-big-fish-in-drug-trade/articleshow/85052530.cms||---
---||Noida||This Jamtara gang duped retired cops of Rs 4.5cr, 1 nabbed by Noida Police||NOIDA: A 24-year-old member of a cybercrime gang based in Jharkhand’s Jamtara was arrested by Noida police from Saharanpur on Tuesday for allegedly cheating scores of retired cops, particularly from UP, of over Rs 4.5 crore on the pretext of disbursement of pension. Posing as UP treasury department officials, accused Noor Ali and his five accomplices would call up the retired cops and share crucial details with them to gain their confidence. Investigators said the gang had sourced the personal data of their victims from online data markets or a shared database available with the cybercrime gangs based in Jamtara. Having gained their confidence, the accused would ask the potential targets to update their bank details so that they could avail some pending pension money directly in their savings account. Those who fell into their trap were asked to share OTPs sent to their phone numbers. And once the OTPs were shared, the accused would empty their bank accounts and transfer the money to several accounts opened with fake documents. According to inspector Vinod Pandey of the Cyber Crime police station in Noida, the accused have so far duped at least 25 retired cops of Rs 4.5 crore. Their victims include a retired cop in Varanasi, who was duped of Rs 40 lakh, a former police official based in Agra who lost Rs 10 lakh, and two retired policemen from Baghpat who were cheated of Rs 23 lakh and Rs 8 lakh, respectively. “Orginally from Bihar’s Bhagalpur district, Ali settled down in Punjab’s Fatehgarh Sahib district, where he owns his own house and has kept his parents. He was arrested from Saharanpur,” Pandey told TOI. “Like Ali, several other cyber criminals trained in Jamtara have of late started relocating to other states with their families.” So far, transactions in at least 80 bank accounts of several private banks and 40 wallets of e-payments platforms have been detected. Cops have so far traced Rs 1.5 lakh in the bank accounts used by the accused and got it frozen. Similarly, a total of Rs. 1.8 lakh across the e-wallets have also been frozen by the police with the help of the payments platform. Gang had targeted Punjab CM’s wife and sitting Patiala MP Preneet Kaur The same gang had earlier targeted Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh's wife Preneet Kaur and allegedly duped her of Rs 23 lakh. The mastermind of the gang, Ataul Ansari, in August 2019, called up Preneet Kaur while she was attending a Parliament session, pretending to be a State Bank of India (SBI) manager. He took details like ATM PIN and OTP number from Preneet, claiming that her salary had to be credited in the account and the vital information was immediately required. After securing the secret details, the accused allegedly withdrew Rs 23 lakh from Kaur's account in three transactions. The MP had lodged a complaint with the Punjab police, after which cops connected the dots with the cyber crime gangs based in Jamtara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/this-jamtara-gang-duped-retd-cops-of-rs-4-5cr-1-held/articleshow/85037950.cms||Shikha Salaria

Telangana irrigation officials did not attend the coordination committee meetings of both boards on Tuesday, demanding a full board meeting be conducted to address their concerns on water sharing issues. Official sources said there were some issues which were settled by the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)-1 earlier but not implemented by the KRMB. “We want to highlight these issues during the KRMB meeting. One is carry-over of unutilised waters, accounting of drinking water and right to draw 45 tmcft from Nagarjuna Sagar,” a senior irrigation official said. A chief engineer said the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal had earlier said if Godavari water was diverted to the Krishna from Polavaram, Telangana, above Nagarjuna Sagar jurisdiction, could utilise 45 tmcft of water out of 80 tmcft from upper catchment areas of Nagarjuna Sagar. As Telangana as catchment areas above Nagarjuna Sagar, the state has right to right draw 45 tmcft. AP constructed Pattiseema project by diverting Godavari water to the Krishna, the official said. “The earlier tribunal said only 20 per cent of the drawn water for drinking water should be accounted as some portion of the drinking water again comes to the basin. The Telangana government has been drawing 16 tmcft from Nagarjuna Sagar to meet Hyderabad drinking water supply needs. This has to be implemented. We have not utilised 45 tmcft of water in the Krishna and stored it for various purposes, which should be allowed as carryover for next year, which was allowed by KWDT-1,” a superintendent engineer said. Sources said these contentious issues would be raised in the KRMB full board meeting. The issue of seeking detailed project reports for projects that were completed prior to the bifurcation of AP will also be raised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-to-raise-key-issues-at-krmb-full-board-meet/articleshow/85054557.cms||---
---||Noida||GMC to introduce house tax for Raj Nagar Ext township||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) has decided to introduce house tax in Raj Nagar Extension township, despite stiff opposition from the residents and RWAs. With this, over 35,000 flats have now come under the ambit of house tax, and GMC hopes to generate over Rs 3 crore revenue annually.The RWAs are of the view that the civic body is not entitled to impose house tax as it has not yet taken over the township. However, the GMC says that until the handover of the society, it will not levy sewer and water tax but is well within its rights to impose house tax.Mahendra Singh Tanwar, municipal commissioner, said, “As a rule, house tax should be levied on properties falling under the jurisdiction of the Ghaziabad municipality. But there are many areas from where the GMC has not been collecting house tax, which has resulted in significant loss of revenue.”“In Raj Nagar Extension township, we did not charge house tax primarily due to opposition from the RWAs and residents. They believe that till the time township is handed over to the GMC, it cannot levy house tax, which is a wrong notion,” he added.The GMC, before imposing house tax in RNE township, carried out a survey of flats and societies in the township. “In our survey, we found out that there are 55 societies and 35,000 flats in the township. And in March this year, we set up stalls urging residents to comply with house tax and we got a favourable response even though a section of people was opposed to it,” said Sanjeev Singh, chief tax assessment officer, GMC.“At the rate of about Rs 3,000 per house/per year, we hope to collect house tax of about Rs 3 crore from the township,” he added.Sudeep Diwedi, vice president of Gulmohar Garden RWA, however, said, “We are not averse to paying the house tax, but our contention is that we need facilities and civic amenities in consonance with the tax. The township does not have even one decent park and even civic waste collection is not up to the mark.”After RNE, the GMC plans to introduce house tax in Crossings Republik township as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gmc-to-introduce-house-tax-for-raj-nagar-ext-township/articleshow/85037959.cms||Abhijay Jha

---||Noida||Greater Noida: Woman dies after 3 surgeries, ‘quacks’ booked||GREATER NOIDA: A 28-year-old woman died within two-and-a-half hours of a surgery, the last in a string of three unsuccessful operations, at a nursing home in Greater Noida’s Rabupura, triggering protests by locals and her family members, who alleged the surgeries were performed by two quacks. The woman, Poonam, had complained of stomach ache for the past few months after which her husband Pradeep took her to Raj nursing home hospital for treatment. The owner, Rajendra Singh, diagnosed she had an abdominal lump and advised surgery. Poonam was admitted to the facility on Monday afternoon. The first surgery took place around 2pm. Her relatives alleged she started bleeding and her condition deteriorated. A doctor, Rajiv Chaudhary, who was called to the facility, told them another operation was required. This was conducted around 4pm. “I wanted to take my wife to a better facility but Rajendra and Dr Chaudhary claimed they would ensure she’s fine at any cost,” Pradeep said. He alleged the duo carried out a third operation. When Poonam’s condition worsened, Rajendra took the couple to Yatharth hospital in Greater Noida, where doctors declared her dead around 3am on Tuesday. Pradeep alleged Rajendra left him at the hospital and brought Poonam’s body to the Rabupura police station and surrendered. The family complained to police and demanded that Rajendra and Dr Chaudhary be arrested. Cops, however, sent the body for post-mortem. After it returned from the mortuary, about 600 people, including Pradeep’s relatives, surrounded Raj nursing home for almost four hours, during which the nursing home staff locked the building and fled. The protesters alleged delay on part of police in lodging an FIR against the accused. They also claimed that Rajendra had been running the nursing home without any degree. Pradeep said he suspected that even Dr Chaudhary was not qualified to conduct surgeries. As the protest led to a traffic jam outside the nursing home, police teams reached the spot. ACP-4 (Greater Noida) Rudra Kumar Singh and SDM Jewar Rajnikant tried to pacify the villagers. Rabupura nagar panchayat chairman Virendra Singh ensured an FIR had been lodged and handed over a copy to the family. He also assured compensation to them, after which the villagers relented. DCP (Greater Noida) Abhishek Singh said the FIR was lodged against both the accused under IPC Section 308 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) as soon as a complaint was received. He said police are verifying the duo’s degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/woman-dies-after-3-surgeries-quacks-booked/articleshow/85037970.cms||Shikha Salaria

Melroy Dantes, Apoorva Kelkar and Madhushree Khursange — all in their 20s — were part of a five-member group that came to Rishikesh on vacation on August 1. Melroy, Apoorva and Madhushree are students of a college in Kandivli (E). Initial information said they were residents of Borivli (E). A police officer investigating the incident said the two other students who survived were too shaken to give out proper details. On Wednesday afternoon, the friends who were staying in a riverside hotel in Tapovan, went to explore a stretch of Ganga near the property. While three of them decided to take a swim, Nisha Goswami and Karan Mishra stayed on the banks. “It happened so fast. Apoorva had waded deep into the water and slipped. The other two swam towards her and within minutes all of them were caught in strong current and disappeared. We could not do anything as there was no one else at the spot,” Karan is believed to have told police. A search operation to find the trio was called off by evening as the river swelled due to heavy rain. Station house officer (SHO) at Muni ki Reti, Kamal Mohan Singh Bhandari, told TOI, that the search operation would continue on Thursday. “The parents have been informed, they will be coming to Rishikesh,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-mumbai-students-feared-drowned-in-ganga-in-rishikesh/articleshow/85056007.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Delhi||Woman kingpin of human trafficking gang selling infants in Delhi caught||NEW DELHI: In their investigations after catching a woman selling an infant in a decoy operation, police have traced and arrested the kingpin of the gang involved in the illegal sales of babies. The accused, Komal, 36, is alleged to have sold the 2-3-day-old girl for Rs 3.5 lakh. The cops said her husband is also a criminal and is lodged in jail on murder charges. The case came into focus in the first week of July with an FIR registered at Paschim Vihar West on the complaint of Priyank Kanoongo, chairperson, National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). While police had arrested a woman named Priyanka in the baby sale racket, the main accused hadn’t been traced. Police are now on the lookout for the other woman, Rani, who worked with Komal. Investigations so far have revealed that Komal and Rani operated a company under the name of Sonia Private Adoption Agency. “The company was listed online and was registered on search service Justdial. It is not an adoption agency, but deals with services like egg donation,” said an investigating officer. “Women who accidently got pregnant without wanting to bear children would be asked to give up their babies for a payment of Rs 1-1.5 lakh. Priyanka’s job was to identify clinics in localities where mostly daily wagers resided and were potential targets. Priyanka was paid Rs 10,000-15,000 in each case.” Parvinder Singh, DCP (Outer) confirmed the arrest of Komal and said that the investigation in the case was continuing and more arrests are likely to be made in the days to come. Komal and Rani met in 2015-16 when the former saw an advertisement in a newspaper about human egg donation. Soon after the two started their business along the same lines. According to Komal, Rani said she was from Surat although investigations proved that she belonged to Delhi’s Kapashera. This year, the duo has sold 8-9 infants, all girls, having got the babies from women who already had a number of kids earlier. The accused made the women sign a cursory contract to ensure the parents of the newborn surrendered the baby to them and no one else.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-kingpin-of-human-trafficking-gang-selling-infants-in-capital-caught/articleshow/85052624.cms||Sakshi Chand

---||Kochi||Engineering students in Kochi build humanoid robot||KOCHI: A group of students from KMEA Engineering College, Aluva, has built a humanoid robot for potential use in healthcare, for the Covid treatment. The robot, named Fuego 2.0, could sense the temperature of a patient or measure his or her pulse. It could also measure heartbeats, provide sanitizer, speak to patients, and give instructions to them. According to the developers, it is the first Covid robot to be built in any of the engineering colleges in the state. Humanoid robots have the body features of a human being and they move like humans. Robotics is a hot topic of research across the world — both in academic institutions and major corporates like Toyota, Sony, or Google (through Boston Dynamics). “I had started originally as my final year project, but then with the Covid situation, I did it with the help of students from other departments. Now it has become more of a college project, rather than my final year project,” said Naeema Nazar, electronics and communication final year student. Apart from electronics and communications, students from other departments of mechanical, electrical and electronics and engineering (EEE), and civil also participated in the project. “Students from electronics and communications department did the programming part and those from EEE took care of the connection of the electronic components. Civil and mechanical students did the building of the body part,” Naeema said. The languages used were C+ and Python. The whole computing power for the robot came from Raspberry Pi, a tiny, singleboard mini-computer originally developed in the UK for educational purposes in schools and used worldwide in fun projects, and also in serious, advanced projects. In fact, Raspberry Pi, booster, and battery were the only components Naeema and her team had sourced from outside for the project. “The rest, including the metal body parts, were made using scrap materials we found in the lab or workshop,” Naeema said. As a result, the whole Fuego 2.0 cost only less than Rs 10,000 to complete.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Stringent charge against woman who hit cop||MUMBAI: Ten months after a woman and her friend were booked and arrested for assaulting a traffic constable, a charge-sheet was submitted against them, invoking the stringent charge of using criminal force to prevent a public servant from performing his duty. Following an amendment, the charge under Indian Penal Code now attracts a maximum sentence of five years’ rigorous imprisonment, instead of two. Among witnesses cited by police were the people who had gathered at the spot at the time of the incident. The case was recently committed to the sessions court, where the trial will be conducted. Sagarika Tiwari (29) and Mohsin Khan (32) were arrested on October 23, 2020, for allegedly assaulting the constable in south Mumbai. Constable Eknath Porte, attached to Kalbadevi traffic division, was on duty at Surti Hotel junction in Kalbadevi when he stopped biker Shaikh and Tiwari was a pillion rider. Porte told Shaikh to pay a fine as he was not wearing a helmet, which led to an argument. A video of her beating the constable had gone viral on social media. The accused were also booked for charges relating to voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult with an intent to provoke breach of peace and criminal intimidation. The duo was granted bail by a magistrate’s court on October 26. Police moved the sessions court, seeking cancellation of bail. The court rejected the police plea in November. The sessions court had held that liberty of a person should not be dealt with lightly. “Denying bail or cancelling bail of an accused would amount to pretrial conviction,” the court had said. The court said bail can be cancelled only if circumstances such as tampering of evidence, threatening of witnesses, likeliness to abscond, exist. “It cannot be said that the magistrate has exercised discretion, arbitrary or illegally,” the sessions court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-stringent-charge-against-woman-who-hit-cop/articleshow/85056022.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kochi||Local body to profit from dry waste transportation||Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation is set to revamp the dry waste collection system and to make use of zone based weighing bridges to ascertain the quantity of waste being transported. The move follows a recent instance where bills related to waste collecting were put on hold after queries were raised regarding the quantity of waste being transported. Two weighing bridges in two zones will be used to monitor the quantity of dry waste being transported. After an interval of almost a year, the city corporation is set to rake in money from collection and transportation of around 11 types of dry waste. Pet bottles and hard plastic, two of the major components of non-biodegradable waste in the city will fetch the corporation Rs 15 and Rs 13 per kg respectively. Colour plastic, rubber and coconut shells are other items for which the corporation will receive money from the firm for transportation. The most commonly dumped plastic waste milk cover will earn corporation Rs 13 per kg while carry bags will be transported at Rs 7 per kg. Oil covers, white plastic covers and paper waste are other types of dry waste for which the corporation will now earn money for collection and transportation. In the process the corporation will have to shell out money for the collection and transportation of cloths, bags and chappals at rates ranging between Rs 5 to 8 per kg. Road waste will be transported at a cost of Rs 7.5 per kg. Unlike previous years, the city corporation received quotes from two firms for around 18 types of dry waste. The health wing negotiated with both the firms and approved rates were presented in the corporation council for approval here on Wednesday. Delay in clearance of bills coupled with pandemic related restrictions led to huge quantities of waste piling up in resource recovery centres. Even when the corporation set off pre-monsoon cleaning drive and mosquito eradication drive, piles of waste dumped in its own recovery centres became an eye sore and corporation officials were at a loss finding solutions for proper transportation. With two firms coming into play and another party exclusively for the collection of dry waste, zone based collection drives will resume in the city. The civic body had worked out a revenue model in the previous years for collection and transportation of dry waste. However, very often the corporation ends up spending more than earning in terms of organising collection drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/local-body-to-profit-from-dry-waste-transportation/articleshow/85050052.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Congress city president Ramu Tiwari had filed a complaint alleging that the contract worth Rs4 crore in 2016 for beautification and development of the garden was awarded to other contractor with increased cost of Rs6.53 crore in 2019. Tiwari claimed that in 2016, the Rs4 crore contract was awarded at 9.84% less cost. However, following complaints and subsequent inquiry, in which no substance was found, had led to cancellation of the contract. In 2019, the CMC awarded the same contract by increasing the cost by over Rs2.50 crore at Rs6.53 crore. The contractor M/s Vijay Ghate Engineer and Contractor, Chandrapur, had quoted 15% higher rate than the base price, he alleged. The CMC officials negotiated with the firm and finalized the contract at 9.84% higher rates, it is alleged in complaint. In-charge of EOW PI Pravinkumar Patil confirmed inquiry is being conducted into the alleged corruption. “We have started recording statement of the concerned. EOW will probe and if substance is found in the complaint, details will be shared with the municipal corporation so that its officials could proceed to file formal FIR,” he said. Tiwari claimed that he has given statement to the EOW. Other related people too are being summoned, he said. He exuded confidence that EOW will unearth the corruption and guilty will be punished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/eow-begins-probe-into-chanda-garden-contract/articleshow/85047903.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Meerut||Meerut: Two army jawans who snatched gold chains for ‘thrill’ traced & booked||MEERUT: Police in UP’s Meerut district have booked two army jawans, both friends, for allegedly snatching gold chains during their leave from duty. One of them, Akash Kumar, 25, posted in Jammu and Kashmir, has been arrested. While his friend, Ravinder -- who goes by his first name-- has joined duty in Nasik. Police have alerted his seniors seeking their help to arrest him. Akash, a rifleman in Rashtriya Rifles, is posted in Rajouri, J&K. Ravinder, a national player in 400metre sprint, is posted as gunner at the Artillery Centre, Nasik. Police have said that the accused may have carried out the crime just for its “thrill.” Additional superintendent of police (ASP) Suraj Rai said, “Their crime was captured on a CCTV camera. It seems they were doing it for thrill, and were completely unprepared for the task. Their faces were clearly visible and even the motorcycle’s registration number was also visible. There was "Army" written on the back of the motorcycle.” According to police, Akash and Ravinder had come to their native Sardhana town in Meerut on leaves a few days ago. It was then that they planned the snatching. Police have confirmed their involvement in two incidents of chain snatching. The first one took place in Surajkund area on July 11 when a 60-year-old woman’s chain was looted. The next one happened on July 24 in Sadar Bazaar area of the town. A same red colour motorcycle was used in both the crimes. “We traced both the accused from the registration number of the bike. We have arrested Akash but Ravinder has already joined duty in Nasik. We have written to the army authorities for coordination in his arrest,” the ASP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-army-jawans-who-snatched-gold-chains-for-thrill-traced-booked-in-ups-meerut/articleshow/85045497.cms||Sandeep Rai

The police identified the accused as Biju alias Moonga Biju, 45, and Biju alias Kadaman Biju, 40, residents of Paluvalli under Palode police station limits. According to the police, the dogs died after biting explosives planted by the accused to hunt wild boars. The police started the probe on Tuesday based on the information provided by residents of Kudavanad, who found the carcasses of the dogs in a rubber plantation here. Among the three dogs that were found dead, one was a pet dog and the other two were strays. All three dogs were found with their heads shattered apparently after biting the explosives. Palode station house officer Inspector C K Manoj said the rubber plantation where the accused planted explosives was located close to the forest next to a stream. The accused had prior knowledge that wild boars usually come to the spot to drink water, so they planted the explosives near the stream to hunt them. On Monday, a pet dog of a local resident died after biting the explosives planted by the accused. Following this, they tried to settle the issue by offering money to the dog’s owner. Though they also tried to remove the remaining explosives, they could not find them. Meanwhile, the local residents became furious after two strays also got killed the next day in a similar manner. So they alerted the police. One more person, identified as Santhosh Kumar of Vattappara, is also said to be involved in the crime. The police are searching for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/trap-meant-for-wild-boar-kills-3-dogs/articleshow/85050097.cms||---
---||Jaipur||NHAI to build 10 flyovers on Jaipur-Kishangarh stretch||Jaipur: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will undertake construction of 10 flyovers to unclog and provide safe passage between Jaipur-Kishangarh stretch. The authority has decided to construct flyovers on the route including Bhankrota, Heerapura, Narsinghpura, Mahlan, Mokhanpura and Padasoli as these points are considered as black-spots. Apart from this, the NHAI will construct flyovers at Bandarsindhri, Dhami Balaji, Gadota and Savarda to decongest the traffic on the stretch. An official at NHAI said, “The authority will spend approximately Rs 220 crore to construct 10 flyovers between Jaipur-Kishangarh stretch. Bids have been invited and work is expected to begin in November. While six flyovers will be constructed for rectification of the black spots, four will be constructed to provide smooth passage,” Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari announced on Tuesday that the Centre had approved a budget of Rs 619.48 crore for the construction of underpass, flyovers and bridge on the entire 6-lanes Gurgaon-Beawar national highway stretch.Many residents living in the catchment areas of Ajmer road will breathe a sigh of releif as demand to construct flyovers on many points was long pending.As city has expanded till Mahlan, the project is expected to solve the perennial traffic problem at various junctions on the route. The absence of a flyover on these points leaves the traffic in knots. An official at the Jaipur Development Authority said, “The project is long pending and it will resolve traffic issues once constructed. In traffic control board (TCB) meetings, the department has strongly urged the JDA to construct a flyover at Mahapura and Bhankrota crossroads several times.”In the past, frequent accidents and snarls near Bhankrota, Mahapura, Heerapura had raised concerns of the traffic department. “The JDA periphery ends at C-zone bypass. The problem over the years mounted due to faulty planning of NHAI. Finally, the authority’s move to construct a flyover over these stretches will benefit the residents of state capital as it passes through urban areas,” said a senior engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nhai-to-build-10-flyovers-on-jaipur-kishangarh-stretch/articleshow/85052636.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Parties set the ball rolling for byelection to two seats||Jaipur: Even before the bypoll dates being announced for two tribal reserved assembly segments — Vallabhgarh and Dhariawad — the main political parties — BJP, Congress and BTP — have become active on ground. Senior BJP leader Gulab Chand Kataria is batting on PM Narendra Modi’s social welfare schemes, while BTP is invoking the issue of tribal pride to garner support. Congress too is making inroads in the poll-bound assembly segments. The Vallabhgarh seat got vacant due to the death of Congress MLA Gajendra Singh Shaktawat in January this year, while Dhariawad got vacant due to the death of Gautam Lal Meena in May this year. The announcement for the bypolls is expected very soon. Kataria is leaving no stone unturned to maintain his influence in the region by having a major say in the polls. He has been meeting the probable candidates and openly expressing his reservation for the candidates he dislikes. Kataria is opposing the candidature of Randhir Singh Bhinder of the Janta Sena Party who stood second in the assembly polls in 2018 and was held responsible for the loss of BJP votes. “The party has appointed booth-level workers who are yet to give feedback to party leaders. It is clear that the election will be contested only on achievements of PM Modi and failures of Gehlot government,” said a party source. “BJP on Wednesday told Kataria in Jaipur to refrain from touching sensitive issues and statements fearing a backlash,” said a BJP leader requesting anonymity. Congress leaders did take rounds in the two assembly segments but have not created any buzz. The party will hold its first meet of coordination committees formed for both the assembly segments in Jaipur on Thursday. Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, who is party in-charge of Udaipur, said that Gehlot government’s performance will be their main poll agenda. Replying to a question on whether the party will give ticket to a family member of the deceased MLA, he said, “It is the party which will decide the candidate but Shaktawat’s wife and his son are seeking ticket from the party.” The party has formed two committees. Vallabhnagar seat has mines minister Pramod Jain Bhaya and cooperatives minister Uday Lal Anjana. In Dhariawad, there is tribal minister Arjun Bamania and youth and sports minister Ashok Chandna. BTP has taken an aggressive stand on separate statehood, increase in tribal quota and separate religious code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/parties-set-the-ball-rolling-for-byelection-to-two-seats/articleshow/85052663.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Robust infrastructure ready to tackle pandemic surge, says Uttar Pradesh health minister Jai Pratap Singh||LUCKNOW: The state government is working tirelessly to tackle the coronavirus pandemic ever since CM Yogi Adityanath decided to take the challenge head on in 2020, UP health minister Jai Pratap Singh said. “The infrastructure set up last year to combat the pandemic has been strengthened and diversified. As a result, we have a robust health system in place,” the minister said, speaking at a webinar organised by The Times of India under ‘Protect UP – My Jab, My Mask’ campaign. Talking about the third wave, he said: “Though a lot is not known about the third wave but sero-prevalence surveys show that 80% of the state’s population above 18 years has developed Covid-19 antibodies. However, we have the required infrastructure in place to handle the third wave. We have set up PICUs (paediatric intensive care units) in medical colleges, PHCs and CHCs and specialised training is being given to paediatricians,” the minister added. “Everyone including PM Narendra Modi and experts expressed concern over UP’s potential to handle the pandemic due to a frail health service network. CM Yogi Adityanath took up the challenge and today UP’s is a model other states want to emulate,” Singh said, adding that acknowledgement even came from Australia. Adding that the vaccination programme was launched with the same spirit, he said: “Over 12 lakh people are getting vaccinated in the state daily. Given the adequate supply, we can vaccinate over 20 lakh in a day finish the entire eligible population in 12-14 weeks.” Singh said surveillance is on in full swing in wake of the third wave. “Teams of health and medical department are visiting crowded places like mandis, weekly markets to carry out Covid tests on vendors, staff of courier companies and others. The exercise has helped in monitoring the spread of the pandemic in the state,” he stated. “Hospitals set up and upgraded for Covid-19 patients still exist and are being augmented. Inter-departmental coordination is key. Migrants who returned to their native places in UP were tested and given ration and monetary support,” Singh said. “At least 30 lakh medical kits have been distributed among those who had Covidlike symptoms. Another 35 lakh kits have been given to children below 12 years of age,” he said. Doubt our data, come verify, says health minister:Health minister JP Singh took pride in claiming that UP has become a story of change. “There were days when UP was synonymous with failures in health sector. But now, UP with a much bigger population is doing better than the states previously considered better,” he said. Singh admitted that doubts were being raised over the outcomes in UP but believed that they were a result of sheer disbelief. “Those who doubt our numbers can come and verify them. Every single test and vaccine given has a name and face,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/robust-infra-in-place-to-tackle-third-wave-of-pandemic-health-minister/articleshow/85054631.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was dealing with a PIL filed by G Vidyasagar, a retired principal from Yellareddy Government Degree College, Nizamabad, challenging their appointments as vice-chancellors. The state adopted the UGC guidelines that guide the state while making such appointments, but the state chose to ignore them, senior counsel S Satyam Reddy said. “The upper age limit is 70, but one of the VCs is above 70,” he said, pointing towards the violations.

The HC said the survey details should be handed over to sub-registrars and higher authorities in the registration department to ensure that government land is not illegally registered by private parties. The court directive came during a hearing of a PIL by a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy. The PIL by Chittapuram Raju of Pragnapur in Medak district accused revenue officials of not taking any action despite complaints about a private person illegally possessing government and assigned land given to the poor. The bench expanded the scope of the petition and directed collectors of all 33 districts in the state to study such instances. “Better survey the whole area in your district and identify government land parcels. Maintain a register of such properties,” the bench said while telling the collectors to geo-tag each such identified government property. “The sub-registrars are directed not to register any sale deed in respect of such government land at the instance of any private party. If in doubt, necessary clarifications shall be sought from the office of the district collector before taking steps to register the sale deeds,” the bench said. The high court sought affidavits from collectors within two months and warned of serious consequences if the court’s orders were not fully implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/survey-all-govt-land-to-save-it-from-land-sharks-hc-to-t/articleshow/85054615.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Booking via multiple mobile numbers leading to extra vax shots, glitches in certificates||Nagpur: Recently, a woman took her Covaxin shot at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), assuming it was her second dose of Covid vaccination. On getting an alert for her second dose of Covaxin, she informed GMCH staff that she had taken her first dose of Covishield in another city over four months ago. Upon further questioning, the GMCH immunization team found out that the woman had registered with another mobile number at the previous vaccination centre for Covishield.In another case, a businessman from East Nagpur created ruckus at a big private hospital this week after he was unable to download his fully vaccinated certificate. The man wanted to travel to Mumbai for an event and needed the certificate for entry. Later, it came to light that the man had done offline registration with another mobile number at the hospital but was trying to download his certificate using his alternate number.Vaccination centres are now seeing multiple such problems of irate beneficiaries who used two mobile numbers or got registered using someone else’s phone and don’t remember it later.GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said if the beneficiary had given same number, they would have come to know which vaccine was taken and when. “When the nurse explained to her that she needs to come after a month for second dose, the beneficiary revealed this was her second dose,” he said, adding she won’t be given another dose.NMC officials said as different IDs are used, mobile number is the easiest option to track vaccination history. “It is needed for any future reference, OTP, or correction. On one number, up to four registrations are allowed. With ID, only vaccination centres can track history. As per our experience, people tend to give wrong numbers, or one not in use. They assume we would harass them by repeatedly calling,” they said. “To confirm vaccination, mobile number or reference ID is crucial. So citizens should be aware of the registered mobile number. Many a time children staying outstation register their parents and when asked for mobile number, these parents innocently give their personal number, leading to unnecessary confusion for vaccinators and tension for senior citizens,” said Prashant Tichkule, nodal officer (Vaccination), Orange City Hospital and Research Institute.Tichkule added, “Cowin is a robust software and is regularly undergoing dynamic developments in back end. However, a few glitches are noticed, like it has to be refreshed repeatedly. Moreover, many a times even after delivering second dose, provisional certificate gets printed. This glitch requires refreshing again for rectification.” Aejaz Shami, AGM, marketing and communication’s, Kingsway Hospitals, said they have now dedicated a helpline through their call centre to address such issues. “Beneficiaries often complain they are unable to retrieve their vaccination certificate. Some even land up at the eleventh hour of their flight or train seeking certificate. Generally, we issue a print out soon after the jab but some either don’t bother to take them or are in a rush. The helpline is now sending certificates online on WhatsApp or email,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/booking-via-multiple-mobile-numbers-leading-to-extra-vax-shots-glitches-in-certificates/articleshow/85047911.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

After the formation of Telangana state, many weavers returned to their home state following initiatives for weavers announced by the newly-elected government. These families established Kakatiya Weavers Cooperative Society and urged the government to allot land to set up power looms. After a long wait, which lasted more than five years, the Kakatiya Weavers Cooperative Society has 364 power loom units spread over 60 acres in Madikonda village of Warangal Urban district. The power loom textile park provides employment to around 5,000 people directly and 4,000 indirectly, in the units. Of the 364 weavers, 160 started loom work. The weavers made Batukamma sarees in 40 loom units. The remaining units were usually employed for work in the private sector. According to weavers’ association president Durga Seamy, the state government has ordered 12,50,000 meters of Batukamma sarees, which have to be delivered by October 2021. All the loom units have shared the work for this order equally, and are producing 1000 meters every day. “After finishing and a final check, we will hand the sarees over to the government soon,” the association president said. D Ravinder , who returned from Surat, expressed his happiness over getting frequent orders. Speaking to TOI, he said that he is happy to work in his motherland: “We did not get to meet ourr family that much when we lived in Surat. However, now, the Telangana state government has provided me with everything. Now, I am not a worker, but an owner of a power loom unit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/364-families-weave-a-comeback-in-warangal/articleshow/85054633.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

Three others, who got washed away in Bhavani river at Rawatbhatta in Chittorgarh district following incessant rains, were rescued by the civil defence team. The state government said that heavy rains had created a flood like situation in some areas of Kota, Baran, Bundi and Jhalawar and Dholpur districts. Teams of NDRF, SDRF and civil defence were conducting rescue operations. The Army and Air Force have been put on alert. An SDRF report said in the last 86 hours ending Wednesday noon, 243 people were rescued and 81 bodies of the dead recovered in rain-related incidents.

Their performance percentage is less than 20% in terms of delinking one Aadhaar number with multiple ration cards, data received from the food and civil services department said. Among the districts that have performed badly are Jhalawar (2.17%), Sawai Madhopur (4.28%), Jalore (4.60%), Barmer (5.82%), Alwar (6.70%), Sirohi (7.05%), Rajsamand (8.85%), Bhilwara (9.59%), Hanumangarh (10.68%), Baran (13.62%), Bundi (17.18%) and Karauli (19.34%). However, 10 districts have shown performance of over 70 per cent in delinking an Aadhaar number seeded with multiple ration cards. These districts are Bikaner (99.84%), Bharatpur (99.75%), Banswara (99.51%), Pali (99.12%), Ajmer (98.07%), Udaipur (88.43%), Tonk (84.54%), Naguar (88.29%), Kota (76.87%) and Pratapgarh (74.44%). As on July 28, there were 1.14 lakh such Aadhaar numbers and the number of units in which the same Aadhaar was seeded were 2.14 lakh. “Linking one Aadhaar number with multiple ration cards is a wrong practice. We had identified these Aadhar cards and gave the data to the districts. They were directed to delink multiple seeding of an Aadhaar number. Some districts have performed badly in the process of removal/delinking and have been directed to expedite the process.

---||Ajmer||Delinking of Aadhaar-ration cards: 12 districts fare poorly||JAIPUR: In all, 12 districts have performed poorly in terms of de-linking of Aadhaar number seeded with multiple ration cards of National Food Security Act (NFSA) beneficiaries in the state. Their performance percentage is less than 20% in terms of delinking one Aadhaar number with multiple ration cards, data received from the food and civil services department said. Among the districts that have performed badly are Jhalawar (2.17%), Sawai Madhopur (4.28%), Jalore (4.60%), Barmer (5.82%), Alwar (6.70%), Sirohi (7.05%), Rajsamand (8.85%), Bhilwara (9.59%), Hanumangarh (10.68%), Baran (13.62%), Bundi (17.18%) and Karauli (19.34%). However, 10 districts have shown performance of over 70 per cent in delinking an Aadhaar number seeded with multiple ration cards. These districts are Bikaner (99.84%), Bharatpur (99.75%), Banswara (99.51%), Pali (99.12%), Ajmer (98.07%), Udaipur (88.43%), Tonk (84.54%), Naguar (88.29%), Kota (76.87%) and Pratapgarh (74.44%). As on July 28, there were 1.14 lakh such Aadhaar numbers and the number of units in which the same Aadhaar was seeded were 2.14 lakh. “Linking one Aadhaar number with multiple ration cards is a wrong practice. We had identified these Aadhar cards and gave the data to the districts. They were directed to delink multiple seeding of an Aadhaar number. Some districts have performed badly in the process of removal/delinking and have been directed to expedite the process. A chief secretary level meeting was held to review the status in all the districts,” said additional food commissioner Anil Kumar Agarwal. Meanwhile, the second phase of mapping and seeding of the members of National Food Security Act (NFSA) ration card holder families will be conducted in the state up to August 31.

Kelkar alleged that the complainant in the molestation case, a journalist with a local paper and a freelance journalist ‘defamed’ him by posting his photographs with two women on social media and accused him of sexual harassment. They demanded Rs 5 lakh to ‘settle’ the matter of which Rs 3 lakh was accepted by the journalist at Kelkar’s office. Kelkar claimed that since he failed to pay the balance, they lodged the molestation complaint. But the freelancer said, “It is a false case.

---||Allahabad||Needed, specific law to deal with cases of 'sex on false promise of marriage': HC||Prayagraj: Observing that it is necessary for the legislature to provide a clear and specific legal framework to deal with the cases where the accused obtains consent for sexual intercourse on the false promise of marriage, the Allahabad high court on Tuesday observed, “This feudal mindset and male chauvinism that women are nothing but an object of enjoyment is required to be rigorously addressed and strictly dealt with in order to create a healthier society and to increase a sense of security and protection in the mind of women”. While making these observation Justice Pradeep Kumar Srivastava dismissed the criminal appeal filed by one Harshvardhan Yadav of Kanpur, seeking bail in an alleged case of rape. The appellant is accused of forcefully making sexual relations with a woman on the false promise of marrying with her. The court also opined that making a false promise of marriage with the mala fide intention to deceive the victim was becoming a phenomenon and that it was widely believed by the accused persons that they will escape from the criminal liability and punishment in such cases. “For the major women population in our society, promise of marriage is a great allurement and they are trapped in a situation which results in their sexual abuse and exploitation," the court further added. In addition to it, the court opined that till such a law is enacted, the court should take into consideration the social reality and reality of human life and continue giving protection to such women who have suffered on account of the false promise of marriage.  The applicant accused – Harshvardhan Yadav -- currently in jail, filed a criminal appeal against rejection of his bail application by the lower court in a case registered under Section 376 (rape) IPC and Section 3(2)5 of SC/ST Act. The victim woman is a police constable and belongs to scheduled caste. She was called by the accused in a hotel to finalize their marriage and prepare documents related to it, however, in the hotel room he allegedly raped her, according to her counsel.Thereafter, on the same day, she lodged an FIR and supported the FIR version both in her statements given to the investigation officer (IO) under Section 161 and to the magistrate under Section 164 criminal procedure code (CrPC). The court noted that the case pertained to a single act of sexual intercourse and the FIR has been lodged on the same day. The court noted that the delay of 17 hours in lodging the FIR was insignificant as it opined that this much of time was natural to take a decision to lodge FIR against a person with whom she was planning to marry.  The court observed that the victim was in love and there was a family hurdle in their marriage as mentioned by the accused, and therefore, the court found it natural that she went to the hotel as the appellant wanted her to come for a talk for preparation of documents for court marriage. Significantly, while rejecting the bail application, the court observed that the accused never actually wanted to marry the victim and had mala fide motives, and had made a false promise to marry only to satisfy his lust, and this, the court added, certainly falls within the ambit of cheating and playing deception to obtain consent for sex.  “Needless to mention that false marriage promise is and always, in the major part of our society, has been an effective tool of mischievous males for creating emotional pressure on a woman for doing sex,” the court further added. Further, while dismissing his appeal seeking bail, the court concluded, saying, “Obtaining consent for sexual relationship by false promise of marriage should be termed as consent given under misconception of fact and must amount to rape. The court cannot become a silent spectator and give licence to those who are trying to exploit the innocent girls and have sexual intercourse with them on the pretext of a false promise of marriage."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/needed-specific-law-to-deal-with-cases-of-sex-on-false-promise-of-marriage-hc/articleshow/85053617.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

---||Nagpur||MAPL board was not in place when machinery went missing from plant||Nagpur: Information obtained under the Right to Information (RTI) Act has revealed that Maharashtra Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Limited (MAPL), Nagpur, had a properly constituted board of directors (BoD) right from its inception in 1979 till date, except for a short time when heavy machinery costing crores was stolen from the plant. MAPL’s parent company — Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (HAL), Pune, has refused to give more detailed information under RTI. In reply to TOI earlier, HAL had informed that machinery was stolen from the plant at MIDC Hingna in April 2016. In the complaint lodged at MIDC police station a few days ago, HAL had said the cost of stolen machinery and other equipment was Rs76 lakh. TOI had reported the machinery was intact when production of medicines was stopped at the plant in 2003, and also during an inspection in 2015 by Union minister Nitin Gadkari, the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, and the then Union minister of state for chemicals and fertilizers Hansraj Ahir. Activist of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Pratap Goswami had sought information about the BoD of MAPL from HAL on May 7. In reply, HAL stated, “No board was reconstituted from the year of 2014-15 to 2016-17. The last annual general meeting of MAPL was on February 3, 2012, and as per articles of association of MAPL the board stood dissolved on that date,” the HAL informed. The HAL gave names of directors in the board from beginning till date. For 2020-21, managing director of HAL Nirja Saraf is also managing director of MAPL. Deputy secretary of ministry of chemicals and fertilizers, and deputy general manager of HAL are directors. Former nominee director Sudhir Paliwal told TOI, “Theft of heavy machinery is itself a mystery. Now, lack of BoD during the theft period is highly suspicious. Why BoD did not exist for two years when the theft happened, and is in existence thereafter,” he questioned. Paliwal said, “HAL owned 59% of MAPL while 33% shares were with SICOM and 8% with IDBI. It is mandatory as per norms to reconstitute board every year. Directors need to be taken from all three share holding companies. It is clear from the information obtained under RTI Act that board was not constituted for two years. Government should fix responsibility and initiate action.” Goswami said a detailed inquiry is needed into the case, as to who did all this and who benefited by closing down MAPL. “It was Vidarbha’s only government-run medicine manufacturing company. The plant would have come to the rescue of the region if it had machinery during Covid-19 pandemic and future,” he said. Goswami had also asked for annual reports of MAPL of last 10 years, minutes of last 10 annual general meeting, minutes of last 10 BoD meetings, copy of audited financial statement of last 10 years, and list of charges registered in the name of the company. HAL in reply dated July 10, 2021, said, “The information sought by you is of such nature which will not serve any public purpose nor related to any public activity or interest. The indiscriminate demands or directions is impractical for an oblique motive and not for public interest. Moreover, the information is confidential and in the interest of the organization and its disclosure may affect the litigation filed against the company, leaving space for influencing the concerned wherein safety and security of the company’s interest is involved.” The central government had closed down MAPL’s plant in 2003 and taken a decision to hive it off but continued Karnataka Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Limited (KAPL) which was established along with MAPL. Earlier, MAPL and KAPL were under HAL, and now KAPL is a separate public sector undertaking company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mapl-board-was-not-in-place-when-machinery-went-missing-from-plant/articleshow/85047962.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Fishermen block road to protest police inaction||Thiruvananthapuram: Tense situation prevailed on Wednesday after fishermen staged a road blockade on Perumathura Bridge, accusing police of laxity in taking legal measures in the accident in which one of their boats was completely destroyed. The blockade continued for over six hours following which vehicular traffic along the coastal road was disrupted. On Tuesday, a boat carrying 22 fishermen was completely destroyed after another boat rammed it from behind at Muthalapozhi breakwater region here. The boat that caused the accident belonged to fishermen from the Thazhamballi region here. Shakkir, the owner of the boat that was destroyed, said he suffered a loss of around Rs 32 lakh in the accident. This involves the cost of the boat, the net and medical expenses for the injured fishermen. Despite lodging a complaint, the Anchuthengu coastal police did not register a case, which infuriated the fishermen. The fishermen called off the protest after senior officials, including Attingal DSP Suneesh Babu and Varkala DSP Babukuttan, held talks with the protesters along with Chirayinkeezhu panchayat president and tahsildar and promised them to levy compensation from the owner of the boat that caused the accident, Anchuthengu coastal police station inspector K Kannan said. “Without the police taking legal measures we cannot approach authorised forums for compensation,” Shakkir said. As many as 16 men on board sustained injuries, including one with serious wounds. One of the injured Nahas underwent surgery at Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College hospital on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fishermen-block-road-to-protest-police-inaction/articleshow/85050143.cms||---

The accused were sending drugs from Hyderabad and Bangalore to Australia through private courier agencies by concealing the contraband in different items. On Monday, NCB team kept a watch on the movement of suspects trying to send narcotic substances to Australia at a courier agency at Akbar Bagh area near Chanchalguda. NCB intercepted two suspects, A Tahir and R Meeran, when they arrived with six rolls of lace and other embroidery items to send them to Australia. NCB team opened the fibre drums around which lace were carefully rolled and found plastic pouches containing one kilo crystalline white powder. When the powder was extracted and tested, results confirmed that it was pseudoephedrine, a controlled substance under the NDPS Act. Pseudoephedrine is used as a precursor to manufacturing methamphetamine. During interrogation, the duo confessed to smuggling pseudoephedrine to Australia and NCB arrested them on Tuesday. NCB sleuths revealed that they zeroed in on the accused after a seizure of 2.5 kilos of amphetamine concealed in gym equipment to be shipped to Australia at a courier agency office in Bangalore on July 6, 2021. NCB sleuths identified one of the suspects after the seizure and kept a watch on the movements of the gang. Subsequently, NCB obtained information that the two accused had shipped a consignment of 1.4 kilos of pseudoephedrine to Australia from Hyderabad by concealing them in kitchen appliances and alerted the Australian counterparts. “The consignment was seized in Australia by the local agencies,” said an NCB official. In April 2021, NCB had seized five kilos of pseudoephedrine from a courier agency office in Lakdi-ka-pul and arrested two peddlers in Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ncb-busts-drug-smuggling-to-oz-via-courier-arrests-two/articleshow/85054698.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Mumbai||Bandra-Kurla Complex, Mulund, Dahisar jumbo centres to reopen||MUMBAI: Three jumbo Covid-19 centres at Bandra-Kurla Complex, Mulund and Dahisar have been asked to begin preparations to resume operations in a phased manner from mid-August. The BMC has been incurring a cost of Rs 2-5 crore for the upkeep of these centres that were shut in May for repair and upgrade. A decision has been taken to operationalise at least 20-25% of the beds in these centres in the coming weeks. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani confirmed that the three jumbos would start operating soon and will take in a few hundred patients each. “The idea is to keep the centres functional in the event of a surge in cases,” he said, adding it is better to have a running system and not having to jump start. The centres won’t run to capacity at the beginning as that would mean hiring a full set of staff. There are barely 100 admissions now from the average 300-odd new detections daily. A civic official said with the relaxations given since August 3, there is a possibility cases could see a marginal increase after 10-12 days. Currently, three jumbo centres — Richardson and Cruddas in Byculla, Nesco in Goregaon and NSCI in Worli — are operational and handle all mild and moderate admissions. SevenHills hospital in Marol is catering to moderate and critical cases. In preparation for the third wave, four new field hospitals are coming up in Malad, the Somaiya grounds in Sion, the racecourse in Mahalaxmi and in Kanjurmarg. In all, the BMC plans to create nearly 20,000 jumbo centre beds. Jumbo Covid centres, which are makeshift field hospitals, were built in 2020 after the pandemic hit. Since then, over 70,000 patients have been treated at these hospitals that are run mainly by contractual staff but are overseen by deans appointed from the civic medical colleges. Kakani said the jumbo centres will play a much bigger role in the future Covid surges the city may experience since medical colleges, including Sion, KEM, BYL Nair and Cooper, will focus on non-Covid ailments. Officials at the Dahisar centre said in the last three months, oxygen lines were upgraded, a new high-dependency unit was commissioned, and the existing structures were strengthened. “We have been asked to be in a state of preparedness since cases could go up. We could start with 50 beds and gradually open all,” said dean Dr Deepa Shriyan. The corporation spends a baseline price of Rs 4 crore to maintain the seven German hangers, the structures that house the wards. The facility has nearly 760 beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bkc-mulund-dahisar-jumbo-centres-to-reopen/articleshow/85052766.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The BJP flung a volley of queries at the ruling council for clarification.The opposition councillors said the actual number of vehicles owned by the city corporation in the administration report was at variance with the document on vehicle assets received through RTI. “The mismatch has reinforced our allegation that the officials did not make use of corporation vehicles and hired private vehicles to swindle money as part of waste management after Attukal pongala,” BJP councillor Anil Kumar said. He also said even the data presented by the works standing committee chairman D R Anil showed disparity with what was stated in the administration report.Nedumcaud councillor Karamana Ajith, who had first broached the issue of missing vehicles of the corporation, said the mismatch in numbers clearly indicates that vehicles have gone missing. “According to data recently presented in the council, there are 225 vehicles owned by the corporation. However, the administration report shows there are only 137 vehicles. There was nothing to prove that the corporation had purchased 88 vehicles between 2019 and 2021. As per the RTI data, there are 41 heavy vehicles and two mini trucks, but the administration report shows 51 vehicles, this means eight vehicles are missing. There are similar incongruities regarding jeeps, road rollers, sky lift and earth movers,” he said.Ajith said while the corporation maintains it has no road roller; the RTI data shows the corporation has a road roller. UDF councillors said the three member committee set up to look into the matter was a farce. “I am a member of the committee and I came to know about it only from the media. I was never informed about the working model of the committee,” said UDF councillor Padmakumar.Meanwhile, Mayor Arya Rajendran said a search committee would be constituted to look into the matter of missing vehicles. “If the committee reports that the vehicles are missing, we will file a case,” she said.Another BJP councillor, P Ashok Kumar alleged that the annual financial statement of the corporation was ridden with errors. There were discrepancies in demand, arrears over various fiscals related to tax and license fee. “Such a report shall not be forwarded to the government, it is humiliating,” he said. While, the Mayor said corrections shall be made in the statement and will be forwarded later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/debate-in-council-over-finance-statement/articleshow/85050213.cms||---

It is never the children who pass on the infection to the adult, it is always the other way round.” He stressed that children are definitely at the receiving end of the pandemic but that is because routine immunization is affected, school is being missed and pressure is on mental health. There is no need to panic for parents, he said. “Infection is not severe in children and they are mostly asymptomatic.” he added. Besides Covid-appropriate behaviour, there is a need to tell people that ensuring proper ventilation is equally important. “One of the foremost things that we need to tell people is that vaccination reduces the risk of infection manifold. A person who has been vaccinated may get the infection but it would not be severe,” said Prof Rajesh Ranjan from IITKanpur. Prof Ranjan’s team at IIT-K, which had done research to predict the second wave, said, “We should not say that the third wave will not come. The US, UK, Japan, and Russia have had many peaks so far. This virus is weird.” On suggestions to tackle the third wave, he said that people aged 18 to 59 years are more at risk and need to be vaccinated. “Our research showed that 40% among those above 60 years of age had developed herd immunity while those aged 18 to 59 had 25% herd immunity,” he said. Besides, the state should also focus on vulnerable regions. “If we assume that at least 30% have developed immunity by now in the state, the third wave could be predicted around October,” said the professor, adding that the government should restrict the movement of people as soon as the increase in the number of cases is noticed so that spread of the virus could be checked on time. Dr Praful Bharadwaj, health officer, Unicef India, said, “Getting both doses of vaccine is important. The second dose coverage will be the deciding factor. It is still less in UP though it has picked up now. All vaccines that we have are effective against all the variants.” Among the government’s steps to increase vaccination is the cluster approach, which has also been adopted by other states. Dr Devashish Das Gupta, faculty at IIM Lucknow and public policy analyst, said that besides physical health, there is a need to improve mental health of people through positivity, empathy and discipline. “We need to develop human values,” he said. He added that there is a need to make private hospitals accountable so that they do not fleece patients. Systemic stress has to be reduced for health workers and government officers, even students and other professionals who are working from home and have lost work-life balance need care and support. “People should be encouraged to take care of themselves. There is a need to schedule relaxation and leisure time,” said Das Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-biological-reason-that-third-wave-will-affect-children-experts/articleshow/85054688.cms||Neha Shukla

The roadways employees will protest between 1pm to 2pm and similar protests will be staged at regular intervals in the coming months.Nearly 20,000 employees and pensioners have been getting delayed dues for over three years and are yet to get their salaries for the months of June-July. The employees claimed that they have received assurances but the delays have become a permanent fixture.M L Yadav, president, Rajasthan state roadways employees union told TOI, “The roadways department gets a financial grant from the state government using which we are given our salaries which gets delayed inevitably. Some sort of solution needs to be found because all of us are dependent on our salaries and pensions to run households. We have planned for various forms of protests till October and will follow Covid protocol.” He further added that delay of at least a fortnight has become a regular occurrence for the past few years and the government needs to find a permanent solution as the department has no money of its own.The employees union will wear black ribbons during working hours for two days on August 12 and 13 followed by one hour demonstration in all units in the afternoon for two days on August 17 and 18. Apart from this, there will be a mass demonstration by all units of Jaipur at Sindhi Camp Bus Stand from one to two in the afternoon.

Azam’s advocate requested the court that his client was infected with Covid-19 and was still under treatment.But the district government counsel opposed the bail claiming that Azam was the main beneficiary of the enemy land fraud and could impact the case after getting bail.Azam, his wife and local MLA Tazeen Fatma and their son Abdullah Azam were booked in a case of allegedly forging documents to capture land falling under the Enemy Property Act. The FIR was registered at Civil Lines police station against the three in August 2019 under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal and section 3 of the Public Property Act, 1984. Advocate Arun Kumar Saxena, district government counsel, said, “13 hectare of enemy property was encroached by the Jauhar University and its ownership was fraudulently changed by Azam in the name of his close aide using his political influence. All the documents submitted were found to be fabricated and a charge-sheet has already been submitted by the police. It was highly likely that Khan would have used his political influence to impact the proceedings of the case so we opposed the bail plea and honourable justice Alok Dubey has rejected the bail plea.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/special-mp/mla-court-denies-bail-to-azam-in-enemy-property-case/articleshow/85048000.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nagpur||Dog-lover vagabond gets hospital bed after activist alerts cops||Nagpur: Animal lover Sandesh Patil, who lived on the footpath, got a fresh lease of life after activists alerted cops about his deteriorating health last week. He got help just in time, and was admitted at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH). Patil, a graduate from Pune in his 40s, has been living as a vagabond near Vaishnodevi Chowk with three dogs, which had attracted the sympathy of animal lovers and activists, who extended assistance to him. Having left Pune after his parents’ death, Patil is learnt to be the owner of a house at his native place, which was allegedly usurped by someone. Depressed and dejected, Patil had somehow landed up in the city several years back and started staying on the footpath. His life depended on the generosity of passers-by and some Good Samaritans. Amid his poverty, Patil had decided to adopt a puppy initially and then two more. Impressed by his love for the dogs even in his makeshift abode on the footpath, the tricycle-bound Patil started getting food and other materials from other animal lovers in the vicinity. It’s learnt animal lover Karishma Galani was alerted about Patil by activist Yogesh Purohit and his kin Kajal Purohit. Patil, who lived by begging on the road, was suffering from filaria in his right leg. The Purohit family, which used to help Patil and his puppies with food, had noticed his failing health and approached Galani for help. Galani sought the help of Zonal DCP Lohit Matani, who immediately deputed two policemen to shift Patil to IGGMCH. Matani said the ambulance driver summoned to shift Patil to hospital had been reluctant until there was a police case registered in the case. “I had to intervene to ensure the ailing man was shifted to hospital, or else he would have died on the road. There are many beggars and vagabonds who die without being attended and assisted, which authorities must not ignore,” he said. Galani said Patil deserved help as he had adopted three street dogs despite his condition and shared his food with them with love and care. “The DCP is also keen to rehabilitate Patil, who seems to be an educated person,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dog-lover-vagabond-gets-hospital-bed-after-activist-alerts-cops/articleshow/85047991.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Delhi||Judiciary can’t step into jurisdiction of police: Delhi court||NEW DELHI: Courts are barred from usurping the jurisdiction of police since the two organs of the state operate into specific spheres of activities and one ought not to tread over the other sphere, a city court has said while setting aside an order which had sought reply of the commissioner of Delhi Police on why a case of alleged cheating was lodged at Crime Branch instead of the concerned police station, while disregarding the provisions of the law. A magistrate court had earlier directed the top cop to file the list of all representations made in the last one year to Crime Branch regarding various offences and the details of the cases in which FIR was registered and in which it was not. It had also directed that the order be sent to ministry of home affairs for necessary information, so that the “prima facie arbitrary” exercise of the discretion of the special commissioner of police can be looked into. Police had moved the sessions court against the order. Calling the magistrate court’s order “perverse” and “unreasonable”, additional sessions judge Prashant Sharma said extraordinary and inherent powers of the court do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whims or caprices. The court said that the order was a “reflection of judicial discretion being exercised in an arbitrary and perverse manner”. The judge further said that the court was not expected to traverse in the jurisdiction of police, unless absence of such intervention would result in miscarriage of justice, but in the present case the magistrate court had failed to highlight as to what miscarriage of justice would have resulted if the order was not passed. “Courts are not supposed to thwart any investigation into cognisable offences. Criminal proceedings ought not to be scuttled at initial stage. Further ordinarily, courts are barred from usurping the jurisdiction of the police since the two organs of the state operate into specific spheres of activities and one ought not to tread over the other sphere. The functions of the judiciary and police are complementary not overlapping,” the court said in its order. It added, “Same in exceptional cases where non-interference would result in miscarriage of justice, the court and the judicial process should not interfere at the stage of investigation of offences… it is clear that jurisdictions of the court of metropolitan magistrate and police have to be construed as separate.” It noted that that previous observations, that there was disregard of the provisions of CrPC and arbitrary exercise of discretion by the commissioner in registration of the FIR, can decide the fate of the FIR in question and therefore, have the effect of terminating the main proceedings of the case once for all and can decide the case finally. It said that the magistrate court had concluded arbitrary exercise of discretion by the special commissioner without giving him an opportunity of hearing. Additional public prosecutor, appearing for police, had submitted that complainant Ranjan Oberoi had directly approached the office of special commissioner of police, Crime Branch and filed his complaint, which formed the basis of the FIR in question. He further said that the complainant had made the complaint addressing special commissioner, police, headquarters, ITO, which was made over to ACP, STF, Crime Branch, for necessary action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-judiciary-cant-step-into-jurisdiction-of-police/articleshow/85052873.cms||Usha Das
---||Kochi||Kerala: Lookout notice in Karuvannur Cooperative Bank fraud case||THRISSUR: Crime branch team probing the scam in Karuvannur Cooperative Bank has initiated steps to issue lookout notices against six accused in the case. According to the crime branch sources the requests for issuing the lookout notices have been submitted to emigration authorities so that the accused can be prevented from going abroad. There are reports that one of the accused has already gone abroad. The crime branch team has started collecting the details of the assets of the accused in the fraud. According to preliminary estimates the bank has incurred a loss of over Rs 100 crore in the scam. Authorities said the properties of the accused would be auctioned to recover part of the lost amount. Three of the accused have filed their anticipatory bail applications at the principal district and sessions court. M Biju Kareem, the bank manager and C K Jilse, the accountant, and Reji Anilkumar, an employee at a supermarket run by the bank, had filed their bail applications soon after the fraud was exposed last month. The bail application came up for hearing on July 21 and the prosecution has been asked to file its response. The petition is likely to come up for hearing on August 6. The probe team has been facing criticisms from Congress and BJP over the delay in the arrest of the accused. They have been alleging that the probe team has been trying to protect the fraudsters because of their links with CPM. The investigators have refuted the allegations, saying that they have been making all efforts to book the accused. Can cops be faulted for pursuing accused: CourtThe high court on Wednesday asked whether police can be faulted for pursuing the accused in the bank fraud case. Justice K Haripal made the statement while considering an anticipatory bail plea filed by TR Sunil Kumar, secretary of Karuvannur bank and the first accused in the case. He had contended that he did not have a significant role in allowing loans and that his custodial interrogation is not required. During the hearing, the applicant’s counsel submitted that the pre-arrest bail plea should be heard as early as possible as the applicant has been made an accused and police have following him around. The court asked how can the police be faulted for following an accused. The applicant had contended that he was removed from the loan-sanctioning section on December 5, 2019 after department of cooperation began an enquiry into some alleged irregularities at the bank. As the secretary, he has very limited role in sanctioning loans and it is the governing body that considers the applications and sanction loans, the petition said. It is due to the lapses on the part of the governing body that a probe was required and the banks employees have no part in it, the applicant said. The court will hear the case in detail on August 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lookout-notice-in-bank-fraud-case/articleshow/85050366.cms||---

As per the official itinerary, Koshyari is scheduled to hold a review meeting with the district administration of Nanded between around 3 pm and 5 pm on Thursday, followed by similar such review meetings with Hinogli district administration for two hours till 1 pm on Friday and later with Parbhani district administration from 4 pm to 6 pm on the same day. The governor, during his three-day tour, is scheduled to attend a host of other formal events, including the inauguration of hostels for minority students at Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, Nanded, visits to different facilities at Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, Parbhani, and interaction with students of the agricultural university, among others. Nanded, Parbhani and Hingoli district administrations have confirmed that the governor is paying visit and there was no cancellation of his tour till Wednesday evening. Maharashtra cabinet minister Nawab Malik, who is also the guardian minister for Parbhani, has accused the governor of encroaching upon the rights of the legislature by holding such review meetings. “The Maharashtra governor is deliberately creating two power centres in the state,” he said. On the other hand, BJP has hailed the proposed tour in question saying that Koshyari was setting new precedent in public interest in the light of powers bestowed upon him by the constitution. “We do not know why MVA government is so much afraid of review meetings to be chaired by the governor. Such meetings would be fruitful for citizens only and the outcome of it would be shared by the state government at the end,” BJP spokesperson Ram Kulkarni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/despite-opposition-from-mva-govt-guv-to-visit-marathwada/articleshow/85045769.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Six months after Act, skill development varsity stuck in red-tape||MUMBAI: Six months after enactment of the Maharashtra State Skills University Act, the skill development department is yet to set up the university due to red-tapism and lack of political will, while a private organization, granted permission on July 16, 2021, was set up on Wednesday. Skill development minister Nawab Malik admitted a delay but said efforts will be made to ensure the new university is set up within a time-bound period. “We working on a war-footing to set up the university in Mumbai as early as possible. We will ensure the search committee for appointment of a vice-chancellor and registrar holds its first meeting as early as possible and submit its report to the department. A time-bound action plan has been drafted,’’ Malik told TOI. After both houses of the state legislature passed a bill, the act for setting up the Maharashtra State Skills University came into existence on April 14. Subsequently, a six-member search committee headed by skill development principal secretary Manish Varma was set up, an advertisement inviting applications for the post of VC and registrar were invited on May 14, while the last date was May 24. A record 60 persons, including additional chief secretary Sujata Saunik, former vice-chancellor Devanand Shinde, principal Nilesh Patil and Jalna ITI principal Bharat Jinturkar were among the applicants, while for registrar’s post, joint secretary Suvarna Kharat and Nashik engineering collector professor G D Mohod were among the 45 applicants. While the deadline for submission of applications ended on May 24, the search committee is yet to shortlist nominees for VC and registrar’s post. “My attention has been drawn to the prolonged delay in appointment of VC and registrar. I will seek information from the department, we will complete the entire exercise in a time-bound period. Our effort will be to start operations of the university as early as possible,’’ Malik said. He said the government’s aim was to create skilled and employable youth, to encourage job creation and to promote delivery of quality skills education, startups, incubation, employability, training, in an integrated manner with industry partnership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-6-months-after-act-skill-devpt-varsity-stuck-in-red-tape/articleshow/85056059.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai gets its first genome lab to strengthen fight against Covid||MUMBAI: When chief minister Uddhav Thackeray e-inaugurated the city’s first whole genome sequencing laboratory, he was capping three months of efforts put in by a group of doctors who graduated from the 100-year-old BMC-run Nair Hospital. At the inauguration, Thackeray said the new lab in Nair’s affiliate Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokli would help to quickly find mutations in the coronavirus, thereby strengthening the fight against Covid. The need for such a lab was felt during the second Covid wave when the new variant, Delta, was found in Vidarbha only during the peak; its earlier detection could have helped check its spread. Additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC was in the process of choosing 384 samples to start the first round of sequencing in the next few days. “We have chosen four categories of Covid patients — those in hospital for a long time, those living in areas with more cases , deceased samples and those with foreign travel history,” Kakani said. As testing each sample would cost around Rs 10,000, the BMC is being careful about picking up the samples. Dr Jayanti Shastri, who heads the Nair Hospital microbiology department and is in charge of BMC’s genome laboratory, said: “We got two machines as donation from US company Illumina costing Rs 6.4 crore. It is the latest technology available in the world.” Another Rs 4 crore was raised by ATE Chandra Foundation from donors such as the Gates Foundations and Godrej. Thackeray, who also flagged off Nair Hospital’s centenary celebrations, said the BMC set up the lab without imposing a financial burden on the government but through corporate social responsibility (CSR) fund. The Nair Hospital alumni stepped in to organise the CSR funds. “Our alumni in Mumbai decided to do something about the fact that the city had no genome laboratory. We got in touch with one of our alumnus in Harvard Medical School, Dr Mehul Mehta, who got in touch with Illumina about a donation,” said Dr Arshad Ghulam Mohammed of the Nair Hospital alumni association. The company agreed, and the paperwork was completed between May 11 and June 4, but the lack of cargo flights delayed the arrival of the machines from Singapore by more than a month. So far, samples from Mumbai were sent to Centre’s INSACOG initiative, but the results were always delayed. In the interim, the state tied up with CSIR’s Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology Lab, Delhi, and the BMC carried out a pilot study with IIT Bombay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-gets-its-first-genome-lab-to-strengthen-fight-against-covid/articleshow/85052885.cms||---
---||Mumbai||58,000 online frauds in a year, yet Maharashtra drags feet on national instant alert system||MUMBAI: Over 58,000 complaints of online banking frauds have been filed with Maharashtra State Cyber Cell in the last 12 months. This includes 14,000-plus from Mumbai. The amount involved runs into several crores. Yet, barely 600 cases have resulted in FIRs. Many applications have been turned into non-cognizable offences, which do not show up in crime statistics and are not probed unless a court order pushes for it. Despite being among the worst-hit by cybercrime, Maharashtra has underplayed the problem and shown no urgency in teaming up with the Centre to institute a helpline-cum-call centre to freeze or track the flow of money stolen digitally. TimesViewIt’s a police force that prides itself on high standards of investigative work and use of cutting edge technology. Yet, Mumbai’s law enforcers lag behind those of several states including Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka in tackling cyber fraud. The problem seems two-fold: police chooses to underplay the extent to which online theft of money has taken root; secondly, administrators have failed to make the fight against such emerging modes of crime a priority.The Union home ministry and the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre have already launched the helpline ‘155260’ in seven states and union territories. It allows a victim of a fraud to register an instant complaint and have information escalated to financial intermediaries involved in the transaction. This has resulted in Delhi and Rajasthan police recovering Rs 1.13 crore since the helpline opened on April 1. Maharashtra’s cyber police, on the other hand, has set no deadlines to implement the plan. ‘Mumbaikars are sitting ducks for cyber cons, thanks to govt inaction’Recently, Bengaluru police and banks, facilitated by the Reserve Bank of India, opened a helpline for victims of fraudulent digital transactions, to freeze the transfer of money immediately. Hitherto, fraudsters have managed to cash out as banks would insist on a first information report (FIR) that is filed only after ascertaining facts and requires investigative resources. The emergency number helps save time by sending a real-time alert to both debited and credited financial intermediaries in the transaction and can prevent funds from being withdrawn by the perpetrator. “There is the concept of a golden hour within which we should respond and cut the transmission chain. Also, the first respondents here have to be the banks or payment platforms as that is where the transactions take place,” said Kamal Pant, police commissioner, Bengaluru. Apart from Bengaluru, at least seven states and union territories have now deployed a technological platform, aligning with the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal, with help from the Central government and Reserve Bank of India to deter cyber crooks. Unlike the southern metro, these regions have worked with the Union home ministry to set up the mechanism. The bad news is Maharashtra is not one of them. Joint commissioner of police (Mumbai crime) Milind Bharambe said a helpline to freeze accounts in cases of online fraud is yet to be rolled out in the city. The State Cyber Police is the nodal agency working on the project, but there is no clarity on when it will be ready. For one, it requires a large investment by Maharashtra to set up a call centre to receive complaints and send out alerts to banks and wallet operators. State Cyber Cell (PRO) Superintendent of Police Sanjay Shintre said they are working with the government to start it. A highly placed source told TOI, “The helpline should have got implemented in Maharashtra state and Mumbai due to the high number of cyber offences (online frauds) recorded annually. It is over 58,000 in Maharashtra and 14,000 in Mumbai respectively in the last one year.” The Bengaluru model shows it can even be done on a smaller size to serve a city before it is scaled up for an entire state. Their Cybercrime Incident Reports (CIRs) address high-frequency, low-value crimes like phishing and fake messaging and use an existing emergency response number. Cyber lawyer Dr Prashant Mali said, “We Mumbaikars are sitting ducks for cybercriminals across the country and they are aided by government inaction. The state, even if takes staff from the arms division, can form and operate a call centre to freeze online frauds. Apart from Bengaluru police, Gujarat cyber police too has managed to save over Rs2.5 crore in 2020 after freezing accounts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/58k-online-frauds-in-a-yr-yet-maha-drags-feet-on-natl-instant-alert-system/articleshow/85054754.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Kochi||Sea trials of Indigenous Aircraft Carrier begin||New Delhi: The much-awaited sea trials of India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC), which will be reincarnated as INS Vikrant once it is commissioned in August next year, finally kicked off on Wednesday. Describing the launch of the maiden sea trials of the 40,000-tonne IAC as a “proud and historic day”, the Navy said India has now joined a select group of countries like the US, Russia, China, France and UK to have the “niche capability” to indigenously design, build and integrate a state-of-the-art aircraft carrier. The IAC will become fully operational only after the flight trials of MiG-29K supersonic fighter jets, MH-60R multi-role helicopters and indigenously manufactured ALHs (advanced light helicopters) are completed from its deck by around mid-2023. But once deployed on the high seas, the 262-metre long and 62-meter wide IAC will pack quite an offensive punch as a floating airfield with fighters as well as a wide array of weapons to project raw military power. Built at the Cochin Shipyard Ltd for around Rs 23,000 crore with an indigenous content of 76%, the carrier was first sanctioned by government in January 2003. It has been designed for a crew of 1,700, with specialised cabins for women officers, and an operational endurance of around 7,500 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 18 knots. The IAC will be christened INS Vikrant after the country’s first aircraft carrier which was acquired from the UK in 1961 and played a major role in the 1971 war and was decommissioned in 1997. India currently has only one aircraft carrier, the 44,500-tonne Russian-made INS Vikramaditya, inducted in November 2013. China, meanwhile, is assiduously ramping up its naval presence in the Indian Ocean Region. It already has two carriers and is building two more towards its aim of eventually having 10. The US Navy, of course, has as many as 11 “super” 100,000-tonne carriers, each of which can carry 80-90 fighters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sea-trials-of-indigenous-aircraft-carrier-begin/articleshow/85050407.cms||---

As a modus operandi, suspects steal bikes and sell them off by collecting at least 50% as advance payment and assure the buyer to handover the documents and collect the remaining 50%. However, these thieves never return to handover documents or to collect remaining amount. When contacted, Gupta said, “Purchasing of stolen bikes or articles is a crime.” The officer said that directives have been issued to break the chain of vehicular thefts. The city police recently arrested a jeweller for purchasing a gold chain from an accused who robbed a pedestrian woman of gold chain. To improve the vehicle detect rate, city police has started marking the areas and spots from where two-wheelers are being frequently lifted by suspect thieves. Through this marking, several vehicular thefts have already been detected in the recent months. “In majority of detections, the vehicles were found to be stolen and sold in rural areas. Efforts are being taken to make the rural population aware so that they abstain from purchasing such stolen vehicles,” said crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav. Police officials said that the police stations having rural areas and villages have been tasked to run awareness drives through local sarpanchs or police patil so that they do not end up in odd situations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/those-purchasing-stolen-vehicles-to-be-made-accused-cp/articleshow/85045796.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Dairy officials said they had to stop production as supply of raw materials was impacted due to the recent flooding. Almost 13 ingredients used in cattle feed manufacturing are sourced from outside state, Anil Phadte, the officiating MD of the dairy said. He added that production began from Wednesday afternoon. The Goa State Milk Producers’ Union popularly known as Goa Dairy, is a cooperative union of about 137 village-level milk collection societies takes care of their members – milk pouring farmers, by providing cattle feed on subsidized rates in a bid to promote milk production in the state.However, the ingredients used in the feed manufacturing process, including salt are brought from neighbouring states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. The dairy supplies about 35 tonne high protein cattle feed, 10 tonne high energy cattle feed, 1.5 tonne Maka Chuni (maize powder), 1.5 tonne calf ration and 1.5 tonne Kadba Kutti (chopped jowar or sorghum and green vegetables) per day to farmers in Goa. While the Maka Chunni is prepared at the cattle feed plant, Kadba Kutti is procured from outside state. Phadte said they had to shut the feed plant for last three days as they could not receive the ingredients from the suppliers in the three states due to incessant rain and flooding in their respective areas. “Besides this, the plant also had to take a break for maintenance and we made best use of the situation by completing maintenance of the plant. The plant has started production on Wednesday afternoon after we received the stock,” Phadte explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/usgao-cattle-feed-plant-stalls-for-3-days-as-floods-hit-material-supply/articleshow/85052895.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a memorandum submitted to Union minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad, Chavan said the rate of interest for education loan should be made at par with home or vehicle loans. “Many avenues are available for the youth today while pursuing higher education. However, many students hailing from humble background cannot fulfil their desire for higher studies due financial constraints and contemplate the option of bank loan for studies. The existing interest rates on educational loan are not affordable for many families and therefore needs a revision,” Chavan said. Stating that different nationalised and private banks currently charge interest ranging from 6.75% per annum to 16% per annum, the NCP leader said such rates should be lowered and kept uniform. “The pandemic has adversely affected the income of many families and this calls for urgent official attention for slashing the interest rates on educational loans. While reducing the interest rates, the government should ensure the benefit is applicable to students who have already opted for education loans,” Chavan said. Karad could not be reached for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ncp-mlc-demands-slashing-of-edu-loan-interest-rates/articleshow/85045849.cms||---

Das was arrested in Bihar under the Arms Act and a gun was found in his possession. “The applicant cannot claim parity with accused Rajkumar Das, and cannot be released on bail as Rajkumar was released on bail on the ground that he is residing in Goa for the last 17 years and that he is having no criminal antecedents, which is not the case in respect of the present applicant,” Justice M S Jawalkar stated. “The applicant, if released on bail, the chances of fleeing from trial and committing the same offence cannot be ruled out. Considering the overall facts and circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that no ground for grant of bail is made out. Accordingly, the application for bail is rejected,” she stated. A gang of six persons held customers hostage and decamped with 11.8 lakh before two of them were caught by alert citizens while trying to flee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/accused-in-bank-robbery-denied-bail/articleshow/85052920.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The pugilist said getting the right training from a young age plays a crucial role in the performance. On Wednesday, Simranjit returned home to Chakar village, where she also went to the local sports academy and interacted with the budding boxers and gave tips on diet and training.Speaking with the TOI, the boxer said, “People and the governments remain distant from sports and sportspersons for four years and near the Olympics their focus suddenly changes. Then they expect all players to get medals and thereafter again forget about them. We cannot bring medals with this attitude.” “The initial years in the game are important and if given the right training and diet from the beginning, we can get excellent results. So, I would suggest the government and the sports authorities to start grooming players for the Olympics from the age when they start playing for the state, as years of hard work and training are required to win a medal in Olympics,” she added.Balwant Singh Sandhu, chairperson of the Chakar Sports Academy, said, “Like us, many other sports enthusiasts are running private academies in other villages. We are doing our best to provide good training to the budding players, but if trained coaches visit such academies and share the right techniques, we may produce more players who can excel at international level.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/adopt-groom-young-players-at-state-level/articleshow/85048129.cms||Payal Dhawan

Though she could not win a medal for the country, she has become a role model for many girls and aspirants.A resident of Chakar village, pugilist Simranjit’s journey to Tokyo Olympics was full of hardships. From losing her father at a young age to not being able to have three meals a day and living in a low-lying house that would fill with water in the rainy season, she fought many odds to reach this platform.On Wednesday, when Simranjit returned to Chakar, 62km from Ludhiana, villagers gave her a rousing reception and students of four schools welcomed her on the way home. She was also honoured at the village gurdwara and a special jeep was called for her in which she went around the village. The vehicle was escorted by the villagers and a dhol player that made many dance with joy.Villager Balwant Singh Sandhu, who also runs the village’s boxing academy, said, “It is a proud moment for us to welcome Simranjit. We had never dreamt of it. She has become a role model and inspiration for many. Though Simranjit and her family did not want any celebration, we could not stop ourselves as it was such an important day for us.”About 100 students of different schools of Chakar stood along the road to welcome the pugilist. They clapped for her and also danced to dhol beats.Simranjit said, “I have been through a really tough time in my life, but it made me stronger and pushed me to work hard for myself and my family. The kind of welcome I have received was overwhelming. I have promised my village that I will perform better in the next Olympics and win a medal.”Simranjit’s mother Rajpal Kaur said, “Watching Simmi (Simranjit’s nickname) on television, representing India in Olympics, was so far the best moment of my life. It was my dream to see her in the Olympics ring and I consider it to be a big achievement. I know she will work hard and win a medal next time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/chakar-spins-with-joy-rolls-out-red-carpet-for-simranjit/articleshow/85048118.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand girl who trekked through hills, forest for network to study tops her school||DEHRADUN: Attending a “digital classroom” meant something entirely different for Jayshree Uraon — an hour-long 8-km trek in the scarped Garhwal Himalayas, 3 km of which was through the dense Dhanaulti forests, with her phone in one hand and notebook in the other. All to find a spot where she’d get mobile internet coverage so she could download her lessons. After a year of this pandemic-driven daily quest, Jayshree has topped her school in the Class XII humanities exams with 82.6%. And to make things easier for those like her, she wants to become a teacher. Burans Khanda in Tehri-Garhwal, about 20km from Mussoorie, is home to 10 families. Set up in 1989, the Government Inter College, where Jayshree studied, is the only school in a 10-km radius. When in-person classes were on, the few kids in the village would always turn up. But with the Covid outbreak and the online shift that followed, things changed. “It was extremely difficult. We were suddenly dependent on WhatsApp notes. I had to borrow my brother’s phone initially. Later, my parents spent their savings and got me one of my own,” Jayshree, 18, told TOI on Wednesday after the Uttarakhand Board of School Education results were out. Jayshree’s parents had moved from Gumla in Jharkhand to the village more than a decade ago and her father Karampal, a mason, decided to settle here. “I am elated,” he told TOI. “I can’t believe she did so well despite these difficulties.” TOI had in May last year reported the plight of Uraon and students like her in the network shadows of Uttarakhand. Deputy director general of the state department of telecommunications Arun Verma had then told TOI that coverage is bad in the hills because it is “not commercially viable” for operators to set up multiple towers in areas with low population. “Jayshree and many of her schoolmates would trek 8-10 km, a major part of which was through dense forests, to find a place to study,” said Kamleshwar Bhatt, her teacher. The forests, villagers believe, are home to leopards. “We couldn’t have held online classes because no one has a consistent mobile network.” Besides, like Jayshree, many students didn’t have the tools for an online classroom. “Many students didn’t have smartphones or couldn't afford mobile data. Most families here are engaged in small farming or daily-wage labour. We knew the challenges. We started uploading images of study material on WhatsApp, so students could download it on their own time,” Bhatt added. “But you need network at some point.” When the pandemic seemed to have eased a little, the teachers started going door to door with printed study material. Jayshree was grateful for that. “I am so thankful to my teachers, who helped me a lot — coming home to give me notes whenever they could,” she said. “Now, I will enrol for an undergraduate course at a government college in Mussoorie and try to start on a computer course as well. When graduation is done, I will get a job to help my family. Later, I will become a teacher. That’s my dream job.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/girl-who-trekked-through-hills-forest-for-network-to-study-tops-her-school/articleshow/85048105.cms||Mohammad Anab

In an important development, the BMC has announced that vaccinations will be held solely through walk-ins at the community level centres in Mumbai. Of the 314 public vaccination centres in the city, a total of 270 are in 227 constituencies, or at the community level. All these centres will now allow walk-ins for citizens above the age of 18 years. In the remaining centres that are housed within hospitals such as SevenHills, KEM, Cooper, etc, vaccination will continue to be 50% through registration and 50% through walk-ins. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer said the decision to allow 100% walk-ins for ward-level centres followed complaints from corporators that people from outside the city were getting shots by booking slots online, whereas locals who were not net-savvy were struggling to book the shots. Pregnant women, students going abroad for education, citizens going for job / business abroad will continue to be vaccinated only at centres designated for them. Importantly, 70% of the doses will be earmarked for second shot recipients while 30% for those coming for the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-only-walk-ins-at-ward-level-centres-from-today-says-bmc/articleshow/85052944.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Complainant says cops made hubby pay for Vaishnodevi trip||Aurangabad: Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta has ordered an investigation into a woman’s complaint that two constables took her husband to New Delhi apparently to effect the arrest of a recovery agent, told him there that the agent had apologised and made him pay for their visit to Vaishnodevi near Jammu. Speaking to TOI, Gupta said, “We have ordered a probe. Based on the findings, exemplary action will definitely be taken against those found guilty.” The woman, 29, had purchased groceries worth Rs 46,000 with her credit card in 2019. She subsequently paid Rs 25,000 of her credit card dues but could not pay the rest after lockdown was imposed in 2020. The woman said she soon started getting calls from recovery agents to pay up the balance. She alleged that the agents sent her abusive messages and even told her get into the flesh trade to make quick money and repay the amount. From June this year, she said she started getting text messages from Delhi-based recovery agents, seeking sexual favours. The woman and her husband had lodged a complaint in February this year but said the police registered only a non-cognisable offence. The MIDC Cidco police station then registered a case under sections 509 of the IPC (intent to insult modesty of woman) and 504 (intentional insult aimed at provoking breach of peace). However, the woman’s husband told TOI, “When we requested the police to add sections of the IT Act, we were asked to go to court and get it done.” In the first week of July, two constables from the police station contacted the husband and asked him to accompany them to Delhi for the arrest of one of the agents who was making calls to the woman. Her husband said, “On reaching Delhi, the police took me to an office from where they said the agent operated. However, I was made to sit outside the office. The police emerged after two hours saying the man had apologised for making the calls.” The husband said the constables played a video recording of a man seeking an apology from his wife. Later, the constables made him purchase tickets for the Vaishnodevi trip. When the man returned to Aurangabad, his wife lodged a complaint with Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/complainant-says-cops-made-hubby-pay-for-vaishnodevi-trip/articleshow/85045919.cms||---
---||Dehradun||56% of hand sanitiser samples ‘ineffective', can't kill coronavirus: Test report||Dehradun: Several sanitisers in the market, including known brands, may be “completely ineffective” at killing Sars-Cov-2 and preventing Covid-19, researchers have warned after they tested 1,050 samples from 50 different brand names in Uttarakhand and found that over half of them were of no use against the coronavirus. In fact, the sanitisers might actually be causing harm as many of them contained toxic chemicals over the permissible limit, said researchers from the Dehradun-based Society of Pollution & Environmental Conservation Scientists (SPECS) who tested them in their laboratory which is approved by the Centre. The samples were collected from households and shops between May and June this year. Scientists found that 56% — or 578 — of the collected samples had an alcohol percentage as low as 10%, rendering them ‘ineffective’. The permissible limit for alcohol in a sanitiser is 75%. Alcohol-free sanitisers were not included in the survey. “At 10%, the alcohol quantity in the sanitisers was too low to neutralise the virus. People were fooled into thinking they had protection against the spread of Covid-19,” said Dr Brij Mohan Sharma, secretary of SPECS, adding that the survey findings would be shared with the Union ministry of science and technology. Dr Naresh Gupta, consultant pathologist in the health department who was not part of the survey, agreed that any alcohol-based sanitiser with less than 75% alcohol would not be of any use against the virus. “According to the World Health Organisation recommendations, 75% of the content in a sanitiser can be alcohol while remaining is distilled water, glycerine or hydrogen peroxide. But chemicals other than alcohol have to be kept below 1%,” Gupta said. More than 100 samples in the survey had higher than permissible limits of hydrogen peroxide. “In some samples, the percentage of hydrogen peroxide was as high as 7% which can harm the respiratory tract and cause nausea, vomiting and foaming at the mouth. We are now forced to think that poor quality sanitisers might have contributed to the spread of Covid infection in the state,” said Sharma. Eight samples also contained methanol. “Methanol is basically hooch and higher levels in sanitisers can be detrimental to the health of kids and elderly,” said Sharma, adding that 300 samples also had toxic blue methylene and derivatives of copper. Experts said that poor quality sanitisers could be behind a spike in skin related issues recorded during the pandemic. Dr Riti Bhatia, assistant professor in the department of dermatology at AIIMS-Rishikesh, said, “Prevalence of dermatitis and eczema among health workers was as low as 20% to 30% pre-pandemic but it increased to 70% during Covid-era according to some estimates. Even among the public, we have noticed an increase in conditions such as dermatitis. The irritant contact dermatitis of the skin and allergic contact dermatitis happens when sanitisers or soaps used are of inferior quality.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/56-of-hand-sanitiser-samples-ineffective-cant-kill-coronavirus-test-report/articleshow/85048184.cms||Shivani Azad

The court will also pass an order on the bail pleas of Waze and accused policeman Riyazuddin Kazi. Making submissions via video conferencing from Taloja jail, Waze said his detention in the absence of a chargesheet was in violation of his fundamental right. The court had earlier turned down his request to appear in person to make submissions on the plea, insisting his lawyer present the arguments. Waze’s earlier plea for default bail was rejected. When a chargesheet is not submitted within the stipulated time, the accused has to be granted default bail.

The daily case tally in Mumbai registered a marginal rise to 329 cases on Wednesday, but the daily test positivity remained at 1% as the BMC conducted more tests. According to the BMC Covid update on Wednesday, 34,114 tests were conducted in the city. Nine deaths were registered in Mumbai on Wednesday, while the state added 195 fatalities. On Tuesday, the city had the lowest toll (3) in three months. The overall case tally in the state now stands at 63 lakh, including 7.3 lakh cases in Mumbai. The state toll is 1,33,410, including 15,920 deaths in Mumbai. Besides ramping up vaccination, the state health department will emphasise on tracking, testing and treatment in the four districts of concern, said health minister Tope. He said as the countries facing the third wave at the moment had higher vaccinated population, they were not severely impacted in terms of hospitalisation and death. “So we are emphasising more and more on vaccination and want the Centre to provide an uninterrupted supply of vaccines,” said Tope. In the last 24 hours, Aurangabad reported 24 deaths, the highest in the state, while Ahmednagar (rural) registered the highest (785) new cases (with 16 deaths). Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Solapur are the only other districts with deaths in two-digit numbers. According to the state health department data, the six-district Nagpur circle reported only 26 new cases of Covid and no deaths on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-cases-cross-300-tope-stress-on-vax-in-4-worst-dists/articleshow/85052987.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal hospitals protest test price cap, to meet panel today||KOLKATA: The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) has convened an online meeting with private hospitals on Thursday after the latter appealed to the commission for clarification on capping of rates for five radiological and 15 pathological tests. The panel capped the charges on July 2 for private hospitals with 150 sanctioned beds and above. Hospitals are yet to introduce the capped charges as they wait for the commission’s response to their appeal. “We will have an online meeting with private hospitals on Thursday as some of them have urged us for a hearing on the capped charges,” said WBCERC chairperson justice (retired) Ashim Kumar Banerjee.  Following the July 2 order, the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) wrote to the panel, seeking a clarification on how the prices were calculated. The association also sought clarification on why this capping was applicable for only NABH-accredited hospitals with 150 and above beds. “Running an NABH-accredited lab requires quality equipment, reagents and 24x7 manpower and service. I hope the commission will hear us out and reconsider the charges. It will not be possible to maintain the quality-control measures at that kind of rate,” said the CEO of a private hospital. According to the commission, it had received numerous complaints about high rates being charged by hospitals for conducting investigations during the pandemic, especially for Covid-19 patients. The health panel then consulted two expert committees before fixing the rates of the tests. The capped charges are applicable to non-Covid patients and only those who avail of cash treatment at hospitals. During the pandemic, charges for the likes of RT-PCR test, PPE kits, doctors and bed had been capped at private hospitals. Thus was apart from the mandatory discount on medicine and consumables for Covid patients. A murmur of discontent followed after the health panel passed the latest price capping order. Nineteen major corporate hospitals, which form the AHEI, decided to take up the issue with WBCERC. “We do not understand why this discriminatory approach towards hospitals with 150 beds and more. How can we introduce new technologies, advanced gadgets in such a situation? But we expect the commission to hear our side and come up with a positive result that will not hurt our interest,” said the head of another corporate hospital. The commission has, however, not taken any decision on revising the capped rates. A call is likely to be taken after the Thursday meet. “Let us hear what the private hospitals says before we take a decision,” said the panel chairperson. Hospitals also hope the commission would consider their higher operation costs in comparison to diagnostic centres and the rising inflation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosps-protest-test-price-cap-to-meet-panel-today/articleshow/85050650.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The Vadodara Central Jail officials filed an FIR against Salim’s brother Ayub and city police commissioner transferred investigations of the case to the crime branch on Wednesday. Salim, one of the key conspirators in the Godhra train carnage, was convicted by a special court in 2011 and he is currently lodged in Vadodara jail.  According to the complaint filed by N P Rathod, a jail official, Salim, who has been punished with life imprisonment, was granted 21-day parole without police escort by Gujarat high court June 16. The court had ordered to deposit Rs one lakh and a solvency certificate of the same amount to two persons within 15 days as a condition to get parole. Ayub turned up at the jail on June 30 and produced two solvency certificates of Kanti Vasava and Iqbal Belim to get parole for Salim.  When the jail officials asked for the original Aadhar card of Vasava and Belim, Ayub said that the identity cards were deposited at the gate along with his mobile phone. He left to get the identity cards but never returned. The jail officials got suspicious as the certificates were of Rs 15 lakh and Rs 10 lakh respectively instead of the required Rs one lakh.  The certificates were sent to the mamlatdar office in Godhra for verification and the jail officials were told that they were fake. The jail authorities also submitted a report about the forged documents to Gujarat high court on July 2. “We will form a team on Thursday to nab Ayub who is a resident of Godhra,” said a crime branch official. In 2014, Salim had jumped his 15-day parole that he got for house renovation work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/convicts-brother-forges-documents-for-parole/articleshow/85047255.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cops share 16 road tips with civic body||Kolkata: The Kolkata traffic police have proposed multiple measures, including road engineering interventions, to reduce traffic congestion and accidents. The note sent to Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) commissioner by Kolkata Police DC (traffic) has suggested 16 proposals, including improving the carriageway, setting up new bus stops, improving illumination and remodelling pavements. Among the major changes proposed are pertaining to the undulating road surface near Ultadanga crossing, improvement in the Garia crossing and reducing the size of the island next to Traingular Park at New Alipore. “Since there is a rise in traffic owing to the use of more cars and two-wheelers during the pandemic, we have decided to share with the civic authorities some suggestions based on ground reports. A similar proposal is also being readied for the KMDA,” said an officer at Lalbazar. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said the suggestions had come from traffic guards, particularly the sergeants, who are on duty at high density traffic corridors and at key intersections. One of the proposals is to install high mast light towers at four crossings — BB Ganguly-CR Avenue, Khanna, Kankurgachhi and Ultadanga-Hudco. They have also sought the improvement of illumination at some important stretches like Durgapur Bridge, Judges Court Road (between Gopalnagar crossing and main gate of Alipore correctional home), Ambedkar Colony, AJC Bose Road (Belvedere Road crossing to DL Khan Road crossing, bordering Race Course) and Kankurgacchi underpass. Cops have also suggested the widening of a few thoroughfares that have witnessed a surge in traffic. These include the northeast corner of Beliaghata Road and BR Singh Hospital crossing. They have proposed that the central median at Ultadanga Underpass should be removed as there is “insufficient space” for Ultadanga-bound traffic. Howrah Bridge guard has proposal the demolition of a part of the boundary wall of a parking lot underneath the Brabourne Road flyover to improve the flow of traffic from MG Road towards Howrah Bridge. The police have also asked KMC to reduce the width of pavements at certain points while urging that the pavement surface be made smooth to encourage pedestrians to use it, instead of walking on the carriageway. However, there is no comment on the need for removing encroachments on pavements, particularly the ones by hawkers — the primary reason why many pedestrians avoid using footpaths. Cops stated that encroachment on roads due to the non-availability of bus shelters is a common sight in the city. They have proposed new bus stops at Khanna Cinema and asked for shifting the AC bus shelter on CIT Road by 50-metre. Cops have also sought for the improvement of drainage system that is needed to prevent waterlogging at Kankurgachhi underpass and Ultadanga underpass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-share-16-road-tips-with-civic-body/articleshow/85050600.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

State GST collections rose to Rs 18,899 crore in July compared to Rs 13,721 crore in June. That is a rise of Rs 5,178 crore. GST collections in July reflect business transactions made in the previous month. Since the state was under a lockdown in April and May, the June revenues reflected the collections during the previous lockdown month. As a result, the surge in July is sharper. GST is a consumption-based tax and an indicator of economic activity. Maharashtra’s GST collections are the highest in the country and it is the main revenue earner for the state government. The data also shows that the GST collection from April to July this year is 68% higher than the same period last year. During April-July in 2020, collections were Rs 40,552 crore while this year the figure is over Rs 68,000 crore. This is a rise of Rs 27,647 crore. Last year, the national lockdown was very stringent with most sectors barring agriculture closed. During the state lockdown in April and May, agriculture, manufacturing, construction and essential services were allowed to stay open. Maharashtra had ended the pandemic-struck year of 2020-21 with GST collections that were 11% lower than 2019. Data showed that the state collected 1.6 lakh crore in GST in 2020-21 compared to 1.8 lakh crore in 2019-20. The receipts had dipped by Rs 20,609 crore. When the state budget was tabled on March 8, the state had revised its target for SGST collections. Although the target for 2020-21 had been set at Rs 1 lakh crore, the state had collected Rs 88,000 crore. The gap was Rs 19,146 crore. The budget documents said: “The tax collections are not showing the expected buoyancy due to the Covid-19 pandemic and non-receipt of compensation cess from the central government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mumbai-state-gst-collection-up-38-in-july-as-lockdown-eases/articleshow/85063663.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Mumbai||Borivli society leads the way with efforts to conserve rainwater||MUMBAI: A rainwater conservation initiative is gaining momentum among residents of a few buildings in Borivli with a local Shiv Sena corporator promising free percolation pits to those housing societies willing to be a part of it. Sena corporator Tejasvee Ghosalkar drew inspiration from Exotica CHS, a housing society in Borivli, that decided to construct percolation pits within its premises to raise the ground water levels through rainwater that may get collected in the pit. Vinu Paul, chairman of the Exotica CHS said, “We were introduced to the idea through Shubhajit Mukherjee, ambassador of ‘Majhi Vasundhara’ Abhiyaan of the state government. We then discussed the same among our society members and decided to initiate it on a pilot basis at a cost of around Rs 6,000. The aim is to send the rain water back to the ground which will then benefit the trees whose roots may be spreading across and also the bore wells in the premises. We have dug a pit with two drums which is supposed to act as a collection chamber when it rains. The water should then slowly perforate in all directions through the holes made in it.” Corporator Ghosalkar, who was a part of the inauguration of the percolation pits at Exotica CHS, said she would be willing to construct free percolation pits for societies keen to emulate the initiative. Abhishek Ghosalkar, her husband also a former corporator, said they have reimbursed the society for the work taken up as they were impressed with the initiative. “We have committed to giving percolation pits so that it helps save rainwater which otherwise enters stormwater drains and goes into the sea. Since it’s environment friendly, we want other societies to follow suit,” he said. Mukherjee said despite the fact that Mumbai receives so much rainfall, top soil in many areas is dry. “I feel such percolation pits, if constructed, will not only reduce waterlogging but also support groundwater recharge,” said Mukherjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-borivli-soc-leads-the-way-with-efforts-to-conserve-rainwater/articleshow/85056244.cms||Richa Pinto

While Satyam Vavilala, the parent, alleged that despite scoring well in a unit test and in Class 9 and Class 8, his son Varun was awarded “very poor marks”. Shalu Sharma, principal, Ivy League Academy, Shamirpet claimed the school followed CBSE norms while awarding marks. “Despite paying Rs 90,000, they awarded him fewer marks as we still have to pay Rs 40,000,” Satyam told TOI. He claimed that he begged the management that he will clear all dues before collecting TC and bonafide, but the management still gave very poor marks. “My son always scored about 70% marks. At a time when even children studying in small schools, or in those owned by government, are being awarded over 90% marks, my son was awarded only 58.8%,” he said adding that his son is depressed and inconsolable. The parent said that after awarding fewer marks, the school had called him and asked him to clear pending dues and collect documents. “How can a school play with a child’s life for money,” he questioned. He said that his son was even stopped from attending online classes and even from writing pre-board exams until he paid Rs 50,000. “Instead of writing exam, he was made to sit in the office room. Only after paying money, they allowed him to write exams,” added Satyam and requested officials to enquire into the issue, initiate action against the management. The school principal, meanwhile, said that fee dues have nothing to do with marks awarded. “We followed and awarded marks as per the rules of CBSE. We have sent marks based on student’s performance in the unit test, half-yearly, and pre-boards. Moderation of marks was done based on the reference year,” said Sharma. She questioned which school would award fewer marks to students in board exams. “At the end, it is not marks of the individual student, but our overall aggregate. Why would we award fewer marks? What would we gain?” she questioned. Sandeep Kumar Sultania, special chief secretary of education, Telangana failed to respond to calls and messages made by TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/school-denies-parents-charges-of-lowering-scores-over-fee-due/articleshow/85054779.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

During April-July in 2020, collections were Rs 40,552 crore while this year the figure is over Rs 68,000 crore. This is a rise of Rs 27,647 crore. Last year, the national lockdown was very stringent with most sectors barring agriculture closed. During the state lockdown in April and May, agriculture, manufacturing, construction and essential services were allowed to stay open. Maharashtra had ended the pandemic-struck year of 2020-21 with GST collections that were 11% lower than 2019. Data showed that the state collected 1.6 lakh crore in GST in 2020-21 compared to 1.8 lakh crore in 2019-20. The receipts had dipped by Rs 20,609 crore. When the state budget was tabled on March 8, the state had revised its target for SGST collections. Although the target for 2020-21 had been set at Rs 1 lakh crore, the state had collected Rs 88,000 crore. The gap was Rs 19,146 crore. The budget documents said: “The tax collections are not showing the expected buoyancy due to the Covid-19 pandemic and non-receipt of compensation cess from the central government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mumbai-state-gst-collection-up-38-in-july-as-lockdown-eases/articleshow/85063664.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra GST collection up 38% in July as lockdown eases||MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s GST collections rose by almost 38% in July compared to the previous month, reflecting economic recovery after the brutal second wave in the state, which had resulted in a lockdown. State GST collections rose to Rs 18,899 crore in July compared to Rs 13,721 crore in June. That is a rise of Rs 5,178 crore. GST collections in July reflect business transactions made in the previous month. Since the state was under a lockdown in April and May, the June revenues reflected the collections during the previous lockdown month. As a result, the surge in July is sharper.

Sources said that the four-day first stage sea trials will cover a distance of around 80 nautical miles, during which the ship’s performance, including hull, main propulsion, power generation and distribution (PGD) and auxiliary equipment would be closely monitored. The inspections will be carried out by various testing agencies and engineering teams, including the Navy’s carrier acceptance team (CAT). Helicopter landing tests involving Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) and Sea King and Chetak helicopters will also be held. However, landing tests of fighter aircraft will happen only later. The first stage is basically the machinery sea trial which will measure the vessel’s performance and seaworthiness. Gearbox, gas turbines, fire-fighting, air conditioning, navigation, communication, speed, manoeuvrability, equipment and safety features will be inspected. There are around 1,200 people on board the ship, including naval personnel and technical teams from Navy and CSL. A senior naval officer, designated Master of the Ship, will be in command during the trials. The ship has been designed with a very high degree of automation for machinery operation, ship navigation and survivability. Its basin trials were completed in November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/iac-may-cover-80-nautical-miles/articleshow/85050668.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

East-West Metro already has the provision in its six operational stations. Once the QR-coded system is operational, commuters using smart cards or tokens won’t have to stand in queue to buy tickets or recharge their Metro cards. Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi said, “We may start the QR-coding system of access in East-West Metro by the year-end. But it will take some time in the North-South corridor as we have to retrofit the existing automatic fare collection (AFC) gates. The process of enabling the AFC gates with the ticketless facility has started.” Officials said North-South Metro, which is the country’s most populous Metro corridor, should be in a position to introduce the facility by early next year. Metro Railway has just finished installing the QR-code scanners at Maidan and Park Street stations. Joshi is keen to introduce QR codes and other digital payment-based systems. Once the facility is in place, commuters can book the tickets online and tickets will be issued via a mobile application and passengers will have to scan it at the AFC gate. “In the QR code system, users must register on the application using mobile number and email ID and buy QR tickets by selecting the starting point, the destination station and the number of passengers. A maximum of six tickets can be purchased at a time,” an official said. Currently, Metro users have to swipe the smart card at the AFC gates to gain access. Tokens can be used for the same purpose. But during the pandemic, no tokens are being issued. The Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) has prepared the software that is being installed in the 26 stations of the North-South line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-keen-on-going-contactless-with-qr-scanners-to-cut-queues/articleshow/85050682.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The traumatised girl somehow managed to escape and stayed locked inside another room even as her inebriated father attempted to break open the door. The crime took place on July 31, but the minor girl remained quiet until her elder brother returned from Delhi on August 3. Their mother passed away last year and the girl used to live with her alcoholic father while her brother, 22, works in Delhi. Her elder sister got married earlier this year. The class VI student, who studies in a government school, soon moved to her aunt’s house in the neighbourhood. An FIR was registered on Tuesday night and the girl's father was picked up by cops. The minor was sent for medico-legal examination on Wednesday. Her statement was also recorded by police. In the complaint, the girl’s brother said his sister was in a state of complete shock. He came to know from his elder sister and immediately came to Budaun to confront his father. After initial investigation, it was found that the complaint was correct and the FIR under IPC section 354 (attempt to outrage the modesty of a woman) along with the Pocso Act was registered, police said. The accused father has confessed to the crime and was sent to jail. The girl’s statement will be recorded in the court under section 164 CrPC and a charge-sheet will be filed soon, the police added.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh flood toll rises to 14, five bridges swept away in 2 days||BHOPAL: Floods continued to wreak havoc in north MP, particularly the Gwalior-Chambal region, on Wednesday, with the death toll rising to 14, three more bridges being swept away and hundreds more villages submerged. PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah spoke with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and assured all help. “The central government is working closely with the Madhya Pradesh government to assist those affected by heavy rainfall and flooding. I have spoken to CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and reviewed the situation. I pray for everyone’s safety and well-being,” tweeted the PM. The CM, who conducted an aerial survey, said the situation was grim. Around 1,225 villages in Shivpuri, Sheopur, Datia, Gwalior, Guna, Bhind and Morena districts are reeling from floods, and over 1,400 people still trapped, he said. “They are safe,” he assured. Five bridges in Datia and Seoni districts have collapsed like clay-and-stick structures in the raging floods in the past two days, the most recent of them being built just two months ago under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). Around 150m long, it connected Sonwara and Dhanora areas. Two bridges in Wainganga river in Mahakaushal region collapsed. Thousands of vehicles, mostly trucks, were stranded or diverted due to collapse of bridges and road submergence. Rail services hit hardAnother bridge, connecting Chhapara and Bhimgarh and built by PWD 10 years ago, collapsed due to water released from Bhimgarh Dam, said officials. A bridge on the Sindh river near Sankua broke apart on Wednesday. A viral video shows a bridge on Sindh river near Ratangarh temple, close to Datia town, come crashing down due to the force of the overflowing river. “Two bridges in Datia district collapsed due to flooding. A crack emerged on a bridge over NH3, which has been closed as a precaution,” the CM said. Though no death or injury was reported in these bridge collapses, it did raise questions on their engineering and construction, and leader of opposition Kamal Nath demanded a judicial probe. More than 1,100 people were rescued from 36 villages in Datia by the Army. The CM said that Army, BSF, NDRF and SDRF have together evacuated 5,950 people from 240 villages. IAF resumed rescue ops on Wednesday. Rail services between Shivpuri and Gwalior and telecom services in Morena district have been badly affected. Some villages in Sheopur district are completely submerged, but people are safe. The Army is reaching those villages for rescue operations, the CM said. There was risk of flooding in Bhind and Morena districts as the water level of Chambal river is rising due to heavy showers. The water level will rise further as water was released from a barrage, Chouhan said. Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia too has been trying to help people in Gwalior-Chambal region, coordinating with the defence ministry and CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Scindia expressed gratitude towards the armed forces for helping the MP government in tackling the crisis situation (with agency inputs) Watch MP Floods: 5 bridges collapse; thousands evacuated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-flood-toll-rises-to-14-five-bridges-swept-away-in-2-days/articleshow/85048329.cms||---

While the varsity received a total of 1,512 applications from ICCR, another 45 applications are received from self-supporting foreign nationals. UoH, admits qualified students through government of India agencies such as the ICCR, Study in India, SAARC countries, and self-supporting international students to various courses in the university. Vice-chancellor of UoH professor B Jagadeeshwar Rao expressed happiness at the large number of applications received this year. “UoH is the preferred destination for higher studies for several foreign nationals. We see this as a positive indicator in line with the Institute of Eminence status of the university and NEP 2020,” said Rao. N Siva Kumar, director of international affairs, said the academic units of UoH, after careful consideration selected 129 foreign nationals this year for various courses from the ICCR applications received. To date, 31 students (nine for PhD and 22 for master’s programmes — 13 girls and 18 boys) have already accepted to join UoH, and some more are expected to accept. Students are from nations such as Syria, Yemen, Uganda, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sudan, Jordan, South Africa, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Nepal, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Malawi, Indonesia, Swaziland, Iraq, Botswana, Eritrea among others. “The admission process is still on for self-supporting students’ applications in this academic year, which is likely to increase the number of foreign nationals further in this academic year,” said Kumar adding that this is also a way forward for the IoE programme of the UoH, which aims to increase internationalisation. Besides this, the UoH team also received a European Commission grant entitled ‘Harmony’ for three years on the topic “Strategies for internationalization of Higher Education in Asian countries”, a project coordinated by Kumar, with professors Vinod Pavarala, R Sivaprasad, Prabhakar Rao, Aparna Rayaprol and S Shaji as team members. UoH has a designated new hostel for foreign nationals with 50 single occupancy rooms, and two new international hostel buildings are also under construction. The students who have applied hail from various countries such as Syria, Yemen, Uganda, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sudan, Jordan, South Africa, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Nepal, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Malawi, Indonesia, Swaziland, Iraq, Botswana, and Eritrea among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uoh-sees-5-fold-jump-in-foreign-application-nos/articleshow/85054783.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Needle part stuck in patient’s arm for months removed after surgery||AURANGABAD: A part of a saline syringe needle, which had allegedly remained lodged in the right forearm of a Covid patient even more than three months after his discharge from the civic body-run Meltron Hospital, was removed after surgery recently. Nitin Khande, a 34-year-old farmer from the Davarwadi village in Paithan taluka, said he had been feeling some pain and numbness in his arm after discharge from the hospital. After subsequent diagnostic check at a private hospital, it was found that a part of the syringe was still stuck under the skin of his arm. “I had tested Covid positive on April 18 and got admitted to the Meltron Hospital the very next day. At the time of my discharge from the hospital on April 27, I could feel something in my arm. The hospital authorities, however, ruled out the possibility and asked me to go home,” Khande said on Wednesday. Even after he went home, Khande’s right arm continued to ache. “I started agricultural work after taking rest for a full one month, but the pain in the right arm was almost paralysing. I contacted a private hospital, where a CT-scan showed the presence of a fibre object of nearly 2 inch length in my arm,” he said. Khande again approached the Meltron Hospital. Based on the diagnostics carried out at the private hospital, he was told to get operated on at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Aurangabad. “I could not afford treatment at a private hospital. The Meltron Hospital issued a letter to the GMCH, where a surgery was performed on July 31 to remove the portion of the saline syringe,” he said. Khande has accused hospital authorities of medical negligence and has sought action against the employees concerned. When contacted, in-charge of Metron Hospital Dr Vaishali Mudgadkar said a detailed inquiry would be ordered into the incident. “It is surprising that the patient approached us almost two months after discharge. We do not have an idea whether he needed hospitalisation at any other place during post-Covid recovery or had any other ailment. We will seek all details,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/part-of-needle-stuck-in-patients-arm-for-months-after-discharge-surgically-removed/articleshow/85046127.cms||Prasad Joshi

The step to engage the public in creating awareness has come after considering the laxity among people to follow Covid-19 safety SOPs. As the turnout for vaccination is going down, the health department and the district administration have planned to organize a contest to encourage vaccination. Memes encouraging vaccination, posters promoting personal and public hygiene, short films promoting Covid-19 preventive measures and slogans to sensitise people can be submitted by people irrespective of their age. Health officials said that people can either WhatsApp their submission to 99526-11108 or send a mail to trichycovidcontrol@gmail.com. “The entries must be in Tamil and should not hurt the sentiments of the people. Short films should not exceed five minutes. The submissions must reach us before August 6, 2021,” the officials said. A team of experts will select the best entries in each category to use the same for building awareness among the people to get vaccinated and prevent the spread of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/contests-to-promote-covid-19-awareness/articleshow/85050735.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Take care of kids’ health to atone for overbilling’||KOLKATA: Three units of a hospital chain have been told to conduct free health check-up of underprivileged children and offer free health food to each of the kids attending the camp. The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) on Wednesday directed the AMRI Hospital group to hold such camps, following three complaints of overbilling against each of its three units. The judgment came a day after Belle Vue Clinic gave meals to 170 residents of Little Sisters of the Poor, following a health panel order after a patient, who was treated at the hospital, complained against misbehaviour by some nurses. Last year, WBCERC had directed Medica Superspecialty to provide boiled eggs to malnourished children in Park Circus area after the establishment was found to have violated a Covid advisory. According to the commission on Wednesday, the hospital had billed a patient Rs 28.47 lakh for 25-day treatment at its Dhakuria unit and another one Rs 18.29 lakh for 24-day stay at the Mukndapur unit. The commission, however, did not specify the bill amount of the third patient who availed 15 days’ treatment at the Salt Lake facility. All three patients were aged and required treatment for age-related complications, including long ICU admission, between December 2020 and May this year. The families later lodged complaints against overbilling. “We found the three hospital units had no uniform rate, showing disparity among the three units. During this period, numerous patients had availed of treatment at the three units and we assume, the bills must have been similar in those cases, even if the rest did not lodge any complaint,” said WBCERC chairperson Justice (retired) Ashim Kumar Banerjee. “We direct the three hospital units to organize free paediatric counselling/health check-up at three nearby slums once a week for eight weeks. Each child should be given health food packet. If any child below 12 years is found to need hospital treatment, they must ensure free treatment.” The commission specified Duttabad and Panchanantala/Govindapur and asked the hospital to identify the third slum. The hospital has also been asked to refund part of the treatment bills, collectively adding up to Rs 41,000 to Rs 1.6 lakh. The hospital contested, saying bills were directly proportional to the number of days spent at the facilites and the disease severity; when a patient with complications spent a significant time in a critical care ward, the spectrum of tests and procedures would mean a higher bill. “While we respect the commission’s role in regulating private healthcare providers, we are unable to accept its ruling on the basis of the belief that the bill amount is more important than the number of days a patient spends in a hospital. We find it unfair and unfortunate about commission’s pre-emptive assumption that over-billing is a norm at AMRI Hospitals, even if patients don’t register complaints. Most people get admitted to AMRI because of the service and the exemplary clinical outcome we provide,” said a release from the hospital chain. The hospital is yet to get a copy of the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/take-care-of-kids-health-to-atone-for-overbilling/articleshow/85050805.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Kolkata||Water, food & newspaper corners on WBTC’s long-distance buses||Kolkata: West Bengal State Transport Corporation is all set to standardise the amenities for long-distance buses. The entire standardisation process aims at providing passengers some basic facilities to make their journey comfortable. From August 5, each passenger on the Esplanade to Suri via Bolpur AC Volvo bus will get a free 500ml water bottle during their journey. Additional bottles would be chargeable. Moreover, a small newspaper corner would be provided — newspapers in three languages (Bengali, Hindi and English) will be kept for reading by passengers during their journey. The bus will have a small food corner where passengers can buy packed biscuits and snacks. This service will start on August 5 on one route for trial and later, this will be added to other buses plying on rest of the long distance routes. “This is being done to make the journey a little comfortable,” said MD of WBTC, Rajanvir Singh Kapur. There are plans on free WiFi on these buses in the future. WBTC runs many long distance buses to tourist destinations like Bolpur, Digha, Mayapur and Bakkhali. Since buses are at the centre of the tourism development in Bengal, there is an attempt to standardise the amenities on buses. Otherwise, there is no standard protocol so far as amenities are concerned. “On some buses water bottles are provided while passengers get nothing on some buses. Once this standard operating procedure is ready, it will be applicable for all long distance buses, be it STU or local,” said an official. Despite having a good railway network, many people prefer to travel by bus for various reasons. Since it is always an issue to have a confirmed seat on a train, people have to depend on buses. “We are putting a lot of emphasis on improving the amenities at buses. We keep tabs on the cleanliness of buses. Each bus, be it an AC or non-AC, is getting thoroughly sanitized after completing a trip.

The party has accused the incumbent government of criminal negligence over the issue. On Wednesday, Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni shared a string of videos of the facility with mediapersons. She pointed out 150 fridges, several crucial medicines, and oxygen cylinders are lying unused at a time when people need them the most. “About 90 of these freezers are worth over Rs 90,000... It is a criminal waste of resources,” said Dasauni. A few months ago, BJP legislator from Raipur (Dehradun), Khajan Das, had also highlighted the issue. When queried on the matter, Tripti Bahuguna, director-general, Uttarakhand health and family welfare department, told TOI, “The deep freezers have been purchased ahead of the likely third wave to store vaccines. Some of the freezers have been sent to hill districts, the others will also be transported once the roads in the hills get clear. The rain-related incidents caused a delay in the process as the truck drivers denied ferrying the goods. Meanwhile, the SDRF and district administrations have already been urged to look out for more storage centres where these supplies can be kept safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/medical-essentials-lying-unused-in-the-open-state-govt-indifferent-congress/articleshow/85048348.cms||Kautilya Singh

The delay has irked history enthusiasts who said that the civic body could have left the old structure untouched. Corporation demolished the structure in November 2019 stating that it has weakened and sanctioned Rs 35 lakh to establish two domes at either end of the ghat and develop a public space in a heritage theme. But, even after 21 months, it remains incomplete. “Thillai Nayagam ghat also called Thillairayan ghat was a Nayak-era structure widely used by the residents to take bath. In the name of redevelopment, the authorities have demolished a heritage structure and now, the proposal has not materialised too,” said N Ramakrishnan, founding secretary, MGR Nalpani Mandram. Locals were using the ghats for performing the final rites of those who were cremated at the adjacent Oyamari cremation ground. Ever since the renovation work commenced, garbage was dumped and weeds have grown in the ghat. “We will resume the work soon,” an official said adding that Covid-19 pandemic and fund crunch impacted the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/2-years-on-ghat-redevelopment-put-on-backburner-in-trichy/articleshow/85050690.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MSRTC plans shift from diesel to LNG||Mumbai: The state bus corporation, MSRTC, plans to make its entire fleet of 18,000 buses run on green fuel. It has begun converting 500 of its polluting diesel buses to LNG and has invited bids this week. In phase II, 1,000 buses will be converted into CNG and later 2,700 buses to electric. MSRTC also for the first time floated tenders on Tuesday to procure 500 ordinary buses on wet lease. MSRTC managing director Shekhar Channe said, “Our fleet runs on diesel but we want to switch to green fuel. As per new electric vehicle policy, 15% of our fleet will be converted into electric. Besides, I am pushing for 1,000 buses to have CNG kits installed in the engine. LNG is a new experiment. We will have 500 buses plying across the state on this green fuel.” He stated that the entire fleet will have non-diesel buses, probably by 2022. On availability of LNG, Channe said it will be part of the contract in which the company converting the engine will ensure its availability. “It is a new experiment for our state and we hope more buses are converted to this green fuel,” he said. As for CNG, Mumbai region has close to 270 refuelling outlets, while the government is setting up 1,500 e-charging stations for electric vehicles. Channe said the 500 new wet lease buses will work on a business model in which a private contractor provides the bus with driver and pay for fuel and maintenance, while ST gets ticket box earnings after the monthly lease rent. Channe said the buses on wet lease will be new and will have comfortable seating arrangements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-msrtc-plans-shift-from-diesel-to-lng/articleshow/85053161.cms||Somit Sen

---||Trichy||Now, low turnout for 2nd dose of Covaxin in Trichy||Trichy: Couple of weeks ago, there were crowds and commotion at most of the vaccination camps organized by the district administration in Trichy, but now, the trend has reversed as the back-to-back camps organised to administer the second dose of Covaxin appear deserted. While 10,000 people across the district are eligible to get their second dose of Covaxin, the staff at the camps are returning hundreds of vials each day. This has left the health officials trying alternative plans such as sending text messages to the beneficiaries. Kalaiarangam and Thevar halls in Trichy city that saw a special vaccination drive for people waiting for the second dose of Covaxin on Wednesday saw only 549 people taking the jab. Of the total 200 vials allotted to the two centres, only 54 vials were used. The two centres altogether returned 146 vials of Covaxin. Although more than 13,000 people across the district have crossed the due date to get the second jab, many of them were not turning up at the centres. Health officials claimed that they are unclear as to why there was poor patronage to get the second dose. “We are checking whether there is any lapse in alerting people about the camps. There are thousands of eligible people yet to take their second dose of Covaxin,” a senior health official said. Since the vaccines allotted in recent batches were meant to vaccinate only those waiting for the second dose, health officials are reluctant to use the vials for administering the first dose although there is a huge demand. In Trichy city, while the poor choice of location was cited as the reason for the low footfall, changing the venues have not improved the vaccination status either. “Sending text messages to beneficiaries is planned to increase the turn out for the second dose of vaccination. Even for Covishield, there is a laxity among people to take their second dose,” Dr M Yazhini, city health officer said. Officials are planning to further decentralise the camps with minimal allotment of vials to encourage people to take their second dose near their residences. The daily conduct of vaccination camps was also cited as a reason for people to postpone their vaccination plans as they believe that camps will be organised every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/now-low-turnout-for-2nd-dose-of-covaxin-in-trichy/articleshow/85050770.cms||Deepak Karthik

Other structures come up on airframe and to make it, we have provided a strategic titanium alloy. Some of the requirements have already been met,” Midhani CMD Sanjay Kumar Jha told TOI. It was decided that the needed material would be developed indigenously under the Atmanirbhar Bharat programme, the technology for it was developed at Midhani. While five slabs have been supplied so far, another seven will be supplied in due course for the work that has begun on the AMCA. Midhani has used a similar technology that it used to provide a specialised titanium alloy used in the making of the crew escape system of ISRO’s Gaganyaan programme. When the advance fighter jet becomes a reality, it will be a crucial arrow in the quiver of the Indian Air Force. With AMCA, India will be joining an elite club of countries which have a fifth generation combat aircraft. The plan is to have 120 stealth fighters to give muscle to the IAF and also the Indian Navy. The aircraft design is by Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) under the ministry of defence with DRDO and HAL working on the project. Going by what Indian Air Force chief RKS Bhaduaria said last year, the DRDO has set a target to roll out the AMCA by 2027. In the second phase of the production, sixth generation technologies will be included in the stealth fighter. Also by 2032, the IAF will have at least 18 squadrons of fighter jets if plans were to materialise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/midhani-supplies-titanium-alloy-for-medium-combat-jets-airframe/articleshow/85054821.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The campaign organised at Nagamangalam village saw 28 women, mostly senior citizens learning to record their signature for the first time. As many as 28 teachers from various schools including Crea matriculation school and MGR Nagar school taught the 28 women in Nagamangalam, the Tamil and English alphabets and also to write their names as a handwritten signature. So far, the women were recording their thumb impressions in documents. They were first trained to write their names on a slate, and then made to practice on paper. The teachers also helped them send postcards to the school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi to emulate the voluntary drive in rest of the state. “The women after learning to register their signature feel confident and their self-esteem has improved. They are told to practice writing the names of their family members, some of their grandchildren were insisted to help them,” said K Maruthanayagam, block education officer, Manikandam.  The programme was an outcome of the block education officer’s attempts to make Manikandam a 100% literate block. “We are planning to cover 3,500 more adults under the programme till September 2021,” Maruthanayagam said. Teachers involved in the drive were ensured that they are vaccinated, while the participants were told to wear masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/teachers-spread-literacy-among-rural-women/articleshow/85050812.cms||---

Addressing a news conference, Sakeer said PSC has no right to extend the validity of rank lists. He rejected the allegations that PSC was slow in processing the appointment process owing to Covid-19 emergency. “Being a constitutional organisation, PSC cannot change the laws and rules that govern it. It would be unconstitutional to demand an extension of rank lists to facilitate the selection of a set of candidates who have already figured in a particular rank list. Rank lists have validity. The maximum validity of rank list can be three years. Instead of sticking to unrealistic demands for appointment of all those who figured in the rank list, job seekers should try to obtain better rank in exams to improve their chances for appointment,” he said. The chairman said PSC didn’t consider the protesting candidates as enemies. He said all job applicants should come to terms with reality regarding the validity of rank lists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/psc-chief-demand-for-rank-list-extension-unrealistic/articleshow/85050862.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Lens on trawler design after spate of capsizes||Kolkata: A series of trawler accidents in the Bay of Bengal not very far from the coastline involving mostly vessels from South 24 Parganas has prompted the state fisheries department to look into a possible design flaw in trawlers used in this region that has led to these mishaps. The fisheries department has approached the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT) in Kochi to detect a possible vulnerability in trawlers used in Kakdwip, Frazergunj, Namkhana, Raidighi and other fishing harbours and landing centres in South 24 Parganas and suggest ways to prevent such incidents. While trawlers are used by fishermen in South 24 Parganas as well as East Midnapore, their designs are different. Those used in South 24 Parganas are similar to vessels that ply the waters of Bangladesh and have a V-shaped hull and a narrow bottom. In contrast, the trawlers used in East Midnapore are similar to those used in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh with a U-shaped hull and a wider bottom. Also, these vessels have a wooden beam that runs along the entire length of the base. Bijon Maity of Kakdwip Fishermen’s Association said the number of trawlers that had capsized in South 24 Parganas over the past five years was significantly more than in East Midnapore. While there had been five mishaps in East Midnapore that led to nine deaths, there have been 35 capsizes in South 24 Parganas, leading to 125 deaths. Nearly all the incidents that have been recorded this year have happened between 4am and 6am and around 15-18km from the fishing harbour while the fishermen were returning with the catch. Last Wednesday, the issue was discussed in detail by fisheries minister Akhil Giri, Sunderban affairs minister Bankim Hazra, South 24 Parganas district magistrate P Ulganathan, fisheries additional director (marine) Jayanta Kumar Pradhan and members of fishermen associations. “In most of the incidents near the South 24 Parganas coast, vessels appear to have capsized after hitting a sand bank or silt deposit. We have therefore asked CIFT to look into the issue,” said Pradhan. The difference in shape, traditional vessel manufacturers like Anibas Das say, is more to do with the topography. While fishermen in South 24 Parganas have to negotiate shallow waters in creeks and rivers before hitting the Bay of Bengal, their counterparts in East Midnapore have good draft all the way. The fisheries minister said the government was aware of the enormity of the challenge. “If a design change is suggested, we will have to incorporate it when the permit renewal happens,” Giri said. A trawler costs around Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1 crore. There are around 11,500 deep sea fishing boats in operation in South 24 Parganas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lens-on-trawler-design-after-spate-of-capsizes/articleshow/85050845.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

Over 5,000 people have been killed and around 7 crore displaced between 2003-2018 in the country due to the extreme weather event. This came to the fore in the ‘Global Flood Database’, which has been released by Cloud To Street — a global flood tracking and risk analytics platform, with co-authors from NASA, Google Earth Outreach, and reputed international universities. At a time when the country has been hit by severe floods, the data is alarming and a matter of concern. According to the database, India featured quite high, both on observed and predicted population exposed to floods. Researchers stated that most flood events were caused by heavy rainfall, followed by tropical storms or surges, snow or ice melt, and dam breaks. Analysis of the data reveals that out of ten major floods in the country since nearly two decades, nine have been caused due to heavy rainfall and one due to tropical storm. “Guwahati, an urbanizing town on the Brahmaputra River, has repeatedly been exposed to flooding over the past two decades,” the report stated. Based on satellite observations of actual flooding over the past two decades, the database further highlighted that the proportion of population exposed to floods has grown by 24% globally since the turn of the century. “This rise is ten times higher than scientists previously thought — due to both increased flooding and population migration. This marks an increase of population inside flood-prone regions up to 86 million people,” analysis added. The database also makes it evident that nearly 90% of flood events occurred in South and Southeast Asia, with the large basins including Indus, Ganges-Brahmaputra, and Mekong. “Population growth in flooded areas is driven by people moving into flood-prone areas — and economic development in those regions. Vulnerable populations often have no choice but to settle in flood zones,” said researchers. As per their estimation, climate and demographic change will add 25 new countries to the 32 already experiencing increasing floods by 2030. “More people and assets are impacted by flooding than any other climate-fuelled disaster, which in turn keeps poor countries poor and drives up the price of food and housing everywhere,” said Bessie Schwarz, CEO and co-founder of Cloud To Street. Recalling past crisis, researchers pointed out how the collapse of the Koshi Barrage left over 3 million people homeless in Bihar in August 2008. “These incidents illustrate the increasingly deadly cost of failing infrastructure,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/floods-killed-5k-displaced-7-cr-in-15-years-in-india-study/articleshow/85069625.cms||Manka Behl

Rest of the infants would be under medical care due to various reasons. Such a high rate of compliance has become a reality because of the shared responsibility of all staff in creating awareness among the mothers,” Dr Senthilkumar told ToI.In order to reach the higher level of compliance to breastfeeding, organisations such as Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Trichy, NNF, Trichy, the Trichy Obstetric and Gynaecological Society, Indian Medical Association, Trichy, Department of Paediatrics of KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College attached to MGMGH, Trichy, Integrated Child Development Scheme, Ekam Foundation, Trichy Metro Rotary Club and Trichy Metro Inner wheel Club organised a series of awareness programmes from August 1- 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/experts-insist-on-increasing-breastfeeding-compliance/articleshow/85050858.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||80% vaccine to be kept for those due to take 2nd dose||Kolhapur: Kolhapur district collector Rahul Rekhawar has asked the vaccination authorities to ensure 80% Covid vaccine doses are reserved for beneficiaries who have their second dose due. The remaining 20% will be kept for those who are yet to take the first dose.Till now, there was no such policy. Only those above 45 years of age were given the priority for vaccination. Among them, those above 60 years old with comorbidity were given the first priority followed by healthcare workers, frontline workers.Now with the number of beneficiaries awaiting their second dose, Rekhawar has taken this decision.Rekhawar said, “I have asked the vaccination nodal officers to make doses available for those, who have completed 84 days after taking the first dose, at the earliest. Around 80% of doses must be reserved for the second dose, which means the priority should be to fully vaccinate beneficiaries who have completed 84 days. The rest of the 20% available doses should be utilised for first dose vaccination. Also, pregnant women should be vaccinated for the first dose. Camps should be held at village level to vaccinate the bed-ridden citizens.”Hence, the number of doses available to vaccinate the younger population will be less. Therefore, the administration has postponed vaccination of those between 18 and 44 years of age in rural areas.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Letter against govt’s plan for Sabarmati Gandhi Ashram||AHMEDABAD: Over 130 eminent personalities including retired high court judges, social activists, writers, artists and filmmakers on Wednesday opposed the government’s Rs 1,200 crore proposal to redevelop Sabarmati Gandhi Ashram precinct. An open letter signed by them reads, “The proposed plan severely compromises and trivializes the sanctity and importance of the present-day Ashram, mainly Hriday Kunj, surrounding buildings, and the museum.” The personalities include filmmaker Anand Patwardhan, historians Ramachandra Guha, Rajmohan Gandhi, retired high court judge Justice A P Shah, writer Nayantara Sahgal, journalist P Sainath, carnatic singer T M Krishna among others. It adds that the, “Hriday Kunj, other historical buildings, and present museums, even if they remain untouched, will no longer be central but pushed into a corner by the new museum, amphitheatre, food courts, shops, etc.” While mentioning the aspect of access to the Ashram precinct it states, “Lakhs of Indians, specially school children, as well foreign visitors come to Sabarmati Ashram every year. The place has never needed a ‘world-class’ makeover to attract tourists. The charisma of Gandhi along with the authenticity and simplicity of the place has been enough.” The letter further states, “The proposed plan at best envisions a ‘Gandhi theme park’ and at worst ‘a second assassination’.” Towards the end the letter registers a collective opposition to, “ a government takeover of Gandhian institutions,” and has urged the government to continue to use public money for proper maintenance and upkeep of such institutions, in consultation with Gandhians, historians and archivists from India and around the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/letter-against-govts-plan-for-ashram/articleshow/85053237.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: NeXT aims to replace MBBS finals, NEET-PG, FMGE||AHMEDABAD: To be held on the lines of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), the National Medical Council aims to conduct National Exit Test (NeXT) for final year MBBS students from 2023. The NeXT will replace the final year undergraduate examination and will also be the basis for admission to postgraduate specialty courses, replacing the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (PG). Students who clear the exam will be granted a licence to practice modern medicine in India and for enrolment in the state medical register or the national medical register, as the case may be, according to M K Ramesh, president of the Postgraduate Medical Education Board. It will also form the basis of admissions to PG medical courses. “To be a medical practitioner in the US, one has to clear the medical licensing exam. We want to reduce the burden of multiple examinations and at the same time introduce world class standards,” said Ramesh. NeXT also aims to solve the problem of foreign medical graduates, it as it will be the same for everyone whether trained in India or any part of the world. “The details of how to conduct the exam across the country, which includes practical examinations, are being worked out. A mock run is being planned for 2022,” he further said. State medical education fraternity experts have expressed apprehensions over NeXT replacing MBBS final exams and say the move may prove detrimental to the state’s efforts to have more doctors available. The recent pandemic has underscored the need for more doctors in the state, especially in rural areas. “Being a national-level competitive test, NeXT could prove tough for students of Gujarat to crack compared to the existing university-level exams,” said the dean of an Ahmedabad medical college. “The final MBBS success rate in the state is around 90%. This means that every year, the majority of students who pass can register and practise medicine. However, we have serious apprehensions if so many students will be able to clear NeXT every year. Moreover, MBBS finals are held twice a year while NeXT will be held only once,” said another senior medical fraternity member. The National Exit Test marks shall remain valid for three years from the date the person has become eligible to be granted a licence to practice, for admission to postgraduate broad specialty courses, according to the Draft Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations 2021. After the expiry of the validity of the National Exit Test marks, the person shall have to take it and qualify again to be eligible for admission to postgraduate broad specialty courses, it said. For admission to postgraduate super-specialty courses, a uniform entrance examination, the National Eligibility–cum-Entrance Test (Super Specialty), will be held each academic year and under the supervision of the National Medical Commission, according to the draft regulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/next-aims-to-replace-mbbs-finals-neet-pg-fmge/articleshow/85053367.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Angry restaurant owners to hold silent march on Tuesday||Owners of restaurants, bars and hotels across Maharashtra have decided to hold a silent protest march on August 10 if the state does not restore their original operation timings or at least ease the 4pm deadline for dining-in till 10pm. The resolution came at a joint meeting of all the hotel associations and their apex bodies in the state. In Thane, restaurant owners went a step further and announced on Wednesday that they will remain shut from next week if the restricted deadline is not eased. In nearby Vasai, Virar, Boisar, Palghar and Dahanu, around 200 hoteliers organised a silent protest, holding placards outside their facilities. “A majority of our members are strained financially as there is no relaxation in taxes or overheads like paying for accommodation and salaries of staff. We will approach the Thane municipal commissioner seeking extension of the 4pm operating limits for dining-in or shut down from next week,” Raghunath Rai, secretary of the Hotel Association of Thane, told TOI.The frustration is more acute as shops have been allowed to stay open till 10pm. “We feel the state has discriminated against us when it allowed other sectors to open,” added Rai.A delegation from the Vasai Taluka Hotel Association submitted a memorandum to the district collector. “The hospitality industry is on the brink of collapse. We are not allowed to operate our businesses but are expected to pay the government taxes,” said Nagraj Shetty, member, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India.The hotel industry, already battered by the pandemic, is worried about the coming Shravan season that has traditionally seen a drop in business. Brijesh Sharma, owner of Shelter hotel in Thane’s Naupada, said: “I will shut my restaurant for 15 days. I am asking my staff to either return to their villages or stay back without salary till the situation eases. I’m unable to bear the losses anymore.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-angry-restaurant-owners-to-hold-silent-march-on-tuesday/articleshow/85053272.cms||Manoj Badgeri

---||Kolkata||Salt Lake, New Town may get monthly power bills before Puja||KOLKATA: If all goes according to plan, residents of Salt Lake and New Town will receive electricity bills every month instead of once every three months later this year. State additional chief secretary (power) S Suresh Kumar has set the ball rolling with a letter to state power watchdog West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (WBERC), asking it to ensure that West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Co Ltd (WBSEDCL) switches from the existing quarterly billing system to the monthly format. “All services — telecom, internet and power provided by other utilities — are billed every month. WBSEDCL followed the quarterly cycle because the WBERC’s regulations that set performance standards of power utilities do not define the term ‘billing cycle’. The government has now directed WBERC to clearly define the billing period as one month for all consumers and has asked the latter to work out a transition plan,” a power department official said. Electricity bills in Kolkata, served by private utility CESC, are generated every month. Officials at WBSEDCL said the switchover from a billing system that had been followed since 1955 was fraught with difficulty and posed multiple challenges, including the requirement for the outsourced agency to recruit more meter readers, appointment of cashiers at the 538 WBSEDCL cash collection centres across the state, making changes in the billing software and printing thrice the number of bills. “WBSEDCL supplies power to the remotest hamlets and covers from the Hills to the sea. Only Kolkata and its suburbs and pockets of Durgapur and Burnpur are serviced by others. So, the task is humongous and financial ramifications are huge,” an official said. The state Assembly’s standing committee on power and non-conventional energy sources, which deliberated on the issue, countered that not only was disparity in the WBSEDCL’s billing system glaring when compared to the standard practice followed by other utilities, it also led to anomalies in the computation of bills, as per the rate slabs that went against consumer interest. “This has also led to a default rate of 20.5% that is not a very healthy reflection on the system,” a power department official pointed out. At present, WBSEDCL’s technical and commercial loss accounts for nearly Rs 250 crore per month. Acknowledging the challenges in the switchover, the power department has advised the utility to start with Salt Lake and New Town some time before Durga Puja and gradually add the urban centres first, followed by semi-urban and then, rural consumers. “A start has to be made. The sooner the better. We will try to initiate it before this Puja, and then roll out elsewhere,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-new-town-may-get-monthly-power-bills-before-puja/articleshow/85050941.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Her advocate Yug Chaudhary argued that judge K D Vadane’s order was illegal as he was not notified as special judge under the NIA Act. He also submitted that upon expiry of 90 days of detention there was no valid or lawful order extending time for filing of chargesheet and hence Bhardwaj was entitled to default bail. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni reiterated the special NIA court would hear a case only after it is taken over by NIA and not during the pre-trial stage. He said until then the sessions court has jurisdiction to pass necessary orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sudha-default-bail-plea-hc-reserves-order-in-mumbai/articleshow/85056337.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||1, 2 ka 4: Babus get mandate to further segregate waste in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: On Tuesday afternoon many in the babudom — in Gandhinagar — were surprised by a two-page notice that was rolled into their door grills. The notice from the Gandhinagar municipal commissioner Dhaval Patel stated that households will be required to compulsorily segregate their domestic waste into four categories. “While we are struggling with two bins, now we are asked to segregate waste into four. But is our municipal waste management system ready for this?” asked a senior official with the civil supplies department. “Also the notice has warned that waste collection will be stalled if any residential area fails to comply with the new rules,” said the officer. People who had left their dustbins outside for collection saw colour coded stickers on them. The new norm suggests that the dry waste now needs to be segregated into three bins — blue bins for milk pouches, newspapers; red bins for sanitary pads, napkins and diapers and black bins for medical waste like medicine bottles, syringes pills and similar items. The green bins are for household kitchen waste. The system was adopted in Lucknow in January this year. On Tuesday afternoon, municipal sanitation department workers visited societies to paste stickers on the bins. “How much time do we have to switch to the new system is not mentioned. We understand that the 2016 waste segregation rules require us to segregate waste into four. But we need a little time to adjust to new system,” said Ajit Solanki, owner of a printing business in Gandhinagar. Municipal commissioner Dr Dhaval Patel in his notice clearly states, “We request citizens to segregate their waste as desired by law. This is compulsory or else our staff may be forced terminate door-to-door waste collection from societies and residential clusters that fail to abide by the notification.” The success of the new waste collection norms in Gandhinagar is being closely monitored by the state urban development department, especially among senior government staff in the capital city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/1-2-ka-4-babus-get-mandate-to-further-segregate-waste/articleshow/85053380.cms||---

Melroy Dante, Apoorva Kelkar and Madhushree Khursange — all of them aged around 21 — were part of a five-member group that came to Rishikesh on vacation on August 1. Melroy, Apoorva and Madhushree were all studying at Thakur Polytechnic in Kandivali East. Initial information said they were residents of Borivali East. A police officer investigating the incident said the two other students who survived were too shaken to give out "proper details". On Wednesday afternoon, the friends who were staying in a riverside hotel in Tapovan, went to explore a stretch of Ganga near the property. While three of them decided to take a swim, the other two — Nisha Goswami and Karan Mishra — stayed at the banks. “It happened so fast. Apoorva had waded deep into the water and slipped. The other two swam towards her and within minutes all of them were caught in strong currents and disappeared. We couldn’t do anything as there was no one else at the spot,” Karan is believed to have told the police. A search operation to find the trio was called off by evening as the river swelled up due to heavy rain. Station house officer (SHO) at Muni ki Reti, Kamal Mohan Singh Bhandari, told TOI, that the search operation would continue on Thursday. “The parents have been informed, they will be coming to Rishikesh,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/3-mumbai-students-disappear-in-swirling-ganga-at-rishikesh/articleshow/85048535.cms||MS Nawaz

The labourers comprised seven males and seven females, including a 72-year-old woman. Four children were rescued too. There were 18 workers and four children, but four of the workers decided to continue with the work they were engaged for. South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal said that the matter has been referred to the labour department. Goa-based anti-human trafficking NGO Anyay Rahit Zindagi (ARZ), alleged that each worker was being paid only Rs 300 at the end of each week and that they often had to go hungry due to lack of money to purchase essentials. It further claimed that the workers lived in tin-sheet huts near the railway track amid unhygienic conditions and without proper toilet facilities. In dire straits, the labourers apprised their relatives back home of their worsening condition, prompting the latter to reach out to the National Adivasi Solidarity Council (NASC) — a foundation for sustainable development from Hyderabad — for help. Acting on a complaint filed by a NASC team with assistance from ARZ on Monday morning, the South Goa collector directed the Quepem deputy collector Nilesh Daigodkar to immediately rescue the labourers. An inspection was consequently carried out in the presence of a labour officer, the Quepem police, NASC and ARZ on Wednesday. All the labourers were shifted to a safe place at Tilamoll and will be sent back to their home state by train. “The sub-contractor was found to be paying only Rs 200 per labourer, per day instead of the minimum wages of Rs 430. During the inspection, the sub-contractor paid them Rs 2.3 lakh as arrears,” Daigodkar told TOI. He further said that Track and Towers Infratech Ltd had been awarded the tender for railway double-tracking at Assolda, but the labourers were employed by a sub-contractor. Stating that theirs was a clear case of human trafficking as they were not allowed to go home, ARZ member Arun Pandey told TOI that the NGO would file a case against the sub-contractor upon receiving the deputy collector’s inquiry report. He also demanded that the sub-contractor’s licence be cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-rescues-14-telangana-labourers-living-in-squalor-at-assolda/articleshow/85053414.cms||Johnny M

Health authorities said the number of daily positive cases is declining, and those getting cured and discharged is increasing with every passing day.District health officer Yogesh Sale said, “The large case load from rural district is reducing since last one week. Despite floods, we ensured testing remains high. Currently, we test around 10,500 swabs every day. The recovery rate is increasing. It may remain constant for some time before the Covid situation eases out in the district.”Every day, the Kolhapur district is reporting 350 to 400 cases. Last week, the average cases were 600 to 800 per day. The case load from Kolhapur city too have dropped. On Wednesday, Kolhapur city reported 122 cases, lowest so far since the Covid cases reached peak. The district administration has started mass testing campaign in around 280 villages, which have more than five active cases. One person from each family is being tested. If the person tests positive, then the close contacts are tested and isolated. “We have increased vaccination in the rural parts of the district. It is the only way to get the Covid situation under control. We want citizens to come forward to get the jab and shun the vaccine hesitancy,” added Sale.Meanwhile, Kolhapur district reported 381 fresh cases and 20 Covid deaths on Wednesday. Satara district added 618 cases and 28 Covid deaths. In Sangli district, 628 people tested positive while 25 patients succumbed to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/covid-recovery-rate-up-by-5-in-a-week-in-kolhapur-district/articleshow/85046550.cms||---

According to police, the woman, Srutidipta Guha Biswas (40), lay lifeless on the floor, while the man, Debasis Dasgupta (45), was found hanging from the ceiling fan. Cops found a suicide note where they said they were ending their lives due to financial distress. Police said the woman had ligature marks on her neck and that Dasgupta might have murdered her before taking his own life. Police said they had booked the flat for one and a half months through an app on rented property. They had told the landlord they were in a relationship and had come from Chennai after a family dispute. They were to vacate the flat on Wednesday and return to Chennai, the flat owner told cops. According to cops, the man hailed from Khardah and the woman was from Cooch Behar. “The caretaker saw the man around 2.30pm. They were to vacate the flat by afternoon. But when they didn’t leave, he rang the bell but to no avail. The TV and AC were on. He switched off the power supply but when there was no response, he alerted the flat owner,” said a police officer.

In addition, a number that was earlier registered in the name of Justice Arun Mishra, who has retired, was also added to the list in 2019, said the report. Besides, there were names of some lawyers involved in high-profile cases, it added. The numbers of N K Gandhi and T I Rajput, who were in the writ section of the SC registry, were alleged to have been on the list. But there was no forensic examination of their phones as they are no longer using the phones, which were with them when their names were allegedly added to the list in the spring of 2019.

---||Goa||Goa govt hikes cab fares by Rs 3/km||PANAJI: Transport minister Mauvin Godinho said on Wednesday that owing to the increase in fuel prices, the state government has decided to grant taxi operators a fare hike of Rs 3 per km. “I had promised a reasonably good increase, whether it is yellow-and-black cabs or tourist taxi operators in Goa,” he said. “The notification has been issued and will be included in the gazette on Thursday. This is a huge relief for Goa’s taxi operators’ community.” Director of transport Rajan Satardekar said that the revision was needed due to the increase in operating cost as well as the cost of living. The last fare fixation was done in 2014, when the operators were getting Rs 21 on the first km. Transport officials said that this hike of Rs 3 will also correspond to subsequent km. “This is a uniform rise across all rates, and Rs 3 is the standard rate for all types of taxis,” an official said. “For instance, from Rs 21 earlier, the taxi operators will now get Rs 24 for the first km and this will follow for the subsequent km. The fare has been increased uniformly for both,” the transport officer said. The rates will be implemented as soon as the order is published in the government gazette. Taxi operators in the state had demanded an increase in existing fare rates as one of the conditions for the installation of digital fare meters in their vehicles. The transport department in May had issued a public notice inviting feedback from stakeholders on the revision of taxi fares in Goa. Following which, the fare rates were revised accordingly. Union leaders of both tourist cabs and yellow and black taxis said that they are yet to see the revised rates, and will react to the hike when they do.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-govt-hikes-cab-fares-by-rs-3/km/articleshow/85053443.cms||Nida Sayed

The place will be developed into an art and science innovation museum for children called ‘Khoj’, a project initiated by the state government’s Gujarat CSR Authority. The project will be executed by Manthan Educational Programme Society (MEPS). The museum will be dynamic and focus on connecting science, art and innovation by means of participatory displays, inquiry-based activities and inquisitiveness-based explorations, claims a concept note from MEPS. The museum will tackle communicating complex issues like coping with climate change, plastic play, reconnecting with our soil, understanding complexity of water, life and sustainability. The concept note explains, “Unlike a regular museum having placards like ‘Please Do Not Touch’, at KHOJ, visitors are encouraged to interact, participate, play and explore different exhibits and concepts.” . It further adds, “The main philosophy of the museum is that the children should have fun and build inquisitiveness while exploring the exhibitions, in the process they will learn and understand different concepts in-depth and further building their own small movements to promote the concept of innovation.” The museum defuses the boundaries between subjects and focuses on the theme and further connecting it with daily lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/old-art-gallery-to-assume-new-avatar-for-kids/articleshow/85053541.cms||---
---||Delhi||To beat test delay, Hindu Rao hosp to get RT-PCR lab||New Delhi: In anticipation of a third wave of Covid-19, North Delhi Municipal Corporation will develop an in-house RT-PCR laboratory that can cater to its fever clinics. Till now, the samples were collected in a fever clinic and sent to National Centre for Disease Control. TOI had earlier reported how tests of even healthcare workers were delayed due to long pendency in NCDC. The standing committee chairman of the civic body, Jogi Ram Jain, said that the lab would provide relief to a large number of residents and patients who visit the biggest municipal hospital. “An RT-PCR testing lab and centre will be opened in Hindu Rao Hospital. The electrification work of the site is likely to be completed by Friday,” he added. So far, no municipal hospital has an in-house RT-PCR testing facility. “Based on feedback from people, we have decided to open an RT-PCR centre in the medical college building of the hospital. We expect that the machines for testing will be set up by Sunday,” Jain said. A civic official said that the centre would be able to carry out the tests by next week. The official further said that initially the RT-PCR centre would be able to carry out tests of 200 individuals on a daily basis. “Most of the patients who come to Hindu Rao Hospital for treatment are from economically vulnerable backgrounds and they cannot afford private labs. This facility will provide relief to such patients,” the official stated. “We had earlier started the sample collection in dedicated fever clinics in the Covid section. The samples were sent to NCDC and it would take 3-4 days for results to come. At some points, when NCDC was overwhelmed with samples, the testing time had increased further.” Jain said that a similar facility would be later developed in Rajan Babu and Kasturba hospitals too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/to-beat-test-delay-hindu-rao-hosp-to-get-rt-pcr-lab/articleshow/85082315.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The first phase will be from September 4 to September 10 and the second phase will be from September 14 to September 20. State higher and technical education minister Uday Samant made the announcement on Wednesday in Pune. The minister also announced the dates for the other CETs. While education faculty related CETs will start from August 26, those for law courses are slated to start from September 16. The CETs for admission to MBA, MCA, MArch and hotel management courses will begin from August 26. However, the minister clarified that these are tentative dates and subject to change if the pandemic situation changes in the state. Samant said the CET cell was told to increase the number of examination centres to ensure that they are not overcrowded. “As opposed to the previous years when there were around 250 exam centres, the number will be increased by 100 to 150 centres,” he said. Minister for reopening of colleges from forthcoming academic yearSamant said he wants colleges in the state to reopen physically from this academic year but there will not be a blanket decision about it. “The director of technical and higher education has been told to take a review of all districts by talking to the district collectors. Once their report about the Covid-19 situation in the particular district is in, we will take a decision on reopening after discussions with the disaster management authority. We will also try to speed up vaccination among college-going students either by using corporate social responsibility funds or the funds available with the university,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/engineering-cet-in-2-phases-from-sept-4-more-exam-centres-added/articleshow/85051096.cms||Ardhra Nair

On August 2, TOI had reported that Gajesh is manager of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency. “It is a very proud moment for us at People’s because one of our students Gajesh has achieved a lot in the IT sector and has become a superstar in this field. He has developed softwares for cryptocurrency,” said Rahul Deshpande, trustee, People’s High School, Panaji. Gajesh, 13, has developed PolyGaj and StableGaj, two Dapps or decentralised applications on Polygon Network which provide access to crypto investing. PolyGaj has managed more than $7 million in cryptocurrency. “Gajesh has done wonders. I am sure there are a lot of people in this country who are hungry to tap this kind of a resource. Today, real jewels of Goa are people like Gajesh. Goa government should come out with a system which taps this talent at a very young age and start supporting them. They should create mentors within Goa for persons like Gajesh,” said Kunkolienkar, after felicitating the teenager. Gajesh said what attracted him to the cryptocurrency sector is that in decentralised finance one can be of any region or age and still build products. “I am happy and proud. Let us not wait on things. This should be taken forward and ultimately this should contribute to the economy of India,” said Gajesh’s father Siddhivinayak Naik, a Goa civil services officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/peoples-high-school-honours-gajesh-for-developing-app-for-managing-cryptocurrency/articleshow/85053447.cms||---
---||Goa||Don’t drop guard & masks, Goa experts warn fully jabbed||PANAJI: Sounding a note of caution to those fully vaccinated against Covid-19, health experts have warned of breakthrough infections and even of them being silent transmitters of the coronavirus to vulnerable sections of the population, including unvaccinated children, if they don’t continue to wear masks and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. With restrictions being lifted and a third wave of the pandemic looming, people must protect themselves from breakthrough infections (when a person contracts Covid-19 even after receiving both vaccine doses) due to newer strains, experts said. “Fully vaccinated persons, if infected, are more likely to have mild or asymptomatic infections and may also silently transmit the infection to their children, elderly and vulnerable persons in their close contact apart from precipitating community transmission,” said professor and head of department of community medicine at the GMC, Dr Jagadish Cacodcar. To date, 88.2% of Goa’s eligible population (18 years old and above) has taken at least one dose of the vaccine. However, only 23.5% are fully vaccinated. “There is a need to explore all possible, permissible ways to ensure that maximum eligible persons receive their second dose by their due date, especially all those who come in close contact with the unvaccinated and the vulnerable, including children under 18 years,” Cacodcar said. Stating that it is not clear how the vaccine will respond to new variants of Covid-19, state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said, “People must be cautious for the next few weeks to protect themselves and their communities. With festivals around the corner, we must control ourselves.” Cacodcar, who is also the member-secretary of the state’s expert committee and task force on Covid-19, said crowded gatherings cannot be allowed. “All religious and sociocultural gatherings, including Ganesh Chaturthi, have to be held with Covid-appropriate behaviour. It is evident from at least eight states, including neighbouring Kerala and Karnataka, that laxity in enforcement of Covid control norms at festivals and large gatherings of any nature have resulted in the re-emergence of the second wave,” he said. The severity of the condition depends on the person who is being infected and their state of health. “Although breakthrough infections are said to be milder in those that are fully vaccinated, they can still transmit Covid-19 to a weak person who may not have the tolerance to fight back. We don’t know who we may infect and that’s why people have to continue to be careful,” said Ayush doctor at the South Goa district hospital, Rita Vaz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-drop-guard-masks-experts-warn-fully-jabbed/articleshow/85053421.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Bidhannagar police said more than 100 small and big eatery owners have been prosecuted in the last one week as cops continue the raids everyday between 8pm and 11pm to ensure the eateries are closing down offline business by that time and also that no customers hang around the shops post 8pm — the prescribed closing time for eateries by the state government. “We were getting complaints that several eateries in Salt Lake, New Town, Lake Town and other areas in the commissionerate were operating beyond the mandatory closing hour. We have started a drive to ensure Covid protocol is maintained,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.  Cops said there had been complaints from residents around City Centre II, New Town bus stand, Chinar Park, Baguiati, Salt Lake City Centre about eateries remaining open well after the closing hours.

Chairman of the admission committee 2021, directorate of technical education (DTE), Dipak Gaitonde said that both online and offline modes will be open to students for the process. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the DTE began accepting forms for admissions to first year and second year direct entry to diploma programme seats. “Earlier, admission forms for diplomas were being accepted only at the DTE office in Porvorim for North Goa and the Ravindra Bhavan in Margao for South Goa. This year, to be able to maintain social distancing because of the pandemic, forms are being accepted at four centres, to spread students across different centres so that Covid protocols are followed,” Gaitonde said. He said that a similar increase in centres to accept admission forms for professional degree programme seats is also being considered. The centres where diploma forms will be accepted are Government Polytechnics in Bicholim and Curchorem, the DTE office, and Agnel Polytechnic in Verna. Diploma forms can be submitted by students up to August 13, Gaitonde said. “We are likely to start accepting forms for degree admission from August 9 or 10, the centres for which will be announced shortly,” he said. The results of the Goa Common Entrance Test were declared on Tuesday.

The former higher education and minority affairs minister also alleged that the illegal activities were being undertaken with the help of former PWD minister VK Ebrahim Kunju. Jaleel said that Kunhalikutty’s son Hasique Pandikadavath has black money in his account in AR Nagar cooperative bank in Malappuram. He also released a copy of the list of names apparently by the IT department, of which the first name is that of Kunhalikutty’s son. The claims that the account of Hasique is an NRI account is a lie and the enforcement directorate (ED) sleuths have identified deposits of Rs 110 crore in the bank account, of which only Rs 7 crore was withdrawn using proper documents, Jaleel said. He said that no convincing documents could be produced for the remaining money, and the financial dealings of Kunhalikutty and his son are dubious. Releasing a copy of the notice issued by ED sleuths to IUML supremo Panakkad Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal, who is also the chairman and managing director of M/s Muslim Printing and Publishing Company Ltd, Jaleel said that Thangal was interrogated by the ED sleuths at his residence in Panakkad after he failed to appear before them despite serving notices twice. “The notice was served to HyderAli Shihab Thangal after Kunhalikutty tried to legalize Rs 10 crore of black money with the help of Ebrahim Kunju. After the ED found out about it, Rs 7.5 crore was withdrawn by remitting Rs 2.5 crore as fine,” Jaleel said. He said that the IUML leadership was responsible for drawing Hyder Ali Shihab Thangal into such a case. Meanwhile, accepting that the ED sleuths had met Thangal, Kunhalikutty said that he was not interrogated by the ED but had only sought some clarity on certain matters. He also said that all the allegations against him and his son are baseless, and all his transactions are transparent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kunhalikutty-laundered-money-jaleel/articleshow/85051181.cms||---

PCMC’s municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil, in a statement, said, “Today’s skills will not necessarily match the jobs of tomorrow, which means that people will have to increasingly learn new skills to remain employable throughout their working life. Thus, we have to think for the next 10-12 years.

More than 230 deaths were reported between January and June 2019. The figure reduced by 39% to 141 fatalities in the same period last year. But between January and June 2021, the number of road crash deaths rose to 159-- a 13% upswing-- which enforcement agencies attribute to higher pedestrian and vehicular movement compared to full lockdown. With increasing needs for social distancing, restricted railway travel, and the continuing pandemic crisis, Mumbai must make a conscious effort to promote a mode shift to walking and cycling, instead of prioritising cars, say experts. "With an increase in personal vehicles on streets post lockdown, it is imperative that Mumbai adopts electronic enforcement to nab offenders. The other challenge is that revised traffic penalties are yet to be implemented in Maharashtra and the intended deterrent effect is lost," said Piyush Tewari, CEO of the non-profit, Save Life Foundation. According to police data, non-fatal crashes have surged by 41% from 673 crashes in January-June 2020 to 946 crashes this year. Road crashes impose a severe economic burden on the survivors, particularly for lower income groups. A latest World Bank report showed that the financial loss for the poor, following a road crash, amounted to more than seven months' household income, while it was equivalent to less than one month's income for rich households. "Good street design is the best tool to enforce safe speeds and reduce crashes. Mumbai can start to widen pedestrian infrastructure through simple measures such as curb extensions and wider sidewalks, which not only allow more space for social distancing but also increases visibility for all road users," said Abhimanyu Prakash, Senior Program Manager with US-based National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), that has worked on road safety projects in Mumbai in partnership with the Bloomberg Initiative for Global Road Safety (BIGRS). "Cities around the world are starting to invest more in public transport through increasing the number of buses and their frequency. Using school buses while the schools remain closed is also a great way to increase bus service across the city," he said. With restrictions easing this year, Delhi also witnessed a spike in fatalities. The administration has started to train policemen in basic trauma care skills to provide onsite care to victims and retrain bus drivers. "Ambulance response time is being brought down from 55 minutes to 20 minutes," said Tewari, whose non-profit is partnering with the administration. "Bogota, London, and Paris are examples of how urban mobility is being rethought with a rapid rollout of low-cost walking and cycling infrastructure. Cities such as Kochi and Bengaluru are creating better footpaths and cycle tracks that Mumbai could learn from," said Arnab Bandyopadhyay, Lead Transport Specialist with the World Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-road-crashes-fatalities-climb-again-after-20-lockdown-slump/articleshow/85053475.cms||Nitasha Natu

The state directorate of vocational education (DVET) has announced that after students receive their board exam mark sheets on August 9, the online procedure for processing admissions and announcement of rounds will begin.Till the mark sheets are distributed, DVET is expecting more enrolments for the courses. Up to August 2, the registrations had crossed 1.2 lakh in Maharashtra. Principal of ITI, Aundh, Prakash Sayagaonkar, said, “Since the admissions are based on SSC results, there will be a very good response like every year. For FYJC, students have to undergo an entrance test, so we are anticipating that many would go for ITIs.”Patil said, “During this pandemic, many students preferred to undertake skill courses at ITI which range from one to three years and start their own businesses and become self-employed. Motor mechanics, diesel mechanic, electrician, fitter, welder, refrigeration are among some vocational courses that always find good takers. If the students are unable to find jobs, they can easily start their own set-ups and regenerate employment for themselves.”Student Vishal Dalvi said, “I had already decided to take admission for ITI despite the marks scored in SSC. My father runs a garage, so I have decided to get into the same line.”Another student Vaibhav Kale, who has registered online for admissions to Aundh ITI, said, “I am also attempting the FYJC entrance, but my inclination is towards some new age courses like robotics, artificial intelligence among others at ITIs which I will be aiming for during admissions. If I don’t get a college of my choice then my last option will be FYJC admission through CET.”Another student, Shweta Patil, has also applied for ITI admissions and for FYJC entrance. Patil said, “Depending on my marks in the entrance and which college my name is listed in, I shall take further decisions about admissions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/online-process-for-itis-after-getting-score-sheets/articleshow/85051119.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Last month, the court had refused to issue notice on the petition after noting that the deputy chief minister and some unknown entities had been named as respondents.Senior advocate Arun Mohan told the court that an amended memo had been filed after deleting the parties. “There are a number of other legal challenges as well, including facilitating of a monopolistic cartel; while debarring the non-super-rich and thus killing all competition. In a way it seeks to restore the zamindari system of the British era (for land revenue) and which was abolished once the Constitution came into the force on 26.01.1950,” the petition said.The court had, last month, refused to stay the new Excise Policy on the petition by Readymade Plaza India Pvt Ltd, a group of retail liquor vendors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-new-excise-policy-similar-to-zamindari-system/articleshow/85051144.cms||---

The state irrigation department on Wednesday increased the water release from the Khadakwasla dam to 5,136 cusec to accommodate the rainwater flowing into the reservoirs. The collective storage in the four dams — Temghar, Varasgaon, Khadakwasla and Panshet — in the Khadakwasla circle surged to 94.4% on Wednesday evening. Stock in the Varasgaon and Temghar reservoirs increased to 92% and 82% of their respective capacities. Wednesday’s stock was 17 TMC higher than the dams’ collective storage last year on the same day. The state irrigation department officials said they were closely monitoring the water levels and inflow of water in the dams. “We are keeping a close eye on the dams that have reached their full capacities. Among the four dams in the Khadakwasla circle, two have already reached their full capacities. Initially, Khadakwasla released water into the Mutha river, which was followed by discharge from the Panshet dam. We started discharge from Panshet to the power house, but the inflow increased during the last two days, which led to the release of water in the river,” an official said. Panshet released water at the rate of 3,000 cusec on Wednesday. The discharge from Varasgaon was likely to begin after the storage touched 95% of its capacity.

---||Pune||Fake: Data twisted to claim high toll among vaccinated||Pune: Many pushing conspiracy theories on anti-vaccine websites have started to twist statistics being released by reliable sources. One misleading theory claimed that a large number of people who died with the Delta variant of the coronavirus were vaccinated. This is not true, experts have said.The conspiracy theorists actually twisted statistics, from Public Health England (PHE) to push to their claim. Earlier in July, the PHE had said there were 92,029 confirmed Delta cases between February 1 and June 22 (most were reported in June). According to the BBC, of these, 58% were in fully unvaccinated people and only 8% were fully vaccinated. By early June, more than half of adults in the UK were fully vaccinated. If the vaccines weren’t effective, the numbers would have been higher. Researchers worldwide have said the Covid-19 vaccines are not perfect. But they do protect a large number of people from severe disease and hospitalisations. A small number will go on to succumb. In populations that have near-100% vaccine coverage, deaths will occur in those who have received the jab. In England, it’s estimated that the jabs have already saved the lives of 27,000 people, the BBC said.The conspiracy theory that skewed the PHE data was found circulating in Indian social networks too. The Times Verified service has certified it as false. Since its launch on April 30 this year, the service has received over 2,500 social media and text messages for verification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fake-data-twisted-to-claim-high-toll-among-vaccinated/articleshow/85051149.cms||---

Commissioner of police Hemant Nagrale has issued a circular to the traffic department, asking all traffic cops to desist from examining vehicles as congestion is increasing on the streets and prioritise monitoring of traffic movement. “If motorists are violating traffic rules, they should be charged under provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act by the traffic police. They should not be involved in any kind of examination of vehicles,” said the circular issued on July 29. “During joint nakabandis by traffic police and local policemen, the traffic police will only act against traffic violations and not examine vehicles. If these instructions are not strictly implemented, the senior inspector of the concerned traffic chowky will be held responsible,” the circular said. A senior traffic police official clarified that traffic cops were not supposed to examine the boot of vehicles or intercept them on the basis of suspicion. “Our men will continue to issue challans against traffic offences and intercept traffic violators as earlier,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dont-check-cars-ensure-easier-vehicle-flow-cp-tells-traffic-cops/articleshow/85053509.cms||---

This is a serious matter, and now, it is to inform that your schools furnish the said information by August 6, 2021, failing which action will be taken against the defaulter schools,” deputy director of education S S Ghadi has said in the letter to school managements. Many prominent schools feature in the list of 55 defaulters. A majority of the institutes in the list, 31, are schools located in Tiswadi, most being Panaji-based. Sixteen of the institutes that are yet to submit the vaccination data are schools for special children located across Goa. The other defaulting regular schools are located in Salcete, Pernem and Sattari. Ghadi has reminded schools that they had been asked on July 18 to submit information to the block resource cluster office about the number of school teaching and non-teaching staff who have received their first and second dose of the vaccine. On July 13, the state government had issued a circular to schools asking teaching and non-teaching staff to get themselves vaccinated on an urgent basis, failing which they would have to produce a negative RT-PCR test result every week to be able to report to work. The DoE has also told school staffers to ensure that their family members are vaccinated. The instructions were issued after CM Pramod Sawant had announced that expert members of the task force had recommended priority vaccination of school teaching and non-teaching staff, to safeguard children from Covid-19 infection ahead of the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/55-schools-warned-for-not-submitting-teacher-vax-data/articleshow/85053486.cms||---

ACP Seetaram Gaikwad said all four units of the city traffic branch have been instructed to take strict action against motorists who are found jumping traffic signals, indulging in wrong-side driving, speaking on cellphone while driving. Gaikwad added that owing to the restrictions, earlier, there were lesser number of vehicles on the streets in the evenings. “Now that the shops have been permitted to operate till 8 pm, the rush of vehicles would be constant till at least 9 pm,” he said. More personnel would be deployed in market and crowded areas like Shalimar, CBS, Meher, Raviwar Karanja, along with Satpur, Ambad, Nashik Road, Adgaon. Gaikwad said that rash driving also leads to a large number of accidents on the highways. “Personnel on the two speed-gun equipped ‘interceptor’ are continuously keeping a check over-speeding vehicles on the Mumbai Agra highway and Nashik-Pune highway passing through the city,” he said. Motorists, mainly bikers also tend to fall while riding on the wet roads during the rainy seasons, leading to accidents, said the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cops-to-up-vigil-amid-ease-of-biz/articleshow/85046643.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC to boards: Respond to state request for CET question bank||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Friday asked CBSE, ICSE and IGCSE boards to respond to the state government’s suggestion to submit a question bank for setting a single paper for the Common Entrance Test (CET) for junior college admissions. A bench of Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and Riyaz Chagla asked the boards to respond to the state after being informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that they have expressed their inability to participate in setting a common question paper. “Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be unanimity. They are unable to perform the exercise and we can’t wait indefinitely,” he added. ICSE student Ananya Patki has challenged the optional CET based on the SSC syllabus. She had dropped science since Class IX. On July 28, the state was asked if a common question paper can be set on the syllabi of all boards. The AG said the state “appealed” to other boards to together give 200 questions, which it will examine. “There will be a total of seven groups of 25 marks each. Four of ours, three of theirs. We’ll give students an option to answer in any four groups. They have to answer 100 out of 175 questions,” he said. The four groups of questions will be as per the state’s notification on mathematics, science, social sciences and English and the three groups of questions of other boards. He said CBSE board has not objected to CET on SSC syllabus and IGCSE board has said it does not have a team in India. ICSE board also said it cannot help with the question bank. With the CET on August 21, the AG said time is running out. “If there is a delay, the admission process will finish in October and the academic year will commence thereafter,” he added. The AG said, “Ten lakh have applied from the SSC board and from other boards few thousands.” He said in a CET, the merit of children can be compared not only across boards but even within a board. But senior advocate Mihir Desai, representing a few IGCSE students, questioned how it can be achieved in respect of subjects not studied. Ananya’s father advocate, Yogesh Patki, questioned the basis of four groups of maths, science, social sciences and English. HC said there must be a solution. “This has to be sorted out by both (state and boards). Give your 200 questions. You also get a chance to subjects of your choice,'” said Justice Dhanuka. With Patki insisting on arguing his case, HC posted the matter to Friday to decide it on merits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-to-boards-respond-to-state-request-for-cet-question-bank/articleshow/85047027.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Hyderabad||GHMC still going low-tech for cleaning ops||Hyderabad: Despite having bagged awards and high ratings for citizen feedback and administration, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation still lags behind when it comes to adopting modern technology. For instance, the civic body is still deploying the bucket cleaning technique to remove silt from choked sewer lines. On Wednesday, two workers died in LB Nagar during a cleaning operation using this technique. However on the other hand, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has been using a state-of-the-art robotic system to track and clean choked sewer lines instead of manual operations for the last three years.“Usually, bucket cleaning system avoids manhole entry and manual de-silting but the contractor’s decision of using manpower was wrong,” GHMC chief engineer for maintenance M Devanand told TOI. Devanand said that they have allotted one jet sucking machine to each GHMC circle to keep cleaning the sewerage network which is 3,783 kilometres in length and has 3.45 lakh manholes. The chief engineer added that the civic body has its own sanitation workers to handle sewerage-related complaints. According to a GHMC official, the civic body’s sewerage system, its machinery and workers, will be handed over to HMWS&SB from October 1 as per instructions of MA&UD minister KT Rama Rao. Manual cleaning had been completely banned after several instances of deaths in manholes across the city. However, GHMC zonal commissioner Upender Reddy said that they used to follow the bucket cleaning system whenever needed to clear storm water drains and that manpower is necessary to operate it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-still-going-low-tech-for-cleaning-ops/articleshow/85053418.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||GHMC gets Rs 2k cr less than earmarked budget every yr||Hyderabad: Telangana spends almost Rs 2,000 crore less every year against the proposed Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) budget, according to a Right to Information reply. Activists alleged that this is affecting civic amenities in Greater Hyderabad badly. “GHMC, which has 30% population of the state and generates 70% of its revenue, is starved of funds. The annual budget of GHMC is a sad reflection of the government’s apathy towards the people living in Hyderabad. The financial position of GHMC is awful, no funds for paying salaries, bills of hundreds of crores worth work done, are pending,” said retired IFS officer M Padmanabha Reddy. After the formation of Telangana, the State Finance Commission (SFC) was constituted in 2015, but the government appointed chairperson and members of the commission only after a public interest litigation was filed in high court. After studying the financial position of local bodies, SFC had sent its report in October 2020 to the governor, who in in turn sent it to government for action on recommendations of the body. “It is deplorable that the government has not taken any action on SFC recommendations nor placed them in the legislature. The local bodies, which should get funds as a right, are looking towards government for charity,” Padmanabha Reddy said. SFC had recommended transfer of 11% of net state own revenue to local bodies. “Neighbouring Karnataka transfers 48% of revenue receipts to local bodies. New gram panchayats, mandal praja parishads and zilla parishads should be given special grants for their infrastructure development,” he added. SFC had recommended that division of pooled resources among panchayats and urban local bodies should be in ratio of 60:40 respectively and distribution of funds on population as per the 2011census. The Telangana government’s annual budget for the 2021-22 fiscal is Rs 1.76 lakh crore. If the recommendation of SFC are implemented, Rs 20,000 crores has to be released to gram panchayats and urban local bodies as their rightful share apart from central grants. The Centre gives Rs 1,365 crore per annum to panchayats, while the state government transfers an equal amount to them , it means monthly about Rs 114 crores is the release by the state government to gram panchayats. “The state government’s claims that Rs 300 crore is being released monthly to GPs needs clarification,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-gets-rs-2k-cr-less-than-earmarked-budget-every-yr/articleshow/85053352.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The victim, 20-year-old Priti Chaudhary, was on her way to join the morning shift when a speeding trailer mowed her down. Police said that the accused driver, Sandeep Bind, was speeding due to which he lost control over the vehicle and knocked down Chaudhary. The trailer’s rear wheel ran over Chaudhary due to which she was killed on the spot. Fearing mob fury, Bind fled from the spot after the accident. However, later he surrendered at Jahangirpura police station. “The accused driver was going to Hazira from Kosamba to unload an empty container, but he was driving at a high speed which caused the accident. He has admitted to the crime and we have arrested him for causing death due to negligence and rash driving,” said a police official. Chaudhary, a traffic brigade personnel, was the sole earning member of her family. Her father Pravin had passed away seven years ago and she was taking care of her ailing mother and a younger sister. “The victim’s relative told us that after her father’s death, her maternal uncle used to help the family, but he too passed away, so she started working in the traffic brigade after completing class 12,” the police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/trailer-kills-traffic-brigade-employee/articleshow/85047581.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Sensitize lawyers on impact ofstrikes on courts’ working: HC||Prayagraj: Taking serious note of lawyers abstaining from judicial work resulting in delay of disposal of cases, the Allahabad high court has directed all the district judges and commissioners of the region to sensitize lawyers through their Bar associations about the impact of strikes on ‘working of the court and plight of the litigants’. While dismissing a petition filed by one Prafull Kumar, Justice Vivek Kumar Birla on Tuesday observed, “Lawyers cannot take working of the court for granted as on one hand, obviously the lawyers must have charged their professional fee and thereafter, they are abstaining from work and on the other hand, they are seeking a direction to the court concerned to decide the case within a specific period. It is a sheer wastage of time of the court concern and ultimately of resources, financial or otherwise, of the litigants as well of the tax payers, as daily cost of running a court is huge but is not serving any purpose, neither of the litigants nor of the society at large.” In the present case, the petitioner was seeking expeditious disposal of his case pending in the court of the commissioner of Prayagraj division since 2014. The court refused to grant the relief as the case was pending because lawyers were abstaining from judicial work. The court after going through the order-sheet of the case which was pending in the lower court observed, “A perusal of the order-sheet right from the year 2014 reflects that except on few dates almost throughout the lawyers were abstaining from work. It is also pertinent to note that in fact, the lawyers are so regularly abstaining from work that a rubber stamp is being used on the order-sheet that the lawyers are abstaining from work.” “This speaks a lot about sorry states of affairs in the courts below, particularly on revenue side,” added the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/sensitize-lawyers-on-impact-ofstrikes-on-courts-working-hc/articleshow/85053575.cms||---

Replying to a calling attention motion by MLA VR Sunil Kumar in the assembly on Wednesday, minister for fisheries, youth affairs and culture Saji Cherian said that as per the Constitution, fisheries is a state subject and the blue economy policy announced by Centre questions the powers of the state. He said that the policy of the LDF government is that like how the ownership of forests are to be vested with the tribal community members who are inhabitants of the forest, the same applies in the case of fishermen. With the implementation of blue economy policy, the fragile seashore would be controlled by corporates and tourism lobby. He said that there would be large-scale constructions along the shores and the homes of the fishing community would be lost. He said that the increase in sea-level is already affecting the fishermen adversely, and the unscientific constructions on the basis of the blue economy policy would add to it further. The minister said that the state had already submitted several concerns and suggestions to the Centre and some of those have been agreed by the Centre. However, more concerns have come up now and the chief minister, at multiple meetings, has asked the MPs from the state to raise the matter in Parliament, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/centres-blue-economy-policy-encroaches-on-states-powers/articleshow/85051284.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Over 85% of our business takes place only after 6pm and it would become difficult for us to survive if the government keeps the curbs intact,” Vedanshu Patil, president of Nashik Restaurant Cluster, said.“It is unfortunate that restaurants and bars are not allowed to operate after 4pm. On the contrary, the state government has given relief to other shops to operate till 8pm,” he added.According to Patil, the protest was held in the city to press for their demands of extending the timing for restaurants and bars till 8 pm. The Association of Bars, Hotels and Restaurants (ABHAR) claimed 15% of the over 450 restaurants & bars in Nashik city have already closed down due to financial crisis and more will be forced to follow suit if the state government does not ease the restrictions.The protesters also reminded the state government that their main business hours are in the evening when people step out of their homes and offices with their families and friends.“The positivity rate of Nashik has reduced significantly and this is the time to give a boost to trade and business. But this is not happening as hotels and restaurants have been kept aside from government relaxation. We don’t know the logic behind why shops have been allowed to function till 8pm,” Sanjay Chavan, president of ABHAR, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-restaurateurs-seek-covid-curb-relaxation/articleshow/85046750.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Hyderabad||Krishna row: AP spurns CJI’s mediation offer||New Delhi: The Andhra Pradesh government on Wednesday spurned Chief Justice of India N V Ramana's practical suggestion to resolve dispute with Telangana on apportionment of Krishna river water shares through mediation, saying it would prefer a legal battle in the Supreme Court to stop the neighbour from “usurping water” in excess of its share. The CJI had on Monday suggested that the two states resolve the dispute over apportioning of the river water through mediation instead of spending time and energy over litigation. However, he caveated it by saying, “If Andhra Pradesh wants adjudication of legal issues raised in its writ petition, I will recuse and post the petition before another bench.” The CJI, who had as an advocate represented the undivided Andhra Pradesh, said, “I belong to both the states. I can arrange for mediation and supervise it for a possible resolution of the Krishna water sharing dispute.” On Wednesday, AP counsel G Umapathy informed the court that the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government would prefer adjudication of the issues raised by the state in its writ petition, which pushed the CJI to make good his words and recuse from hearing of the petition. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said the Union government has full faith in the CJI and that it would like the CJI-led bench to hear the writ petition filed by AP. However, Justice Ramana remained firm and ordered the case to be posted before another bench. In its writ petition, Andhra Pradesh has accused Telangana of depriving people of AP of their legitimate share of Krishna water for drinking and irrigation. The bigger of the two neighbours alleged that Telangana was not following decisions taken on river water management in the Apex Council constituted under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act of 2014 as also the directions of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) constituted under the 2014 Act and directions of the central government. It has also blamed the Centre for not notifying the exact jurisdiction of KRMB. “This is resulting in illegal acts on part of Telangana and its authorities, creating serious constitutional issues,” it said. However, a day after AP moved the SC, the Centre on July 16 notified the Godavari and Krishna river management boards, giving them more teeth to administer, regulate, operate and maintain projects listed on these two rivers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh as per the mandate of the AP Reorganisation Act. The Jagan Reddy government's petition stated: “Fundamental rights, including right to life of its citizens, are being seriously impaired and infringed on account of unconstitutional, illegal and unjust acts on part of Telangana and its officials, resulting in the citizens of Andhra Pradesh being deprived of their legitimate share of water for drinking and irrigation purposes.” The bone of contention is the Telangana government's June 28 order, which stated that “to tap more hydel generation in the state, the government has taken a decision to generate hydel power up to 100% installed capacity”. The order directed the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation Limited (TSGenco) to “generate hydel power up to 100% installed capacity in the state”. AP alleged that Telangana had issued the notification days after the Jal Shakti ministry on June 17 communicated to the director (Hydel), TSGenco, requesting the latter “to stop further release of water immediately through Srisailam Left Power House and follow the water release orders issued by the KRMB, except in case of extreme grid urgency”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/krishna-row-ap-spurns-cjis-mediation-offer/articleshow/85053620.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

NCPCR cited provisions of the POCSO Act and the Juvenile Justice Act to say that posting the picture of the parents thereby reveals the identity of the deceased child, which is a violation of the law. The commission has sought an action-taken report from both Delhi Police and Twitter in the matter and said it should be sent to the commission within three days. NCPCR sent a letter to the resident grievance officer of Twitter, saying it received a complaint that a photo of the victim’s family has been posted on the Twitter handle @Rahul Gandhi with the caption stating that they are the father and the mother of the child. “In the said photo, the faces of the victim’s father and mother can be seen which thereby reveals the identity of the girl,” the apex child rights body said. NCPCR has also asked Twitter to take action and remove the tweet from the platform. NCPCR has also written to Delhi Police and sought action against Gandhi.

The Army’s logistics units and soldiers are stationed there, so closure of the road is making movement difficult as well as turning into a grave security concern. The protest entered its third day on Wednesday after a nine-year-old girl was allegedly raped and murdered inside a crematorium. The notice was served by Lieutenant Colonel Navneet Singh Boparae, General Staff Officer-I, Intelligence for General Officer Commanding, to the village person leading the protest. “It is intimated that a protest has taken place near FOL, DPOT, which is in close vicinity to the central vehicle depot since August 3. It is intimated that a number of logistics units (major and minor), along with serving soldiers are residing in the area around the protest site. These logistics units are facing a lot of administration problems due to the protest,” added the notice. “A large number of local and outsider protesters are present, which is raising the threat levels and security concerns in the cantonment. The protest might lead to any untoward incident or unwanted security hazard also keeping in mind the forthcoming national event, Independence Day,” the notice stated. The zonal and sector commanders earmarked in the notice have already been told to keep their security teams ready. “You are requested to take necessary measures to clear the road and protesters may be removed immediately to avoid any untoward security incident that might hamper the smooth functioning of defence units/establishment,” said the notice, which has also been marked to the SHO, Delhi Cantonment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/army-wants-protesters-to-leave-for-i-day-work/articleshow/85051361.cms||---

---||Nagpur||CBSE Std XII: Parents uniting over ‘low marks’ issue||Nagpur: Many parents of CBSE Std X and XII students are reaching out to each other through social media to raise awareness about the ‘low marks’ issue. After TOI published an article about parents venting their ire on schools, calls and emails came in from as far as Navi Mumbai to seek more information about parent groups in other cities. Parents are hoping to find strength in number and trying to connect through Whatsapp groups and other social media sites. A parent from Navi Mumbai wrote an email to TOI saying, “We are similarly affected group of parents from Navi Mumbai. We want to join with other groups of parents in this regard from different parts of the country.””After TOI put the parent in touch with the Nagpur group of parents, it became clear that many parents are now connecting with each other. A parent from Nagpur said, “This issue will become big in coming days because there are thousands of parents across India who are unhappy. The marks allotted by schools are low and very divergent. There is no logic which can explain why a consistent 90% plus scorer student gets just 70 marks in a subject.”What’s further infuriating some parents is that no details have yet been announced regarding the proposed dispute settlement for results. TOI had reported that CBSE will soon be issuing details about the process through which disputes related to results preparation will be heard. Maharashtra state education board has already formed a committee to address this issue for its HSC (Std XII) students. Every divisional board office has been made the first point of contact for all state board students who wish to raise issues or file complaint regarding their results. A CBSE parent said, “See the speed with which state board acted and set up the committee. CBSE should have done the same. As of now, we are awaiting to see what solution CBSE offers and schools too are deflecting focus towards that. We are stuck in the middle.” A few parents are even considering going to the court, but some expressed reservations. “We are aware that the marks tabulation policy was approved by the Supreme Court so there is no way any high court will entertain our plea. Hence, we are thinking of asking schools to provide us mark allotment paperwork, which is something we can approach the HC for,” said a parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-std-xii-parents-uniting-over-low-marks-issue/articleshow/85051332.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Two occupants of a car from the city were killed and another person was injured in the accident. The accident caused a major traffic jam on the busy Pune-Bengaluru highway for a couple of hours before normal traffic was restored late at night. The police identified the deceased as Sanjay Chandrakant Kulkarni (52), a resident of Karvenagar, and Vijay Tukaram Polekar (47), a resident of Janta Vasahat. An officer from the Shirwal police station said, “The milk tanker was heading towards Pune from Kolhapur at a break-neck speed and its driver may have lost control over the vehicle as it started hit motorists travelling ahead, that is two cars, a truck, another tanker, an SUV and a tempo. Both cars were damaged completely, and the police had to use gas cutters to extricate the victims from the mangled heap.” The driver of the milk tanker ran away from the spot, abandoning his vehicle. The police later summoned the owner of the tanker for an inquiry and to seek details regarding the driver of the vehicle. Following the accident, vehicular movement on the national highway came to standstill for almost two hours. The police team removed the wreckage of the vehicles from the road and vehicular movement was finally restored at around 11.30 pm. In early July, two men were killed, and one was injured in a similar highway accident. A speeding truck had crashed into a container truck at Kunjirwadi on the Pune-Solapur highway at around 4am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-killed-as-milk-tanker-hits-6-vehicles/articleshow/85051340.cms||---

The speaker made the observations after a section of media allegedly reported that the omission of the name of one of the members, who had given notice seeking leave for adjournment motion, by the speaker was deliberate.  The speaker said that such kind of interpretation was unfortunate and the journalists should ensure more responsibility and caution while reporting the proceedings, which should be true to the facts. The matter pertains to the leave for adjournment motion sought by members including M K Muneer, A P Anil Kumar, Mons Joseph, Anoop Jacob, Mani C Kappan and K K Rema, regarding the shortage of Plus One seats in the state. When the speaker read out the names of the members who had served the notice, the name of K K Rema was left out initially, and the opposition members had immediately objected to this omission. The speaker had then clarified that it was not deliberate and the photocopy of the notice from which he had read out the names had accidentally excluded the name of K K Rema. He had then rectified the mistake and read out the name of Rema as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/assembly-reporting-must-be-true-to-the-facts-says-speaker/articleshow/85051358.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The announcement was made on Wednesday by Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) in its regulatory filing.SMG’s Hansalpur plant, which supplies cars exclusively to MSI for domestic as well as export markets, will scale down its production to a single shift at certain manufacturing lines in the plant.“Owing to the semiconductor shortage situation, the company has been informed by its contract manufacturing company, SMG, that production will be partially impacted in this month,” states the regulatory filing of MSI.“SMG will tentatively not carry out production on the three Saturdays (August 7, 14 and 21) this month,” it further states.“Certain production lines at the SMG plant may see temporary reduction from two-shift to one-shift working,” the filing says. “As the situation is dynamic and uncertain, the company will monitor and take a day-to-day decision on models, lines or shifts to optimise resources for maximum efficiency.”The SMG plant has three assembly lines operating with an installed capacity of about 7.5 lakh units per annum.Semiconductors have a major application in electronic devices, automobiles, computers, and cellphones. “With newer car models going for automation and more electronic features including hybrid-electric systems, blue-tooth connectivity, touch-screen interface, and app-based sensors being used, the requirement of semiconductors has increased multi-fold,” said an automobile industry source.SMG started with the production of Baleno in February 2017, when the plant was commissioned and manufacturing activity started. Nearly a year later in January 2018, the manufacturing of Maruti Suzuki Swift began. The company subsequently began production for exports in March 2018. In October 2020, the plant rolled out its millionth car.SMC has made a cumulative investment of Rs 12,680 crore in the establishment and upgrade of the plant in Gujarat, one of the highest by an automobile giant in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/semiconductor-crunch-smg-to-scale-down-production/articleshow/85051387.cms||---

We requested the outfit members to remove the idol, but they refused. Meanwhile, more than 30 Christians gathered in the area and raised slogans against the Hindu Munnani members. We removed the idol from the area on Wednesday morning as the outfit cadres hadn’t received any permission to install the same there,” the officer said.Police have detained 27 Hindu Munnani members who attempted to prevent officials from removing the idol.Talking to the media on behalf of the prayer hall management, Joshua Stephan said the land belonged to them and their facility had been there for more than three decades. Suresh, district executive member, Hindu Munnani, said it was on the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department’s land that they had placed the idol. “We didn’t occupy the prayer hall’s land.” Pointing out that the prayer hall was on the illegally occupied land, he said its management cannot claim the land’s ownership.‘Kadeswara’ Subramaniam, who came down to Tiruchengode town on Wednesday evening, said the officials were supporting the Christians indirectly. “We will stage a demonstration and a series of protests, if the officials don’t allow us to install the Vinayakar idol on the girivalam path.”Revenue divisional officer Ilavarasi and other officials are camping at Tiruchengode town to monitor the situation. They said they had asked the prayer hall management to produce the land documents to confirm their claims. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/cops-remove-idol-placed-without-permission-on-temple-path/articleshow/85051339.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Investigation into 9-year-old’s death given to Crime Branch||NEW DELHI: The case of alleged rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl in southwest Delhi was transferred to Crime Branch on Wednesday evening. As the autopsy report was inconclusive about sexual assault and cause of death because the body was cremated, police are now relying upon scientific tools of investigation. They intend to carry out narco analysis and polygraph (lie-detector) tests on the accused. These tests require the consent of the accused and are not admissible as evidence in court. However, they help cops in the investigation. Police are also relying on the collection of evidence and its analysis by forensic officers. They would also go for a DNA match. Sources said that bodily fluids and samples had been collected from the homes and clothes of the accused, which would be tested for traces of the deceased girl’ DNA. A senior officer said, “The case has been transferred to Crime Branch for a scientific investigation and carrying out a speedy trial in the interest of justice. We will seek the help of technology and related tools to get to the truth.” The four suspects in the case, Radheshyam, Mohammad Saleem, Kuldeep and Laxmi Narayan, have already been arrested. The minor girl died at a crematorium in mysterious circumstances in southwest Delhi’s Nangal village on Sunday night. Initially, an FIR for culpable homicide and destruction of evidence was filed. Subsequently, the caretaker-cum-priest of the crematorium was apprehended along with three others. Later, IPC sections of murder, sexual assault and criminal intimidation were added to the FIR, apart from invoking Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and SC/ST Act. According to police, the girl had gone to get cold water from the crematorium around 5.30pm on Sunday after informing her mother. Around 6pm, the mother was called to the spot and shown the body of the girl. The priest and the others warned the mother that if she called the PCR, then not only would a police case be made, but during autopsy doctors would take away all organs of the girl. So, it would be better to cremate her. The girl was subsequently cremated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/investigation-into-9-yr-olds-death-given-to-crime-branch/articleshow/85051372.cms||---
---||Pune||Covid-19: Outstation cases keep up Pune Metropolitan Region’s count||PUNE: Covid-19 infections among the large number of people entering the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) for short work-related trips has caused an increase in the region’s active caseload. The state health department has estimated there are 15,473 active cases in the region. But the number of actual PMR residents who are currently undergoing treatment — across homes and hospitals here (active cases) — is less than 10,000. The active caseload then increases by a substantial number if outstation individuals are added. Now, PMR authorities do not include these patients in their active caseload as they are not residents of the PMR. But the state government continues to include them in Pune’s active case count as they have tested positive for Covid at hospitals and labs in the region. “We currently have 8,972 active Covid patients in the PMR who are yet to recover from Covid-19. They are undergoing treatment either in home-isolation or at hospitals. The state has pegged this number at 15,473. The surplus 6,501 active Covid cases are not residents of the PMR,” said additional district health officer Abhay Tidke. Tidke added, “These are people who had arrived in Pune for short visits, either from districts in Maharashtra or other states. But they developed symptoms and tested positive for Covid in Pune and are either undergoing care at hospitals or within the confines of the temporary accommodation they were staying in.” The district authorities, even if they don’t count these patients in Pune’s active caseload tally, keep up care. “We keep monitoring their health, but do not count them in our active case tally. But state officials have to consider them in Pune’s tally until their names are properly diverted to the Covid caseloads of the districts they're from,” Tidke said Efforts are currently on to clean up patient data for a more accurate picture of caseload, officials said. Aayush Prasad, CEO of the Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “We have drawn the attention of state officials to this matter. And they are updating their data.” State surveillance officer Pradip Awate said, “We need to ensure there is no duplication in Covid cases. The same person’s name can figure in the tally of the district where he/she tested positive while on work or business trip and also in the district where they hold permanent place of residence. Since Covid-19 has generated massive volumes of data, updating it will take some time.” It was a similar situation earlier this year and in 2020 as well. A Covid response survey released in May had found that 26% of people who were hospitalised in Pune at the time were from the neighbouring districts — mainly Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Solapur and Ahmednagar. Officials also confirmed that in September last year, nearly 30% of admitted patients were from other districts. “We have patients from all over the state,” a senior official from Pune division had said at the time. The CoEP makeshift hospital in May had more than 700 patients from outside PMC limits earlier this year. Authorities across neighbouring districts have been asked to ramp up their medical infrastructure — including ICU beds, oxygen tanks and personnel — to ensure Covid patients, particularly those who are critical and with underlying conditions, receive immediate treatment locally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/outstation-cases-keep-up-pmrs-count/articleshow/85051396.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Nagpur||HC dismisses plea to stop HT line through Hingna forest||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has rejected a petition demanding a stay on the work of erection of high-tension (HT) line passing through Hingna reserve forest area.Petitioner Jaydeep Das moved HC contending that clearance granted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC) on August 19, 2013, for erection of transmission tower and laying of HT line passing through the reserved forest of Ambazari, has now lapsed. He pointed out that nothing has progressed for more than seven years and the norms of reserved forest had also changed. According to him, the forest had now become a biodiversity area and environmental impact assessment wasn’t obtained for erection of towers.A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor stated that the most important permission from MOEFCC was granted about eight years ago, but for some or other reason, the work is still not complete.“We ave gone through respondent’s reply that shows all the necessary permissions including clearance from MOEFCC have been obtained before undertaking the work of erection of HT line which would be passing through reserve forest area,” the judges said.They pointed out that during arguments by respondents, it has emerged that some administrative hassles were responsible for delay in the work completion. “Now those hassles have almost been resolved, except for the felling of the forest trees standing on the path from which HT cable would pass. We are hopeful that even this work would be completed by the forest department expeditiously, preferably within three months from the date of the order, of course by following the law and proper procedure,” the bench said.While demanding a disposal of the case, the respondents earlier submitted that they had received all the requisite permissions for the project, complied with all the technical formalities and no further clearance was required.“The petitioner hasn’t denied all these averments and is also not present before us. But, in view of respondents’ reply and supporting documents, we’re satisfied that there is no substance in the petition,” the bench said before dismissing the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-dismisses-plea-to-stop-ht-line-through-hingna-forest/articleshow/85046808.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Man held in 2017 drug frame-up names south Mumbai builder||MUMBAI: Four years after drugs were planted on a social worker’s scooter, police arrested a man who said he had carried out the act at the behest of a local developer who wanted to settle scores over a property dispute. The MRA Marg police on Saturday arrested Mohammed Rajabali Makrani under the NDPS Act. However, the victim, Mohammed Aslam Shaikh, 63, died last year. Makrani was produced before the 38th Metropolitan Magistrate court which remanded him to judicial custody. Makrani admitted he had planted 128gm of charas on Shaikh’s scooter on the instructions of a South Mumbai developer. When the police sent summons to the accused developer, he moved the sessions court for anticipatory bail. The court has kept the matter for hearing on August 9. The accused developer through his lawyer Sameer Nangre has also filed a quashing petition of FIR before the Bombay HC. As per details of the case, on February 13, 2017, the MRA Marg police received a tip-off that a suspected drug peddler was moving on a black scooter near Kala Ghoda. A police team reached the spot and found the scooter parked nearby. As soon as Mohammed Aslam Shaikh arrived, he was detained. A search of the vehicle resulted in recovery of the charas. “Shaikh, a noted social worker from Dongri, denied having any knowledge of the contraband. Subsequent discrepancies during the course of investigation raised suspicion and it was decided to get to the bottom of the case. Shaikh was released subject to certain conditions,” said an officer. Shaikh had then told the police he had come to the city civil court to attend hearing in a property dispute involving his relative and the accused developer and that he suspected he had been framed. Makrani in his deposition before the court stated the developer had given him the contraband as well as duplicate keys of Shaikh’s scooter. He said he kept the contraband in the dickey of the scooter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-held-in-2017-drug-frame-up-names-sobo-bldr/articleshow/85053691.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Poll code? K Chandrasekhar Rao to roll out Dalita Bandhu in Vasalamarri today||HYDERABAD: Taking everybody by surprise, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday announced that the Dalita Bandhu scheme will be rolled out from his adopted village of Vasalamarri in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district on Thursday. The CM said Rs 10 lakh each would be deposited into the accounts of 76 Dalit families in the village. The scheme was supposed to be launched in poll-bound Huzurabad on pilot basis on August 16. The CM interacts with a villager during his visit to Turkapally village in Vasalamarri in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district on Wednesday.During his visit to the village on Wednesday, the CM said the government will be releasing Rs 7.6 crore for the scheme and the amount would be deposited into the Dalit families’ accounts from Thursday. “A Dalit protection fund will also be created in Alair assembly constituency. Vasalamarri will become a role model in Dalit Bandhu implementation and it will be developed on the lines of Erravelli village,” KCR said. Buzz in the political circles, however, is that the CM had hurriedly announced the scheme as the Election Commission of India (ECI) is likely to announce a schedule for the MLC polls and Huzurabad by-election soon. “If the schedule is announced, the government cannot officially launch the scheme as the model code of conduct will come into effect immediately,” sources said. The CM had earlier announced that Dalita Bandhu pilot project would be launched in Huzurabad and held an orientation programme for 412 Dalits from the constituency a couple of weeks ago. He even faced criticism from the opposition parties over the timing of the launch of the scheme in the face of Huzurabad bypoll. Explaining about Dalita Bandhu, the CM said the scheme had been designed in such a manner that it gives complete discretion to the beneficiaries who need not repay either to the bank or to the government. “A special monitoring committee will be constituted to guide the beneficiaries and oversee effective implementation of the scheme,” he said. “There is about 100 acres of surplus land in Vasalamarri which will be assigned to Dalit families,” he said and added that 2BHK houses would be sanctioned to the homeless poor in the village. He also directed Yadadri district collector Pamela Satpathy to sanction pensions to the eligible beneficiaries. When some people brought to the notice of the CM on inundation problems due to the lack of a drainage system in the village, he directed the officials to lay drainage pipelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/poll-code-cm-to-roll-out-dalita-bandhu-in-vasalamarri-today/articleshow/85053670.cms||Koride Mahesh

As the children screamed for help, a man cutting grass in a nearby field immediately dived into the pond, but by the time the children — Rohit Kumar (11) and his friend Sandeep (10) — were rescued, they had died, said police, adding that they sent the bodies for autopsy. The children were taking bath when Sandeep started drowning in the pond, and as Rohit rushed to rescue him, he too lost his balance and started drowning, said police. Roza police station SHO Jaishankar Singh said, “There was not a single guardian around the pond when the children were taking bath. The water level in the pond was high due to incessant rains. The children didn’t realise it and entered deep into the water and drowned. The bodies were handed over to their families after the autopsy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/two-kids-10-11-drown-in-pond-in-shahjahanpur-village/articleshow/85043398.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||Clip of woman creating ruckus on road goes viral||Pune: A video clip of a woman creating a ruckus by squatting and sprawling in the middle of the Tilak Road near Hirabaug Chowk, with several vehicles dangerously passing by her and many onlookers busy capturing the incident on their cellphones, around 11pm on Tuesday went viral on the social media. The woman, in her twenties and wearing a red T-shirt with black jeans, appeared to be in an inebriated condition, police said, adding that no one was seen in the clip coming forward to shift her to safety. Some commuters alerted the Swargate police about the incident, following which two beat marshals reached the spot. But on realizing that the person concerned was a woman, they called women police personnel for help. By the time the women police reached the spot, the woman had moved to the side of the road and ran away towards Dattawadi. The police were still clueless about the woman’s identity and why she had created a ruckus. The police said many two-wheeler riders took videos of the woman on the road and the clips went viral within a matter of little time. The video clips showed the woman sitting or sprawling in the middle of the road. She was also seen waving at bus and car drivers in an apparent gesture to drive their vehicles towards her. The vehicles slowed down while approaching her and drove away from her. Senior inspector Balasaheb Kopnar of the Swargate police said, “We don’t know the details of the woman, or why she behaved in such a manner. Some people told us that she was in an inebriated condition. The woman ran towards Dattawadi on seeing the women police personnel approaching her. None of the motorists tried to pull her aside from the middle of the road. We have not yet registered any cases.” A senior police officer said, “People present at the spot should have taken the initiative to move the woman to a safe place. What she was doing could have been dangerous for her and also other road users. However, many people tend to shy away fropm taking such responsibilities fearing getting involved in legal issues. But ideally that should not be the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/clip-of-woman-creating-ruckus-on-road-goes-viral/articleshow/85051379.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Enforcement Directorate issues another notice to Panakkad Thangal||KOZHIKODE: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued another notice summoning IUML state president Panakkad Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal to appear before the investigating officer on Friday in connection with a probe into alleged transactions of unaccounted money through the bank account of Muslim League’s mouthpiece, Chandrika. Thangal is being summoned in his capacity as chairman and managing director of Muslim Printing and Publishng Co. Ltd, the publishers of Chandrika. The ED is probing the allegations of money laundering during the time of demonetization through the bank account of the newspaper. It has been alleged by the petitioner Girish Babu G that a director of the newspaper had deposited Rs10 crore in the bank account of the daily in Ernakulam and several crores of rupees were deposited in the account of the newspaper in the Kaloor branch of another bank. The petitioner has also alleged that the transactions were benami transactions of former PWD minister V K Ebrahim Kunju who was later arrested by the vigilance and anti corruption bureau (VACB) on graft charges in Palarivattom flyover case. The high court had in August 2020 asked VACB, which had launched an investigation into the allegations, to share the progress of the probe with ED. Hyderali Thangal is currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Kozhikode. The notice was served by ED officials at his current place of stay in Kozhikode. Given his health condition, it is not known whether he will appear in person at the ED office on the specified date. ED had issued a notice to Thangal in July last year asking him to appear before the investigating officer in Kochi but the ED officials had recorded his statements after visiting his residence at Panakkkad. VACB officials had raided the office of Chandrika in March 2020 and had seized 34 documents and one hard disc. Ebrahim Kunju had maintained that the amount found in Chandrika’s bank accounts was the subscription amount collected by the newspaper management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/ed-issues-another-notice-to-panakkad-thangal/articleshow/85051433.cms||---
---||Delhi||Serious economic offences can’t be viewed lightly, says court; denies bail||New Delhi: While dismissing the bail pleas of two directors of a Delhi-based real estate firm, a city court said that when the country was facing huge economic crisis on account of numerous scams which are having a disastrous impact on the state efforts to stabilise the economy, a serious view has to be taken of economic offences which show a distressingly growing tendency.The court further said that if serious economic offences, which adversely affect the public and society at large, were viewed lightly, confidence of the people in the institution of justice would be shaken.Additional sessions judge Dr Kamini Lau dismissed the bail pleas of Sushant Mutreja and Nishant Mutreja in five cases related to alleged cheating of a large number of investors of crores of rupees by not delivering possession of flats and properties in Delhi-NCR.“If serious economic offences are alleged to be committed by the applicants/ accused, which adversely affects the public and society at large, then discretion cannot be exercised, for if such offences are viewed lightly, then the confidence of the public in the institution of justice would be shaken,” the judge observed in the order.The court further said that “the entire community is aggrieved if the economic offenders who ruin the economy of the state are not brought to book.”“A murder may be committed in the heat of moment upon passions being aroused. An economic offence is committed with cool calculations and deliberate design with an eye on personal profit regardless of the consequence of the community,” it said.It noted that in five FIRs, there were 890 investors and the total alleged cheated amount was about Rs 125 crore.The police had submitted that the amount collected by the company was allegedly misappropriated and the funds were diverted to purchase the flats/ properties in Ghaziabad and Uttarakhand in the name of subsidiary companies.They further alleged that the land regarding the other projects was also purchased from the amounts collected from the investors and the amount was transferred swiftly to the accounts of more than 25 sister firms and associate companies.Both the accused’s counsel claimed that they always wanted to complete the project, but the market condition led to the delay in delivery of the projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/serious-economic-offences-cant-be-viewed-lightly-says-court-denies-bail/articleshow/85051399.cms||Usha Das

BLW spokesperson Rajesh Kumar on Wednesday said that similar devices would be mounted on the other goods trains after successful testing. According to him, the BLW has been selected by the Railway Board to implement the (EoTT), a flagship mission project of the Indian Railways, which seeks to replace guard & brake van (BV) in freight trains. The EoTT is a low-cost radio telemetry device which is used to establish communication between the locomotive’s driver and the last wagon of the train to ensure that the train is running with all wagons as a complete unit. The BLW is convener of the task force for smooth coordination and streamlining the project implementation. An EoTT set consists of a cab unit also called communication display unit and a rear unit, also called sense and brake unit or end of train unit. The rear unit is attached to the rear coupler of the last wagon of a rake. The cab unit and rear unit communicate over a radio link enabling two-way transmission of status data and instructions for the rear unit. The Railway Board in November 2020, approved in principle equipping all freight trains with EoTT devices that will replace the standard guard/brake van at the end of every goods rake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/blw-mounts-eott-device-in-goods-train/articleshow/85053657.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Pay one-time fixed jantri and own your GHB house||GANDHINAGAR: In a significant development, the state government has cleared a proposal to convert housing units of the Gujarat Housing Board (GHB) from leasehold to freehold on payment of a fixed jantri amount. The state urban development and urban housing department wrote a letter to the GHB commissioner on July 30, 2021, stating that the state government has cleared a proposal to convert leasehold properties to freehold properties on payment of a one-time jantri. Apart from generating income for the state government, the move will pave the way for residents to own such properties, which they currently hold on lease. Not only will the residents get higher income from sale of these properties, they can also opt for redevelopment. The issue of Gujarat Housing Board tenants not being able to legally sell their properties was being represented to political leaders for quite some time now. The matter also came up for discussion when the Union home and co-operation minister asked officials to resolve pending issues of GHB tenants. Occupiers of GHB properties –residential units in buildings, row houses or tenements – hold properties on lease for a fixed period (mostly 99 years). They are not in a position to sell these properties as these are not freehold properties. With several GHB houses being in posh areas,occupants of GHB houses will opt for converting their properties from leasehold to freehold, say those in the real estate sector. “Once they get the ownership, they will be able to sell these properties to anyone without requiring prior permission. If all the members of the housing society agree, they can even opt for redevelopment as well,” said a real estate expert. During his last review meeting of pending issues in Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency, Amit Shah had asked officials to work out a solution to pending issues of GHB occupants. Several areas of Ahmedabad where GHB houses are located, fall under the Gandhinagar LS constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pay-one-time-fixed-jantri-and-own-your-ghb-house/articleshow/85051448.cms||---

The MCCIA survey stated that the non-operation or the severely restricted operation of malls, cinemas, restaurants and hospitality industries such as travel and lodging, was slowing down the recovery and might eventually stall beyond a point, unless the curbs were eased. The overall production levels in the district reached to around 78% in July, up from 73% in June. The employment levels ticked up slightly, also to 78%, from 77% in June, But both are a far cry from the figures of 85% and 86% respectively, in February this year.Around 30% of the companies surveyed stated that their production levels have reached the pre-Covid figures, while 18% fett that it would take another six months. “It is good to observe the month-on-month pick-up in every segment. But we are yet to reach the February-March 2021 peak. Given the current levels of Covid positivity rate, the Pune region needs to further unlock amid apt behaviour and increased vaccination rate,” MCCIA director-general Prashant Girbane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/service-sector-lags-eco-revival-suffers/articleshow/85051442.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare has asked the revenue officials to find out the properties of children's parents in the district and any other place and then secure them for the children till they turn 18 years of age. A total of 24 children have lost both their parent to Covid. This move comes after Mandhare and Nashik Zilla Parishad CEO Leena Bansod noted that most of the children were being taken care of by the maternal relatives instead of the paternal ones, which was the natural process. “There is no report or any kind of intimation that children may be deprived of their rights by their relatives in any case. But as an administration we would like to take steps to protect the property and the future of the children by ensuring their right,” Mandhare said. He said the administration had a detailed list of 24 children, who have been orphaned. He asked the revenue officials to visit all the families and identify the properties which were owned by the deceased parents of the children and also those properties that could have been inherited by their parents. The names of the children should be included in the ‘rights’ of all such properties. “The transactions of all such properties would be banned until these formalities of including the names of the children are finalised. Once, it is sorted out, the bans would automatically cease to exist,” he said.The officer also has asked the NGOs and the revenue officials to visit families of all 850 children, who have lost either of their parents due to Covid and try to provide mental support. The revenue officials will do the needful in case of the properties owned by the deceased and help in the necessary transactions in the interest of the children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-admin-to-protect-properties-of-children-orphaned-by-covid-pandemic/articleshow/85046852.cms||Abhilash Botekar

It would also include whether or not he would have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the objections that he has received,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said.The HC was hearing two PILs filed by Ajay Tiwari and Shweta Burbure through counsel M Anil Kumar, and Swachha Foundation secretary Sharad Paliwal through lawyer Ritesh Tahaliyani.The bench clarified that if NMC tree officer is of the opinion that he does not have jurisdiction in the matter, he would be at liberty to refer all the objections to the authority which can take up the issues.“The authority having jurisdiction in the matter may take its decision in accordance with law. It’s advisable that it takes the decision as expeditiously as possible, preferably within eight weeks from the date of the order,” the judges said.Earlier, Anil Kumar contended that the tree officer doesn’t have any jurisdiction and it vests in the State Tree Authority because there are more than 200 trees growing at the site. He contended that the environmental clearance for development of this land into IMS is required as several trees would be axed and some of them, if the authorities decide, would be translocated. He submitted that a diverse flora and fauna has developed at the site and unless all the rules and procedures as prescribed in law are followed, the biodiversity of the area will be lost.In the last hearing NHAI informed that the tree officer would be hearing objections regarding felling and translocating trees at Ajni for IMS. The NMC had received over 7,000 objections which would be processed and decided in a public hearing, before coming to any conclusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-asks-nmc-tree-officer-to-fix-jurisdiction-over-ajni-vann-tree-felling/articleshow/85046823.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Some hospitals estimated a ratio of 70:30, while referring to current hospitalisation levels — 70% of admissions being from other districts. Govind Kulkarni, senior consultant physician with the Sahyadri super-speciality Hospital, Nagar Road, said, “We are now receiving complicated Covid-19 cases from districts such as Nashik, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Solapur, Kolhapur and other parts of western Maharashtra. These are mostly post-Covid patients having bilateral pneumonia with some other system complications needing ICU care, ventilators etc.” Kulkarni added, “Out of the total Covid admissions at our hospital, 30-40% of patients would be from Pune. The rest are outstation patients. This trend has been prominent over the last two months as some districts are reporting more cases than Pune, which also has a higher recovery rate.” He said Pune receives a lot of patients as it has fully equipped Covid care centres, ICU units and specialist doctors. Kapil Zirpe, a member of the Pune Covid task force and head of the neurotrauma unit of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “Most admitted Covid cases at our hospital are severe and complicated cases from districts of Ahmednagar and Satara. They contribute to around 70% of admissions currently.” Sanjay Pujari, from the ICMR national task force on clinical research for Covid and director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, said the city is currently seeing a significant number of patients coming in from other districts. “Conversely, during the peak, cases were predominantly only from Pune. Inter-district travel has opened up, which could be one of the reasons for the increase in outstation patients,” he said. A source from Jehangir Hospital said, “Though Covid admissions are only in single digits, at least 50% admissions are from outstation.” Pune zilla parishad's CEO Ayush Prasad said 30% of all hospital admission in the district currently may be outstation patients, with 10% at medical colleges in rural Pune. “Even non-Covid patients from some districts in Marathwada, Pune division and parts of Ahmednagar come for treatment here via referrals and tie-ups between Pune hospitals and those in smaller cities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-see-many-admissions-from-high-caseload-dists/articleshow/85051404.cms||Neha Madaan

The police are yet to take any action against the owner of the motorcycle that the underage boy was riding in violation of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act. “The motorcycle belonged to the boy’s father, who is an electrician. The boy had taken the motorcycle for a ride without informing his parents. We will take action in due course of time,” said sub-inspector Ravindra Mudal of the Hinjewadi police. The collision between the two vehicles occurred on the morning of June 22 along the Hinjewadi-Kasarsai Road. “The teenage motorcyclist was heading towards Kasarsai from Hinjewadi and the scooter was coming from the opposite direction. We had to conduct a spot panchanama, besides minutely studying the accident spot before taking a call on the registration of an FIR. Hence, it took so much time to register a case of negligence against the scooter rider,” Mudal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-book-scooterist-for-underage-bikers-death/articleshow/85051413.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Vid farmers fear another bollworm attack||Nagpur: Farmers have once again reported incidence of pink bollworm, the worst dread for a cotton grower. Cotton is the main crop in Vidarbha. Last year too, bollworm had hit cotton output in the region.Farmers who have been using genetically modified (GM) BGII seeds developed by Monsanto and supposed to be resistant to the pest have faced regular infestations since over four years at least.With good rains so far and a similar outlook for days ahead, there are apprehensions of a higher intensity of pest infestation this year, said farmers and experts. The pest has been reported in the fields in parts of the region wherever the crops have reached flowering stage.Officials of the agriculture department also accepted the development. The picture would be clear by end of the month when almost entire crop would have attained flowering stage, said source.There have been reports of pink bollworm in farms at Arvi Taluka of Wardha district. “The infestation is above economic threshold limit (ETL),” said a senior official in the Nagpur division of agriculture department. ETL is a benchmark to judge whether infestation can impact the crop and measures like pesticide spraying are needed.There were complaints in pockets of Yavatmal and a team has been sent to inspect the spot. There was infestation last year but could be managed, said an official in the district.“There has been no incidence of pink bollworm in the crop SAP reporting system maintained by the department,” said an official in the Amravati division which includes Yavatmal district.Farmers, however, said there have been incidences in pockets where flowering has taken place in the cotton crop.“Pink bollworm has been seen in farms at Arni and Mahalgaon Taluka of Yavatmal,” said Manish Jhadav, a farmer from the district.A group of farmers has submitted a memorandum before the district collector in Yavatmal demanding that the government should provide preventive means like pheromone traps to the farmers. The memorandum also says that despite repeated occurrences, there is no timely guidance from the agriculture department. Jadhav shared a video of farms affected by the pest.Vijay Ingle, a farmer in Akot taluka of Akola district, also confirmed that his crop is being hit by pink bollworm.A source in a government research agency said by December last year, the late variety of cotton was affected by pink bollworm. It may have led to around 30% fall in output.Meanwhile, as pesticide spraying is expected to increase due to pest infestation, a new technique is being tried to lure the bollworm away using scent of the female moth. Hollow wires generating a strong scent of the female worm are being tied to cotton plans. The male worm is expected to be attracted towards the wire and ultimately gets distracted. This is can prevent breeding and the worms that have a short life would die before mating.South Asia Biotechnology Centre (SABC) and Agrovision Foundation is carrying out a trial in 300 acres of farmland in plots at Warora in Chandrapur and its dubbed to be the largest farm experiment of its kind in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vid-farmers-fear-another-bollworm-attack/articleshow/85046845.cms||Shishir Arya

That was the first time she had beaten all three after losing practice games to them for an entire year. The wins gave her the belief that she would come back with a medal from Tokyo. Jagadeesh Kalaga (20), Aditya Bapineedu (21) and Abhyansh Singh (20) were Sindhu’s sparring partners and they toughened her for the bigger battle. “She told me, now that I have defeated them I am confident of winning gold at Tokyo. It is always advantageous to play against boys,” said Pradeep Raju, chief coach and founder of Suchitra Badminton Academy where the three men train. All three belong to different states and have different styles, forcing Sindhu to adopt different strategies during practice games. Jagadeesh, who hails from Visakhapatnam, plays just like South Korean shuttler An Se Young, while Abhyansh plays a fast-paced game like Tai Tzu-Ying, according to Sindhu’s team. Abhyansh, who hails from Varanasi, focussed on the front court, a style similar to Tai’s game at the net. “I would take a lot of points from Sindhu akka at the net. I beat her for an entire year. But just before she left for the Olympics she beat me convincingly. That was when we knew she would win an Olympic medal,” said Abhyansh. Those who watched Sindhu’s game at Tokyo were impressed with how she tackled Akane Yamaguchi and He Bing Jiao at the net. That was not Sindhu’s strength before the Tokyo Olympics and coach Park Tae-Sang concentrated on this area with the help of the sparring partners. Jagadeesh is very good at round the head attack. “All three of us are happy about what we have done for her preparation,” Jagadeesh told TOI.

---||Mumbai||Western Railway files FIR against own official after internal inquiry reveals role in job scam||MUMBAI: The Western Railway has registered an FIR after an internal inquiry revealed that one of its officials allegedly committed a fraud by offering fake appointment letters for the post of Train Ticket Examiner (TTE). Sources said that an FIR had also been lodged on July 30 with the Mumbai Central Government Railway Police (GRP) by one of the candidates who received a fake appointment letter. “In October 2019, Western Railway published an advertisement for 21 commercial-cum-ticket clerk posts under the sports quota. Of these, 2 seats were reserved for candidates under the Kabaddi quota. Later, two Kabaddi players applied for the post and the recruitment process was completed on January 10, 2020, and their names were added to the waiting list,” said a senior official. Although many applicants were disqualified after medical tests and verification, the two Kabaddi players were hopeful of getting a job in the Railways. In March 2021, one of the two players received a correspondence in an envelope with the Western Railway logo printed on it. The appointment letter mentioned that he will have to be present for the medical test on June 15, 2021. After arriving in Mumbai from Haryana, the complainant met a railway sports officer, and his name was entered in a register at the railway office on the first floor of Churchgate station some time during the second week of July. However, a day later, the player got a phone call informing that his name was not in the appointment list. As soon as the player realised he had been cheated, he tried to contact the sports officer of the Western Railway but his mobile phone was switched off. Sources said the accused had forged the digital signature of the competent authority on the appointment letters. The GRP is trying to track down the accused who gave the fake appointment letters to the two youths, whether there was any exchange of money, and which railway officials were contacted during the tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wr-files-fir-against-own-official-after-internal-inquiry-reveals-role-in-job-scam/articleshow/85053761.cms||Manthan K Mehta
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Natural gas supply goes ‘virtual’ in tribal areas||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Gas, a government-owned entity, has begun supplying natural gas to consumers in the tribal areas of Narmada district by setting up a system where liquefied natural gas (LNG) is delivered using cryogenic trucks. This for the first time in the country where this new system is used in a tribal belt, said a senior official working with Gujarat Gas. “It is a very difficult terrain for laying pipeline networks. To make natural gas accessible and affordable in the most ‘aspirational tribal district’ in the shortest possible time, the company has rolled out a virtual CGD network in the district by setting up an LNG dispensing facility at Vavdi village in March this year,” said the official.  The system comprises of LNG storage tank and re-gasification facility and is called virtual CGD network as it is not connected to the gas grid, he added. The total cost of the system, which includes an LNG tank of 24,000kg capacity, is under Rs 10 crore. Vavdi is about 19km away from the world’s tallest Statue of Unity at Kevadia and the system is used to supply natural gas for vehicular consumers as well as piped gas for cooking in villages and towns of the district, he said. At a time when Covid-19 pandemic has made setting up of physical pipeline infrastructure in the country a challenge, Gujarat government laid interior pipeline network at Vavdi and connected to 370 households through the system. Plans are in place to connect about 2,000 household in Narmada district using the virtual network over the next few months, according to a government official. While providing reliable and consistent supply of an eco-friendly energy source, the system also saves the cost and time spent to set up pipeline infrastructure. It also allows consumers to fulfil their specific needs through customizable supply. Till date, Gujarat Gas has laid about 33k of internal pipelines in Narmada, especially for last mile network connectivity to households. The company is currently catering over 10,000kg of CNG demand from vehicular consumers daily. Such pipeline systems play a significant role in gas distribution to remote locations in North America and the concept is slowly picking up in India. The systems can transport compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) to consumers in the distribution network. Gujarat Gas won CGD license for Narmada district in the ninth round of bidding that was held by Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB). The company was the sole bidder for the Narmada geographical area (GA). The existing gas pipeline network is about 42km away from Jhagadia. The topography of Narmada district along with eco-sensitive belts demand considerable time to lay gas pipeline network to serve natural gas users across the district, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/natural-gas-supply-goes-virtual-in-tribal-areas/articleshow/85051551.cms||---

The girl is a student of Standard IX, whereas the boy works at an eatery. The boy and the teenaged girl are known to each other, as they reside in the same apartment building. Senior inspector Jaganath Kalaskar of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station said on Wednesday, “Around 1.15am on Monday, the girl walked into the lift from the third floor of the building in order to reach downstairs. The boy, who was already present in the lift, molested and pushed the girl.” Kalaskar added, “The panicked girl reported the incident to her parents after they reached back home in the evening. The girl’s mother has registered a first information report relating to molestation under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).” The officer added, “We have arrested the boy. During questioning, he has admitted to his involvement in the crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/youth-held-on-charge-of-molesting-17-yr-old-girl/articleshow/85051462.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala to move SC against high court order||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan informed the assembly on Wednesday that the government would file an appeal against the high court order that quashed the 80:20quota followed by the state for minority scholarships among Muslim and Christian students. He said that the HC verdict would be questioned in the apex court based on legal advice. “The legal advice we received says that the state government has certain powers to decide on such matters, though the high court had ruled against it,” the CM said. However, he clarified that the government decision to challenge the HC order had nothing to do with the government assurance that Muslim community students would continue to enjoy the scholarship for which they were eligible before the HC order. “There will not be any reduction in the amount of financial assistance or the number of beneficiaries even as we follow the HC order that reservation for minority communities should be based on their population size. There is no need for a worry on that,” he informed the House. The chief minister said there are six different scholarships for students belonging to minority communities. Answering a question regarding the delay in releasing funds to Madrasa teachers’ welfare board, the chief minister said the government would look into the matter and promised necessary followup actions. IUML leader PK Kunhalikutty said the state government would face yet another setback in the Supreme Court, if it appealed against the high court verdict on minority scholarship issue. “Instead of going to the Supreme Court, the government should set up another scheme for other minority communities and use the funds in the current scheme only for Muslim students,” he said. But, Vijayan said that an appeal is being filed to ensure that the state is not denied the powers vested with it. “Whether we get a rap or a pat is not a matter of concern. What is important is that we should explore that option,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-to-move-sc-against-hc-order/articleshow/85051504.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Rs 140 crore in interest-free loans given under MMUY to women||GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government on Wednesday disbursed Rs 140 crore in interest-free loans to 14,000 women’s self-help groups under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Utkarsh Yojana (MMUY), a state government scheme launched last year for financial upliftment of women. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani made the announcement at Vadodara on the occasion of Nari Gaurav Diwas, organised as part of the 9-day celebrations for the completion of his five years in office. The scheme was launched in September last year with a target of covering 10 lakh women (10 per group) and giving them Rs1,000 crore in interest-free loans by the end of December 2022, Rupani said. “Today, we will be depositing Rs 140 crore in the bank accounts of 14,000 women’s self-help groups that have over 1 lakh members. This is a first-of-its-kind scheme in the country that provides collateral and interest-free finance to women’s groups so that they can set up small businesses and contribute to their family’s income,” the chief minister said in his address. Claiming that MMUY is better than the micro-finance model promoted by Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh, Rupani exuded confidence that other states will adopt the scheme for economic upliftment of women. The Gujarat government’s focus is to ensure that women lead in all sectors and perform better than men, he said. “The BJP has given equal rights and opportunities to women of the state. A society can never progress without giving opportunities to its women. In Gujarat, 50% seats in panchayats and local bodies are reserved for women. Of total 1.5 lakh youth who got government jobs recently, 33% were women,” Rupani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-140cr-in-interest-free-loans-given-under-mmuy-to-women/articleshow/85051478.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Stay alert, still not clear if antibodies protect against new variants: Docs||Nagpur: Even as the district continues to report low number of cases and prepares for easing of restrictions, doctors in the city have warned of complacence based on the belief that a large part of the population has developed antibodies and Covid-19 is over. Citizens must not lower their guards assuming that they are now fully protected due to vaccination or infection, they said.“It is a fact that many of us have developed antibodies but it is not clear if they can protect us from new variants of the novel coronavirus. We must learn from the bad experience of US and UK, where the authorities had to re-implement use of masks in public places after cases surged,” said physician and paediatrician Dr Satish Deopujari.The advisory comes amid casual approach of people, who are seen socializing, shaking hands or hugging at public places.NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said sero-survey was limited to some places and not done in city limits. “Presence of antibodies can’t be generalized. The sample size for sero was far less comparatively. No one has until now said we can stop following Covid appropriate behaviour. It can’t be said that Covid is over. Those who predicted this have been proved wrong. Nothing is certain with this virus, so best thing is follow regulations,” he said.GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said experts from across the world say that this is a virus highly likely to mutate. “In case one of the mutants again proves deadly, immunity acquired naturally or through vaccine will not work. If we have to prevent a third wave, we need to be responsible. Active members of the family must get vaccinated, take proper sleep and diet, maintain hygiene,” he said.Dr Gawande warned that it is estimated Covid cases may rise from this month end.Dr Imran Noor Mohammad said, “Those who have developed antibodies can be spreaders. Immunity may wane or a new variant having immune escape mechanism or breathrough infection can’t be ruled out. No one should let their guard down. We may see the same kind of peak as seen in April if Covid-19 is taken lightly.”Dr Mohammad pointed out that the 40% not infected yet include almost the entire population of children.Consultant psychiatrist Dr Suleman Virani said the brain amplifies information of low cases, and relaxes as if there is nothing to worry, and people give up precautions. “This behaviour is akin to earlier times, when they would feel they are going to die even if they had fever or common cold,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stay-alert-still-not-clear-if-antibodies-protect-against-new-variants-docs/articleshow/85046864.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The family of the girl had filed a kidnapping case against the boy, also 15 years old, in Sambhal district. The girl was on Tuesday produced before a magistrate court, where she said that she went to Goa with the boy by her own choice. According to police, the duo was traced to a village in Goa following which they were brought back to UP on Monday. Circle officer (CO) of Sambhal, Arun Kumar, said, “The minor girl was produced before Chandausi court on Tuesday where her statement was recorded. The girl said before the court that she had eloped with the boy by her own choice and was not forced by anyone. She has also denied allegations of kidnapping that were leveled against the boy and his family by the girl’s father.” The girl has been handed over to her family, the CO said. “The boy was produced before the juvenile justice board and he is being given counseling. The girl also denied allegations of being kidnapped by the boy before the child welfare committee. The minor boy has been sent to a juvenile home for now,” the police officer said. After they had gone missing, Sambhal police had formed teams to trace them. On July 30, the girl tried to contact her father after which her location was traced. They were found in a village in Goa. In a joint operation, the duo were recovered by Goa police and later handed over to Sambhal police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/girl-15-tells-court-she-fled-to-goa-with-minor-boy-on-her-own-wasnt-kidnapped/articleshow/85043589.cms||Maria Khan

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: 2 workers die cleaning drain silt manually||HYDERABAD: Two men were killed after allegedly choking on toxic fumes late on Tuesday night after they entered a drain to remove silt manually at Padmavathi Colony in Sahebnagar under LB Nagar GHMC limits. While one body was retrieved in the night, the other body was swept away in the drain water. GHMC officials blamed the contractor for taking up work during night despite clear instructions against it and without the knowledge of officials. There is also a ban on manual cleaning of manholes. The labourers were identified as Shiva (25), whose body was found, and Ananthaiah (45), both from Chintal Basti in Saidabad. The two were not GHMC staff and engaged by contractor B Yellaiah, also from the same area. According to officials, the labourers were using the ‘bucket cleaning’ system and Shiva fell from the ladder while entering the drain about 10 ft deep. Ananthaiah followed him as there was no response. Police suspect that both choked on toxic fumes and Ananthaiah’s body was washed away in the overflowing drain. GHMC officials said that the contractor was told to clean up silt in the drain after residents of Gandhi Nagar, Akhilandeswari Nagar, Snehamai Nagar and Padmavathi Colony complained about overflowing drains due to the recent incessant rain. “It is an unfortunate incident. The work was not supposed to be taken up manually. Though there are clear standing instructions against cleaning choked manholes during night, the contractor ignored it. The work was done without GHMC officials being informed,” said GHMC chief engineer (maintenance) M Devanand. He said a detailed report would be submitted to GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar and action would be taken against the contractor. Vanasthalipuram police have registered a case against the GHMC contractor under IPC Section 304 (II) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), SC & ST (POA) Act and Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Rehabilitation Act, 2013, based on the complaint by family members of the two workers. LB Nagar DCP Sunpreet Singh said that they were yet to arrest the accused. Police was also deployed at the spot to prevent any clash between political party workers. In the evening, 60 Congress workers including Malreddy Ranga Reddy and his brother Malreddy Ram Reddy were taken into preventive custody for staging a protest at the spot against the alleged negligence of GHMC officials and for confrontation with followers of local MLA D Sudheer Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-workers-die-cleaning-drain-silt-manually/articleshow/85053785.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Nagpur||NMC rejects MahaMetro request to maintain vertical gardens||Nagpur: Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has turned down a request from MahaMetro to maintain vertical gardens developed by it on Metro pillars and medians.In a letter to municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, MahaMetro said it has completed the Metro rail construction work from Sitabuldi (Munje Chowk) to Mihan on Wardha Road and Sitabuldi (Munje Chowk) to Lokmanya Nagar Metro station on Hingna Road.MahaMetro invested lakhs of rupees for developing vertical gardens. Now, it will require around Rs5 lakh for their maintenance for three to four years. The gardens need drip irrigation which will incur water and electricity charges.In its letter, MahaMetro mentioned that if NMC does not take over the developed greenery on medians, then the former should be allowed to recover maintenance costs through outsourcing from small advertisements in the median portions.A senior official from NMC’s garden department said the civic body has turned down their request. “The cash-strapped civic body is already facing difficulty in maintaining public gardens across the city. How and from where will we maintain MahaMetro’s vertical gardens,” the official asked. “MahaMetro’s plea to allow small advertisements in medians too was rejected,” said an official from the NMC’s advertisement department. The NMC’s garden department already lacks manpower and this will increase work pressure. “Hence, we refused to accept their request and instead advised them to maintain the vertical gardens and medians through CSR funds from various business houses in the city,” the official said.NMC currently owns medians and intersections measuring 39,584 square metres across the city. However, due to shortage of funds, the civic body has roped in private firms to maintain the medians. In Civil Lines, the medians are being maintained to a good extent. But the civic body has failed to maintain them in other parts of the city. The patch from Variety Square to Janta Chowk has become a filthy stretch in the absence of maintenance, sources in the NMC’s garden department pointed out. A MahaMetro spokesperson said that as per the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act it is the responsibility of NMC to maintain greenery, so they had offered to hand over vertical gardens to the civic body. “However, if they do not want to do it then they should give us advertising rights so we get revenue to maintain the gardens,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-rejects-mahametro-request-to-maintain-vertical-gardens/articleshow/85046888.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘HSC students have scored better in pandemic despite online education’||MUMBAI: This year, there were merely 99,100 HSC students under the second-grade category—the ones who scored between 45% and 60%. “No one is to be blamed for these scores but I would caution students to not read too much into these Class XII marks. These are not a true indicator of where they stand,” said Vidyadhar Joshi, principal of Vaze-Kelkar College, which has 1,534 of its 1,571 students score a distinction (over 75%). The months of June and July were nightmarish for students. School and high school results would bring cheer to some and tears for many. But the past few years have seen a sort of change in the feelings that results evoke. Shubhamraje Junior College in Thane, has 28 students who scored at least 99%. Examples like these are aplenty. The central logic for the high grades is the evaluation formula: BEST scores of three subjects of Class X, scores of Class XI unit tests and term exams as this batch did not take an annual Class XI exam, and college level tests for Class XII. N M College principal Parag Ajgaonkar said, “Sure, we all have better results this year, but students have also gone through so much. The uncertainty, the stress, family members suffering from Covid, and online education would have all taken a toll on them. Also, this is in fact a better reflection of where a student stands than what one exam would infer as this is based on scores of Class X, XI and XII.” But at Jai Hind College a different picture emerges. As principal Ashok Wadia said, “We were transparent and maintained integrity.” While the highest in humanities is 99%, the lowest score dips to 52.7% and in case of science, the college topper secured 98% and the last candidate got 49.2%. In commerce, too, marks range from 97.8% to 61.8%. At St Xavier’s College, too, the lowest score is 58.67% in science which only one student got; all others have got more than 60%. In Arts, the lowest score at the college is 70.5%. HR College head Pooja Ramchandani explained the negative fallout on students who have “lost the practice of writing” and said one needed to look at a “paradigm shift in assessments and evaluation which can be continuous and would hence be comprehensive”. She opened her college’s commerce stream at 98.5% which closed at 60.2%. At the SIES college, Sion, there are no students scoring in the 50s and 60s. “Arts and science results are 100% and everybody has got a high score in the 80s and 90s,” said principal Uma Shankar. At Sant Gadge Maharaj College of Commerce and Economics at Girgaum, 70% of the 290 students have scored over 90%. And there is no student below the 70% mark. Principal Keshav Shinde admitted he gets average and above average students and the scores this year are unrealistic. “Even repeater students have got phenomenal results this year. The pass and second class have just disappeared,” said Shinde. At Amdar Daulat Daroda Degree College of Science in Wada of Palghar district, principal Abhijeet Adhikari is worried about the high scorers. “Every other student is in the 80s and 90s. We may have to at least conduct a viva to fill our degree seats,” he said. A lecturer who was part of the college result committee said that even students who would have scored 35-40% in a written exam have got 70% and above. The HSC results were declared on Tuesday and across the state, 91,420 students secured more than 90%, which is over 1,000% more than last year’s 7,344 students who had breached the mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hsc-students-have-scored-better-in-pandemic-despite-online-education/articleshow/85053802.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The post was lying vacant after the city BJP parliamentary committee removed three-time corporator Narendra Borkar, who held the post for two years, in April this year. The BJP had forced Borkar to resign citing his inactive and poor performance.Though BJP had not announced Kukde’s candidature for the post, party sources said he will submit his nomination on the day of the election. Due to Covid restrictions, the election will be held online.BJP was supposed to nominate Kukde as Borkar’s replacement. However, due to Covid-induced lockdown, NMC could not conduct the election, though it nominated six corporators including Kukde on the transport committee. The six new corporators had to replace the members headed by Borkar, whose resignation from the panel was accepted by both the transport panel and the general body.Borkar’s ouster saw infighting in the city BJP and it became a bone of contention between the two corporators. Borkar wanted to continue in the post and had also cited a state government’s notification which allowed continuation of the standing committee and subject committee chairman and members beyond the end of their tenure. The relaxation was meant for a month in abeyance of elections due to spike in Covid cases. It also led the department to seek legal opinion, which “rejected” Borkar’s claim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/transport-panel-chief-to-be-elected-on-friday/articleshow/85046910.cms||---

Bombay HC wants CA to be made party||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the chartered accountant of ailing Zarin Ghani Walsh, grand-daughter of ‘FrontierGandhi’ Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, to be joined as a party to her nephew’s petition to appoint him legal guardian so that he can take her with him to Pakistan. A bench ofJustices K K Tated and Justice Prithviraj Chavan heard a petition filed last year by Mashal Khan (40) to also authorise him to deal with her properties. Walsh (76), a Canadian national, has resided in India since 1983. She is the daughter of Khan’s eldest son. Mashal (40) is the son of her late brother. In February, the HC had directed a court official to visit Walsh at her Breach Candy home to ascertain her condition. Mashal’s advocate Mayur Khandeparkar said the court officer had visited her and submitted his report. He said an air bubble has again opened between India and Dubai and she can be taken from Dubai to Pakistan. But the state reiterated its opposition to allowing Walsh to be taken out of India. Government pleader Poornima Kantharia said. “We are not disputing her illness. If he takes her out of India, no one will know what will happen to her. My concern as state is who is going to answer for it.’’ Kantharia said the CA looking after Walsh’s affairs and who also holds power of attorney must be impleaded. “Let the CA come and throw light on her properties,” she added. Khandeparkar objected and added that Mashal comes from an “illustrious family” and her properties are of least concern for now. “She needs to be around people related to her,’’ he urged. Khandeparkar argued that the Supreme Court has held that a foreign national is also entitled to protection under article 21 (Right to Life). “This is a peculiar case. Both are foreigners,’’ he added. Union Bank of India’s advocate said Walsh has a joint account with the chartered accountant, Dinshaw Sanjana, and another person Monika Ghosh and that it will abide by the order of the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/frontier-gandhi-kin-to-go-to-pak-hc-wants-ca-to-be-made-party-in-mumbai/articleshow/85054910.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Coimbatore||Fresh approach needed to secure national interests, says President||Udhagamandalam: President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday said there was a need to think of new ways to secure national interests and ensure national security as the country was passing through challenging times. He was taking to the trainee officers at the Defence Service Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington. “The pleasant and salubrious climate of the Nilgiri hills is conducive for learning. And this applies to the armed officers undergoing training at DSSC here,” he said while addressing the officers of the 77th staff course. Trainee officers from various countries across the globe are housed at DSSC. The President, who is on a four-day tour to the Nilgiris, said the nation was passing through challenging times. “The concepts of national security and defence are changing. Geo-strategic and geo-political compulsions and many other factors have made the security landscape more complex. Low intensity conflicts, counter terrorism and non-combat conflicts pose different challenges. There is a need to have a thorough understanding of all the aspects.” In these changing times, he asserted, the nation had to think of new ways to secure its interests and ensure its security. “This would require a fresh approach.” Kovind said the student officers would be given comprehensive inputs during the staff course to help them understand the changing dynamics. Referring the Covid-19 pandemic, the President said the entire humanity was going through tough times and that the pandemic had impacted all walks of life. Kovind expressed confidence that the professional learning at DSSC would enable the student officers to imbibe the required competencies. “In order to become effective leaders, the officers will have to demonstrate excellence in personal and professional domains.” He also appreciated the outstanding grit and determination displayed by the armed forces in dealing with the situation on the borders. Governor Banwarilal Purohit attended the programme at DSSC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/fresh-approach-needed-to-secure-national-interests-says-president/articleshow/85051513.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

ATR, the buffer zone of Jim Corbett Tiger Reserve, falls within the Uttar Pradesh jurisdiction. The step has been taken to ensure there is no disturbance to the herbivore population since, at present, there are 27 tigers in ATR, officials said, adding that the food chain and a balanced ecosystem must be maintained. On Wednesday, Bijnor divisional forest officer, M Semmaran, said, "A good prey base and availability of water are reasons for the increasing tiger population in Amangarh. For this, we need a safe environment for herbivores to breed and grow. This is the breeding season. So, patrols and a network of informers are in place to keep guests, villagers and poachers away." There are at least 25 villages on the forest outskirts. Locals usually take their cattle inside the tiger reserve area for grazing. Besides, villagers also travel for dry wood or fodder. Their entry has been completely prohibited now and several teams have been formed for patrolling, officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/breeding-season-of-herbivores-at-atr-guests-outsiders-prohibited/articleshow/85039730.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Bhopal||Rain fury: Veggies and fruits bite into middle-class budgets||Bhopal: Since the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic, prices of essential commodities have been rising and fruits & vegetables are no exception. But, with constant rainfall, now their steep prices have started affecting the family budgets, deeply.Even as mangoes flooded the fruit markets in the summer this season, their prices seldom came down below Rs 90 per Kg. Summer vegetables like gilki and bhindi were selling for Rs 80 per Kg. As of now, lauki, kaddu and baigan at Rs 40 per Kg are some of the cheapest vegetables available; cheapest of the lot, however, is potatoes for Rs 20 per Kg. Pointing to consistent rainfall over the past few days, Vegetable sellers claim that vegetable prices will rise further in the next few days as vegetables will start rotting with fields marooned. So, parval, shimla mirch and even bhindi could touch Rs 100 per Kg mark in the next few days. “Right from our childhood, we have seen a bumper mango crop one year and far lesser yield next year. Supply of mangoes in the market this summer suggested it was the year of bumper crop, but prices of mangoes remained high till the end of the season. Year before last, we had bought mangoes for Rs 40 per Kg. Like everything else, mangoes, too, have become far dearer. For months, apples have been selling for Rs 200 per Kg or more,” said Vinod Shrivastava, who said eating fruits and vegetables is the best solution to a person's health problems. But, how does one get to eat enough of fruits/vegetables at the prices they are available? "Ever since, doctors, media and dieticians started recommending protein-rich diet to people to develop greater immunity following outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic, prices of pulses and vegetables have gone up considerably. I bought beans for Rs 250 per Kg. How do you expect a common man and his family to have a healthy diet when prices of everything are so high,” said Rakesh Kochar, a marketing executive for an electric company. President of Bittan Market Sabji Vyapari Mahasangh, Hariom Khatik, however, said that vegetables were cheap till recently, but their prices have started going up now and in next few days, they would spike. “Gilki, which was selling for Rs 10 per Kg in the wholesale market is now selling for Rs 20, which is exactly the double,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/rain-fury-veggies-and-fruits-bite-into-middle-class-budgets/articleshow/85048922.cms||---

Students visit the primary school playground even though it was officially shut for classes, sources said. Bhavna Kumari, 11, from Mudhi Bakapur village in Bulandshahr was sitting next to the wall when it fell on her. The foundation wall was built only four months ago, school authorities said. A teacher at the primary school said three girls arrived at the school compound to play on Wednesday morning. Initially, she stopped them but when they kept on insisting, she allowed them to play, the teacher added. “We then heard a loud noise and saw that Bhavna was hurt after the wall collapsed. We took her to a nearby hospital where she died,” the teacher said. Angry over the incident, villagers have demanded an FIR against those responsible. The girl’s parents have filed a complaint against the wall contractor and school authorities. The FIR was yet to be registered, though.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/school-wall-collapse-kills-class-viii-student/articleshow/85043688.cms||Ishita Mishra

The restrictions cover the entire district, including eateries outside the city limit too. However, the rule is being strictly followed only within the city limits.Restaurants along Amravati Road, Kamptee Road, Wardha Roads and other exits from the city are operating openly taking customers from back door.TOI took a drive along the Kamptee Road towards Jabalpur highway between 5 and 7 pm. Some of the joints on the way were seen open. A quick peep inside did not show any customers.A little further on the highway, TOI stopped at a restaurant where takeaway services were open, but dining in was also not denied. Later, owner of the restaurant clarified that only takeaways are allowed after 4pm. “Sometime families arrive on their way from long distances request to be served. Looking at the situation, some cannot be denied food too,” he said.“It’s time that the government eases the curbs. Why should the restaurants be excluded if other establishments can run till the evening. It’s difficult to even recover the wages . Even the last year’s power bills have not been paid, but there is no respite from government’s side on such dues,” said the restaurant owner requesting not to be named.Vehicles were seen parked outside some of the joints which had their shutters were down. Smaller eateries with tables alongside shops easily operated.A source in the hospitality industry said a number of revellers had posted on social media about their visits to restaurants along Amravati Road during evening time.Tejinder Singh Renu, secretary of Sarkar Jagao Vanjiya Bachao Samiti, an organization of businessmen demanding easing of curbs, said even he was pointed out about some highway joints remaining open. “If at all so, it may be due to compulsion as it is difficult to meet the expenses and losses are piling,” he said.District collector R Vimala said such restaurants maybe operating due to lack of police force. “It’s difficult to monitor each and every area and people should also remain responsible,” she said.Superintendent of Police (Nagpur rural), Rakesh Ola said he has asked the police stations concerned to remain vigilant. Raids were conducted on Tuesday and the vigil will continue. “The department concerned, which includes the district collectorate, will also be informed so that further action like cancellation of license can also be taken,” said Ola. He stressed that not many restaurants were remaining open beyond the timings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rules-off-the-menu-as-restaurants-outside-city-operate-beyond-4pm/articleshow/85046924.cms||Shishir Arya

Hospital representatives TOI spoke to said scores of citizens, including those in the 18-44 and 45-plus groups, are becoming eligible for the second jab. And due to shortages at government-run sites, these beneficiaries are finding it easier to get a paid shot at private hospitals. Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, "The number of first-dose beneficiaries has dropped significantly over the last few days. In June and July, we were vaccinating nearly 3,000 to 4,000 beneficiaries daily with the first dose, which has reduced to just 300 to 400. Our focus will now be on second-dose beneficiaries. We have a stock of around 25,000 doses of Covishield and we will replenish that soon." Jitendra Oswal, the deputy director of the Bharati Hospital, said that the number of second dose beneficiaries was set to increase significantly. "Turnouts are low for the first dose. We will evaluate the second dose-response in the coming days," he said, adding that they have at least 25,000 doses of Covishield with them. Snehal Porwal, founder of the Healing Hands Clinic said units are preparing for the surge in second-dosers during August. On Wednesday, due to fresh Covid vaccine supply the day before, coverage improved in the district with a total of 48,675 vaccinations. For Thursday, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has readied as many as 60 vaccination centres for Covishield and eight for Covaxin. Those turning up for a second jab will be given preference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-vaccination-sites-focus-on-surge-of-second-dose-beneficiaries/articleshow/85051605.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Data from district health officials revealed that 3,469 beds will be reserved in the government hospitals, while 2,687 beds will be reserved in private set-ups for children. The beds will include oxygen supported beds, ventilator supported ICU beds and isolation beds. The most number of beds will be reserved in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits (see box). Manisha Naik, PMC’s nodal officer for bed management, told TOI, “This is preliminary planning that we have done regarding the available resources in the civic and private facilities. Apart from children, we have told the hospitals to be ready to treat adults, just like in the previous two waves.” Naik said they would have over 14,000 beds comprising oxygen supported beds, ventilator supported ICU beds and isolation beds for treating adult Covid patients. PCMC officials said they were working on creation of dedicated children’s wards in civic facilities. One such ward was created at New Jijamata Hospital a few weeks back, while another one at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital was inaugurated on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-than-6k-covid-beds-to-be-reserved-for-kids-in-pune/articleshow/85051588.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Dehradun||Let schools open for now, will take call based on Covid scenario: Uttarakhand HC||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday said that schools in the hill state should be allowed to stay open for at least two to three weeks after which it would assess the Covid situation in the state and take a call. All government schools in the state opened for classes 6 to 12 on August 2 after the state cabinet decided to allow educational institutes to hold offline classes. A plea in the high court has challenged the government’s decision to open schools and alleged that many private institutes were forcing parents to sign an undertaking that they can’t be held responsible in case of infections. While hearing the petition on Wednesday, the bench asked the government to issue a circular prohibiting such an undertaking. The plea also alleged that schools have told children not to bring tiffin, but they won’t give cooked meals either as part of their standard operating procedure during the pandemic. The court has asked the government to explain how children would stay in schools without any meal for almost six hours. The bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma asked the government to inform whether school staff has been vaccinated and what steps it has taken to conduct thermal screening. The government will also explain how social distancing will be maintained among children. It has to file a response by August 17. The plea by a Haridwar resident named Vijay Pal Singh has alleged that the decision to open schools posed threat to the lives of the children since they had not been vaccinated and were predicted to be most affected by the third wave of the pandemic. The court has remarked that there should be regular testing on students and schools where a large number of students are found to be infected should shut down. The court also directed the state to inform the court about the attendance of the children and the number of tests being conducted. Schools in the state were closed in April 2020 due to the pandemic. The state government had tried to reopen schools for classes 11 and 12 last year, but the order was withdrawn as Covid numbers went up again. Students of classes 10 and 12 had attended school for a brief period in the early months of 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/let-schools-open-for-now-will-take-call-based-on-covid-scenario-hc/articleshow/85048918.cms||Prashant Jha

Kerala has not received a gain in tax revenue with the introduction of the GST system in July 2017. It has particularly hit the collection of commercial tax, he said while inaugurating an online interactive session with stakeholders on ‘Four years of GST’, which was organized by Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT) on Wednesday. Balagopal said that around 160 countries across the world migrated to the GST regime, but several countries –including the USA – have not implemented it. “I think this is because of practical difficulties and the systemic inefficiency of the tax system. Even our government realized the lapses in the GST system very late,” he said. The serious issue Kerala is confronting on the finance front is the squeeze in tax collection. Unfortunately, GST has not helped to reverse the situation. We thought the opposite when the new system was introduced, he added. “The systemic lapses in the implementation of GST is a major concern as tax revenue diminishes. This should be considered seriously. Tax-GSDP ratio of the state is lower compared to the pre-GST period. Under VAT system tax – GSDP ratio was 16%; it is below 11% now. Consumers are not benefitting through GST as prices skyrocketed contrary to earlier projections. Traders and industrialists complain about the new system and state governments aren’t getting benefits. Hence, a rethinking in the case of GST is inevitable without which states can’t move forward,” he said. Former finance minister TM Thomas Isaac, who chaired the inaugural session, said all states should exert pressure on the Centre to extend GST compensation for another five years. “States should be allowed to make slight changes in the base rates of SGST,” he added. Additional chief secretary (finance) RK Singh shared his concern over lower tax-GSDP ratio of Kerala. The ideal ratio is 15%, but the state is far below that level. Dr Sharmila Mary Joseph secretary (taxes), Giridhar Pai (commissioner, CGST), Rathan U Kelkar (commissioner, SGST), S Karthikeyan (special commissioner, SGST) also spoke at the session. GIFT director KJ Joseph delivered the welcome speech. Around 200 plus traders, industrialists, tax practitioners and officials shared their views across various sessions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/amid-dipping-revenue-fm-seeks-review-of-gst-system/articleshow/85051599.cms||---

The state on Monday eased the Covid-19 restrictions for the bulk of the state, but not for Pune and 10 other districts with a relatively higher positivity rate. A meeting convened on Wednesday evening by the traders, having their shops in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits, to decide their future course of action continued till the time of going to the press. The Federation of Trade Association Pune had decided to defy the state’s order after its requests for an extenion in business timings did not yield results. Accordingly, several shops on Laxmi Road, Sinhagad Road, Karve Road and M G Road remained open after 4pm on Wednesday in defiance of the state’s order Some shops operated till 5pm, while a few closed at 4pm. Pune Wholesale Hosiery Readymade Garment Association president Manoj Sarda, who has a shop on Laxmi Road, said, “We stayed open till 7pm, while some shops kept their shutters half open. Some shops were made to close for the day by police in Raviwar Peth.” Cawas Pundole, president of the Pune Camp Merchants Association, said, “The franchises closed at 4pm, as they are run by employees who cannot take a decision on keeping the shutters open against the rules. From Arora Towers to Bata Chowk, most shops shut at the deadline. But beyond Kohinoor restaurant, most shops remained open till 6pm.” Shailesh Bhavsar, a jewellery shop owner from Sinhagad Road, said, “We just want to keep our business running Though we kept the shop open till 6pm, there was no customer because most were scared of getting into trouble.” Sandeep Narang, president of the United Hospitality Association, said, “About 70% members, who own restaurants, cafes and eateries, operated till 7pm in a symbolic gesture. We wrapped up the last orders for the seated customers by 4pm and only offered food delivery beyond the deadline.” Additional commissioner of police Sanjay Shinde said, “Many shopkeepers, especially in the old parts of the city, kept shops open beyond 4pm. Policemen in plain clothes did videography of such shops. Legal action will be taken against those shopkeepers.” (Inputs from Gitesh Shelke &Sadanand Godse) Gym owners raise pitch for dual slots The Maharashtra Navnirman Sharik Sena (Pune city) is opposed to the 4pm closure time and want a change in the timings so that the gyms can remain open from 6-11 am and then from 4-9 pm “People visit gyms from 6-11 am before their work and then again in evening.

The Union health ministry’s three-member expert team comprising Pranil Kamble, public health specialist, Airport Health Organisation, Pune, Himmat Singh, scientist, National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR), Delhi, and Shilpi Nain, professor, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Delhi arrived in Pune on Wednesday. It has started helping the state and the district officials to identify the possible source of Zika virus infection. “The probable source of infection could be Belsa’s transport link with other states, including Kerala where Zika outbreak has been under way from the early last month (July). But this is just a suspicion. We are working on this link to identify the probable source of infection. The Union health ministry’s team has also started helping us from Wednesday,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said. A 50-year-old woman from the village tested positive for Zika-chikungunya coinfection on July 30. Dhiraj Jagatap, the deputy sarpanch of the Belsar village, said, “Traders load trucks with tomatoes, custard apple and pomegranates in and around Belsar and transport them to states like Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.” He said, “We sent of 152 blood samples of people, including those visiting the village for trade. Barring the woman, no other case of the Zika virus has been detected so far,” he said. The NIV has detected chikungunya infection in maximum samples so far. “It is a mixed outbreak of chikungunya, dengue and Zika but with predominance of the chikungunya virus,” Awate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/central-team-starts-zika-outbreak-probe/articleshow/85051618.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Inaugurating one of the protest programmes at Kamaleswaram, KPCC chief K Sudhakaran said Sivankutty was not eligible to function as the education minister in a state like Kerala. “An education minister is expected to be a role model for the new generation. However, our education minister Sivankutty is a petty goonda. Only CPM and Pinarayi Vijayan can protect people like Sivankutty,” he said. Despite the Supreme Court verdict that all persons, including Sivankutty, accused in the assembly ruckus case should face trial, the chief minister is protecting Sivankutty. The CM is doing so to prepare a ground to insulate himself if the Supreme Court pronounced an adverse verdict against him in the Lavalin case, claimed Sudhakaran. Sivankutty’s claim that he would prove his innocence before the trial court is pitiful. People of the state are paying the price for the mistake made by the voters in Nemom, he added. Opposition leader VD Satheesan inaugurated the dharna in front of the secretariat, former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala opened the dharna at Vattiyoorkavu. Former CM Oommen Chandy and UDF convenor MM Hassan inaugurated the protest programmes at Kazhakkoottam and Vizhinjam respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sivankutty-is-a-petty-goon-kpcc-chief/articleshow/85051675.cms||---

Hitherto, fraudsters have managed to cash out as banks would insist on a first information report (FIR) that can be filed only after ascertaining facts and requires investigative resources. The emergency number helps speed up response by sending a real-time alert to both debited and credited financial intermediaries in the transaction and prevents funds from being withdrawn by the perpetrator. “There is the concept of a golden hour within which we should respond and cut the transmission chain. Also, the first respondents here have to be the banks or payment platforms as that is where the transactions take place,” said Kamal Pant, police commissioner, Bengaluru. Apart from Bengaluru, at least seven states and union territories have now deployed a technological platform, aligning with the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal, with help from the Central government and Reserve Bank of India to deter crooks. Unlike the southern metro, these regions have worked with the Union home ministry to set up the mechanism. The bad news is Maharashtra is not one of them. Joint commissioner of police (Mumbai crime) Milind Bharambe said a helpline to freeze accounts in cases of online fraud is yet to be rolled out in the city. The State Cyber Police is the nodal agency working on the project, but there is no clarity on when it will be ready. For one, it requires a large investment by Maharashtra to set up a call centre to receive complaints and send out alerts to banks and wallet operators. State Cyber Cell (PRO) Superintendent of Police Sanjay Shintre said they are working with the government to start it. A highly placed source told TOI, “The helpline should have got implemented in Maharashtra state and Mumbai due to the high number of cyber offences (online frauds) recorded annually. It is over 58,000 in Maharashtra and 14,000 in Mumbai respectively in the last one year.” The Bengaluru model shows it can even be done on a smaller size to serve a city before it is scaled up for an entire state. Their Cybercrime Incident Reports (CIRs) address high-frequency, low-value crimes like phishing and fake messaging and use an existing emergency response number. Cyber lawyer Dr Prashant Mali said, “We Mumbaikars are sitting ducks for cybercriminals across the country and they are aided by government inaction. The state, even if takes staff from the arms division, can form and operate a call centre to freeze online frauds. Apart from Bengaluru police, Gujarat cyber police too has managed to save over Rs2.5 crore in 2020 after freezing accounts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaikars-are-sitting-ducks-for-cyber-cons-thanks-to-govt-inaction/articleshow/85053833.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Pune||Eight ward limits record 60% of PMC areas’ dengue cases||PUNE: Rainwater accumulation and poor upkeep have sent dengue cases soaring in eight of the 16 ward limits of the Pune Municipal Corporation, which account for 60% (844) of the total 1,400 dengue infections recorded in the city between January 1 and July 31 this year. An analysis of the ward-wise distribution of these cases showed that residents of Ghole Road-Shivajinagar, Ahmednagar Road-Wadgaonsheri, Yerawada-Kalas Dhanori, Dhankawdi-Sahakarnagar, Hadapsar-Mundhwa, Kasba-Vishrambaugwada, Aundh-Baner and Tilak Road-Sihagad Road were worst-affected by the mosquito-borne disease this year. PMC officials have intensified surveillance and preventive measures in these wards in the wake of the Zika virus detection in rural parts of Pune. The mosquito that transmits Zika virus, namely Aedes aegypti, also causes dengue and chikungunya. Private hospitals (1,283 cases) and government-designated sentinel (117 cases) centres have collectively registered 1,400 dengue cases till July-end this year. As most of the private hospitals use rapid antigen tests, civic officials consider these cases as ‘suspected’. The government-designated sentinel centres use dengue antibody tests. Hence, these cases are considered as confirmed cases, the civic officials said. “We have stepped up the measures. Citizens should also do their bit to keep their surroundings clean,” said PMC’s head of the insect control department Sanjeev Wavare. “Rivers that flow through city need utmost care to keep them flowing to check mosquito menace. Stagnation of water due to hyacinth or low water-depth resulting from the accumulation of silt can result in stagnation providing conducive ground for mosquito breeding,” said health activist and medical practitioner Abhijit More. Filling up vacant posts of entomologists/biologists, sanitary inspectors is also key to contain the diseases. “Besides, they need to rope in adequate permanent or contractual staff for identifying and destroying mosquito-breeding sites,” More said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/eight-ward-limits-record-60-of-pmc-areas-dengue-cases/articleshow/85051648.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Trial court can deal with Rona Wilson’s claim on planted evidence’||MUMBAI: National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday told Bombay high court that Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon accused Rona Wilson’s contention that evidence was planted on his personal computer can be dealt with by the trial court. NIA was opposing his petition to quash the case against him relying on US digital forensic firm Arsenal Consulting’s report that incriminating evidence was planted on his personal computer before his arrest in 2018 by Pune police.Additional solicitor-general Anil Singh, representing NIA which took over the case in January 2020, said Wilson was relying on a report forwarded by American Bar Association, a third party that has no standing in India as it was not a statutory body and its members are unknown. “Can you rely on a report for the purpose of quashing the proceedings?” he asked. Singh said the case was at the stage of framing of charges and Wilson’s contentions can be looked into by the special court at the time of trial. Senior advocate Indira Jaising, for Wilson, said an expert must be appointed to probe whether the evidence in question was planted on his computer in 2016, almost two years before Wilson’s arrest. The court will continue hearing the case later this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-trial-court-can-deal-with-ronas-claim-on-planted-evidence/articleshow/85055651.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Four stop bus posing as cops, rob Rs 1.12 crore of courier firm||PUNE: Four bike-borne men wearing police uniform intercepted a Solapur-Mumbai state transport bus on the highway at Patas, about 75km from the city, around 2am on Tuesday and robbed four employees of a courier firm travelling in it of Rs 1.12 crore. The courier firm employees were carrying the cash for delivery to a firm’s offices in Mumbai and Bhiwandi. Hitendra Balasaheb Jadhav (32), one of the employees, lodged a complaint with the Yavat police in rural Pune. According to the complaint, the four men riding on two Bullet motorcycles overtook their bus and intercepted it. They got into the bus and forced the victims to get down with their belongings on the pretext of an inquiry. The four men then assaulted the victims with sticks and snatched their bags containing the cash. The courier firm has confirmed to the Pune rural police that its employees were indeed transferring the cash. But it was not known yet as to for what purpose and for whom such a huge amount of cash was being transferred, the police said. TOI on Wednesday afternoon contacted the courier firm but its officials said, “We are not authorised to speak with the media.” They also refused to share phone numbers of senior officials. Inspector Bhausaheb Patil of the Yavat police said, “The courier company had assigned Jadhav, Tejas Bobade, Vikas Bobade and Santosh Bobade the task of delivering the cash to the company with offices in Mumbai and Bhiwandi. They boarded the bus from Solapur.” Patil said the victims did not note down the registration numbers of the two motorcycles. “The suspects might have even put fake and fabricated number plates on the motorcycles before committing the robbery. The crime occurred in a rural area and no CCTV cameras are installed on this section of the highway,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-stop-bus-posing-as-cops-rob-rs-1-12cr-of-courier-firm/articleshow/85051671.cms||---

---||Bhopal||At 79%, Madhya Pradesh has highest seroprevalence||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh has the highest Covid-19 seroprevalence in the country-wide 4th seroprevalence survey conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Madhya Pradesh was found to have 79% seroprevalence in the survey. Overall, 67.6% Indians above the age of 6 have seroprevalence according to the survey. Serological surveys reveal how many people have antibodies against the Coronavirus infection i.e. ratio of people already exposed to the virus. The survey was conducted between June and July, 2021. The data of the survey released last week shows that after Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar, Gujarat with 75.3% seroprevalence, Chhattisgarh with 74.6% , Uttar Pradesh with 71% and Andhra Pradesh with 70.2% have seroprevalence beyond 70%. Madhya Pradesh is followed by Rajasthan, which has a seroprevalence of 76.2% and Bihar 75.9%. Kerala, which is reporting the highest Coronavirus cases now-adays is at the bottom with 44.4% seroprevalence. Maharashtra may be having the highest number of Covid-19 patients right from the beginning, but seroprevalence among its people is comparatively low at 58%. The fourth survey shows a steep hike in the presence of antibodies in the population as compared to the third one which was conducted between December and January and showed only 21.5% of the population had seroprevalence. Experts, while stating that greater seroprevalence is a “good omen” for the future as more people are equipped with the antibodies to fight the deadly virus, however, warned that precautions are still necessary and one can't afford to get complacent. Coordinator of the Covid combat team in MP, Dr Lokendra Dave, while talking to TOI said, “If there is greater seroprevalence among people of MP, it’s good. But, reliability of a survey like this depends on multiple factors like the sample size or the number of districts covered in the survey and areas from which samples are collected. Despite the fact that it has the highest seroprevalence in the country and makes the state less vulnerable to the third wave, we can’t get complacent and stop taking precautions needed to ward off the third wave.” While releasing the data, the Union health ministry said, “The national sero survey results don't reflect the heterogeneity of seroprevalence between districts and even between states.” It recommended that the state and Union territories should conduct surveys themselves to obtain districtlevel data on seroprevalence, which will be essential in framing public health response measures at a local level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/at-76-2-mp-has-highest-seroprevalence/articleshow/85049009.cms||---

Frequent power cuts result in increased wastage of products, and tools used for manufacturing products often get damaged. At a time when we face financial issues due to lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 infection, we find it difficult to operate units,” the petition said.President of the association J James said many industrial unit owners are forced to forfeit their wafer-thin profit margin to increased product wastage. “While monthly maintenance activities should be carried out, unannounced power cuts should be brought down,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/micro-unit-owners-demand-24/7-power-supply/articleshow/85051742.cms||---

The stone structure, being designed by a Thane-based architect, will be surrounded by 84 trees — one for each of the deceased. The familes that survived the landslide in Mahad and Poladpur talukas of Raigad will be temporarily accommodated in container houses. Six corporate houses and NGOs have offered 35 families (24 in Taliye and 11 in Poladpur) container homes as protection during the monsoon season till their rehabilitation homes are ready. “Twenty four of the 63-affected families in Taliye village have opted for container houses that have all the basic amentities like power and water supply. Those staying in Pune and Mumbai are yet to seek houses. Similarly, 11 container homes are set up for people in Kevnale and Govele Sutarwadi villages in Poladpur taluka. These container houses are placed about a kilometre from the landslide spot,” said tehsildar Dilip Rayannavar. “Government empanelled architect Rahul Samel had on Monday inspected the Taliye landslide site for a proposed memorial on the lines of one at Malin village (struck by landslide on July 30, 2014, killing 151), Ambegaon taluka, Pune,” added Rayannavar. “About 1.5 acre land with scope for expansion has been identified for the memorial,” said Swapnil Burle, section engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-memorial-proposed-at-site-of-landslide-in-taliye-for-lives-lost/articleshow/85054972.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Ahmedabad||HC questions the use of PASA to evict tenants||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday asked the state government whether the Land Grabbing Act and its amendments that allow the Prevention of Anti-social Activities Act (PASA) to be invoked have achieved their purpose. Or is the PASA aspect of the law being misused, the court asked. The HC sought the explanation from the state home department after hearing a case in which a person was slapped with PASA provisions for not vacating a rented house. The landlord lodged an FIR and the person was termed a property grabber and ordered to be detained. The petition against the PASA order was filed by one Jagdish Mehta from Botad district. Police had filed an FIR on the complaint of the landlord of the house which was rented to a woman. The landlord did not like other persons visiting the place. Upon hearing the case, Justice Paresh Upadhyay suspended the PASA order and said that this would become a shortcut for civil litigations, which remain pending in court. The judge also questioned whether the dispute falls under the land grabbing laws. “It is in this background, this court finds that wider issue has cropped up,” the HC said “…as to whether the object sought to be achieved by the government with the introduction of this amendment is achieved or misused.” The court said: “On this point, the response from the State of Gujarat, Home Department is required.” The court said that small cause courts are replete with cases regarding disputes between landlords and tenants. The practice of invoking PASA against tenants who are reluctant to vacate the premises would end all civil litigations and landlords would resort to the use of land grabbing laws, the court said. The court said that the legislature may have passed the law in its wisdom and the decision to include land grabbing in the list of offences fit for the invocation of PASA may also be proper. But the court questioned the decision of the authorities to bring the law to the level where it is used to vacate rented properties. The court has sought a reply from the government by August 23 saying that it wanted to know whether the state government agrees to such a use of the amendment in the law by the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-questions-the-use-of-pasa-to-evict-tenants/articleshow/85051750.cms||---

The judge took note of the fact that the construction of vulnerable witness examination centres was completed and inaugurated in Tiruvannamalai combined court building campus last year while the construction work is under progress at Karur, Salem, Trichy, Tiruvallur and Krishnagiri districts. Similarly, proposals to establish such centres for other districts are pending at various stages.The judge observed that though the scheme came into effect following a Supreme Court direction, there is a mention that it shall come into force from the date of government notification. The court had sought a report from the registry on the scheme, after it was informed that witness in a murder case was being threatened by the accused persons. The court was informed that protection was granted for witnesses from February 8, 2021 to April 7, 2021 by the Theni principal sessions court. Thereafter, there is no specific order for extension of witness protection.

Seth had recently returned to her native place in New Delhi after completing PhD from IUCAA and also secured a post-doctoral fellowship at University of Tartu, Estonia. On July 31, Seth and her brother came to Mumbai by flight and she went to meet a former IUCAA PhD scholar friend now settled in Thane. The two set out for trek accompanied by two more friends, the police said. They reached the fort early on Wednesday and climbed all the way up on foot. Police inspector Vikas Jadhav told TOI that the accident occurred when they were coming down a green algae-ridden step where Seth slipped and fell into a deep valley. Her friends raised an alarm and got some local villagers to remove her. She was taken to the Junnar rural hospital where the medical authorities declared her dead, the police said. “Her parents have been informed about the tragedy and reached Pune on Wednesday evening,” said IUCAA director Somak Raychaudhury. “She was one of IUCCA’s favourite students and it is unfortunate to lose her in this manner,” said Raychaudhury.

---||Kolhapur||Water supply to Kolhapur city restored within 12 days||Kolhapur: Water supply to the entire Kolhapur city finally resumed on Wednesday, Nearly 1,500 employees — both technicians and ground staff — had toiled hard to make it happen in 12 days. All three raw water pumping stations, which provide drinking water to Kolhapur city, had been submerged due to the recent Panchaganga floods. The pumping stations were under water for four days. The pumping stations were under water during the 2019 floods too. That year, it had taken the water supply department around 18 to 20 days to restore the water supply for the entire city. This time, due to planning, the department managed to resume supply in a phased manner. After few days of submergence, the department started the submersible pumps at the Balinga raw water pumping station and after that, the supply to around 25% city was resumed within three days. Nitin Desai, the additional commissioner of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation, said, “We divided the works that had to be done based on our experience of 2019 floods. The teams were given tasks — such as removing the motors, getting the panels repaired, getting electricity supply restored, transportation and coordination. We removed the motors around the same time and sent them to the industries equipped with furnaces. The motors needed heating to dry. Our technicians worked day and night to get the panels and electricity restored.” Even when the floodwater had started receding, the pumping stations that are located along the Panchaganga banks were inaccessible. Knee-deep muddy water posed a challenge to transport the heavy machinery of the pumping stations. However, the staff had to use their physical strength to get the machinery to dry places and load them in the transport vehicles. “The staff and technicians were all associated with the KMC. No outside expert support was taken to get pumping stations restored,” said Desai. After the 2019 floods, the KMC had submitted a proposal to increase the height of the platforms from the pumping stations so that even if the floodwater gets here, the pumping can go on uninterruptedly. The total plan was worth Rs 25 crore and was not approved for funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/water-supply-to-kolhapur-city-restored-within-12-days/articleshow/85044116.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC livid after man ‘framed’ as sex offender||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court criticized Gandhinagar district authority for slapping PASA against a person by terming him a sexual offender. The court commented that it was a “full-fledged framing” of the person. One Brijesh Solanki from Gandhinagar filed the petition against detention order under PASA on basis of two FIRs lodged against him. One was filed for alleged illegalities committed as a store manager in a corporate group, while the second FIR accused him of obscene behaviour in Sector 7 of Gandhinagar by undressing himself before women in public places. The court did not agree with the second FIR and said that this was difficult to believe because Sector 7 is a densely populated locality. The HC suspended the PASA order and said that the FIR and detention order appeared to be abuse of law. The court asked the Gandhinagar district collector to respond to the query how he thought it fit to invoke PASA orders on basis of two FIRs. The judge said that the alleged obscene behaviour in the state capital is not possible. The FIR was lodged by wife of a peon, who works with the state home department. “This is concocted. This is full-fledged framing,” the judge remarked and added, “This is full-fledged framing of this man for extraneous reason. And the collector did it without understanding it.” The court further said to the prosecutor that such practice of invoking detention provision is becoming serious. “And this is taking place unabated in the state’s capital now,” the judge said and posted further hearing on August 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-livid-after-man-framed-as-sex-offender/articleshow/85051791.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Staffers of Air India’s subsidiary in court over their PF dues||MUMBAI: Staffers of Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India, moved Bombay high court recently against the company’s decision to set aside a part of their salary to clear outstanding Provident Fund (PF) and tax dues. The court granted a 3-week stay on implementation of the management’s decision. From April 2019, AIESL had stopped depositing PF amount deducted from staffers’ salaries into the PF Trust. This came to the fore on July 13 when the company informed staffers that AIESL board had decided to ‘set-aside’ 20% of their gross salary to create cash flow to pay these outstanding dues. According to Air India unions, the latest cut combined with last year’s pay reduction would take the total cut to about 35-42% of AIESL staffer’s gross salary. The staff approached police to file an FIR against Air India directors for default. Engineers belonging to Executive Aircraft Maintenance Engineer’s Association filed a writ petition. AIESL CEO Jose Mathew in a letter sent to staffers said AIESL board had on July 28 examined the possibility of arranging funds from various sources. “The board is prepared not only to permit reversal of its earlier direction of withholding salary immediately but also prepared to return withheld salaries at the earliest,’’ said the letter appealing to staffers to withdraw all court cases and FIRs in order to `create a conducive atmosphere for the board to issue the suitable order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-staffers-of-air-indias-subsidiary-in-court-over-their-pf-dues/articleshow/85055785.cms||Manju V

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: More new Covid cases than recoveries in a week||BHOPAL: In past one week more people have tested positive than those recovered. This was just opposite to a week ago when less people had tested positive and more recovered. In past 15 days between July 20 and August 3 a total of only 215 new Covid-19 positive cases were reported, however during the same duration 267 people recovered from the disease. However, if the last 7 days of the fortnight between July 20 and August 3, i.e., period between July 28 and August 3 is considered, then 111 people have recovered from the disease but 113 have tested positive. If this is narrowed down further to last four days between July 31 and August 3—then the gap between number of new patients testing positive and those recovering has further increased as only 56 people have recovered but a whopping 74 had tested positive in these four days. Though it is slow but for the past one week, recoveries are dropping while number of new infections are on a steady rise in the state. Sources said that this could also be pre-cursor of any new surge in Covid-19 cases and it is also important to note that these infections are not concentrated to one or two districts but in past 7 days new cases have been reported from 19 districts of the state and apart from districts like Indore and Bhopal districts like Sagar, Jabalpur, Damoh have also contributed to the tally of positive cases in these past 7 days. The trend which shows a minor increase could lead to further increase in cases if the appropriate Covid-19 behaviour, i.e., wearing masks, maintaining social distance and also maintaining hand hygiene is not adhered to, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/more-new-covid-cases-than-recoveries-in-a-wk/articleshow/85049071.cms||Amarjeet Singh

---||Chennai||2 lawyers among 7 sentenced to death over Chennai doctor’s sensational murder||CHENNAI: A city court on Wednesday sentenced two advocates and five others to death in the case of brutal murder of Dr Subbiah, a neurologist, seven years ago in Chennai. While two others were sentenced to life, the lone approver in the case was released without punishment. The murder of the doctor in broad daylight by a machete-wielding gang was captured on a CCTV installed in the neighbourhood. First additional sessions judge S Alli on Wednesday announced the punishment after holding all the nine accused guilty. The crime was a fallout of a property dispute between the doctor and a Kanyakumari native, Ponnusamy, and his family. Others joined the conspiracy for gain. On September 14, 2013, the gang attacked Subbiah when he came out of Billroth Hospital in Raja Annamalaipuram. He died of injuries on September 23. Police arrested Dr James Satish Kumar and henchmen Murugan, Selva Prakash, Iyyappan, school teacher Ponnusamy, his wife P Mary Pushpam, and sons, P Basil, a lawyer, P Boris and Yesurajan. The prime accused, advocate B Williams, who was absconding, surrendered on August 2018. During the final argument, special public prosecutor N Vijayaraj submitted that all the accused are directly involved in the murder and insisted the court award death penalty to all of them. Now, on completion of the trial, the sessions judge sentenced Ponnusamy, Basil, Boris, William, James Satish Kumar, Murugan and Selva Prakash to double capital punishment for offences under Sections 302 and 120B of IPC. The other two accused, Mary Pushpam and Yesurajan, have been sentenced to double life terms. Iyyappan, who turned approver, was considered as a prosecution witness and was released without any punishment. Directing that all the sentences ordered against the accused shall run concurrently, the court said, “of the total fine of Rs 10 lakh, a sum of Rs 1 lakh shall be appropriated to the state and balance Rs 9 lakh to be paid to the wife of the deceased Shanthi Subbiah, as compensation under Section 357 (2) of the CrPC.” Since the capital punishment has to be confirmed by the high court, the court directed the immediate transfer of case bundles to the high court for confirmation of the death sentence imposed under Section 366 of the CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/2-lawyers-among-7-sentenced-to-death-for-city-doc-murder/articleshow/85051805.cms||Suresh Kumar

The event was attended by the party’s national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra on August 2. A day after the FIR, BSP national president Mayawati on Wednesday targeted the state government for “politicising Covid-19 protocol”. She said that the party’s Brahmin outreach programme will intensify. Condemning the FIR against the BSP workers, Mayawati said, “The BJP government is misusing the state machinery. The FIR has been registered to demotivate and spread fear among the BSP workers. The entire nation has been watching that Covid-19 rules and regulations don't apply for BJP workers.” “I want to make it clear that the series of 'Prabudh Varg Sammelan' will continue. Despite all attempts to stop it, BSP will intensify the ongoing programme,” she added. On the complaint of senior sub-inspector Awadesh Kumar Badhoriya, the FIR was registered against BSP district president Rajkumar Jatav, local BSP member Neeraj Mishra and other unidentified members.

Till July 20, the district had received only 28% of the annual rainfall. Due to this the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had also decided to impose water cuts in the city on every Wednesday. However, the situation improved a bit thereafter and the NMC has also rolled back the decision to impose cuts. “The rains have just touched the 52% of the annual rainfall average. While some of the regions have received good rainfall, others are still reeling under shortage of showers,” Bhagwat Doifode, Nashik’s resident deputy collector, said. The Igatpuri taluka has received 66% of its average annual rains – highest in the region — while at 23% Chandwad taluka has received the lowest rainfall till date. Only five out of the 15 talukas have received better rains and have crossed the 50%-mark while all others have their current averages below 50%. Talukas like Igatpuri, Trimbakeshwar, Peth and Surgana that are on the western side of the district in the Sahyadris along with Niphad taluka have received over 50 % of the annual rains. Last year, the district had received 49% of the average rain during the same time. “Last year, the parched regions of the district had witnessed higher rainfall than the western regions where most of the 23 major and medium dams are located,” Doifode said, adding the rainfall have also helped in increasing the water storage in the dams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dist-receives-52-average-rainfall/articleshow/85044170.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The woman, Zahida Ansari, was riding pillion with her husband, Mohammad Ansari (59), when their two-wheeler hit the pothole near Delhi Zaika hotel at 11.30pm. “It was raining heavily and my vehicle skidded off the road after hitting the pothole. I suffered minor injuries but Zahida was seriously hurt,” Mohammad said. TimesViewThe PMC needs to wake up fast to the pathetic condition of roads and potholes posing a danger to the road users. A woman lost her life in Kondhwa in an accident caused by a pothole. Craters and trenches appear with unfailing regularity on Pune roads every monsoon. What also has not changed is the civic body’s failure to find a permanent solution to prevent roads from getting damaged during rains. Enough has been said and written about the scientific ways to repair and restore roads, but neither the contractors nor the civic body seem to have learnt anything.Mohammad first took Zahida to a smaller private hospital and then to Inamdar Hospital, where she was declared brain dead. He then took her home. “I got her discharged because of financial constraints,” Mohammad, who runs a small bakery, told TOI. Mohammad told the Kondhwa police that Zahida was admitted to Inamdar Hospital around 1.30am on Tuesday. She passed away at home around 4am on Wednesday. A family doctor declared her dead. She was laid to rest at the Kondhwa graveyard, the police said. “We counselled her family and explained the nature of her injuries. We advised them to continue with the treatment but they sought a discharge against medical advice,” Inamdar Hospital’s medical director Pervez Inamdar, who was travelling abroad, told TOI over the phone. Inamdar said Zahida was on ventilator support at the time of discharge. “We don’t know what happened after that. We shared the information with the Kondhwa police at the time of admission and before discharging her, as is routine in medico-legal cases. There is no need to conduct a postmortem in traffic accident cases,” he said. Zahida’s relative, Yameen, said the road where the accident occurred was poorly lit. “Mohammad lost control of his two-wheeler after a truck’s headlights flashed on his eyes,” Yameen said. Senior police inspector Sardar Patil said they would seek all medical reports and the doctors’ opinion from the hospital. “Usually, a postmortem is not required in cases where the doctor is sure about the cause of death,” he said. Former corporator Raees Sundke said the road was damaged due to its use by heavy vehicles engaged in construction work and heavy rain. “I have requested the Pune Municipal Corporation’s road department to fill the potholes to prevent accidents,” he said. Hamid Khan, who runs a hotel opposite the accident spot, said the road is always wet because of water spilling from private tankers. “Vehicles driven at high speed as well as skidding on this road are common,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-dies-of-head-injury-after-2-wheeler-hits-pothole/articleshow/85051794.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Nashik||Cops, ZP join hands to tackle Covid||Nashik: Nashik rural police and the health department of the Nashik Zilla Parishad have joined hands to intensify the preventive measures to control Covid spread in Niphad and Sinnar talukas. As per the decision taken by the police and the ZP, conducting rapid antigen tests will be intensified in the market committees of Niphad and Sinnar to ensure there are no Covid cases among farmers and traders coming to the market areas. Superintendent of police (Nashik rural) Sachin Patil said the Covid positivity rate was under control in the district. However, a majority of the cases, that are cropping up in the rural district, are from these two talukas. Since vegetables, fruits, milk etc is transported from these talukas to other places in the country, farmers coming to the wholesale marketplaces must not have Covid, which can lead to further spread. Patil said currently 10,000 rapid antigen tests were being conducted in the rural district. He said there were many villages of Sinnar taluka bordering Ahmednagar district, where the infection rate was very high. Considering that the residents of these places could visit the neighbouring district for work, the police patils of the villages concerned have been instructed to keep a watch on such people and get their tests done regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cops-zp-join-hands-to-tackle-covid/articleshow/85047179.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Cops in a bind over detention centre for foreign nationals||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The police have landed in a catch-22 situation over the first detention centre for foreign nationals in state, set up on the basis of the instructions of the high court. Social justice department (SJD), which is responsible for bearing its expenses as per the government order, is yet to provide funds, leaving an embarrassed police to utilize their mess fund (meant for the welfare of policemen) to run the centre in Thrissur. “The expenses of the detention centre is around Rs 50,000/month, including food expenses of the detainees, rent of the centre and other logistical expenses; including power charges. Also, the future of the detainees is uncertain as they have no passports and there is no positive response from the Nigerian embassy to deport them,” said a top police officer. As per the GO issued on May 8, 2021 on establishing the detention centre, ‘the social justice department will bear all expenses in this regard including rent, food and other essential needs for the detenues’. Though the order was issued, SJD is yet to meet the commitment. But, the centre had to be established since the high court had instructed the government to do so. The proposals for setting up of detention centres for foreign nationals were kept in abeyance in state in the wake of strong protest against Citizenship Amendment Act as the move to open detention centres were seen as a pro-CAA move by the government, especially when the government was a staunch critic of CAA. However, in an appeal submitted by two Nigerian nationals —who were arrested and housed in Viyyur central prison in a case registered at Guruvayur police station— the court on Dec 18, 2020 observed that foreign nationals are continuing inside the prison indefinitely and the government has not done anything to implement the court’s directive of 2015 to set up detention centres to house such foreigners. The court then directed the government to set up a detention centre within six months and file a compliance report before the court. On April 9, 2021, the same bench issued another order saying that for finding a temporary detention centre, no policy decision is necessary, and instructed authorities to earmark a detention centre within 30 days from the date of the second order. On the basis of that order, state police then instructed district police chief, Thrissur city, R Adithya to find a temporary detention centre at the earliest, who then located a house for the purpose. In 2015, the Centre had instructed all the states to set up temporary detention centres for lodging foreign nationals who have been tried in the country for various offences and are awaiting deportation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cops-in-a-bind-over-detention-centre/articleshow/85051920.cms||KP Saikiran

His posts apparently targeted political leaders and the ruling party during the second Covid wave. The photographer, Kapil Parmar, was charged with defamation and for the intention to cause fear among people. The Disaster Management Act was also invoked. His posts allegedly made references to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani, and deputy chief minister Nitin Patel. Parmar approached the HC through advocate Mehul Mehta for quashing the FIR against him. He submitted that he was suffering from Covid and because of his deteriorating condition, he was frustrated. Therefore, some posts were made against the ruling party and he was accused of objectionable remarks that could spread rumours and create an environment of fear resulting in public disturbance. The HC has issued a notice to the state government and has sought a reply by September 13, when further hearing on Parmar’s plea is scheduled. On April 27, Ahmedabad’s cybercrime police registered a complaint against a person who operated a profile by the name of ‘Kapil Kumar’ on social media. The person is accused of using derogatory language against some politicians. The complaint was registered by one Harishchandrasinh Bhimbha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-pain-spurred-anti-neta-posts-photographer-tells-hc/articleshow/85051880.cms||---

Swimmers in MP urge govt to reopen pools||BHOPAL: Sanidhya Chouksey, a national medallist from Bhopal, is fearing poor performance in the next national swimming meet. Reason: Closed swimming pools in the state capital have snatched the opportunity from him to practice while swimmers of other states are sweating hard as the pools have been opened in their states. Sandihya and other swimmers have demanded opening of pools for practice. The swimmers said that other states including Delhi and Karnataka have already opened the pools and the practice of other competitors is on in full swing. “As a result, other state swimmers have been training and are at an edge in terms of performance in comparison to MP swimmers. In the upcoming nationals, we will have to face swimmers who had a better practice than we had. Will it be a fair competition?” Swimmer Vidhi Jaiswal said that swimming pools should be opened at least for the swimmers who have to participate in state and national level championships. “Let us practise and prepare ourselves for the national championship,” said Vidhi. “Even if the pools open up today, we are still 2 months behind,” said another national swimmer Vanshaj Khanna. A delegation of the Madhya Pradesh Swimming Association (MPSA) has also presented a memorandum to home minister Narottam Mishra. Joint secretary, MPSA, Ramkumar Khilrani said, “Swimmers are not getting trained as pools are closed. We had urged the home minister that the pools must be opened at the earliest. We are waiting for his response,” said Khilrani. Khilrani said that the association has assured the state government that they will follow all Covid protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-practice-yet-for-national-events-swimmers-urge-govt-to-reopen-pools/articleshow/85049139.cms||Ramendra Singh

Farmers estimate that about 40% of their crop has been damaged. Over 200 mm rainfall in the last seven days has caused waterlogging in large tracts of agricultural land in the district. The excessive moisture has damaged chili and capsicum crops cultivated across 12,000 hectares. Firozabad is a major producer of chili and capsicum and supplies produce to major markets in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra among others. Besides, for the past three years, major companies have also been directly purchasing chili and capsicum from farmers here. According to farmers, one kg of capsicum seed costs around Rs 1.5 lakh. Same quantity of a particular variety of chili seeds costs between Rs 50,000 and 1 lakh. The heavy rains have resulted in major crop loss. The entire crop would be destroyed if it continues to rain for another week, said farmers. Rajesh Pratap Singh, a Narkhi block-based farmer who had sown capsicum across 18 acres, said, “Around 40% of seedlings have rotted due to waterlogging in the field. We are trying to route water out of the fields to save the remaining crop. But it is raining repeatedly. With less crop yield this season, the price of capsicum is likely to increase.” Farmer Pradeep Kumar said, “We had sown chili in 10 acres of land in mid-July. Due to excessive rainfall and waterlogging in fields, the growth of saplings has been severely affected. The crop yield is likely to decrease by 50%. The quality will also be affected if the rain doesn't stop.” Firozabad district agriculture officer Ravi Kant confirmed that “continuous rainfall over the past seven days has caused waterlogging in fields. This is harmful for chili and capsicum crops. It will impact crop yield. Assessment of crop loss is being done. We will help the farmers in getting the benefit of crop insurance.” According to the meteorological department, there is a possibility of Agra region experiencing a few spells of rainfall and thundershowers till August 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/waterlogging-damages-chili-capsicum-crops-in-firozabad-farmers-peg-loss-at-over-40/articleshow/85044211.cms||Deepak Lavania

Panchayat president P Kandasamy, however, has denied the charges and said he was ready for a probe.According to the complaint, a public toilet which was in proper shape and used by several villagers was demolished just because it was located close to the properties of the panchayat president and his relatives.A drinking water connection was given to the cattle shed of E Jagan, councillor of ward 6 and a close associate of the panchayat president. Though it was only a cow shed, they have falsely claimed to have built a house in the site and obtained the connection in connivance with the president, the complaint said.The petition said as against the government rules and multiple court orders that reserve sites should not be utilised for any purpose, the panchayat president was building an overhead tank in the six-cent reserve site at Murugan. Similarly, panchayat records show that a kabaddi court has been set up at the reserve site at Annai Velankanni Nagar under MGNREGA scheme. “But no such work was undertaken under the scheme. Funds under the scheme were siphoned off by producing false documents to show that such a work was undertaken,” the complainant said.Documents were submitted to show that a work was undertaken through MGNREGA scheme to set up a volley ball court and people were paid for the work. But the fact is no such volley ball court was set up, said the complaint signed by about eight councillors and the panchayat vice-president.Kandasamy said that they were building the overhead tank in the reserve site because they couldn’t find an appropriate place. The toilet was demolished long back and there were plans to build a new and better toilet. For the volley ball court and kabaddi court, Kandasamy said they have sought more funds and once the funds are allocated work will be done in a full-fledged manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/theethipalayam-panchayat-prez-faces-graft-charges/articleshow/85051829.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Now, part payment benefit extended to SRA builders too||MUMBAI: Over a year after top builders executing projects under the BMC, Mhada and other planning authorities were allowed to pay premiums in instalments, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) on Monday issued a circular extending the benefit to its developers. State urban development (UD) minister Eknath Shinde had approved the move in March this year after the BJP threatened to protest if the file was not approved. However, the SRA issued a circular only on Monday. According to the circular signed by M V Waghikar, controller of finance in the SRA, builders can now pay premiums to the SRA in five instalments. One instalment of 10% and four of 22.5% each. The BJP had hit out at the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for not extending the instalment facility to SRA developers, and threatened to launch a sit-in protest outside Nirmal building in Nariman Point, where key decisions of the UD department are taken, if the benefit is not given to SRA developers. BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha, who is the state BJP treasurer, had alleged that the file (to start instalment facility for SRA builders) was stuck in Shinde’s office for three months. “The SRA has finally woken up and issued the circular. This has come one year late. We have seen the importance of having a home with the toilet during the Covid-19 pandemic. The UD department must take decisions that help eliminate slums, and not just help top builders who make luxury housing for the rich,” Kotecha said. SRA officials said they were waiting for directions from the UD department on whether the rules regarding collection of premiums in instalments will be applicable to the SRA too. “We issued the circular after the UD clarified that the SRA can give the same facility as the BMC,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/now-part-payment-benefit-extended-to-sra-builders-too/articleshow/85055770.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The reptile, measuring around 3 feet in length and 2.5 feet in breadth and weighing over 50 kg, is believed to have strayed into human habitat after recent swelling of the river due to rainfall. Honorary wildlife warden Atindra Katti said it is a first record of a Giant Softshell turtle within the stretch of Godavari river flowing through Marathwada. “It’s a female turtle and we think it is at least 60-year-old. Being a cold-blooded creature, the turtle needs periodic basking under the sun and it must have moved towards the human areas after such session,” he said. The reptile was rescued into its natural habitat on Monday evening after keeping it under observation for a brief period. Katti said spotting of a Giant Softshell turtle is a sign that the overall ecosystem of Godavari river is still intact despite different ecological threats. Appreciating the rescue work, Nanded district collector Vipin Itankar said the district administration was taking all-out action against sand mining and other unlawful activities taking place in and around the river. “We are using manpower and technology to put a check on sand mining. We request the locals to share information about such illegal activities as it is their responsibility as well to protect the river,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rare-giant-softshell-turtle-found-in-mwada/articleshow/85044224.cms||Prasad Joshi

Sanjay Pawar, the Shiv Sena district president, said, “The national highway in under the central government. The Karnataka government cannot stop anyone from using it. Even if the locals want to travel to places like Kagal, Gadhinglaj, Ajara and Chandgad in Kolhapur district, they are being stopped by the Karnataka police. Locals need to commute from one place to another for their daily activities and cannot produce a negative RT-PCR report every day.” He added, “The Karnataka government has also blocked all the internal roads leading to Karnataka from Maharashta and has installed a checkpost on the Dudhganga river before Kognoli checkpost and motorists without negative RT-PCR reports are being sent back from there. If the checkpost is not removed, the district collector should make negative RT-PCR mandatory for vehicles coming from Karnataka into our state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/will-demolish-karnataka-checkpost-sena-workers/articleshow/85044276.cms||---

The two had eloped from the city’s Varachha area a week back. As per the plan made by the two, they had even made an extortion call to the girl’s father so as to prevent him from searching for her. The police said that the couple had been planning the escape for the last three months as the two families, belonging to different castes, were against their relationship. On Wednesday, police brought 22-year-old Payal Solanki and 20-year-old Aakash Khatiq back to the city after catching them from near a toll plaza when the two were on their way to Agra. The couple had kept police running through Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi. Solanki’s father Lakha, a diamond artisan, had lodged a complaint at Varachha police station on July 28 that his daughter had been kidnapped. He also claimed to have received a call demanding Rs 10 lakh ransom. However, police had suspected that Solanki had eloped since she left home on the pretext of going to the market. Khatiq supports his father Rajkumar in running a fair price shop and had developed friendship with Solanki a year ago. Solanki was preparing for a CA course and went to a tuition class where she met Khatiq. Their friendship further grew through Instagram. After the two families rejected their marriage proposal, Solanki and Khatiq planned to run away. “For the last three months the couple was preparing to elope. Apart from saving Rs 50,000, Khatiq had also purchased six SIM cards, clothes and bags. The two had watched several online videos on how to dodge the cops,” said a police officer. They did not stay at one place for more than 12 hours and travelled only by long route buses, police said. After leaving the city they first went to Rajasthan later moved to Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi. They changed SIM cards and mobile phones to avoid getting traced through electronic surveillance. But police kept close watch on their movement through other mediums. They also tried for a registered marriage before escaping. But with Khatiq yet to attain the age of 21 years they were not able to get married.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/runaway-couple-from-surat-caught-from-agra-highway/articleshow/85047742.cms||---

While scamsters would call up people posing as bank managers, now they are using new tactics to swindle money from bank account.Explaining their modus operandi, an official said that a scamster would call up a person and introduce himself as a government employee. “He would say that just like how Tamil Nadu state government had given dole Rs 4,000 as Covid-19 relief in two instalments, the central government is also in the process of distributing Rs 6,700. The caller would ask for bank account details, phone number and OTP received by the caller in order to transfer money. While alert residents refused to divulge OTP details, many inadvertently shared the details and lost money. There is no such scheme from the central government.

BJP unit appeals to Uttar Pradesh CM||AGRA: BJP’s Aligarh unit has appealed to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to name the newly-constructed mini airport in the city after party veteran Kalyan Singh. The airport is likely to be thrown open to air traffic next month. Aligarh MP Satish Gautam said that Babuji (Kalyan Singh) is a popular figure not only in the state but across the nation.

The bridges were washed away in the ongoing deluge. Nath tweeted, “After the collapse of the bridge in Datia’s Ratangarh, now another bridge in Sankua has been washed away. These incidents are serious and worrisome. Only a few years ago, this bridge was built by spending crores of rupees, which got washed away like a leaf in the rain. A high-level judicial probe should be ordered and responsibility fixed.” In another statement, the former chief minister said, “Several districts in Gwalior, Chambal, Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand regions are in the grip of severe floods. The situation in Shivpuri and Sheopur districts are extremely alarming. Morena, Bhind, Datia and Guna are also affected.” Nath said road connectivity of hundreds of villages has been destroyed while some bridges have been washed away in the flood fury. “Thousands of citizens are stranded and are surrounded by flood waters”, he said. Nath said that while normal life has been adversely affected, homes have been totally destroyed and damaged. “Even daily essentials are ruined and crops have been ravaged”, Nath said. The veteran Congress leader reminded the state government that many people have been killed by lightning. He said though the NDRF, SDRF, army jawans, BSF, home guards, police, local administration are working together with local people in the rescue operations but a lot still needs to be done. “Relief work must be taken up on a war-footing to rescue stranded persons and bring them to safety so that casualties can be avoided,” Nath said. Nath also demanded that thousands of affected citizens be given daily essentials, food, clean drinking water and clothes. He said that damaged homes must be provided with necessary materials for repair and reconstruction.

The DMK government set up a commission on June 15 led by retired Chief Justice of Delhi high court, D Murugesan, to look into enrollment ratio of government school students in professional courses such as engineering. “Reports said that only a few students from government schools were being admitted to professional courses and the government wanted to reverse that trend,” the state had said explaining the reason for setting up the commission. “Justice D Murugesan panel has recommended 10% preferential quota, but the cabinet decided to confine it to 7.5% on a par with NEET quota,” a source said on Wednesday. The NEET quota helped 435 government students get seats in medicine and dental courses last academic year. The sources said, “This quota will be applicable to all government seats in professional courses in the state.” The horizontal reservation will not disturb the existing rule of reservation. The cabinet led by chief minister M K Stalin has decided to introduce a bill in the upcoming budget session to implement the reservation. While 40% of the students who pass out every year in TN are government school students, the commission found that only 6.4% were admitted to professional courses last year and it was no different in the previous years. On an average, only 2% of government school students got admitted to Anna University. The data was 5% for law colleges and 3% for veterinary science courses, sources privy to the commission’s report said. The commission found that there was a lack of awareness among rural households about professional courses and their economic condition was the foremost reason for this. Most of the parents also preferred government schools over private schools due to exorbitant fee. “It has been found that illiteracy in rural areas resulted in student dropouts, especially among girls. Many could not complete higher secondary-level education and have taken up jobs for survival. The commission has recommended a preferential quota to uplift the students from rural background who are unable to compete with students from urban areas,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/7-5-quota-for-govt-students-in-all-professional-courses-in-tn/articleshow/85051927.cms||Julie Mariappan

While the government has said that reopening is being considered for higher classes since Covid-19 cases have come down in the state, it has remained silent in the case of primary schools. “We have been conducting street schooling by visiting residences of children for almost a year and teaching them. So it is not impossible to safely teach primary school students. At least for villages and areas where there are no containment zones, schools can be reopened for primary schools in a phased manner. Children need to get back to school at least partially and can’t keep waiting for vaccination,” said K Saravanan, a primary school headmaster and zonal president, Child-Friendly Schools (CSF). He also added that children can easily be given minimum education by alternating between remote learning through video lessons and going to school for two-three days a week. Several primary school associations, including Tamizhaga Arambapalli Asiriyar Koottani and Tamil Nadu Primary School Teachers Federation have already put forth demands to the state government to reopen primary schools as soon as possible. “We are ready to do whatever we can to ensure children study and learn. We even started going to houses of students to teach them since many did not have access to smart phones or were not paying attention to Kalvi Tholaikatchi. We are doing what we can for now but only school reopening can help children learn properly again. Parents too keep on asking us when schools will reopen,” said M Porchelvan, district secretary, Tamizhaga Arambapalli Asiriyar Koottani, Madurai. Teachers also expressed concern over how such young children may lose their ability to even read or write and how their long-term learning development may be affected. Further, the health of primary school students is also a concern as teachers are not monitoring intake of nutritious meals. “At least children from higher classes can learn something from online classes. But primary school level children are not able to adapt to online learning as they are playful and distracted. They have completely lost their routine and are not showing any interest in studying. Socializing is also important at that age, which they are missing now,” said L Kavithalakshmi, mother of a Class II student. Most parents have also returned to work now with lockdown relaxations and are not able to spend as much time with children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/parents-teachers-push-for-reopening-primary-schools/articleshow/85051924.cms||---

Complainant Hira Koshti told police, “On July 25, I went to withdraw money from the ATM but realised that I was unable to carry out the transaction. I was approached by a person who offered to help me with the problem. He asked me for my pin number and helped me out. However, Rs 40,000 was withdrawn from my account later.” She filed a complaint with the police. The cops searched for CCTV footage and tracked the person who offered to help Koshti. The cops identified him as Shyam alias Dholu Rathod, a 23-year-old resident of Meghaninagar. The cops said that Shyam had been caught in a similar incident earlier, too.

Now, as it is implemented during the agricultural seasons also, it is causing much hardships,’’ he said.There should be a balance on how the labour is utilized. Earlier, all of them were employed in agriculture, but as the 100-day work scheme is offering less work and more pay, all workers have moved out of agriculture, he said.Thirupathy said that government should ensure there are workers in fields when there is agricultural activity. Cultivation and weeding can only be done manually. The farmers or owners of the lands could be asked to contribute a small sum like Rs 25, in addition to the MGNREGS wages, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-ensure-mgnregs-workers-move-to-agriculture-when-needed/articleshow/85051943.cms||---

However, there is a chance that the tree might survive as the forest department had made an effort to re-plant the 60 feet tree at Jhalana Leopard reserve. The team reached the spot on Wednesday morning and brought the tree to the reserve with the help of two cranes. Forest ranger Janeshwar Singh said , “NGO Shristi Foundation assisted the forest department in resurrecting the fallen tree. The organisation brought the tree till Jhalana, while department staff transplanted it.”The tree was also pruned to ensure that it did not need much nutrition and could balance well. Experts are hopeful that since the weather is conducive, the tree will grow well at the site. “The reserve has witnessed good survival rate at Jhalana. Out of 12 tress, 11 have survived. This tree was reduced to 20 feet before transplantation for better survival.”Uprooted trees can be saved even a week after falling down if they are re-erected at the same spot and provided adequate care. “It requires additional care if its replanted in a foreign location. Since a man died after the tree fell, it was risky to replant it on same location,” said a forest staff . The process starts with pruning the higher branches to reduce the weight and it was replanted using fresh soil, manure and termite repellent. Amit Tyagi, a local shopkeeper of Nehru Bazaar said, “I am immensely happy that an old tree of the city has been saved. Transplantation of trees is a great service to society. Since, survival rate of new trees is less due to pollution and harsh weather conditions, this practice to save old trees should be adopted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/uprooted-tree-replanted-at-jhalana/articleshow/85051939.cms||---

Experts said if it did not rain in the next 19 days, then 59% of the crops will be ruined. Till date, the district has received 90mm rains, which is less than 60%. Sowing has not been conducted in 30 % villages because of lack of rains. According to information, 4.66 lakh farmers from the district had have taken around Rs 2,200 crore loan from different banks. While cooperative banks disbursed crop loans of Rs 700 crore, other nationalised banks including SBI, PNB, BOB disbursed Rs 1500 crore loan. Deputy director agriculture (extension) Barmer Virendra Singh Solanki said because of lack of rains, crops of bajra, gwar, moong, moth and teel were getting affected. “Now, the damage is increasing with delay of rain every single day. The crops are in the initial stage and need more rains. If it doesn't rain in the next few days, there will be more damage to the crops,” he said. Farmer Achalaram Jat said he was disappointed as it had not rained. “The situation is continuously deteriorating. If it doesn't not rain in the next 2-3 days, all my hardwork will go in vain and will not be able to repay the loan,” he said. According to sources, out of a target of 8.35 lakh hectares for bajra, sowing was carried out in 4.50 lakh hectares. Similarly, target for moong was 90,000 hectares, but sowing was carroed out in 45,000 hectares. The target of groundnut was 60,000 hectares, but sowing has been on only 5,000 hectares. Gwar was sown in 2.10 lakh hectares out of 2.90 lakh hectares. In all, against a target of 15 lakh hectares, sowing was carried out on 9.20 lakh hectares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/barmer-waits-of-rains-crops-wilt/articleshow/85051970.cms||---

An ardent dog-lover, the 77-year-old man of Sithathoor village in Sivaganga has preserved graves of 40 dogs reared by him over the years, who continue to live in his memory. These dogs were mongrels on the streets which he adopted. But the names he called them were as varied as Saritha, Devi, Duraisamy, Nallamma, Vellachi and Ramar to name a few. Thangasamy is unmarried and lives in a small single-room house. Whenever a dog dies, he immediately gets another one, but also builds a small mud grave in his yard for the departed one. Occasionally, he puts some limestone on the graves for better identification. He used to work as an agricultural coolie in his younger days, but now he is jobless and lives on the rice provided through the PDS which also helps feed his pets. Thangasamy says that remembering his pets gives him a lot of satisfaction. He maintains the graves by removing the leaves and debris around it and occasionally places flowers on them. Fellow villagers vouch for his love of dogs saying it is praiseworthy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/77-year-old-preserves-graves-of-40-pet-dogs/articleshow/85051947.cms||---
---||Madurai||App to monitor MGNREGS works to be launched today||Madurai: Workers of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Scheme (MGNREGS) and works carried under the scheme in Madurai and other southern districts would now be monitored using a mobile app, launched by the Union ministry of rural development. The ‘Area Officer Mobile’ app, which will be implemented from Thursday, is aimed at preventing leakages in the 100-day work scheme. Assistant project officer, DRDA (wage and employment) M Gandhiraja, said that all the officials and block-level officers were provided training to handle the app. The app would be used to track the workers on duty, completion of the day’s work as their attendance, and uploading of photographs of the work done per day onto the site. Madurai district has 697 clusters of MGNREGS workers in the 420 panchayats. This is about 70% to 75% of the active workers, of which about 2.25 lakh villagers are enrolled. Active workers are those who have job cards, with their Aadhaar cards linked to the bank accounts. Workers in the scheme are paid Rs 273 per day as wage. If they do not produce the desired results like not digging to the required depth, the wage is reduced to Rs 180 per day. The mobile app would now make monitoring of such activities easier. The workers in the scheme are classified into three - unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled. The works given to them include construction of anganwadis, school buildings, urban bunding works and tree planting. Physically challenged people are also employed in the scheme, where they have to work for four hours per day, against the eight for other workers. But, they are not employed in the general work, but made to look after the children of the other workers or provide them with water or other requirements. “These workers get paid their full wage of Rs 273 per day,” said Gandhiraja. He said that usually the workers come as unskilled and became skilled in various trades like construction after about three years. “It is also a way of building confidence and ensuring a livelihood for them in the long term,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/app-to-monitor-mgnregs-works-to-be-launched-today/articleshow/85051965.cms||---

According to the complaint filed on Tuesday, Narendra Raval smashed kitchen cabinets, the kitchen counter, marble cupboards, and a wash basin. The complainant is Bhavesh Patel, a resident of Silver Cast Society in the Science City area. He has said in his complaint that he had given the contract for flooring and other works to a civil engineer called Umesh Patel. The works were to cost Rs 13 lakh. Umesh had hired Raval, a Ghatlodia resident. The complainant stated that on July 17, Raval had stopped his tiling work. The complainant said Umesh assured him that the work would resume soon. On July 19, Raval had an argument with Umesh over the delay in work. Enraged, Raval picked up a hammer and went on the destructive spree. When the complainant requested Raval to stop, Raval threatened him with dire consequences.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: North sinks, south spared of large-scale flooding||KOLKATA: Less than 24 hours after stormwater had started receding from some waterlogged pockets of north Kolkata, fresh showers on Wednesday inundated large parts of north and central Kolkata. In comparison, barring a few pockets, south Kolkata was largely spared of waterlogging woes as low-lying areas received less rainfall. Ultadanga, Belgachhia, Maniktala, Beliaghata, Burrabazar, Girish Park, Thanthania, Amherst Street, College Street, Muktarambabu Street, Camac Street and Shakespeare Sarani were worst hit by spells of heavy downpour that lashed large parts of north and central Kolkata between 11 am and 3 pm. Going by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation sewerage and drainage department data, Ultadanga, Belgachhia, Maniktala, Palmer Bridge (Beliaghata) and Thanthania drainage pumping stations received over 70mm rain in three hours. The KMC drainage network has the capacity to drain out 10mm rain in an hour. So, the results of the heavy downpour were obvious. Storm water could not be flushed out from most north and central Kolkata areas till Monday night. Motorists and bikers bore the brunt of the waterlogging woes driving down Chittaranjan Avenue, Mahatma Gandhi Road or Camac Street, parts of which went under knee-deep water. Residents of Muktarambabu Street, Thanthania, Amherst Street, Girish Park or College Street called up the KMC borough offices to drain out accumulated water. Inundation of some of these areas has compelled the residents to stay indoors for three days. Take the plight of Sunita Jaiswal, a resident of Amherst Street. Jaiswal, in her early 60s, needed to keep an appointment with a physician at a nursing home located in the neighbourhood on Wednesday afternoon. But, she did not dare to move out of the house as the entire area has remained inundated since the past two days. “I don’t know when the stormwater will recede. I need to visit my doctor at the earliest,” she said. The waterlogging scenario has become so bad in the Amherst Street-Thanthania belt that the KMC drainage department had to press into service extra pumps. In fact, KMC on Monday operated majority of the heavy-duty pumps at the major drainage pumping stations such as Palmer Bridge, Ultadanga, Maniktala, Belgachhia and Dhapa Lock to give residents of north and central residents relief from inundation. In south Kolkata, only Ballygunge and Jodhpur Park drainage pumping stations recorded heavy rains. However, low-lying areas like Kidderpore, Garden Reach, Kalighat, Chetla and Behala were spared of an inundation as these areas received less than 30mm rainfall on Wednesday afternoon. According to a KMC sewerage and drainage department official, all efforts were being taken to combat waterlogging in the event of fresh showers predicted for the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/great-divide-north-sinks-south-spared-of-large-scale-flooding/articleshow/85049311.cms||Saikat Ray

After the exams got cancelled, the state derived an assessment methodology for the students. CIE students were not included in the assessment. They have to write the exam when it is held. Most CIE students are from science who could not get the 50% to 60% needed to qualify for NEET and JEE. Students said admissions for the competitive exams will be in October. If they miss CIE exams, they miss the competitive tests too. “My daughter will lose two years,” said a parent.

---||Kolkata||Aug starts with a bang, more to follow||Kolkata: Repeated spells of moderate to heavy showers lashed Kolkata on Wednesday as a cyclonic circulation formed over north Bay of Bengal. Clouds hovered around the city from early in the morning, with the rain intensifying in the afternoon. According to weathermen, the monsoon trough, which now passes through Sriniketan, Diamond Harbour and stretches across to the northeast Bay of Bengal, has contributed to the wet weather and will continue to trigger rain across south Bengal till August 6. While the city received 22mm rain till 5.30 pm, north and south 24 Parganas, east and west Burdwan, Hooghly, east and west Midnapore and Howrah were lashed by heavy to very heavy showers on Wednesday. Kolkata will continue to receive light to moderate rain on Thursday ads well, the Met office said. A heavy to very heavy rain warning has been issued for East Midnapore on Thursday. West Midnapore, Jhargram, Purulia and Bankura may receive heavy rain on Friday. While Kolkata received moderate rain till an intense afternoon spell, the northern and eastern parts of the city were drenched by heavier showers. Dum Dum and Salt Lake recorded 83mm rain till 2.30pm on Wednesday. “A 8-9km tall cloud column sailed into the city from north Bay of Bengal through Bangladesh. It has been supplemented by the monsoon trough that now passes through Gangetic Bengal. While southern parts of Kolkata received moderate rain, the showers were heavier in the north,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. The consistent three-day downpour across Gangetic Bengal may lead to a rise in water -level in rivers, some of which are already overflowing and have flooded extensive areas across Midnapore and Hooghly, warned the RMC. Low-lying areas in cities, suburbs and villages could be waterlogged and traffic congestion due to intense rain has been predicted. There could be damage to standing crops in the field, the warning said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/aug-starts-with-a-bang-more-to-follow/articleshow/85049282.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Gul was working for a sub-contractor at Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL) and was arrested after CSL reported him missing. Though police are yet to find anything that connects him to a serious offence like espionage, they are conducting a thorough probe considering the sensitive nature of CSL where the Indigenous Aircraft Carrier-1 is being built and tested. The accused came to India on a three-month medical visa in June 2019. According to sources, Gul admitted during interrogation that his family lived in different parts of Pakistan for several years. “He claims he was in Pakistan when he was a kid and his family moved to Afghanistan when he was a teenager. He doesn’t remember the year when they moved. It seems like his stay was mostly in and around Karachi. A probe is on to find the truth behind his claims. We are yet to find evidence suggesting espionage but all angles will be probed,” said an officer. Gul was remanded in police custody for 8 days after his arrest. It is learnt that central agencies, including IB and NIA, had questioned him. He was remanded in judicial custody again on Monday and police will question him in prison if need arises, sources said. Police are analysing the contacts on his phone. South police had booked him under Sections 14 (a) (whoever remains in any area in India for a period exceeding the period for which the visa was issued to him) and Section 14 (b) (whoever does any act in violation of the conditions of the valid visa issued to him for his entry and stay in India or any part thereunder) in connection with the incident. Sources said his father was from Afghanistan while his mother is from Assam. Officers said that when his application for visa extension was rejected, a fake ID in the name of Abbas Khan was forged so that he could work with one of his uncles as a helper. Police tracked him down after CSL reported that he was missing. He was later arrested from Bowbazar in Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/arrested-afghan-native-spent-his-childhood-in-pak/articleshow/85052102.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Traffic crawls in flooded Kolkata||Kolkata: Intermittent rain all through the day slowed down traffic across the city, forcing cops to send out SOS to KMC to ensure that rainwater is drained out as soon as possible. Overall, central and north Kolkata were the worst hit. In the south, the Karaya-Ballygunge-Tiljala-Pragati Maidan belt bore the brunt. Even though the intensity of the rain decreased towards evening, there was no respite for home-bound commuters. A bus got stuck under the Patipukur underpass yet again but passengers managed to vacate it well in time. Waterlogging — from ankle-deep to even to the knees — was reported from Patipukur and Ultadanga underpasses, Amherst Street, Muktarambabu Street and CR Avenue in north and central Kolkata. Water that accumulated near the Brabourne Road flyover close to North Port police station hampered traffic on Strand Road. Similar was the situation on the Park Circus Connector — between Science City and Gobinda Khatik Road. There was congestion on Congress Exhibition Road too. Waterlogging on certain pockets of DH Road and Biren Roy Road meant that traffic movement crawled along these stretches. On CR Avenue, such was the rush that cops had to use double green signal cycles (open signal for two cycles instead of one) to clear the Esplanade-bound traffic at all major crossings. On EM Bypass, Ruby and Parama crossing witnessed heavy traffic rush.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traffic-crawls-in-flooded-kolkata/articleshow/85049366.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Four years into the driving job, she wanted to learn to operate earthmovers and approached several firms, only to be turned away. But Saru Syndicate, an earthmover sales agency, came forward to help her.“While women can fly airplanes, why not earthmovers? It is not as difficult as one would think. Given proper training, anyone can operate them. People are often surprised seeing me operate the giant machine. I think it should be made normal. But it can take place only when more women choose the profession,” Angala told TOI.Managing director of Saru Syndicate Rukkumani Samiappan said the firm plans to train 100 more women. “We want to change the notion that women work only in specific sectors. Women should be allowed to pursue their dreams so that they can bring out their best,” she said.Angala now works as a demo vehicle operator at Saru Syndicate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/she-moved-heaven-earth-to-operate-excavators/articleshow/85052017.cms||---
---||Jaipur||No govt rules to trust pvt gemstone certifications, retailers’ price||Jaipur: Recently, the Centre had issued mandatory hallmarking guidelines for gold jewellery to protect consumers from being duped. But people buying diamonds and semi-precious stones are still not protected. Hundreds of private labs have mushroomed in the country issuing certification for diamonds and semi-precious stones. There are no government guidelines or standards for these certifications, which leave the role of fixing prices at the hands of retailers and the certification labs.Sources in the industry said some of the labs issue certifications as per retailers’ wish, thereby shortchanging the consumer. The consumer are forced to pay higher prices for gemstones and diamonds, which are of much lesser value.The country’s accreditation agency, the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL), does not have any guidelines for these labs. While the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council of India has two labs - Jaipur and Delhi —, it cannot cater to the huge transactions happening every day. Besides GJEPC’s labs, most traders and retailer said standards of testing and certification done by Gemological Institute of America (GIA), International Gemological Institute (IGI), Gemmological Institute of India (GII) and Indian Diamond Institute (IDI) are more trusted. But the network of their labs falls far short of the demand from the country’s huge retail market. This has led to the mushrooming of the private labs which neither have proper equipment, trained people nor the transparency in the absence of government guidelines. In July last year, GJEPC had proposed recommendations to the ministry of commerce for bringing in minimum requirements with which a laboratory has to comply with and demonstrate its competency to carry out grading of diamonds and identification of gemstones and pearls, along with their disclosure in consistent and clear terms. “The gem testing procedures are becoming similar to those of any other material testing in a laboratory and therefore, it is extremely important to formulate/ lay down minimum acceptable protocols to be followed for certification. This would enhance the credibility of certification resulting in consumers transacting with greater degree of confidence,” GJEPC had said in the recommendations.Convener of gem testing lab of GJEPC Vijay Kumar Chordia said, “It is difficult to lay down specific standards as gemstones have varied range with regard to colour, quality, size, etc. But broad guidelines with regard to if a piece if natural or man-made or heated can be formulated.”Some retailers said admitted that the issue of transparency in the colour stone business would be difficult to achieve but some there needs to be some regulatory compliance mechanism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-govt-rules-to-trust-pvt-gemstone-certifications-retailers-price/articleshow/85052005.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Dismissing a writ petition moved by a lawyer, a bench of Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh said that from records it was evident that he did not have any real threat to his life and property. Justice Singh observed, “ The security should be provided only to those who face real threat to life for having done some work in the interest of the society or the nation from terrorist/naxalite or organized gangs and not otherwise. A personal enmity with other would not come within the parameters for assessing the threat perception of the applicant for providing him security.” The bench also directed its registry to send copy of the instant judgment to the chief secretary, additional chief secretary (home) and director general of police, for taking decision accordingly for providing security to an individual. Petitioner, Abhisekh Tiwari, had filed the petition alleging that he is an advocate in Lucknow bench of the Allahabad HC and practices on criminal side and also files PILs in the HC to raise public interest issues and as such he has got threat to his life and property and he should be granted security cover. The petitioner had challenged an order of April 2021 passed by authorities refusing him security on the basis of recommendation made by a security committee that he had no real threat to his life and liberty. Additional chief standing counsel Amitabh Rai pointed out that the petitioner’s annual income was Rs 4.50 lakh and he never lodged any FIR against individuals or others, indicating that he had any threat from him or them. The petitioner was earlier granted security from Jaunpur at 10% expenses, though he has no threat perception. “If the petitioner’s contention is accepted then every advocate, practising on criminal side would be required to be given personal security,” Rai said. Turning down the plea, the bench further observed, “As a matter of principle, private individuals should not be given security at the state’s cost unless there are compelling transparent reasons, which warrant such protection, especially if the threat is linked to some public or national service they have rendered and, the security should be granted to such persons until the threat abates. But, if the threat perception is not real, it would not be proper for the government to grant security at the cost of tax payers money and to create a privileged class.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/grant-security-only-when-threat-perception-real-hc/articleshow/85054102.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

The CCTV camera footage of over three dozen locations was examined to find some clues about the accused. The alleged rape had taken place in the early hours of June 7, when the city was under strict lockdown. According to police, the 23-year-old girl was returning home from a pub in a car driven by his friend, who was in an inebriated condition. The girl had a verbal spat with the friend who left her near the Kamla Nehru Nagar flyover.As the girl was left stranded alongside the road, two suspects overpowered her and forcefully took her behind bushes where they allegedly took turns to rape her. The girl managed to escape from the captivity of the accused and sought help from Bhankrota police station. Despite all the technical investigation, the accused could not be arrested. One of the investigators claimed that the girl was not able to properly recall the crime due to the ordeal she had gone through. Police said the identification process was completed following extensive fieldwork, but the accused are still absconding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bhankrota-rape-case-accused-identified-but-still-on-run/articleshow/85051979.cms||---
---||Madurai||Madurai: ‘House of Pennycuick’ actually wasn’t his, say historians, fans||MADURAI: A charming cottage, with tiled roof and steps leading into it, stands amidst a cluster of tamarind and neem trees on a sprawling campus on the Madurai-Natham road on the northern side of Madurai city. It is now at the centre of a political controversy. The site selected for the Kalaignar Memorial Library has run into controversy as it is said to be the residence of Col John Pennycuick, who constructed the Mullaperiyar dam, and is hero-worshipped by many villages in the southern districts. But historians and even his fans say chances of Pennycuick having resided in Madurai were next to impossible. One of the first announcements made by the new government in Tamil Nadu was the establishment of the Rs 70 crore library in Madurai. The house on this PWD land, which has a quaint British-era look about it, was popularly known as the house in which Col Pennycuick lived. So, when the decision was announced to construct the library on this land, a section of the farmers, the Periyar-Vaigai Ayacut Farmers Federation, opposed it saying the house of Pennycuick should not be demolished. The opposition parties, including AIADMK and PMK, also opposed the site selected, insisting that it was a heritage site. Madurai district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar said the building was constructed between 1912 and 1913, after the death of Pennycuick on March 9, 1911. This information was obtained from the PWD’s building registry. PWD minister E V Velu said the AIADMK was opposing a development activity without basis. Historian S Duraisamy, who has researched the life of Col Pennycuick in his thesis, ‘The Periyar Project A Study’, said, “I visited archives in Chennai and I have seen handwritten letters by Pennycuick and his correspondence with the British government for the construction of the dam. But nowhere was there any reference to him having lived in Madurai.” Duraisamy said the distance from Madurai to Thekkady where the Mullaperiyar dam had been constructed would have made it impossible for the engineer to set up a campsite in Madurai. Meanwhile, his diehard fans and worshippers in Palarpatti led by O Andi, 42, who has been celebrating the birth anniversary of Pennycuick in his village since 2000, had written booklets on the late engineer. He believes Pennycuick did not reside in Madurai. Andi has named his daughter Sara Sanjugi after Pennycuick’s mother Sarah. There are many who have Pennycuick as part of their name in Palarpatti and Veerapandi villages. The house that he lived in the Lower camp near the dam is where his belongings have been showcased. There is a memorial and bronze bust of Pennycuick too. “This is memorable enough,” said Shanmugam, a villager from Theni who worships the engineer’s photograph.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/house-of-pennycuick-actually-wasnt-his-say-historians-fans/articleshow/85052023.cms||---

According to police sources, the victim is a Class XII student in a private school. The girl had got acquainted with one of the accused through social media in 2019. The accused developed an affair with the girl on the promise of marrying her. Later, he sexually assaulted the girl and also captured the intimate videos. He threatened to release the videos and extorted Rs 50,000 from the victim, sources said. Meanwhile, the accused also shared the videos with the second accused who in turn blackmailed the victim to take more of her naked photos. The main accused had also posted the videos online before deleting them in a few minutes. The accused were arrested and booked under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, 67 (ii) of the IT Act and sections 354B, 354C of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/2-held-for-sexually-assaulting-girl-taking-video/articleshow/85051996.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Pockets around airport, stretches of Salt Lake, New Town waterlogged||Kolkata: Fliers and airline crew were delayed for the second time in a week after torrential rain flooded the area between Chinar Park and Haldiram’s on Wednesday. But while the Chinar Park crossing and service roads on both sides of VIP Road were under knee-deep water, the main thoroughfare was comparatively drier — unlike last Friday when it went under water between Teghoria and Kaikhali. “Traffic was slow, but it was still moving. Unlike last Friday, the Kestopur flyover was usable. We were saved because it rained a little less than last week. But the authorities need to do something to solve this situation,” said an airport official who was caught in traffic for three hours last Friday and was again stuck on Wednesday. He was able to report on duty after a 45-minute delay. There were no recorded no-shows as airline officials said they allowed people reporting late because of the weather. Several parts of New Town, Salt Lake, Sector V, Dum Dum and Lake Town were inundated with rainwater entering multiple complexes in New Town. While residents of several high-rises in Action Area I complained of waterlogging inside and outside their premises, residents of East Enclave at AF Block in New Town said their elevator shafts were flooded and they had to disconnect power supply to them. “We operated two pumps, but even then the water remained inside the buildings till late in the night. Elevators were switched off and elderly residents had no option but to climb the stairs. The waterlogging problem in this part is growing every day. Three flat owners out of 16 in our building have shifted elsewhere after being fed up with the waterlogging issue,” said Arun Mullick, a resident of East Enclave. NKDA authorities opened a control room to check the situation overnight. “All the pumps were operated, but with the Bagjola canal overflowing, flushed out water was moving back on to land. Engineers will chalk out short-term and long-term measures to minimize the waterlogging problem once the rain eases,” said an NKDA official. TOI had written about the state public health engineering (PHE) department working to set up a new drainage pumping station near Chinar Park junction in Rajarhat to solve the waterlogging problem at Haldiram’s junction. In Salt Lake, there was waterlogging on the roads in front of City Centre I, Poura Bhavan, Karunamoyee and other places, specially on the low-lying areas and pockets off the eastern drainage canal — which was overflowing. “The locality was inundated just like last week, but this time the water also receded fast,” said Dipankar Mitra, a resident of CL Block. BMC officials said around 134 pumps were operated across Salt Lake and Rajarhat and the utility access holes in several places were opened up by the civic staff to flush out the water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pockets-around-airport-stretches-of-salt-lake-new-town-waterlogged/articleshow/85049339.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh moves Bombay HC against probe committee summons||MUMBAI: Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh has moved the Bombay high court challenging the order of a one-member inquiry committee summoning him to appear before it on August 6. Justice (retd) K U Chandiwal was appointed to probe allegations of corruption and malpractices against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh on Singh’s March 20 letter to the chief minister. Singh’s petition said that the HC, on April 5, while rejecting Deshmukh’s petition to quash CBI inquiry against him, held that prima facie a cognisable offence has been made out against him. The CBI was directed to conduct a preliminary inquiry noting there are serious allegations against him. The Supreme Court upheld the HC order. Singh’s petition said the scope of the inquiry committee was adjudicated by the high court and Supreme Court and questions whether the committee can continue with its inquiry. Stating that he cannot be compelled to depose before the committee and face cross-examination, Singh urged the HC to declare that the committee’s scope is adjudicated and nothing survives for inquiry. Among interim reliefs, he has sought stay on the proceedings before the committee and on the summons for deposition and cross-examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-param-bir-moves-hc-against-probe-committee-summons/articleshow/85054999.cms||---

While the district has been testing between 7,000-8,000 samples per day, the number of samples tested per day is around 5,600 for the past two days. However, the Covid-19 positivity rate is still low at 0.4%. The average Covid-19 cases per day in the district have also dropped from being around 60 in the mid-July to 20. “We are testing all those with Covid-19 symptoms and all suspected cases, contacts of Covid-19 positive patients and fever patients who come to primary health centres. Some are also voluntarily coming forward to get tested if they suspect they have Covid-19 symptoms,” said Dr K V Arjun Kumar, deputy director of health services, Madurai. With the number of Covid-19 cases coming down drastically in the district, not many are coming to the fever camps. “Covid-19 testing is done judiciously. In the areas where fever camps are being conducted, health officials are going door-to-door to check on possible cases. Samples are being lifted if a person has a cough or sore throat. This is to ensure that we identify cases early,” said Dr Arjun Kumar. The senior health official also added that Covid-19 awareness activities are also actively underway in the district. Measures are also in place to prevent crowding in public places and enforce wearing masks. Those with symptoms of Covid-19, including fever, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell etc., are advised to immediately consult a doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/daily-testing-down-to-5600-samples-in-madurai-district/articleshow/85052043.cms||---

They spend around Rs 35,000-40,000 per month through mutual contribution for their medical care and treatment.Currently, the Hada family is taking care of around 35-36 stray dogs, suffering from diseases and injuries, 16-17 of the dogs are at their residence and others are at the shelter home in Borekhandi area.On the report that their dog shelter was surrounded by overflowing Chandrawati river and water had entered into the shelter home posing a threat to the lives of dogs there, he and his sister rushed to the spot, Navneet said.Since the water had already gushed into the shelter home, they pulled the dogs onto a tin shed roof and called for help at control room and other helpline numbers, but each of them initially responded that the rescue teams were engaged at other places, he said.“I eventually uploaded a video of the flooding shelter home and called for help and also started making arrangements at personal level for shifting the dogs as there were several crocodiles in the flooding waters,” he added.However, a rescue team from KMC reached the spot with a boat around 1pm and the 15 dogs were rescued from the shelter home and shifted to another place, he added.“We received a report that three persons were trapped in a house in Borekhandi area, but the rescue team found several dogs also, however, all of them have been rescued,” fire officer at KMC (North), Janak Jakiya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/15-stray-dogs-rescued-as-flood-water-gushes-into-shelter-home/articleshow/85052021.cms||---
---||Delhi||'Children get well early, no long Covid'||NEW DELHI: Long lasting symptoms of Covid-19 are rare in children, a new study published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal has confirmed. Children typically get better after six days of the infection and the number that experience symptoms beyond four weeks is low, just around 4%. The study, based on data reported through a smartphone app by parents and caregivers, provides the first detailed description of Covid in symptomatic school-aged children and reassures that long-term symptoms are rare. In contrast, multiple studies of Covid patients in India and abroad have established that adults continue to suffer from prolonged illness for many months in a condition termed Long Covid. Responding to the new findings, Dr Anupam Sibal, senior paediatric gastroenterologist at Apollo Hospitals, said, “Even in India, in both the first and the second wave of infection, most kids with Covid were asymptomatic. They got diagnosed only because some family member had tested positive and they were tested too.” He added that the few children who were symptomatic suffered mild fever, cough and loss of sense of smell. “Only around 1% of the children who tested positive for Covid required hospitalisation because of multi-systemic inflammation,” Sibal said. In the new Lancet study, the researchers used data collected through the ZOE Covid Study smartphone app related to 250,000 children aged five-17 years in the UK. Symptoms were reported through the app by their parents or carers, rather than assessed directly in children. The team did not collect data on school attendance, a statement from The Lancet said. Most children recovered within four weeks, with a minority experiencing symptoms after a month (4.4%, 77 out of 1,734). Typically, they had only two symptoms remaining after four weeks. The commonest symptom experienced by children with long illness was fatigue, with 84% (65 of 77) reporting fatigue at some point in their illness as a persistent symptom. Headache and loss of sense of smell were also common, each symptom experienced by 77.9% of the children at some stage of their illness. However, headache was more common early in illness while loss of sense of smell tended to occur later and to persist longer. Of the 1,379 children who developed symptoms at least two months before the end of the study period (on or before December 29, 2020), fewer than 2% experienced symptoms for longer than eight weeks (1.8%, 25 of 1,379). Older children were typically ill longer than primary-school-aged children (average illness duration seven days for those aged 12-17 years against five for those 5-11 years), the researchers found. Professor Emma Duncan of King’s College, London, lead and senior author of the study, said, “It is reassuring that the number of children experiencing long-lasting symptoms of Covid is low. Nevertheless, a small number do experience long illness with Covid, and our study validates the experiences of these children and their families.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/children-get-well-early-no-long-covid/articleshow/85052101.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

He had left the handbag behind in a trolley, according to airport sources. However, thanks to Manish Jadhav, an airport security staffer who supervises the parking area, the Delhi-returned passenger got his bag back. “I was on duty from 6am onwards. I was just inspecting the trolleys, when I found the bag lying unattended. I immediately clicked a picture and sent it across to my security supervisor, who later submitted it to the terminal manager’s office,” Jadhav told TOI. Airport officials confirmed that the passenger returned to the city airport a couple of hours later, and upon checking with the terminal manager, he received his bag intact. Jadhav, who is a resident of Kalol near Gandhinagar, travels to the airport every day on a motorcycle. He has been working at the city airport since November and airport sources said that Jadhav is a serial do-gooder who has returned lost, forgotten and abandoned belongings of several passengers transiting through the city airport. “In December last year, Jadhav had spotted a wallet at the airport premises which he immediately took and handed over to the security supervisor. The purse contained Rs 97,000 in cash,” said the source. Prior to working at the city airport, Jadhav had worked at a residential building as a security supervisor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/airport-staffer-returns-bag-forgotten-by-flyer/articleshow/85052033.cms||Niyati Parikh

They have put up no-entry boards in front of houses, urging neighbours, friends, relatives and door-to-door salespeople to keep out of property.M K Shakunthala, a 66-year-old resident of Police Quarters in Ganapathy, said she was previously staying in a housing complex. “We are a family of three, including my daughter and granddaughter. We shifted to this house after the Covid-19 outbreak, to avoid people. I had told my relatives and friends to keep away for some time, explaining the gravity of the situation. After hawkers and marketing people knocked at the door, I had to instal a no-entry board,” she told TOI.Some of her neighbours criticized her for keeping the board, said Shakunthala. “One of them later tested Covid positive. People should realise that the infection is spreading through those close to them.”People are still careless though they have seen the worst of the pandemic, said P Kesavan of Avarampalayam. “Getting infected could prove to be a nightmare, which we do not want to undergo. We somehow escaped the first and the second wave. We do not want to take a chance now. So, we have put up a board outside the house, discouraging people from visiting us. What we have done is not new. Many apartments have restricted entry to outsiders.”Some people in rural areas also have been staying away from large gatherings.

Candidates between all India rank (AIR) 24 to 216 have taken admission this time. Of the four in the top 100 on the merit list from Bengal, three have chosen NUJS. Bengal topper Ameya Deb, who had ranked eighth nationally, has however chosen to join NLS Bangalore. The first list, after getting the nod from NUJS, will be released by the Consortium of National Law Universities on Thursday. The three others in the top 100 on the merit list who have taken admission to NUJS are Debarshi Ghosh Dastidar, Rohit Roy and Vanshika Agarwal, who have ranked 24, 35 and 89 respectively. “I have found out that there’s hardly any difference in the quality of teaching across the top law schools. Since NUJS is among them, I chose to stay back,” Ghosh Dastidar said. Roy said, “I wanted to stay in Kolkata because I wanted a work-life balance. There are many activities I am involved in here and I didn’t want to give them up by choosing another city.” Out of the 125 seats, 72 are general, of which 22 are reserved for domiciled candidates from Bengal. This is over and above the 18 seats for NRIs, two seats for foreigners and two for Jammu & Kashmir candidates taken from the national merit list. “This time, we have a citizen from the UK and another from the US. Vanshika Gupta and Sahithi Ragampudi are both foreign passport holders but with roots in India,” said Nirmal Kanti Chakraborty, vice-chancellor of NUJS. The two candidates from Jammu & Kashmir — Abdul Hannan Kirmani and Murtaza Hussain — have ranked 256 and 490 nationally. This is the second year in a row when candidates are not coming in for physical counselling. “While they had to submit documents only to the respective law schools last time, this year students have to also submit to the Consortium for double checking. Last year’s “virtual” batch has now gone up to the second year. We couldn’t have imagined in the pre-pandemic times that we would teach an entire batch without meeting anyone,” Chakraborty said. Classes will start in the online mode from August 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nujs-first-ug-list-today-3-from-all-india-100-on-board/articleshow/85049398.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The initiative will facilitate transportation of large size cargo including textile machineries, spare parts and readymade garments from Coimbatore, Air India officials said. At present, cargo weighing 150kg per single piece can be shipped from Coimbatore airport, which can accommodate only narrow-body aircraft. “The new facility will help traders to move bigger consignments to other airports that have wide-body aircraft,” an official said. “Goods intended to be exported from other airports will be cleared by customs at the Coimbatore airport itself. Cargo trucks will be sealed by customs department after certifying goods, so that they need not to be certified by customs at the airport from where the consignment is airlifted. The facility will also help cargo agents in Coimbatore to handle more consignments.”It is a first-of-its-kind facility, Air India Coimbatore station manager Girija Ramesh said. “The trucking system is backed by Air India’s digital processes. It will hugely benefit the logistics community in Coimbatore.” Representatives of trade bodies attended the launch event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/customs-bonded-trucking-facility-boon-for-exporters/articleshow/85052055.cms||---

According to department officials, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) returns the total money amounting to approximately Rs 10 crore (of the 1,03,664 pensioners) to the state government’s treasury due to errors in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. “These errors have occurred due to changes made in the bank’s ISFC codes (because of merger of banks) or their bank account numbers. Due to this, their Jan Aadhar cards have not been updated with fresh account numbers or IFSC codes. Hence, the money doesn’t get transferred to their bank accounts,” said an official. “The number of such pensioners has accumulated over a long period of time who hasn’t updated their bank account details on Jan Aadhar cards. Around 1.5 lakh such beneficiaries have already updated their bank account details,” the official added. “ “Jan Aadhar number is linked with RajSSP portal (where applications of applicants are uploaded) and all details pertaining to bank accounts and other information are updated on the number.”The department has launched a campaign to reach out to these beneficiaries and update their bank account details on Jan Aadhar cards. Samit Sharma, secretary of the social justice and empowerment department, said, “The districts have been instructed to contact these beneficiaries and rectify the errors by updating their bank account details. Due to these errors, money doesn’t get transferred to their accounts. Even though the number is just 1% of the total beneficiary, we have to rectify the errors.”According to the RajSSP portal, there are 86.14 lakh pensioners in the state. Among the total pensioners, 57.34 lakh beneficiaries of old-age pension scheme, 5.19 lakh are beneficiaries of specially-abled pension scheme, 20.22 lakh are beneficiaries of widow pension scheme and 2.64 lakh are beneficiaries of old-age farmer pension scheme. Total money amounting to Rs 700 crore is transferred to the bank accounts of the pensioners every month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1-03-lakh-beneficiaries-deprived-of-pension-schemes-due-to-errors-in-bank-account-details/articleshow/85052064.cms||Sidhartha Dutta
---||Lucknow||DNA doubtful if don’t believe Ram is your ancestor, says Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: CM Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said that he doubts the DNA of those who refuse to believe that “Lord Ram is our ancestor”. The statement was made during an interaction with a media house, where the CM said in his opinion, there was no resident of India or UP who would have any hesitation in saying ‘Jai Shri Ram’ as Ram was our ancestor. Indonesia has the world’s largest population of Muslims. Indonesia also believes that Ram was their ancestor. What world are we Indians living in? We should be proud of the fact that Ram was our ancestor. If Indonesia can feel proud of this, then what is stopping us from taking pride in this fact,” the CM said. The CM related a conversation he had with a member of an Indonesian delegation which had come to perform Ram Lila at Ayodhya’s deepotsav some years back, where he had said that had a Muslim performed in Ramlila in India, it would led to a ‘bawaal’. “All artists in the Indonesian troupe were Muslims who had Sanskrit names and were playing various characters like Sita, Ram, Ravan etc in the Ramlila. I asked one how this was possible that they were followers of Islam, had Sanskrit names and performed in the Ram Lila since if this was done here, it would lead to chaos. He said, those who create problems are unruly people and that we should not fall into their trap. He said that Ram was their ancestor and they were proud of it,” the CM said. For the Indonesian troupe which does not take any payment from the government for performing the Ram Lila, it was a matter of pride that they were able to travel to the land of their ancestors, to the land of Ram, the CM said. “It should be a matter of great pride for us that we have a relationship with Ram and he was our ancestor. If someone doesn’t believe it then I doubt their DNA,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dna-doubtful-if-dont-believe-ram-is-your-ancestor-says-yogi/articleshow/85054182.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Officials said orders have already been issued to check RT-PCR negative report of tourists on their arrival. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday tweeted, “Currently, eight states/UTs reproductive factor (R-factor) of Covid is more than one. In the entire country, it is 1.2. In past few days, cases have been increasing, which is a concern.” He said the R-factor helps to understand how many people can a positive person infect. If the R-factor is less than 1, then it shows that the pace of spread of the virus is slow. In the state, the R-factor is 0.5. A lot of tourists from the state go to different places where the R-factor is above 1. In some southern and Northeastern states, surge in Covid cases is taking toll on the health of people. The state government is aware about it and it is ensuring that people flying to the state should carry a negative RT-PCR report. “We had issued the orders of making RT-PCR negative report mandatory for all the travelers reaching the state. The orders are still in effect and there are no changes to it,” said a senior health department official. Besides, on roads connecting interstate borders, health department teams have been camping and conducting RT-PCR tests in districts such as Banswara and Pratapgarh, which share borders with Madhya Pradesh and Banswara. “We share border with Madhya Pradesh. During the day, our teams remain present at the checkposts where police also remain deployed. Our teams are alert and we are conducting RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests as well. For over a month, we have not reported any Covid infection and we do not have any active Covid case in our district,” said Dr Vishnu Dayal Meena, chief medical health officer, Pratapgarh. At Jaipur airport too, the health department’s team remain deployed asking passengers to show the mandatory RT-PCR negative report. A passenger, who had arrived at the airport from Delhi recently said, “I boarded the plane from Delhi where I was asked to show the RT-PCR negative report. When I reached Jaipur, staff of the health department was present at the airport and was asking for the mandatory RT-PCR report. But I saw some passengers who managed to escape without showing the report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-ensures-people-landing-from-other-states-carry-rt-pcr-negative-report/articleshow/85052095.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Star Theatre, four multiplexes across city set to reopen today||Kolkata: The iconic Star Theatre, along with four properties of INOX, will reopen in Kolkata on Thursday. State-owned Nandan has already reopened on Monday. At a meeting of exhibitors held at Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA) on Wednesday, it was decided single-screen owners will take individual calls on reopening.  According to Amitava Guha Thakurta, regional director at INOX (East), the multiplex chain is reopening in Bengal with ‘The Suicide Squad’, ‘Mortal Kombat’, ‘Godzilla vs. Kong’ and ‘Mumbai Saga’. “INOX Quest will reopen four screens. Metro will reopen both screens. Swabhumi will reopen two of the four screens, while City Centre 1 will reopen three of its four screens. We will increase the screens over the weekend depending on the response,” he said. Nandan reopened with reruns of two Bengali releases — Parambrata Chatterjee’s ‘Tangra Blues’ and Koel Mallick’s ‘Flyover’. Star Theatre is reopening with ‘Radhe’ and ‘The Suicide Squad’. Joydeep Mukherjee, who has lease for Star Theatre, said, “We knew content won’t be available initially. I don’t support the double standard of exhibitors crying hoarse to allow government to open theatres and then keeping their cinemas shut. Content will flow automatically once cinemas reopen.” INOX Metro is one of the six properties in Bengal of the multiplex chain that is reopening on ThursdayChairman of exhibitors’ section of EIMPA, Ratan Saha told TOI that most owners of Kolkata theatres don’t want to reopen unless there are new releases. “I can open my Ajanta cinema only when we get a new Bollywood release,” he said. Last week members of EIMPA met minister Aroop Biswas with a plea to offer exhibitors soft loans for restarting operations. For every ticket of any value, a theatre gets service charge. For an air conditioned hall, the charge is Rs 5. For non-air conditioned hall its Rs 3. A hall with a cooler gets Rs 2 per ticket sold. At that meeting, a request was made to increase this service charge along with increasing duration of cinema licenses from the existing one year to three years. “We requested that industrial rates be applied for theatres in case of electricity bills instead of prevailing commercial rates. On the cinema license and electricity bill issues, we have been asked to send a letter to the I&CA department,” said EIMPA president Piya Sengupta. Navina’s owner Navin Choukhani is not keen on opening his theatre in August unless there is a solid line-up of releases. “We call Tollywood the Bengali film industry. Therefore, it is only fair that industrial rates are applicable for electricity bills. If the government allows industrial rates, we will have to pay at least 10% to 15% less. With survival of single screens at a stake, during the pandemic, this help from the government will really mean a lot for us,” he said. However, he is not in favour of service charge at all. “The distributor and the exhibitor should have their independent terms and conditions regarding how much each takes home after paying tax,” he added. According to Saha, EIMPA has “no demands but only appeals” to the chief minister. “On Wednesday, a committee was formed to help exhibitors get in touch with financiers in order to structurally remodel their cinemas for commercial viability,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/star-theatre-four-multiplexes-across-city-set-to-reopen-today/articleshow/85049502.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

---||Ludhiana||‘Political will lacking to bring out whole conspiracy behind sacrilege’||Jalandhar: After seeking an appraisal of the home department, which is headed by the chief minister, and Punjab Police, in the last week of May, state jail and cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa also wrote a strongly worded letter to the CM in the middle of July, when infighting in the Congress had hit the rock bottom. In that letter, Randhawa said there appeared to be a lack of political will and professionalism in investigation agencies to bring out the conspiracy behind Bargari sacrilege case of October 2015. “I being the member of group of ministers (GOM) deputed by you to assure and ensure the lifting of dharna by Bargari Insaaf Morcha in the presence of Guru Granth Sahib ji, feel chated and humiliated,” Randhawa wrote in the letter, while also urging him to inquire about the truth and ensure justice to the sangat (community). Randhawa had been siding with Navjot Singh Sidhu during the infighting which had divided the party’s state unit into two camps, of Sidhu and CM Amarinder Singh. The infighting receded only after Sidhu was made the Punjab Congress chief on July 19, and Amarinder decided to attend the ceremony where Sidhu took charge of the post. In his letter, Randhawa mentioned that Bargai cases spelled doom for SAD-BJP regime and it was Amarinder’s commitment to ensure justice which paved the way for the formation of Congress government in 2017. He mentioned that in the challans presented in two of the cases — first related to theft of the Bir of Guru Granth Sahib and the other to the final act of sacrilege at Bargari — the conspiracy angle had been omitted and this act smacked of giving a clean chit to the Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmit Ram Rahim. “In spite of bringing in the notice of then DGPs, SITs and you, no effort was made to arrest the three conspirators – Harsh Dhuri, Sandeep Bareta and Pardeep Kaler – of the sacrilege incidents, only to save main conniver, the Dera Sacha Sauda head,” he wrote, adding that the trio was also the link between the dera head and the “president of a political party whose role in sacrilege and firing incidents is questionable”. He pointed out in the letter that no effort was made to bring the dera head on a production warrant for questioning. “Even after Haryana government’s permission for probing him in jail, no probe was made,” he argued. “These facts clearly indicate that there was lack of political will as well as determination in investigation agencies to expose the whole conspiracy and bring the real culprits to justice,” he added. In June 2019, Haryana government had given permission to the SIT probing Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan firing cases to question Sirsa dera head, but the SIT did not question him. The probe in both firing cases was being handled by then IG, Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh. However, he has not yet spoken on the issue of why the dera head has not been questioned despite permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/political-will-lacking-to-bring-out-whole-conspiracy-behind-sacrilege/articleshow/85052225.cms||IP Singh

Babloo joined the saffron outfit in the presence of UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and other senior state leaders at the party headquarters in Lucknow. Soon after joining, Babloo claimed that the charges framed against him in the arson case were false. “I was not even present at the site when the incident happened,” he told reporters, adding he has been demanding a CB-CID inquiry into the case Reacting to the development, incumbent UPCC chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said: “Rita Joshi ji will be able to comment better on Babloo’s induction in BJP…She too is in BJP.” The arson incident took place in July 2009 when a group of masked men attacked Joshi’s house in Lucknow with iron rods and then set it on fire. The incident came in the backdrop of an uncharitable comment of Joshi about BSP supremo Mayawati vis-à-vis rape victims. Babloo and BSP leader Intezar Abidi were named as accused in the case. Will appeal to cancel Babloo’s membership:BJP MP Rita Bahuga Joshi reacted sharply to Jitendra Singh Babloo joining BJP, saying that she was flabbergasted. Joshi said she would speak to BJP president JP Nadda and UP chief Swatantra Dev Singh soon and appeal to them to cancel Babloo’s membership. “I remember it was Babloo who led the group of men who set my house on fire in July 2009. The charge against him was found to be true,” Joshi said when asked to comment on the development. Joshi said that she was sure that Jitendra kept the party leadership in the dark and joined the party. “BJP doors are open for all. But I am sure that the UP BJP president must not be aware about Babloo's criminal past,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-inducts-ex-bsp-mla-accused-of-arson-at-its-mp-rita-joshis-house/articleshow/85054229.cms||Pankaj Shah

The high fares though are not acting as a dampener as a few hundred people currently stranded in Kolkata and other cities in the east make a dash to catch the few flights on the radar and return to their families and work. A ban on travel from India was announced on April 22 by the UAE following the explosion of Covid cases in the height of the second wave. With UAE now relaxing the norms for those with residency permits, there is a scramble to return. “Emirates has scheduled two flights on August 8 and 11. There is good demand on both flights,” Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi said. The airline will operate a three-class configuration Boeing B-777-300ER aircraft. In addition, IndiGo will operate a flight on Thursday. FlyDubai, the LCC based in UAE. has a flight scheduled on August 13. The resumption of the flights will also mark the debut for Rapid PCR Covid test at Kolkata airport — which has now become mandatory as part of the flying protocol to the middle east. Fliers to Dubai need a Covid-19 test certificate issued within 48 hours between the time of sample collection and scheduled flight departure, a rapid PCR test 4 hours before the flight departure and a third rapid PCR test on reaching Dubai. Kolkata airport has already equipped itself with rapid PCR testing kits from Abbott — that can test 80 persons in an hour and will cost Rs 4,000 per person. At Kolkata, the tests are being conducted by HLL Lifecare Ltd. “Following swab collection, the passenger gets the report within 15 minutes as the Abbot ID kits generates the results and passengers get printed copies of their test results with a QR code as well as electronic versions on mail,” airport director C Pattabhi said. Meanwhile, there is confusion over whether people who have taken the vaccine doses in India will be allowed into the country. Airlines officials insisted that only those who had been fully vaccinated in the UAE before flying to India would be allowed to board the return flights. Four vaccines are currently available in the UAE: Sinopharm, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sputnik V, and Oxford-AstraZeneca.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/flights-to-uae-packed-despite-high-ticket-price/articleshow/85049546.cms||Subhro Niyogi

However, within few hours, the chief secretary filed a plea urging the court to recall the order because the money was meant as compensation to be paid to the land losers and not for legal expenses. The state may now press for an urgent hearing on Kumar’s plea on Thursday. The PIL was filed by Prabhakar Chouti, a lecturer from Mahbubnagar, questioning the GO RT No 208 issued on June 7. According to Mayur Mundra, advocate on record for the lecturer, the GO granted Rs 59 crore as legal expenses for defending Kumar and chief commissioner of land administration (CCLA) in contempt cases. Appearing for the petitioner, senior counsel L Ravi Chander said Kumar was both the signatory and the beneficiary of the GO. On average, Rs 32 lakh was proposed to be spent on each contempt case, he said. The bench comprising Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy issued notice to the state and sought to know details of how the money was proposed to be spent. “Which norms of the treasury were relaxed to spend money this way?” Chief Justice asked. Later in the day, Kumar filed an affidavit urging the court to recall the restraint order. He brought to the notice of the court a letter written by the district judge of Mahbubnagar who narrated the woes of the poor people whose land was acquired, but compensation was not paid. “This money is not meant for defending me in contempt cases,” he said while urging the court to recall its order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pil-claims-chief-secy-cleared-rs-59-crore-to-defend-himself/articleshow/85054255.cms||---

The appointments committee of the Cabinet on Tuesday “approved the proposal for appointment of Dr Dhriti Banerjee, scientist E, Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) as director …”. Banerjee will be taking charge some time next week. Speaking to TOI on Wednesday, she said, “I believe ZSI’s 100-year legacy would help me catapult the organization to greener and futuristic heights in biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.” The 51-year-old has had an illustrious career as a scientist, conducting research in taxonomy, zoogeography, morphology and molecular systematics. She has been co-ordinator of ZSI’s Digital Sequence Information Project since 2012. On breaking the glass-ceiling in this organization, she mused, “Women are blessed with unique power to strike a balance between work and family. But I was lucky to have had an exceptionally supportive one — my husband, Sughran, daughter Roinee and my parents. I am also grateful to my mentors in the organization for their guidance.” Even though women are equal partners in scientific development and nation-building, their scientific journey around the world began only in the late 19th century. In fact, ZSI, headquartered in Kolkata with 16 regional centres under the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, started hiring women scientists as late as 1949, after more than three decades since its inception on 1 July 1916. Mira Mansukhani thus created history in an organization which until then was largely dominated by men. “ZSI’s women scientists have been carrying out regular surveys exploring faunal diversity from the Himalayas to the deep sea and nearly 60% of the new species discovered are by women scientists today,” said Banerjee. “In the past century, only 20% of the total scientific staff strength in ZSI are represented by women. But their scientific contributions prove that they have played a key role in strengthening the roots of ZSI,” she said. ZSI documented the contribution of 100 women scientists on the occasion of its centenary celebrations in 2016. Banerjee had co-authored the document titled “The Glorious 100 women’s Scientific Contribution in ZSI”, on women scientists contribution to studies related to different animal groups. Banerjee was also part of a team in June 2015 that traced the grave of ZSI’s first director-general Thomas Nelson Annandale, who was buried at the Scottish Cemetery in April, 1924. “It took us some time to discover that the ZSI founder was buried at the Scottish Cemetery and not at the Park Street Cemetery. But when we initiated the mission, we realized that the inscriptions were barely visible. We had a difficult time looking for Annandale’s tombstone. But it was an extremely rewarding experience,” smiled Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1st-woman-director-in-100-yrs-of-zsi-history/articleshow/85049602.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

While North West and South West have reported a positivity rate of 0.21% and 0.19%, respectively, all other districts have comparatively lower numbers. North East district has nil cases and a zero positivity rate. While there is no clear indication of Covid-19 cases rising again in the capital, the numbers are rising in some parts of the country. Delhi also needs to be on alert because the recent highest positivity rate of 0.12% (85 new cases) over the past 24 days was reported on Sunday. According to the district-wise performance report, on July 31 Central district reported six cases with a positivity rate of 0.09%, East had five cases and 0.08% positivity rate, New Delhi 19 cases and 0.29%, North seven cases and 0.13%, North West 12 cases and 0.21%, Shahdara two cases and 0.03%, South four cases and 0.06%, South East seven cases and 0.11%, South West 15 cases and 0.19% and West nine cases and 0.12% positivity rate. All districts are conducting 4,000 to 6,000 tests every day, a majority of them being RT-PCR. A health department official said the positivity rate was far lower than the target of 5% that the districts were supposed to maintain. “It’s difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind some districts reporting a higher positivity rate than others. Only experts can highlight the causes after a detailed analysis,” added the official. Officials from the districts reporting higher positivity rates said they were conducting a maximum number of tests in places like containment zones, slums, middle-class areas and villages. A government hospital doctor involved in Covid-19 management said, “If more tests are conducted in containment zones and adjoining clusters and among the contacts of Covid-positive people, then the positivity rate is likely to be slightly higher. More tests in super-spreader areas also pushes up the positivity rate. It has been observed that more tests conducted in slums and underprivileged areas throw up a lower positivity rate. That is why it is suggested to use mixed locations for carrying out the tests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cases-still-low-districts-with-higher-positivity-rate-on-alert/articleshow/85052309.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Lucknow||PM Modi to interact with Uttar Pradesh’s Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana beneficiaries||LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with the beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) in UP via video conferencing on Thursday to mark UP the celebration of August 5 as PMGKAY Day. According to a statement from the Prime Minister Office, a massive awareness programme is scheduled to be launched throughout the state to ensure that no beneficiary is left out from availing the benefits of the scheme. UP CM Yogi Adityanath will also be present on the occasion. Almost 15 crore beneficiaries of the state have been getting ration free of cost under the ambitious scheme through nearly 80,000 fair price shops in the state. Under the PMGKAY scheme, 5 kg per person additional food grain is given to all beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act. Modi on Wednesday said since Independence, India's food reserves kept increasing but hunger and malnutrition did not decrease in that proportion due to inefficient ration delivery schemes and selfish elements. He made the remarks during the virtual interaction with the PMGKAY beneficiaries in Gujarat. The PM said that after Independence, while the scope and budget of cheap ration schemes increased year after year, the effect it should have had on the poor remained limited. Not surprisingly, the state government geared up for the occasion with UP chief secretary Rajendra Tewari pitching for an intensive campaign for wide publicity of the scheme. As per the instructions, all the nodal officers reached their allotted districts on Wednesday itself. The nodal officers have also been asked to review the incomplete works under various government schemes approved in the district, such as district plan, MP fund, funds of three-tier panchayats and other departmental schemes, listing all these works and completing them at an accelerated pace. The CS also asked the nodal officers to leave the district only after the completion of the program on Thursday. He said that the preparation being done at the fair price shop level would also be reviewed by the nodal officers. Officials were also asked to review the status of availability of bags to be provided to the beneficiaries at the fair price shops. Apart from this, the officials were asked to assess the preparation done in respect of celebrating the program as 'festival' at the fair price shop level. The designated nodal officer also reviewed the status of the action taken in relation to the seating arrangement of the guests and beneficiaries as per the Covid protocol, inviting those who have been deprived of the scheme and those who are being covered for the first time under this scheme. Officials also checked the status of installation of television sets at fair price shops for live broadcast of the PM address, review of action taken regarding invitation of public representatives to participate in the program, adequate police force at fair price shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-to-interact-with-ups-gkay-beneficiaries/articleshow/85054324.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Jaipur||Alwar cops bust ‘sextortion’ racket, 8 accused arrested||JAIPUR/ALWAR: Alwar police on Wednesday arrested eight members of a ‘sextortion’ gang that targeted people including an Indian man settled in Texas in the US. The accused had extorted nearly Rs 15 crore from different people by blackmailing them. Alwar SP Tejswani Gautam said police had learned that a few suspects were blackmailing people through porn clips and a special team was set up to probe into the matter. A police constable ran a decoy operation and soon came into contact with one of the accused masquerading as a woman. The accused demanded Rs 10,000 from the constable, following which a person was setained near Roopbas flyover in Alwar. Police seized his mobile phone and found that messages and the video calls sent to the constable were from the same SIM. Later, police arrested all accused identified as Gafruddin, alias Shoeb (28), Saif Ali, alias Saifu (26), Akram Khan (33), Sajid, alias Dhola (20), Ashfaq (21), Rashid (21), Moen Khan (20) and Moen (20). Except for Moen, a resident of the Shastri Nagar of Jaipur, the remaining are residents of Dausa district. Police said the accused relied on the same modus operandi where a gang member would masquerade as a beautiful women on social media sites to befriend potential targets. Casual online flirting soon turned into bolder chatting till numbers were exchanged on WhatsApp. The next bait is porn where the victim thinks the person in the clip is the ‘woman’ he is chatting with and invariably gets tricked into indulging in a sex act that is recorded. The accused then begins to blackmail the victim, demanding hefty money in multiple tranches. This time, however, the gang also targeted a non-resident Indian (NRI), settled in Texas, US. “He informed us that a gang was trying to blackmail him. We told him not to send any money to the accused,” Gautam said. Alwar police said they were monitoring similar gangs who target people through pre-downloaded porn clips.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/alwar-cops-bust-sextortion-racket-8-accused-arrested/articleshow/85052300.cms||---

---||Agra||First case of Kappa variant confirmed in Agra||AGRA: The microbiology department of SN Medical College (SNMC) in Agra has declared that one of the samples it had sent for genome sequencing to King George Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow has been tested positive for Kappa variant (B.1.617.2) of Covid-19. The 37-year-old man, infected with the Kappa variant, was hospitalized after testing positive for Covid-19 in May. The patient has fully recovered now. The Kappa variant was first detected in India last year with cases mostly reported from Kerala. Head of the microbiology department at SNMC Dr Aarti Agarwal, said, “Around 15 samples of Covid-19 patients were sent for genome sequencing to KGMU. Out of these, one sample tested positive for Kappa variant. This is the first case of Kappa variant reported from our lab. Besides, 12 other samples tested positive for Delta variant which was the most prevalent variant during the second wave of Covid-19.” SNMC principal Dr Prashant Gupta said, “The Delta and Kappa variants are actually siblings, the direct descendants of a variant that earlier used to be referred to as the double mutant, or B.1.617. The patient whose sample tested positive for Kappa variant has completely recovered from the infection. It is good that no case of delta plus variant has surfaced in the genome sequencing.” “Delta plus variant is more transmissible and evades the body’s immunity faster as compared to the delta variant. People need to strictly follow the Covid-19 protocol. Getting vaccinated, wearing face mask and maintaining social distance will prevent us from the possible third wave of Covid-19,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/first-case-of-kappa-variant-confirmed-in-agra/articleshow/85045019.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||With stakes high, parties go all out to win bypolls in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Have by-elections in Telangana become prestigious and expensive for political parties, especially for the ruling TRS? It appears so, going by the number of sops announced by the government in the constituencies that are going to bypolls. Until 2019, bypolls to both assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies were not considered significant and touted as ‘local’. For that matter, the government too did not pay much attention to the by-elections. However, the scenario changed with Huzurnagar assembly bypolls held in October 2019, which was vacated by former TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy after getting elected from Nalgonda Lok Sabha seat.  To win the election, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced sops worth Rs 100 crore to the assembly constituency. After losing Dubbak in another by-election to BJP last year, KCR personally monitored the campaign in Nagarjuna Sagar and visited the constituency twice and showered sops worth over Rs 2,000 crore, mainly various lift irrigation schemes and funds for the civic bodies in Nalgonda district. Now for the upcoming Huzurabad assembly by-election, the ruling party is focusing on the campaign and working out a strategy to win the poll at any cost. The state government is expected to spend about Rs 3,000 crore on various schemes and developmental works in the constituency ahead of the by-election. Apart from taking up Dalit Bandhu pilot project in Huzurabad, the government started sheep distribution, funds for civic bodies and took up other schemes to attract the voters. “The parties, especially the TRS, are giving importance to the by-elections now because of the high stakes involved with these polls. Timing of the election is also important. Huzurabad is important as the TRS wants to defeat Eatala Rajender come what may. The election results will also have an impact on the next general elections,” political analysts professor K Nageshwar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-stakes-high-parties-go-all-out-to-win-bypolls-in-the-state/articleshow/85054353.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Delhi||HC reminds Centre, AAP govt about SC’s order on medical oxygen stocks||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Wednesday reminded the Centre and AAP government that the Supreme Court has directed them to create buffer stocks of liquid medical oxygen and not just capacity to store it. The high court also found lack of clarity on the steps taken by the Centre for setting up buffer stock of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) in the national capital to deal with the pandemic, even as the third wave is anticipated. “The Supreme Court order casts an obligation on both of you. Please don’t dither on this. Overnight you won’t be able to create a buffer stock,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said. It examined the status report filed by the Centre and pointed out the report does not indicate that buffer stock of LMO is actually created for the use of Delhi, but only talks of enhancement of oxygen storage capacity. “This is how we were placed in March... today the situation may look fine then see what happened in April-May. There is no escape from this (buffer stock of LMO). This is like insurance and we have to be prepared,” the bench underlined. The Centre said it might approach the apex court for clarification and cited a report prepared by the SC-appointed National Task Force on Covid-19 to claim that it had taken steps to augment oxygen storage capacity of Delhi. Central government’s standing counsel Kirtiman Singh said Delhi government has done enough for creating a buffer stock and the Centre is ready to assist if needed. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi government, said the state government has a buffer stock of around 420 metric tonnes of LMO kept at different places with the suppliers outside Delhi and by August 31, they will transfer this stock to Delhi. He stressed that these stocks are earmarked only for the capital, adding that a total of 1400 mt tonne of LMO capacity is available. While 724 mt tonne is with hospitals, 250 is stored with refillers and 221 is available in tanks already installed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-reminds-centre-aap-govt-about-scs-order-on-medical-oxygen-stocks/articleshow/85052334.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||India||Karnataka: 29 ministers inducted in Bommai cabinet, 23 from BSY govt||BENGALURU: A week after taking over as Karnataka chief minister, Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday expanded his cabinet by inducting 29 ministers. He retained 23 ministers from the 33-member Yediyurappa cabinet - including the lone woman minister - while bringing in six new faces. The ministers were administered oath of office and secrecy by governor Thaawarchand Gehlot at Raj Bhavan in the afternoon. The sanctioned strength of the state cabinet is 34; the current strength is 30. Bommai said portfolios would be allocated in a day or two. The much-awaited expansion bears the stamp of former CM BS Yediyurappa as many of those inducted are closely associated with him, including the 10 legislators who joined BJP after quitting the Congress-JD(S) coalition in 2019 and helped the saffron party form the government. However, contrary to speculation, Yediyurappa's son and BJP vice-president BY Vijayendra failed to make it to the ministry. "The party's central leaders, including party president JP Nadda and BJP in-charge for Karnataka Arun Singh, have spoken to Yediyurappa and Vijayendra. I can only say his name (Vijayendra's) is not on the list," Bommai told reporters ahead of the oath-taking ceremony. While two of three former deputy CMs - Govind M Karjol and CN Ashwath Narayana - are part of the new cabinet, the party has decided to do away with the post in what is being seen as a move to strengthen Bommai's hands and curb new power centres. After the oath-taking ceremony, Bommai held a cabinet meeting in the evening and reiterated that the focus is on tackling Covid-19 as a potential third wave looms large in the state. The cabinet decided to revamp the state's Covid task force with some new members. It was led by Ashwath Narayana. "The new cabinet will respond to the needs of the people, earn their trust and deliver good governance," Bommai said. Asked about four ministerial berths being vacant, he said cabinet expansion will happen in states and regions left unrepresented will get priority subsequently. He dismissed the brewing dissent in the party unit, saying BJP is a "national party with a strong leadership". On senior ministers from the previous cabinet being dropped, he said the high command has decided to rope in those with organisational experience for party work. Prominent omissions from the previous cabinet include Laxman Savadi, S Sureshkumar, Aravind Limbavali, CP Yogeeshwara and Shrimanth Patil. While the cabinet composition appears to balance political and caste equations, regional representation remains badly skewed. The ministry includes 9 Lingayats (including the CM), 7 Vokkaligas, 3 Kurubas, 3 ministers from scheduled castes, 2 each from Brahmin, Billava communities and one from scheduled tribes. In this make-up, 14 of the 31 districts of the state remain unrepresented, while Bengaluru claims the lion's share of seven ministers. In Yediyurappa's cabinet too, there were seven ministers from Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karnataka-29-ministers-inducted-in-bommai-cabinet-23-from-bsy-govt/articleshow/85056451.cms||Manu Aiyappa

Sanjay told TOI that a decision would be taken whether to stop his padayatra mid-way if the notification for Huzurabad bypolls was issued. “All the top leaders of the party, including me, will campaign in Huzurabad,” he said, indicating the importance attached to the bypolls. However, he said he had no idea as to when the bypoll notification would be issued. The BJP state president rubbished the allegations of Congress state president A Revanth Reddy about his padayatra being postponed on the directions of the ruling TRS. On the other hand, resumption of Eatala’s padayatra would depend upon the condition of his knee which was operated upon in a private hospital here. Also, Eatala’s padayatra is likely to slow down once it resumes. Unlike 10 km covered by Eatala every day as part of his padaatra prior to his hospitalisation, Eatala may opt for four to five km of padayatra per day if doctors give a green signal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bandis-padayatra-from-aug-24/articleshow/85054374.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab Police SIT counter CBI probe in sacrilege cases, says it left out important evidence||Bathinda: In its chargesheet in sacrilege cases, the Punjab Police special investigation team (SIT) has contested the CBI’s claims on the basis of which the central agency had based its closure report filed in court. SIT has countered the CBI probe in three cases: theft of bir of Guru Granth Sahib at Gurdwara Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 1, 2015, pasting of derogatory posters, and strewing pages of bir at Bargari on October 12, 2015. On Tuesday, the accused were given copies of the challan filed by SIT in Faridkot court. While six Dera Sacha Sauda followers are facing the cases, one has died and three are absconding. CBI had filed the closure report on June 29, 2019, in a CBI court, claiming that nothing suspicious was found the from dump data of mobile towers in the area of Burj Jawahar Singh Wala and Bargari, and the call detail report (CDR) of mobile numbers of persons concerned. The SIT claimed to have collected incriminating evidence against accused and that the CBI probe had serious flaws and it left out important evidence before filing the closure report. It claimed that sacrilege cases had a direct link with the dera as the accused had a nexus with the sect management. The followers were angry over non release of MSG2 movie and one of them, Mohinderpal Bittu (now deceased), had staged a three-day dharna in Moga for its release, claimed SIT. SIT said finding nothing from dump data of mobile towers or CDR was not enough to give a clean chit as a clever person would switch off his/her mobile phone or keep it away from the crime scene. CBI claimed that as an Alto car (PB 30 R 6480) allegedly used in crime, purchased in 2016 in name of Shakti Singh’s brother, could not be used in June 2015, Mohinderpal allegedly used an Indigo (PB 11W 7114), which was sold by Rajinder Kumar to his (Mohinderpal) son Devender in January 2017. SIT stated that the Alto (PB 30R 6480) was not in its possession but another car (PB 47D 3609), belonging to Sukhjinder, was. The witnesses claimed to have seen the accused standing next to an Alto. As against CBI claims of people not coming forward to record statements, SIT said many stated that it (CBI) did not record their statements. Countering CBI claim of no sufficient incriminating material and evidence on record to prove these were people were actively involved in hatching conspiracy, the SIT stated there is sufficient evidence on record to pinpoint the role of arrested persons.
