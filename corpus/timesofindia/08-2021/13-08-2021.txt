The 23-year-old girl, who made history by being the first to win a medal for the state in the Olympics, was welcomed by chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma with a hug on the tarmac. Hailing from a remote village in upper Assam’s Golaghat district, she stepped into the boxing ring eight years ago. Sarma patted Lovlina on her back before presenting her with the traditional Assamese ‘gamosa’ (hand towel), a ‘japi’ (traditional headgear) and a bouquet. Accompanied by sports minister Bimal Borah and parliamentary affairs minister Pijush Hazarika, she came out of the airport under tight security. A red carpet welcome awaited her outside the airport. Lovlina’s fellow boxers, including world championship medal winner Jamuna Boro, leaders from several organizations, including the All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu) and dignitaries from sports associations and her well-wishers felicitated her with gamosas. A cultural troup staged a Bihu dance in welcome. “Lovlina has ignited a billion dreams with her success at the Tokyo Olympics and set an example for budding sports talents in rural areas to aspire to achieve big at the world stage,” the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/lovlina-accorded-a-heros-welcome-in-guwahati/articleshow/85283494.cms||Mukut Das

The aviation ministry late on Thursday night increased both the minimum and maximum domestic airfare levels by 12.5%. The move came along with the government allowing airlines to operate 7.5% more domestic flights, raising their capacity deployment from 65% to 72.5%. The government had on June 1, 2021, hiked domestic airfares by 15% while slashing flights within the country from 80% of pre-Covid level to 50% at the height of the deadly second wave. During the pandemic, the aviation ministry has been regulating both domestic fares and capacity. With that the second wave ebbing, the domestic capacity was first increased to 65% on July 5. Now capacity domestic deployment and airfares have been hiked by 7.5% and 12.5%, respectively. Read AlsoGovt allows 7.5% more domestic flightsNEW DELHI: The government has allowed airlines to operate marginally more — 7.5% to be precise — domestic flights. Airlines can now operate 72.5% of their pre-Covid domestic capacity, up from 65% allowed on July 5, 2021. During the pandemic, the aviation ministry has been regulating both domesticAs a result, for instance, Delhi-Mumbai one-way minimum fare will rise from Rs 4,700 to Rs 5287.5 and the maximum fare will rise from Rs 13,000 to Rs 14,625 (taxes extra). This is the fourth hike in airfares this year due to spiralling jet fuel prices, the biggest cost item for airlines — with a majority of Indian carriers struggling to survive in the absence of any fiscal support from the government during the pandemic. The range is for economy one-way fares and does not include user development fee of airports, passenger security fees (Rs 150 for domestic) and GST. When schedule domestic flights resumed after a two-month break on May 25, 2020, the government had asked airlines to start with one-third of pre-Covid time flights and also fixed fare bands to ensure two things — passengers are not fleeced and financially strong airlines do not resort to predatory (below cost) fares to hasten the bankruptcy of weaker ones. Based on flying time, there are seven categories: starting at flights below 40 minutes and going upto 3-3.5 hours. Several airlines and airport operators are asking the government to free up the sector from its pandemic-time control and let market forces decide capacity and fares to help revive the sector. The entire travel industry, including airlines and hotels, realise that their survival rests on domestic travellers as international travel could take a long time to open up both ways — Indian tourists being allowed in most countries and foreign tourists being allowed into India. This fact is recognised by government agencies too. For instance, the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority’s consultation paper on Hyderabad Airport (HIAL) tariff says: “The authority has looked into the traffic trends at HIAL and observes that the traffic at Hyderabad Airport is dominated by domestic segment (about 81% of the total traffic over the last five years was domestic passengers). The authority is of the opinion that post-pandemic recovery of traffic at the Hyderabad Airport would be led by domestic segment and that it may recover at a faster growth rate than other major airports which tend to have a higher share of international traffic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/domestic-air-travel-costlier-by-12-5/articleshow/85283443.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC) has re-started dumping of garbage at a new site in Boragaon located close to the Deepor Beel Wildlife Sanctuary. The new dumping site is about 1 km away from the earlier site at Boragaon which was discontinued following an Assam government direction on June 24 asking the Kamrup Metropolitan district to use the newly chosen Chandrapur site in the eastern suburbs of the city to dump garbage. Assam environment and forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya, in a written reply to a question from Congress legislator Asif Mohammad Nazar on Wednesday, informed the state assembly that the department concerned didn’t avail the ‘environment clearance’ from the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) along with ‘consent to establish’ and ‘authorization certificate’ from the state pollution control board to dump garbage at Chandrapur. In his reply, the minister said that on July 28, 2021, the GMC applied to the state pollution control board for the ‘authorization certificate’ to establish the dumping ground at Chandrapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/minus-clearance-cert-gmc-stops-dumping-wastes-at-chandrapur/articleshow/85282814.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

The foray of the Congress into the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) has its significance as a couple of assembly segments here are set to go to the polls (byelections) soon. Several top leaders of the Peoples’ Joint Action Committee for Bodoland Movement (PJACBM), including its chief convener, Garjan Mushahary, joined the Congress on Thursday. Only a few days ago, the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) bestowed responsibility on Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi to take stock of organizational matters in the BTR where the Congress-Bodoland People's Front (BPF) alliance enjoyed overwhelming support till the BJP formed the government in Assam in 2016. The switchover of Mushahary along with 17 other leaders of the PJACBM bears significance as they spearheaded the movement for a separate Bodoland state with the All Bodo Students Union (Absu) and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (Progressive) (NDFB-P) for years. Assam Congress president Bhupen Borah told TOI that the joining of Bodo leaders has ushered in a ray of hope for the Congress in the BTR, just ahead of the byelections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/bodo-leader-mushahary-joins-cong-before-bypolls-in-assam/articleshow/85282812.cms||---

---||Pune||Discounts, happy hours, benefits for vaccinated persons: Pune restos ramp up their game to attract patrons||From March 2020, when a nationwide lockdown was imposed, till August 2021, the hospitality and F&B industry has undergone several ups and downs, adversely impacting their business. With the relaxations that came into effect since Monday, restaurants are finally breathing a sigh of relief as they can now reopen for dining in, which contributes to a major part of their earning, till 10 pm on weekdays and 4 pm on weekends, at 50 percent capacity. While patrons are excited about dining in, restaurants, too, are leaving no stone unturned to make their patrons’ eating out experience pleasant and pocket-friendly. Discounts, revamped menus, new décor and live performances are awaiting you at your favourite restos. And if you’re vaccinated, be ready for added benefits! Footfalls go up as restrictions easeAlthough the eateries are expecting more footfalls during weekends and the upcoming festive season, the number of people dining in has gone up already. “Now people are no longer in a rush finish their meals before 4 pm. There has been a rise in patrons stepping out and visiting us post work, for dinner with loved ones, or hanging out with friends. We are hoping that the number goes up further during the weekend,” says, Sanat Sarpotdar, owner of Poona Guest House at Laxmi Road. Echoing his feelings, Ashutosh Joshi and Sumeet Choudhary from Unicorn House, Kalyani Nagar report a 30 percent increase in dine-in customers compared to when stricter restrictions were in place, while Puja Dubey, owner of Zayk-e-Awadh, Kalyani Nagar, says the footfalls have already gone up by around 20 percent. Karan Kriplani, owner of Hippe @ Heart, says, "There sas definitely been an upswing on Monday, it being the first day post relaxation, but since it has only been a couple of days, we don't really know how much of a rise it's going to be. But we have a new menu and new offerings for our patrons for the extended number of hours." Weekday offers and weekend happy hoursWith the losses incurred over the last year-and-a-half, one might think that dining in would have become costlier with restaurants trying to recover the business lost. On the contrary, city restaurants are giving discounts and offers for customers. “We want to bring a smile on our customers’ faces by giving them something extra to look forward to,” says Daniel Faleiro, manager of Punk Lounge from Baner, adding, “On weekdays we are giving 10 percent off on the total food bill and additional discount if they order drinks, too. For weekends, the brunch menu is on offer at a very nominal price, with unlimited food. There are also happy hours between 1 and 4 pm where one gets a free drink, and two if they have got both doses of their vaccine.” Several establishments, that only catered to an age group, are also accommodating family and kids now, so that everyone can have a good time, they get more footfall. However, not all of them are in a position to offer huge discounts. Karan Khilnani, Owner, Elephant and Co, says, “Recently, on International Beer Day, we had offers on beers, we were selling it as cheap as Rs 6. While we don’t have are special discounts overall on dining, we doing special day offers and planning to offer more in future as the business gets back on track." Restaurant owners have also introduced pocket-friendly menus considering the pay cuts that majority people have had to take amid the pandemic. “Having a pocket-friendly menu helps a great deal in getting people from all walks of life and age groups to your restaurant,” say Ashutosh and Sumeet, adding, “We have offers on drinks on Wednesdays. It’s nice to see folks coming out to dine despite the tough times that we are living in. So, the entire F&B industry wants to cheer them up and offer whatever discounts we can. It also helps attract customers.” India’s Olympics medal haul this year, and the pre-Independence Day celebrations have led to some great offers across restaurants. Ashutosh adds that those who are fully vaccinated get a complimentary after shot at their restaurant.  Vida Heydari, owner of VHC, Koregaon Park, says, "Besides offers on drinks and a sumptuous brunch, we have also added immunity-boosting beverages to our menu and a few more options in burgers and pizzas since people really loved them during the lockdown." Offers on long-distance delivery, too!Mehul Bhatewar, owner of Anand Veg in Kothrud, saw an increase in patrons excited to dine, but he didn’t want to overlook customers ordering from his restaurants. “Many of our regular customers are returning to dine in at our restaurant. We’ve observed that now more families and couples are coming in to dine out since the relaxation in timing has been announced. We’ve added a lot of new snacks, mocktails and main course items to give our customers a fresh start. We’ve also started long-distance delivery for free. We want to make sure that our customers, irrespective of where they live, are taken care of.” Vaccinated? Enjoy more benefits!A handful of eateries also want to sweeten the bitterness of the lockdown by giving free desserts on orders above Rs 1000. “No matter how many people are on the table, if the orders go above Rs 1,000, we give them complimentary gulab jamun or phirni, either of the two. However, if a person is fully vaccinated, they get to enjoy both desserts free of cost,” shares Ganesh Gupta, owner of Flavours of Rajasthan, Wakad. Puja adds that at her restaurant if a person shows valid proof of vaccination, they get a special treat. “Those who are fully-vaccinated get a discount of 10 percent on their bill on all days,” she says. Sanat adds, "We are providing complimentary snacks / sweets to those who are vaccinated, even if they have taken the first dose." ‘To sustain the third wave, restaurants must not stop following COVID protocols at any cost’Anurag Katriar, restaurateur, President - National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), says, “In a recent meeting with the CM of Maharashtra, we discussed how restaurants could survive if the third wave hits. The only solution is that restaurant owners must never violate any COVID-related protocols even after relaxations. To further help the hotel industry, we have proposed a few relaxations and relief in license fee, and taxes which, if waived off or reduced, will help the industry to get back on its feet sooner. The aim is to reach the breakeven point and stop the hospitality industry from bleeding any further."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/discounts-happy-hours-and-benefits-for-vaccinated-persons-pune-restos-ramp-up-their-game-to-attract-patrons/articleshow/85278581.cms||Amrita Prasad

The driver has been identified as Surajit Sutradhar. Two days ago, the police arrested five accused from Ambassa and booked them under sections 120 B, 307, 326, 392 and 427 of IPC. A local court sent them to a weeklong judicial custody. Since 12 of the accused in the case are in Kolkata, state police have reportedly alerted the airport to detain them as soon as they land in Agartala. Sources said Tripura police have also decided to send a team to Kolkata to arrest the 12 bring them back to Agartala on transit remand, which has triggered fear among the local workers. Sources said although Trinamool Congress workers were injured in stone and brick pelting allegedly by BJP supporters in Ambassa on August 7 on the national highway and claimed that they were denied medical care in the police station, no complaint has yet been registered against BJP workers. Trinamool Congress leader Ashis Lal Singh, however, alleged that despite lodging complaints against BJP workers soon after the attack, police did not register the FIR. Instead, he said TMC leaders were implicated in false cases following pressure from the top-level of the BJP. “We know how the police work under the Biplab Kumar Deb government. The police are being pressured to arrest as many as 40 of us on serious charges and putting us behind bars for at least three months.” Meanwhile, the police raided the homes of TMC workers, including that of Singh and others who have been on the run for the last three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/arrest-of-tmc-leaders-driver-sparks-fear-among-local-workers/articleshow/85283390.cms||---

When asked about Sharad Pawar's allegation that outsiders were called in to manhandle opposition leaders including women MPs, Union minister Piyush Goyal said the NCP chief was probably "wrongly informed" and also asked him to introspect on the behaviour of his "colleagues in opposition". The minister was addressing a joint press conference with his cabinet colleagues. "In 55 years of my parliamentary career, I have never seen this kind of behaviour towards women MPs in the August House. More than 40 men and women were brought into the House from outside. It is painful. It is an attack on democracy," Pawar had alleged. When his reaction was sought, Goyal said, "Marshals or security staff neither belong to the ruling side nor the opposition. They look after the Parliament's security. We have not appointed them." All those were parliamentary security service officials, marshals. Of them, 12 were women marshals and 18 male security personnel. "Let me clarify, Pawar was wrongly informed, may be, by somebody. Their figures are wrong and their allegations are also wrong that they were outsiders who came in," Goyal said. "I would like to urge Sharad Pawar ji to introspect on the behaviour of the opposition throughout the entire Parliament session. Whether the parties with which he is standing today is what he has seen in 55 years of his parliamentary career? Has he ever seen this type of things? I think Pawar ji should introspect and tell the nation whether he condones their behaviour," he said. The minister also urged Pawar to not cast aspersions on the Chair, but to go into "the merits and the truths" of the matter. "He (Pawar) should not get carried away by some wrong propaganda by his colleagues," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-rejects-sharad-pawars-allegation-that-outsiders-were-called-in-to-manhandle-mps-in-rajya-sabha/articleshow/85284058.cms||---
---||India||Afghanistan: India looks to play 'constructive' role in Doha for political outcome||In the middle of concerns over Taliban's unrelenting military offensive in Afghanistan, aided apparently by international terrorists, India participated Thursday in a regional conference in Doha for expediting the Afghanistan peace talks. India's participation was significant as it had been kept out of the extended troika meeting just a day earlier of Russia, US, China and Pakistan on the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan. The conference was still on late on Thursday. Official sources said the Indian delegation was playing a constructive role in efforts underway to arrive at an agreement for a political outcome. Despite its reservations about Taliban, India has supported all peace initiatives in recent times for a lasting political settlement through "an inclusive Afghan led, Afghan owned and Afghan controlled process". A day ahead of the Doha meeting, the government reiterated in Parliament that India was in touch with various stakeholders within and outside Afghanistan for durable peace. India was represented by MEA joint secretary J P Singh in the meeting. The participants apparently agreed that there can be no military solution to Afghanistan and that, according to Afghanistan's chief negotiator Abdullah Abdullah, they won't recognise any regime taking over the country by force. While the meeting was still on, Abdullah called for an immediate session of the UNSC to discuss the current developments in Afghanistan. The participants expressed concerns over increasing Taliban attacks, including war crimes and human rights abuses. During his visit to India last week, Qatar special envoy Mutlaq bin Majed Al-Qahtani had emphasised on the need for an interim political arrangement that could end the violence in Afghanistan. Al-Qahtani had then also invited India for the ongoing meeting in Doha. Qatar has also expressed concerns over the likelihood of external actors affecting the ongoing Doha peace process between the Taliban and the Afghan government. While Qatar has not specifically blamed Pakistan, the Afghan government has been a lot more forthcoming on the issue. After the troika talks in Doha on Wednesday, Abdullah Abdullah said the continuation of the Taliban's bloody attacks "in collusion with regional and international terrorists" will not only lead to a humanitarian catastrophe and a protracted war but also "exacerbate violent extremism and incite terrorists in the region" posing a threat to all. While the MEA didn't publicly comment on reports that terrorists in large numbers from Pakistan had joined the Taliban, India has repeatedly expressed concerns since the beginning of this year about the role of terror groups. During his visit to Kabul early this year, NSA Ajit Doval had emphasised on the need to rein in international terror groups for durable peace and stability in Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/afghanistan-india-looks-to-play-constructive-role-in-doha-for-political-outcome/articleshow/85284732.cms||Sachin Parashar
---||World||US has decided that India is a strategic ally, says Pakistan PM Imran Khan||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan told foreign journalists late Wednesday night that he believed the US had picked India to partner with in the subcontinent. "I think the Americans have decided that India is a strategic partner. Maybe that’s why Pakistan is being treated differently. Pakistan is just considered to be useful only in the context of settling this mess (Afghanistan)," Khan was quoted by Dawn (online) as saying at an interaction with foreign media at his home here. "The hasty way in which the Americans left, if they wanted a political settlement then common sense dictates that (you negotiate) from a position of strength," he was quoted as saying, adding that the US was now blaming Pakistan when they no longer had any leverage. He said that another reason for the US’s shifting position was his country’s close relationship with China. "A nightmare scenario for Pakistan would be a protracted civil war in case the Taliban tried to form an exclusive Afghan government through a military takeover," he told the journalists, according to Dawn, explaining that the Taliban were a Pashtun-majority group and hence there would be spillover effects in Pakistan’s Pashtun-majority areas. "So there is a likelihood that we will again have problems in our Pakhtun areas," the PM said, adding that close to three million people had been internally displaced from Pakistan’s tribal areas due to war in Afghanistan. "We have a larger Pakhtun population here in Pakistan than in Afghanistan, and they’re probably the most xenophobic people on Earth. They fight each other normally, but when it’s an outside force, they all get together," he said. Any civil war in Afghanistan, Khan said, would also derail Pakistan’s plans for connectivity with Central Asia and its g eo-economic agenda."Hence it’s in Pakistan’s interest that there is a political settlement in Afghanistan and all factions come together to form a government that represents everyone," he added. He also contradicted what his national security adviser had claimed in a recent interview to the "Financial Times", saying, "I am not waiting for a call from US President Joe Biden." The subject has been discussed and written about in the country for the last few days and the PM’s statement on Thursday has once again confounded many who wonder why Khan needed to say what he has said. "I keep hearing that President Biden hasn’t called me. It’s his business. It’s not like I am waiting for any phone call," Imran said in response to a question from a journalist. Khan’s supporters and opponents had a field day discussing the subject on social media. Memes were made and comments were shared on Twitter showing the PM waiting for a call that he now says he is not interested in receiving. A leading satirist and columnist for Dawn newspaper, Nadeem Farooq Paracha, posted a picture showing President Biden on the phone saying he was only ordering a pizza in response to being asked whether he was calling the Pakistan PM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/us-has-decided-that-india-is-a-strategic-ally-says-pakistan-pm-imran-khan/articleshow/85285153.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The fall of Ghazni, capital of its eponymous province, means that the Taliban now control the most important highway connecting Kabul to the south of the country. It also means they have effectively severed President Ashraf Ghani’s government’s connections to important provinces like Kandahar, Helmand and Farah. Extensive fighting had been on around Ghazni for days. Ghazni, an ancient city, was the seat of Mahmud of Ghazni, the first of the Turkic mamluk-origin Ghaznavids and the conqueror who is said by some historians to have invaded India 17 times, and to have plundered the Somnath temple in 1025 CE. Speaking to the media, a Ghazni provincial council member said that the Taliban have taken most of the city, including the governor’s compound, while Afghan forces currently control a police base on the outskirts of the city. While Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is flying to northern towns, like Mazar-e-Sharif to seek help from the warlords, the Taliban march to besiege the capital is picking up pace by the hour. The country’s interior ministry, meanwhile, said the Afghan police had arrested Ghazni governor Mohammad Dawood Laghmani and his deputy in Maidan Wardak province, south of Kabul, after they had fled the provincial capital. In southern Afghanistan, the insurgents, who have besieged Kandahar for weeks, claimed they had taken control of the prison and freed more than 1,000 inmates. While the Afghan government has not confirmed the prison takeover, the militant group has shared a video showing the prisoners walking outside the jail. In Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province in the south, the militants have taken over the regional police headquarters. According to government sources, some police officers surrendered while others retreated to the nearby governor’s office still controlled by Afghan forces. Fighting between the Taliban and government forces has been on for weeks in Lashkar Gah. While the Taliban are taking over control of the north, the west and the south of the country, and might soon begin marching on Kabul, the national capital, the inability of the Western-trained and equipped Afghan defence forces to retake any lost ground is worrying their backers in the West. Reminding the Afghan government of American efforts, US President Joe Biden had said on Wednesday: "We spent over a trillion dollars over 20 years. We trained and equipped with modern equipment over 300,000 Afghan forces. Afghan leaders have to come together. They’ve got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-within-two-hours-of-kabul-after-ghazni-falls/articleshow/85285404.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

This new rule will kick in from August 15. The days leading to this move was preceded by a 60-km protest, from Tungar Phata, Vasai to Collector Office Palghar, by 200 hoteliers and restaurateurs. On August 6, a delegation from the restaurant sector, which included hospitality associations — NRAI, HRAWI, AHAR and HAI, met the Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to voice their concerns. He assured the F&B industry that he would personally discuss the subject with the State COVID Task Force and arrive at a decision soon. Hopefully we should have the 1.30am deadline back: Restaurant ownersSherry Bhatia, President, HRAWI, says, “The hospitality industry thanks the Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, the government authorities and the COVID-19 task force for easing the restrictions. Restaurants will now be able to make some business, which was just impossible while operating until 4pm. The industry, including owners and people employed in it, has suffered for over 16 months of income deprivation. We were hoping that since restaurants continue to operate at only 50 per cent capacity, the government could have allowed us to remain open till midnight.” Sherry Bhatia adds, “However, the CM has kept his promise, and we welcome this move and expect more easing of restrictions shortly.” Restaurant owners are now hopeful of getting back to the 1.30am deadline like the good ol‘ days. Restaurateur Riyaaz Amlani says, “We would have ideally wanted a 1.30am deadline, however this is a step in the right direction. Restaurants have been suffering for a long time now and we are just grateful to be given an extension to 10pm. The government should review this in a week or two from now, and hopefully we should have the 1.30am deadline back by September 1.” ‘We need to work together to ensure our doors are open for the long haul’Restaurateur Pritina Shrestha Tuli says, “All our fellow restaurateurs have been working hard to follow each and every COVID guideline possible. We are all focused on getting the right SOPs in place to ensure the safety of all guests and staff. We need to work together to make sure our doors are open for the long haul and we are prepared to do all it takes to do that. We truly hope that in due time the government has faith to increase the timing to usual licensed hours.” ‘The 10pm deadline is a bad idea’Restaurateur Amrish Arora believes that the newly allotted time for eateries is not a good idea. He says, “The 10pm deadline is a bad idea. It’s cramping up dinner time again. Diners are going to make reservations in all restaurants and some restaurants will surely flout the rules to accommodate that. This is encouraging more unscrupulous ways of doing business. It’s also anti-COVID as you are compressing our time and putting so much stress on the system. The government should give us our time of 1.30am as per our license, so that we can comfortably manage our people. We have come out of two years of stress and this is going to kill us. The task force needs to have a meeting with the heads of the hotels and restaurant associations and find out what is possible and what is plausible.” He adds, "The Task Force had till today allowed us all to function without vaccination. We could serve lunch without the double vaccination +14 days and now suddenly from 15 August onwards the rule changes?" ‘It’s like telling us not to open at all’Talking on behalf of the industry, Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, Vice President of the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI), and spokesperson of HRAWI, says, “We should be allowed to operate as per our licence timings and not 10pm. The deadline is probably good for Pune, because they have almost three times the amount of cases that Mumbai has. A lesser or same treatment is nothing short of surprising. I would request the CM to review these timings and re-review the guidelines set by the task force which is nothing short of ridiculous. The entire industry is really disappointed with these new guidelines, because it is also like telling us please do not open, remain shut. So I would request the CM to please go through these guidelines and remove the anomalies and contradictions. They must either increase the capacity to higher than 50 per cent or to increase the timings, otherwise, it will be impossible for us to operate.” Some questions raised by the F&B industry stakeholdersThe new 10 pm guidelines for restaurants in Mumbai has also got the F&B industry posing more questions as one of the requirements for a restaurant to be operational is that its staff should be fully vaccinated...  We have been pleading with the government to prioritise vaccination for hospitality staff for the past 10 months. Why was it not done? Most staff in the hospitality industry are between the 18-45 age-group, so why were they not prioritised by the government for vaccination? Will they make vaccination for hospitality staff available now and bring down the 84-days deadline? Malls to remain open till 10pm, tooMaharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope reportedly said that from August 15 onwards, malls in Mumbai will remain open till 10pm. The staff have to be fully vaccinated with both doses and will be allowed only after 14 days from the second dose. Social distancing and all other SOPs have to be maintained in the malls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/restaurateurs-thankful-for-10-pm-deadline-but-question-why-not-extend-it-to-1-30am/articleshow/85272954.cms||Debarati S Sen

The company claims to have vaccinated as many as 1,299 truckers arriving at APMC truck terminal from different states. According to the firm, more than 40% truck drivers are not vaccinated even with a single dose due to reasons like being on the move, no availability of smartphones, etc. The company had arranged vaccination camps in other cities too with a target to vaccinate 10,000 truckers across the country. A company spokesperson said, “As per a recent study conducted by the company in association with a market research company, revealed that out of 406 truck driver respondents, 65% needed technical assistance to book their slots while 54% faced challenges to find vaccine slots because of the constant commute that their profession dictates. Furthermore, close to 40% showed lack of awareness and knowledge about how and where to get the vaccine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/two-day-vax-drive-sees-1299-truckers-getting-jabs/articleshow/85286448.cms||George Mendonca

MMRDA officials requesting anonymity said the surface on one of the arms developed some cracks few days back following which the authority decided to rope in experts to ascertain its stability. Subsequently, the bridge that was to be flagged off anytime soon is likely to be delayed it is learnt thereby adding to the chaos on the arterial stretch which is a crucial crossover point for inter-city and freight traffic between Pune-Thane-Nashik and Mumbai. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis who visited the bridge, Thursday, said the bridge widening was vital and claimed to have stepped in with additional funds for the works during his tenure as the chief minister. “The initial cost of the work was Rs 9 cr but spiralled over the years and got stuck for several years. I allocated over Rs 200 cr funds for the work and I feel the arms should be thrown open soon,” said Fadnavis while talking to the media. It may be recalled the work was started last three years andwas to be executed in two phases with the first where two arms of three lanes each would be constructed on either sides of the existing span and opened up beforethe two existing lanes are demolished and reconstructed. Cabinet minister Eknath Shinde who recently oversaw the progress said the entire widened bridge would be thrown open for public in the coming months. However, with the MMRDA not yet ready with a deadline, it has added to the worries of the average commuter who spends a considerable amount of time here. “The bridge widening work is very important for smooth and faster passage of traffic between Thane and Mumbai. We have not yet been notified by the MMRDA of any dates for opening up of the stretches for traffic,” said Balasaheb Patil, deputy commissioner of police, Thane traffic. Meanwhile, MMRDA commissioner Srinivas SVR, Thursday, confirmed to TOI they are awaiting a report from the Bombay IIT after some cracks had developed on the surface of one of the lanes. “It doesn’t look like a major fault but we are nonetheless getting an expert report. There are some pending works on both the arms of the bridge and once it is completed, it willbe opened up for traffic,” said Srinivas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/kopri-bridge-to-open-after-fitness-report-from-iit-b/articleshow/85285958.cms||Manoj Badgeri

---||India||Centre notifies ban on single-use plastic items from July 1, 2022, increases thickness of polythene bags to 120 microns||NEW DELHI: Seeking to make India single-use plastic-free by next year and deal with the menace of huge uncollected plastic waste across the country, the Centre on Thursday notified ban on the use of ‘single-use plastic items from July 1 next year and increased thickness of polythene bags from 50 microns to 120 microns. The thickness clause will, however, be implemented in a staggered manner in two phases, beginning September 30. Currently, polythene bags of less than 50 microns are banned in the country. But under the new rules, polythene bags of less than 75 microns in thickness will be banned from September 30 and bags of less than 120 microns will be banned from December 31 next year. The notification, issued by the environment ministry said that the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of single-use plastic, including polystyrene and expanded polystyrene, commodities will be prohibited with effect from July 1, 2022. Such 'single-use plastic items include earbuds with plastic sticks, plastic sticks for balloons, plastic flags, candy sticks, ice-cream sticks, polystyrene [thermo-col] for decoration; plates, cups, glasses, cutlery such as forks, spoons, knives, straw, trays, wrapping or packing films around sweet boxes, invitation cards, and cigarette packets, plastic or PVC banners less than 100 micron and stirrers. The staggered plan on thickness clause has been approved so that it doesn't affect small businesses and traders. The ministry had March notified the draft. The final decision was notified on Thursday after considering the views of stakeholders on the draft. The notification also for the first time defined the ‘single-use plastic and identified such items which are to be banned in a staggered manner. It says “single-use plastic commodity” means a plastic item intended to be used once for the same purpose before being disposed of or recycled. An increase in the thickness of carrying bags, made of virgin or recycled plastic, will substantially improve the collection and recycling of used carrier bags. The move assumes significance as currently, 40% of total plastic waste remains uncollected in the country every day. The uncollected plastic waste causes choking of drainage and river systems, soil and water contamination, littering of the marine ecosystem, ingestion by stray animals, and open-air burning leading to adverse impact on human health and the environment. Under the notification, it will be the responsibility of urban local bodies and ‘gram panchayats’ for setting up and coordinating the waste management system and for performing the associated functions such as ensuring segregation, collection, storage, transportation, processing and disposal of plastic waste. The provision of thickness will not be applicable to carry bags made up of compostable plastic. The manufacturers or sellers or brand owners of compostable plastic carry bags will have to obtain a certificate from the Central Pollution Control Board before marketing/selling or using those stuff including plastic packaging materials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-notifies-ban-on-single-use-plastic-items-from-july-1-2022-increases-thickness-of-polythene-bags-to-120-microns/articleshow/85286261.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||World||Migrants find themselves stranded abroad by new US policy||EL CEIBO: Karla Leiva sat on the patio of a migrant shelter near the Guatemala-Mexico border Thursday with her 5-year-old daughter Zoe. They had been in three countries in the past 24 hours, none of them their own. Leiva, 32, from Yoro in north-central Honduras, had arrived at the shelter in El Ceibo on Wednesday. She and her daughter had started that day 1,000 miles to the north in Brownsville, Texas, where they were put on a plane by the US government with dozens of others mothers and children without knowing where it was going. The rumour running among the migrants was that they were being sent to California. Eventually, while in the air, they were told the plane would land in Villahermosa, in southern Mexico's Tabasco state. There, Mexican authorities hustled them onto buses that drove them the three-plus hours to the Guatemalan border. Leiva and her daughter were swept up in the latest US government effort to deter migrants and asylum-seekers from arriving at its southern border. While still delivering some migrants on flights directly to their Central American nations, the U.S. government has started supplementing with flights to southern Mexican cities like Villahermosa and Tapachula, where Mexican authorities carry them the rest of the way to Guatemala's border, even if they're not Guatemalan. Since last year, the US has not been allowing migrants to solicit asylum at the southern border under a pandemic-related ban. Leiva said she was not asked by US or Mexican authorities if she feared returning to her country. At the Mexico-Guatemala border, they were told to walk into Guatemala and look for the shelter. No one registered their entrance into Guatemala. They were not asked for evidence of a negative Covid-19 test required of all foreigners entering Guatemala. "No one told me anything. They never heard my case and why I went to the United States," Leiva said. "I couldn't tell them that they were extorting me and that they threatened to kidnap my little daughter and take my adolescent sons to join the gang. That's why I left the country." Responding to reporters' questions on Thursday, US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas made his department's first public acknowledgement that it is expelling Central Americans on the flights to southern Mexico. The Mexican government has been publicly silent. Mayorkas said the U.S. was coordinating with the Mexican government on flights that include Central Americans and ensuring that they comply with international law to provide humanitarian protection when warranted. He didn't elaborate. The flights to the interior of Mexico are part of efforts to discourage returns by migrants apprehended along the Southwest border, Mayorkas said during a visit to the Rio Grande Valley. "If in fact they are turned around and placed in the northern part of Mexico, it is too facile, too easy for them to return and try an illegal entry again," he said. "And so in response to that recidivism, to deter and prevent that recidivism from occurring, we are expelling them further into the interior of Mexico, which is far more difficult to try again." He said the Biden administration has made changes to border policy, including allowing unaccompanied children into the country, but said people without a legal claim to residency would be removed under the law. On Wednesday, five United Nations agencies, including the High Commissioner for Refugees, expressed concern over the U.S. policy and repeated their call for the Biden administration to lift the so-called Title 42 restriction on asylum. Mayorkas said the people being expelled to the interior of Mexico have been expelled under Title 42. For years, the US government has intermittently flown deported Mexican migrants back to the interior to make it more difficult to try to cross the border again, but this appears to be the first time it has flown Central Americans to Mexico instead of their home countries. The move comes after President Joe Biden jettisoned many of his predecessor's hardline immigration policies, describing them as cruel or unwise, including one that made asylum-seekers wait in Mexican border cities for hearings in US immigration court. Biden also scrapped agreements with Central American nations for asylum-seekers from third countries to be sent there to have their claims heard, denying any prospect of settling in the United States. The Biden administration has said it wants to focus on addressing the root causes of migration from Central America. Vice President Kamala Harris has led that effort, visiting Mexico and Guatemala to discuss how the U.S. can help while encouraging people not to come. But those are at best medium-term solutions, while at the U.S. border, the number of encounters between US authorities and migrants keeps rising. Leiva had left Yoro on July 27 with her daughter and three older sons. Twelve days later, she and her daughter crossed the Rio Grande on a raft into Texas with a smuggler and were quickly apprehended. She said her sons were supposed to have followed, but didn't manage to cross. U.S. authorities took Leiva and Zoe to Brownsville. Two days later they were put on the plane. On Thursday, they both still wore the identifying wrist bands US authorities gave them. The orange-painted hilltop shelter here has been filling this week as more migrants are dropped at the border daily.

Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said opposition leaders were shedding crocodile tears as their agenda of “anarchy” was exposed. He claimed that the opposition MPs had warned of dire consequences, in case any bill other than the one to restore rights of states to draw up OBC lists, was taken up for passage. Leader of the House Piyush Goyal said MPs climbed the table, tried to break the gate while a window glass was actually broken and a woman security staff injured. She had lodged a complaint and on Tuesday a file was thrown at the chair. Times viewRegular ruckus and disruption in Parliament creates an unhealthy political atmosphere. So does ending a session before its due date. The unpleasant situation involving marshals was caused by this poisoned atmosphere. It is a pointer to declining decorum in the House and falling standards of democracy. The slide must be arrested before it's too late.“We called on Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and urged him to take strong action against these MPs so that none dares to repeat such acts of vandalism in the House in future,” Goyal said and added, “The Opposition's approach of `my way or highway' is highly condemnable and the country also condemns such attitude.” Goyal also referred to the action against “unruly” MPs when late Somnath Chatterjee was the Lok Sabha Speaker. Chatterjee had taken an unprecedented move, cracking the whip by referring as many as 32 MPs to the privileges committee after they paid no heed to repeated warnings of disciplinary action. Goyal also clarified that 30 marshals were on duty on Wednesday and there was no one from outside as was alleged by some leaders like NCP’s Sharad Pawar. The Union ministers cited videos showing women marshals being jostled by the opposition MPs. The two ministers were also joined by Bhupender Yadav, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Anurag Thakur, Arjun Ram Meghwal and V Muraleedharan. About Opposition allegations that they were not allowed to speak, Goyal accused them of being “selective” as they sought division once and took part in the constitution amendment bill on OBC. I&B minister Anurag Thakur said, “The Secretary General’s table in Rajya Sabha is not meant for dancing and protesting.” He alleged that “anarchy from streets to Parliament” was the Opposition’s only agenda during the monsoon session. He said the Opposition should apologise to the nation for what happened in Parliament during the session. “Congress and some other opposition parties have committed a sin of spreading pollution in Parliament and political hypocrisy on the streets during the monsoon Session. This is called “Chori Aur Seena Zori,” Naqvi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/seven-mantris-take-house-battle-to-opposition/articleshow/85287435.cms||---

The opposition parties, led by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and including NCP leader Sharad Pawar, wrote to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu complaining against “use of unacceptable force and physical manhandling of MPs including women members” by security personnel deployed in the House. “What happened last evening was a shocking, unprecedented insult to our democracy and the very dignity of the House. Opposition MPs were prevented from registering their protest against the General Insurance amendment bill...,” the letter said. The opposition condemned the “authoritarian attitude and undemocratic actions of the government”. But TMC stayed away from the activities on Thursday, creating an irritant for the bloc as its leaders said the party will not be taken for granted. Speaking to the media, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said he felt like he was standing “on the Pakistan border and not in Parliament”. Rahul Gandhi, who was in the march, said for the first time, MPs in Rajya Sabha were beaten up. “This was nothing short of murder of democracy.” RJD’s Manoj Jha said, “The PM is constructing a new Parliament building, and also digging the grave of parliamentary norms.” While training his guns at Rajya Sabha Chairman and Lok Sabha Speaker for not “running the Houses”, Rahul addressed the people, alleging, “The PM of India is selling the country. He is selling the soul of India to two-three industrialists and that is why the opposition is not allowed to talk about farmers or unemployment, insurance bill or Pegasus.” The opposition also issued a joint statement accusing the government of deliberately derailing the monsoon session. It said the government ran away from parliamentary accountability and a debate on Pegasus, which resulted in the deadlock. “The Parliament session is over. Frankly, as far as 60 % of country is concerned, there was no Parliament session as the voice of 60% of people was crushed, humiliated,” Rahul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opposition-marches-in-protest-slams-use-of-force-on-mps/articleshow/85287702.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The new rule, which comes in force from Monday, will instead require close contacts of positive Covid-19 cases to get a free PCR test as soon as possible and self-isolate in case of a positive test. The government had announced the plans last month and confirmed it this week as official figures showed that 75 per cent of people have now received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. "Getting two doses of a vaccine has tipped the odds in our favour and allowed us to safely reclaim our lost freedoms, and from Monday we can take another huge step back towards our normal lives by removing self-isolation requirements for double jabbed people who are contacts of people with Covid-19. Double jabbed people who test positive will still need to self-isolate," said UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid. "Vaccines are what will bring this pandemic to an end - the wall of defence provided by the rollout is allowing us to get even closer to normal life," he said. Under current rules, critical workers were allowed to leave self-isolation to ensure vital services continued. But the changes to be introduced from Monday will mean that fully vaccinated contacts will routinely be able to attend work if they do not have symptoms. "Thanks to the huge success of the vaccine programme, we are able to ease self-isolation requirements for double jabbed people and under 18s. It is important that close contacts continue to come forward for a PCR test, in order to detect the virus and variants of concern," said Dr Jenny Harries, UK Health Security Agency Chief Executive (UKHSA). "Although two doses of vaccine will greatly reduce your own risk of becoming unwell with Covid-19, it is still possible to contract the virus and pass it to others. So if you develop symptoms at any time - vaccinated or not - you should get a test and be very careful in your contact with others until you have received a negative test result," she said. The latest data from Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University shows that around 60,000 deaths, 22 million infections and 66,900 hospitalisations have been prevented by the vaccines. Meanwhile, the UK's latest daily coronavirus data on Thursday recorded 33,074 new infections and 94 deaths in a 24-hour period, compared with 29,612 new cases and 104 fatalities reported on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-confirms-covid-19-quarantine-rule-change-for-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/85287767.cms||---
---||World||More than 9,000 anti-Asian incidents since pandemic began||The frequency of anti-Asian incidents - from taunts to outright assaults - reported in the United States so far this year seems poised to surpass last year despite months of political and social activism, according to a new report released Thursday. Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition that became the authority on gathering data on racially motivated attacks related to the pandemic, received 9,081 incident reports between March 19, 2020, and this June. Of those, 4,548 occurred last year, and 4,533 this year. Since the coronavirus was first reported in China, people of Asian and Pacific Islander descent have been treated as scapegoats solely based on their race.  Lawmakers, activists and community groups have pushed back against the wave of attacks. There have been countless social media campaigns, bystander training sessions and public rallies. In May, president Joe Biden signed the bipartisan Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, expediting Justice Department reviews of anti-Asian hate crimes and making available federal grants. Those supporters should not feel discouraged because the data hasn't shifted much, Stop AAPI Hate leaders said.  "When you encourage hate, it's not like a genie in a bottle where you can pull it out and push it back in whenever you want," said Manjusha Kulkarni, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council. "There's too much perpetuating these belief systems to make them go away."  Several factors contributed to the data, from an increase in incidents to a greater desire to report, according to Kulkarni. As the economy opened up more in the past few months, it meant more public interactions and opportunities to attack, she said. Also, a bump in reporting typically occurs after a high-profile incident like the March 16 Atlanta-area spa shootings that left six Asian women dead.  "There, too, is where we saw some that were incidents that had taken place weeks or months before, but they just were either not aware of our reporting center or didn't take the time to report," Kulkarni said.  The reports aggregated by Stop AAPI Hate are from the victims themselves or someone reporting on their behalf, like an adult child. Overall, the report found verbal harassment and shunning - interactions that don't qualify legally as hate crimes - make up the two largest shares of total incidents. Physical assaults made up the third. But their percentage of the incidents this year increased from last year - 16.6% compared to 10.8%.  More than 63% of the incidents were submitted by women. Roughly 31% took place on public streets, and 30% at businesses.  Many Asian Americans and others blame former President Donald Trump for ratcheting up the danger by talking about the virus in racially charged terms. While Biden has demonstrated allyship, there is concern that a U.S. investigation into the origins of COVID-19 could lead to more hostility and treatment of Asian Americans as enemy foreigners.  "We understand that other nation-states are competitors to the United States, and a number of them do have authoritarian regimes," Kulkarni said. "But the ways in which we talk about the people and the ways in which blame is assigned somehow looks different for communities of color than it does for, say, the Russian government or the German government."  Many of the headline-making attacks over the past year and a half have been against elderly Asian people on both coasts. In most of those cases, a senior was beaten, kicked, shoved or even stabbed out of nowhere. Several such incidents have been caught on video.  A U.S. Census survey released earlier this month found Asian American households were twice as likely as white households to admit they didn't have enough food throughout the pandemic because they were afraid to go out - not due to affordability or transportation issues. In contrast, other racial groups' households said they were experiencing food insecurity because of the pandemic. Asian American respondents didn't say specifically if it was fear of racial attacks that kept them at home.  Anni Chung, president and CEO of San Francisco-based Self-Help for the Elderly, says the seniors they help were hit by a "second virus that is a hate virus." The nonprofit provides food and programs to more than 40,000 older adults in the Bay Area, most of them Asian. The organization went from transporting a pre-pandemic load of 400 meals daily to over 5,000 per day. Last year, they gave out 963,000 meals overall compared with 436,000 typically.  "Sometimes when we talk to seniors, they say this hatred drove them to be stuck in their house even worse than the pandemic," Chung said.  For them, the fear is more than a headline but something in their own backyard.  "One of our clients was on the bus. Right before the man got off the bus, he just punched her," Chung said. "She said no one - not the bus driver and a number of Chinese on the bus - went to her care."  Giving into that fear means seniors have missed important things like doctor's appointments or exercise routines at the park. So, in June, with some funding from the city, Self-Help for the Elderly expanded a volunteer escort service to accompany seniors on errands or outings around Chinatown and other neighborhoods. It had more than 200 requests that month.  The onslaught of verbal and physical assaults has drawn more skepticism than sympathy from some. Peter Yu, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Colorado who is also Chinese American, came under fire last month for characterizing anti-Asian hate crimes as exaggerated.  "I would welcome him to look at the data and see there has been a significant increase," Kulkarni said. "This may be a situation when people refuse to see racism or misogyny. I think they're just really refusing to see reality and how unfortunately, in the U.S, we have allowed those forces to prevent people from living their lives."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/more-than-9000-anti-asian-incidents-since-pandemic-began/articleshow/85287886.cms||---
---||World||Houston to join schools rebelling against state bans on mask mandates||Houston's public schools were expected on Thursday to defy a state ban on mask mandates, joining other districts in Texas and Florida requiring face coverings in classrooms to fight a surge of Covid-19 infections, despite threats from their governors.  The board of the Houston Independent School District was due to vote on a mask mandate on Thursday, flouting Republican Governor Greg Abbott's ban on such rules.  "The health and safety of our students and staff continues to be our guiding compass in all of our decisions," wrote the district's superintendent, Millard House II, in a statement.  The measure is likely to pass, with a majority of board members expressing support for the mandate, the Houston Chronicle reported.  With the start of the academic year coinciding with a dire new wave of Covid-19 cases, schools have quickly become the focal point of the nation's political fight over masking and vaccine mandates.  The threat by Florida to withhold the salaries of school officials who require masks has escalated tension between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, and the administration of US president Joe Biden, a Democrat.  The White House is considering reimbursing Florida school officials if DeSantis, who is widely seen as weighing a potential 2024 challenge for the presidency, follows through on his threat.  The worst of the Covid outbreak is concentrated in the US South, including Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana and Texas, where intensive care units have been stretched to capacity. While flouting federal recommendations on masks, Florida has asked Washington to help by sending ventilators.  The number of daily cases across the country has doubled in the last two weeks, according to a Reuters tally, reaching a six-month peak, while the average number of daily deaths has increased 85% in the last 14 days.  In Texas, some 10,000 people are hospitalized with the virus. In Florida, where Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has banned mask mandates and threatened to withhold the salaries of school administrators who defy the order, about 15,000 people are hospitalized. Florida has set new hospitalization records for 11 days in a row, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Florida and Texas account for about a third of the nation's Covid-19 hospitalizations, although they only represent about 15% of the population.  "Our frontline health care heroes are finding themselves stretched thin and physical and mental exhaustion is taking its toll," Florida Hospital Association President Mary Mayhew said in a statement on Tuesday. "This new Delta variant is extremely infectious and leading to 25 and 35 year olds hospitalized for Covid." Schools as political battlegrounds Students and teachers across the United States are back in classrooms or about to start school this month as Covid-19 cases are surging at a pace not seen since the winter, with the Delta variant driving up transmission and causing mostly the unvaccinated to get sick and die.  On Thursday, the National Education Association President Becky Pringle, who leads the largest teachers' union in the country, said she supported vaccine mandates for teachers. Her statement came on the heels of a similar announcement from the American Federation of Teachers' president earlier this week.  Several school districts in Arizona have mandated mask-wearing, despite a state law against such mandates. A group of Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday called on Republican Governor Doug Ducey to withhold funds from districts that were enforcing the mandates, saying their noncompliance with state law "borders on anarchy."  A few Florida school districts, including Broward County, have issued mask mandates, prompting investigations by the state Department of Education and exposing superintendents and school board members to the risk of losing their salaries.  In Texas earlier this week, district judges ruled in favor of allowing Dallas and San Antonio public schools to require masks, dealing a blow to Governor Abbott.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/houston-to-join-schools-rebelling-against-state-bans-on-mask-mandates/articleshow/85288085.cms||---
---||World||US sending 3,000 troops for partial Afghan embassy evacuation||WASHINGTON: With security rapidly deteriorating in Afghanistan, the United States is sending in an additional 3,000 troops to help evacuate some personnel from the US Embassy in Kabul, officials said Thursday. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said one Army and two Marine infantry battalions will enter Afghanistan within the next two days to assist at the Kabul airport with the partial embassy evacuation. State Department spokesman Ned Price said diplomatic work will continue at the Kabul embassy.  "Our first responsibility has always been protecting the safety and the security of our citizens serving in Afghanistan, and around the world," Price said at a State Department briefing, calling the the speed of the Taliban advance and resulting instability "of grave concern."  Price insisted Thursday's move shouldn't be seen as encouraging an already emboldened Taliban and said, "We are committed to supporting Afghanistan and its people. That commitment remains."  But the move suggests a lack of confidence by the Biden administration in the Afghan government's ability to provide sufficient diplomatic security in Kabul as a series of provincial capitals have fallen to a Taliban offensive this week.  Kirby said an additional 1,000 members of an Army-Air Force task force were going to the Gulf country of Qatar to help with visa processing for the ongoing evacuation of former translators and other Afghans who had worked with Americans in Afghanistan.  And an Army brigade combat team of up to 4,000 troops from North Carolina's Fort Bragg was going to Kuwait to be on standby in case more troops were needed for the embassy mission.  Kirby stressed the new deployments were a temporary mission focused only on the embassy drawdown and helping the State Department accelerate the visa processing for Afghan translators and others, not a move to get involved in the war again.  The US has withdrawn most of its troops and formally ends its role in the war on Aug. 31. The Pentagon had kept about 650 troops in Afghanistan to support US diplomatic security, including at the airport.  Afghan government forces are collapsing even faster than US military leaders thought possible just a few months ago when President Joe Biden ordered a full withdrawal.  The Taliban, who ruled the country from 1996 until US forces invaded after the 9/11 attacks, captured three more provincial capitals Wednesday and two on Thursday, the 10th and 11th the insurgents have taken in a weeklong sweep that has given them effective control of about two-thirds of the country. The insurgents have no air force and are outnumbered by US-trained Afghan defense forces, but they have captured territory, including the country's third-largest city, Herat, with stunning speed.  In a new warning to Americans in Afghanistan, the second it has issued since Saturday, the US Embassy in Kabul on Thursday again urged US citizens to leave immediately. The advisory was released before the announcements in Washington about further reducing already limited staff at the embassy.  The United States continues to support the Afghan military with limited airstrikes, but those have not made a strategic difference thus far and are scheduled to end on Aug. 31. Biden could continue airstrikes beyond that date, but given his firm stance on ending the war, that seems unlikely.  The most recent American military assessment, taking into account the Taliban's latest gains, says Kabul could be under insurgent pressure by September and that the country could fall entirely to Taliban control within a couple of months, according to a defense official who discussed the internal analysis Wednesday on condition of anonymity.  Military officials watching the deteriorating situation said that so far the Taliban haven't taken steps to threaten Kabul. But it isn't clear if the Taliban will wait until they have gained control of the bulk of the country before attempting to seize the capital.  The security of the US diplomatic corps has been talked about for months, even before the Taliban's battlefield blitz. The military has long had various planning options for evacuating personnel from Afghanistan. Those options would largely be determined by the White House and the State Department.  A key component of the options would be whether the US military would have unfettered access to the Kabul international airport, allowing personnel to be flown systematically out of the capital. In a grimmer environment, American forces might have to fight their way in and out if the Taliban have infiltrated the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-sending-3000-troops-for-partial-afghan-embassy-evacuation/articleshow/85288263.cms||---
---||World||Donald Trump appeals split decision in fight with US House over financial records||WASHINGTON: A long-running court fight between Donald Trump and a House of Representatives committee over his financial records is heading back to an appeals court after a judge issued a split decision this week.  In court documents filed on Thursday, Trump's lawyers and attorneys for the House Oversight Committee both asked the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review a decision issued on Wednesday.  In that ruling, US District Judge Amit Mehta said Trump's accounting firm, Mazars, should turn over some financial documents to the Democratic-led House committee but not all of the records the panel had sought.  Mehta's ruling came in a long-running lawsuit brought by the House Oversight Committee, which first issued a subpoena for Trump's financial records in 2019.  The lawsuit was back in Mehta's courtroom after a trip to the US Supreme Court. In a July 2020 decision, the high court said Mehta needed to redo his legal analysis and weigh the House's needs for Trump's financial records against the burden such a request puts on the former president.  Mehta on Wednesday said Mazars should turn over documents relating to Trump's hotel in Washington, DC, saying the committee proved that it needed them to evaluate potential legislation and conduct government oversight.  But he did not allow House investigators to see disclosure forms Trump submitted to the government that outlined his assets and liabilities.  Unlike other recent presidents, Trump refused to release his tax returns and other documents that could provide details on his wealth and the activities of his family company, the Trump Organization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/donald-trump-appeals-split-decision-in-fight-with-us-house-over-financial-records/articleshow/85288417.cms||---
---||World||Israel says it downed a Hezbollah drone that crossed border||TEL AVIV: Israel downed an unarmed Hezbollah drone that crossed the border from Lebanon, the army said Thursday. In a statement, the army said it downed the drone after it crossed the border into Israeli airspace. The incident on Wednesday was the latest uptick in activity along Israel's northern border. Last week, the Iran-backed militant Hezbollah group claimed credit for firing rockets toward Israel. That was preceded by a rocket attack launched from Lebanese territory, though it remained unclear by whom. Israel responded with artillery and rare airstrikes. Lebanon is experiencing its worst economic and financial crisis in its modern history, which the World Bank describes as among the worst the world has witnessed since the mid 1800s. Still, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the Lebanese government is responsible for attacks launched from Lebanon toward Israel, no matter by whom. Israel estimates that Hezbollah possesses over 130,000 rockets and missiles capable of striking anywhere in the country. In recent years, Israel also has expressed concerns that the group is trying to import or develop an arsenal of precision-guided missiles. Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader, said he'd retaliate against any future Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon and added it would be wrong to assume Hezbollah would be constrained by internal divisions in Lebanon or the country's harsh economic crisis.  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday said it was important for all sides "to avoid actions that can further heighten tensions and lead to miscalculation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israel-says-it-downed-a-hezbollah-drone-that-crossed-border/articleshow/85288522.cms||---
---||World||WHO urges China to share raw data on early Covid cases||GENEVA: The WHO on Thursday urged China to share raw data from the earliest Covid-19 cases to revive the pandemic origins probe -- and release information to address the controversial lab leak theory.  The World Health Organization stressed it was "vitally important" to uncover the origins of the worst pandemic in a century, which has killed at least 4.3 million people and battered the global economy since the virus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.  In the face of pushback from Beijing, the UN health agency called for the provision of "all data and access required so that the next series of studies can be commenced as soon as possible".  After much delay, a WHO team of international experts went to Wuhan in January 2021 to produce a first phase report, which was written in conjunction with their Chinese counterparts.  Their March report drew no firm conclusions, instead ranking four hypotheses.  It said the virus jumping from bats to humans via an intermediate animal was the most probable scenario, while a leak from the Wuhan virology labs was "extremely unlikely".  However, the investigation faced criticism for lacking transparency and access, and for not evaluating the lab-leak theory more deeply -- with the United States upping the pressure ever since.  A WHO call last month for the investigation's second stage to include audits of the Wuhan labs infuriated Beijing, with vice health minister Zeng Yixin saying the plan showed "disrespect for common sense and arrogance towards science".  - Data access critical: WHO - In a statement on advancing phase two of the studies, the WHO insisted the search was not "an exercise in attributing blame" or political point-scoring.  "The next series of studies would include a further examination of the raw data from the earliest cases and sera from potential early cases in 2019," the UN agency said.  "Access to data is critically important for evolving our understanding of science."  The WHO said it was working with several countries that reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from 2019 stored biological specimens.  For example, it said, in Italy, it had facilitated an independent evaluation by international laboratories, which included the blind retesting of pre-pandemic blood samples.  "Sharing raw data and giving permission for the retesting of samples in labs outside of Italy reflects scientific solidarity at its best and is no different from what we encourage all countries, including China, to support so that we can advance the studies of the origins quickly and effectively," the WHO said. Lab leak theoryAfter reading the phase one report, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus concluded that the probe into Wuhan's virology labs had not gone far enough.  Long derided as a right-wing conspiracy theory and vehemently rejected by Beijing, the hypothesis has been gaining momentum.  It was a favourite under former US president Donald Trump, but his successor Joe Biden is also keen to see this line of enquiry pursued.  "China and a number of other member states have written to WHO regarding the basis for further studies of the SARS-CoV-2 'lab hypothesis'," the WHO said.  "They have also suggested the origins study has been politicised, or that WHO has acted due to political pressure.  "In order to address the 'lab hypothesis', it is important to have access to all data and consider scientific best practice and look at the mechanisms WHO already has in place."  - Row on report - It added that analysing and improving lab safety and protocols "including in China, is important for our collective biosafety and security".  Meanwhile Danish scientist Peter Ben Embarek, who led the international mission to Wuhan, said a lab employee infected while taking samples in the field falls under one of the likely hypotheses as to how the virus passed from bats to humans.  He told the Danish public channel TV2 that the suspect bats were not from the Wuhan region and the only people likely to have approached them were workers from the Wuhan labs.  He also revealed that up until 48 hours before the end of the mission, the international and Chinese scientists still could not even agree on mentioning the lab theory in the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/who-urges-china-to-share-raw-data-on-early-covid-cases/articleshow/85288616.cms||---
---||World||Biden eyes tougher vaccine rules without provoking backlash||WASHINGTON: When the pace of vaccinations in the US first began to slow, President Joe Biden backed incentives like million-dollar cash lotteries if that's what it took to get shots in arms. But as new coronavirus infections soar, he's testing a tougher approach.  In just the past two weeks, Biden has forced millions of federal workers to attest to their vaccination status or face onerous new requirements. He's met with business leaders at the White House to press them to do the same.  Meanwhile, the administration has taken steps toward mandating shots for people traveling into the US from overseas. And the White House is weighing options to be more assertive at the state and local level, including potential support for school districts imposing rules to prevent spread of the virus over the objection of Republican leaders.  "To the mayors, school superintendents, educators, local leaders, who are standing up to the governors politicizing mask protection for our kids: thank you," Biden said Thursday. "Thank God that we have heroes like you, and I stand with you all, and America should as well."  But even as Biden becomes more aggressive, he has refrained from using all of his powers to pressure Americans to get vaccinated. He's held off, for instance, on proposals to require vaccinations for all air travelers or, for that matter, the federal work force. The result is a precarious balancing act as Biden works to make life more uncomfortable for the unvaccinated without spurring a backlash in a deeply polarized country that would only undermine his public health goals.  Vaccine mandates are "the right lever at the right time," said Ben Wakana, the deputy director of strategic communications & engagement for the White House Covid-19 response, noting the public's increasing confidence in the vaccines and adding that it marks a new phase in the government's campaign to encourage Americans to get shots.  Many Republicans, particularly those eyeing the party's 2024 presidential nomination, disagree and warn of federal overreaching into decisions that should be left to individuals. Biden and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, an epicenter of the latest virus wave, have spent weeks feuding over the proper role of government during a public health crisis.  There is notable support for vaccine mandates. According to a recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 51% of Americans say the federal government should recommend that employers require their workers to get vaccinated, while 45% say it should not.  For now, Biden has required most federal workers to attest to their vaccination status under potential criminal penalties, with those who have not received a dose required to social-distance, test weekly for the virus and face other potential restrictions on their work.  Health workers at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services will be required to get vaccinated, and the Pentagon's announced that it intends to mandate vaccines for the military by next month.  The sharper federal approach comes as nearly 90 million eligible Americans still have not been vaccinated and as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, says shots are the only path for the nation to contain the delta variant.  White House officials say Biden wanted to initially operate with restraint to ensure that Americans were ready for the strong-arming from the federal government. The federal moves have been carefully calibrated to encourage a wave of businesses and governments to follow suit.  Biden administration officials briefed prominent Washington trade groups including the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable ahead of the federal announcement in hopes their members would follow suit. White House officials have fielded dozens of calls from business executive in recent weeks about how to implement their own vaccination mandates, officials said, sharing best practices and tips for how to protect their workforces.  "Through vaccination requirements, employers have the power to help end the pandemic," White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Thursday, naming companies, universities and local governments that have implemented them.  The new restrictions appear to be having the desired effect. The rules combined with fresh concerns from the surging delta variant have nearly doubled the average rate that Americans are getting newly vaccinated from last month to about 450,000 per day.  Zients said the White House still has no plans to develop the infrastructure for so-called vaccine passports, despite some criticism from businesses that the patchwork of local and state verification systems leaves them without a clear way to enforce mandates. The Biden administration had promised to share frameworks for verification systems, but ultimately left them all to the private sector and local governments, in part because of political sensitivities.  Still, while more severe measures such as mandating vaccines for interstate travel or changing how the federal government reimburses treatment for those who are unvaccinated and become ill with Covid-19 have been discussed, the administration worried that they would be too polarizing for the moment.  That's not to say they won't be implemented in the future, as public opinion continues to shift toward requiring vaccinations as a means to restore normalcy.  Lawrence Gostin, a professor of health law at Georgetown University, said Biden would likely need to continue to turn up the pressure on the vaccinated. "He's really going to have to use all the leverage the federal government has, and indeed use pressure points," Gostin said. "And I think there are a few that he can do. But he hasn't done yet."  "The country is completely fatigued with lockdowns, business closures and masking," added Gostin, "and vaccines, are literally our only tool. We've tried masking distancing occupancy limits, even entire lockdowns now for coming along for nearly two years. And the virus, just keeps raging back. And the vaccines are the only thing we have now to defeat the virus. We need to use that tool and we need to use it vigorously. And I think there will be large public support for that"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-eyes-tougher-vaccine-rules-without-provoking-backlash/articleshow/85288645.cms||---
---||World||States that had a grip on Covid now seeing a crush of cases||The Covid-19 surge that is sending hospitalizations to all-time highs in parts of the South is also clobbering states like Hawaii and Oregon that were once seen as pandemic success stories.  After months in which they kept cases and hospitalizations at manageable levels, they are watching progress slip away as record numbers of patients overwhelm bone-tired health care workers.  Oregon - like Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana in recent days - has more people in the hospital with Covid-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. Hawaii is about to reach that mark, too.  This, despite both states having vaccination levels higher than the national average as of last week. Arkansas and Louisiana were significantly below average, while Florida was about even.  "It's heartbreaking. People are exhausted. You can see it in their eyes," said Dr. Jason Kuhl, chief medical officer at Oregon's Providence Medford Medical Center, where patients are left on gurneys in hallways, their monitoring machines beeping away.  In other developments, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize Covid-19 booster shots for certain people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients, to give them an extra dose of protection.  The US is seeing the virus storming back, driven by a combination of the highly contagious delta variant and lagging vaccination rates, especially in the South and other rural and conservative parts of the country.  New cases nationwide are averaging about 123,000 per day, a level last seen in early February, and deaths are running at over 500 a day, turning the clock back to May.  For the most part during the pandemic, Hawaii enjoyed one of the lowest infection and death rates in the nation. In recent days, though, it reported record highs of more than 600 new virus cases daily.  On its worst day in 2020, Hawaii had 291 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus. Officials expect to hit 300 by the end of this week.  Despite the promising demand for Covid-19 shots early on, it took three weeks - much longer than expected - to get from 50% to 60% of the vaccine-eligible population fully vaccinated. Vaccinations have since plateaued. Nationally, the rate is about 59%.  The biggest hospital on Hawaii's Big Island is feeling the pressure. Out of 128 acute beds, 116 were taken Wednesday at Hilo Medical Center, and the hospital's 11 intensive care unit beds are almost always full these days, spokeswoman Elena Cabatu said.  "If someone out there has a heart attack or a sepsis or gets into a bad accident that requires intensive care, we will have to hold that person in the emergency department," Cabatu said.  "I'm surprised we landed here," she lamented. "The hope during the mass vax clinics was just so high."  Hilton Raethel, president and CEO of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, disputed any notion that the rebound in tourism in Hawaii is largely to blame.  "The tourists have been a source for infection, but they've never been the predominant source of infection," Raethel said. "There's a lot more concern about people from Hawaii, residents who go to the South, go to Vegas, to other places, and they come back and spread it."  In Oregon, gov Kate Brown announced this week that nearly everyone will have to wear masks again in indoor public spaces, regardless of their vaccination status.  For the second straight day Wednesday, the state reported a record number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients - 665. The previous peak of 622 came during a November surge, before the vaccine became available. ICU beds across the state are about 90% full.  Throughout the pandemic, health officials have described Oregon as a success story, largely because of its tight restrictions, which were lifted at the end of June.  Meanwhile, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said more people are getting vaccinated in states with the highest infection rates, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi.  "We're getting more shots in the arms in the places that need them in the most. That's what it's going to take to end this pandemic," he said.  In Florida, where Republican gov Ron DeSantis has steadfastly blocked mandatory mask-wearing, some emergency rooms are so overcrowded that doctors are sending patients home with oxygen and small, portable oxygen-monitoring devices to free up beds for sicker patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/states-that-had-a-grip-on-covid-now-seeing-a-crush-of-cases/articleshow/85288666.cms||---

Suspended accounts included those of senior leaders K C Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala among others, social media head Rohan Gupta, and the INC Twitter handle along with those of the party’s Mumbai, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Daman and Diu and Tamil Nadu units. A Twitter spokesperson said the action was initiated because the handles violated Twitter rules and that accounts will be restored once objectionable content is deleted. The handles had put up pictures of the family of a child victim whose death is being alleged to be a case of sexual assault. Twitter was alerted to pictures of the dalit family of the 9-year-old meeting Rahul Gandhi, shared on the latter’s Twitter handle, by the national commission for protection of child rights (NCPCR). As a mark of protest against the the social media company’s “misplaced” action, and to throw a challenge as well, Congress supporters renamed their handles as ‘Rahul Gandhi’ and changed their profile pictures to Rahul’s, leading to a surfeit of RaGa handles. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slammed Twitter and accused it of being in cahoots with BJP, to “lock down the voices that cry for justice”. “Is Twitter following its own policy for the suspension of Congress leaders’ accounts or the Modi government’s? Why hadn’t it locked the account of SC commission that had tweeted similar photos ...Twitter is blatantly colluding with stifling of democracy by BJP government in India,” she said. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who also heads the parliamentary standing committee on information technology, said the action taken against Rahul Gandhi raises obvious concerns of selectivity and bias. “...Focus on what happened to the girl, not a pic!” TMC MP Derek O’Brien condemned the Twitter action. “What’s going on @Twitter @TwitterIndia @jack. What’s going on? We strongly condemn the blocking of the accounts of @INCIndia and senior leaders of the Congress party,” he said. The social media firm said, “Twitter Rules are enforced judiciously and impartially for everyone on our service. We have taken proactive action on several hundred Tweets that posted an image that violated our Rules, and may continue to do so in line with our range of enforcement options. Certain types of private information carry higher risks than others, and our aim is always to protect individuals’ privacy and safety,” a Twitter spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/23-twitter-handles-7-accounts-linked-to-congress-suspended/articleshow/85288683.cms||Swati Mathur
---||India||Covid: One-dose Sputnik Light set for rollout in September||MUMBAI: India’s immunisation plan against Covid-19 may get bolstered soon with the rollout of locally manufactured single-dose Sputnik Light in September. Panacea Biotec, which had earlier partnered Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), has submitted the dossier for seeking emergency-use authorisation to India’s drug regulator recently, sources told TOI. The vaccine, which will be available in limited quantities initially, is expected to be priced around Rs 750. Till now, the immunisation programme has been using imported two-dose Sputnik V, rolled out by Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's, RDIF’s exclusive distribution partner for India. Shortages in supply of the two-dose Sputnik V could be resolved as early as the month-end, with Dr Reddy’s ramping up supplies, sources added. The full rollout of the Sputnik V vaccine was put on hold and is hence lagging, as its imports from Russia were impacted in June. Around five lakh doses of Sputnik V’s component 2 vaccine, which have been imported, could be rolled out in India soon. ``We are also working closely with our partners in India for manufacturing readiness. We expect that locally manufactured doses are likely to be available from the September-October period’’, a Dr Reddy’s spokesperson said. Sputnik Light, developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute and backed by RDIF, received emergency use authorisation in Russia in May. It is perceived by experts as more ‘suitable’, given the task of vaccinating a large population even as a possible third wave looms. The Sputnik Light jab has demonstrated nearly 80% efficacy, according to analysed data taken 28 days after the injection was administered in a trial in Russia, an RDIF statement said. Earlier in July, Panacea Biotec had announced the receipt of a manufacturing license to produce Sputnik V vaccine at its Baddi plant in Himachal Pradesh. The batches manufactured at Baddi have successfully passed the checks for quality parameters both at the Gamaleya Center in Russia and at the Central Drug Laboratory, Kasauli (Himachal Pradesh). Panacea will produce 100 million doses annually of the vaccine which will be distributed by Dr Reddy's. Also, an expert panel under the health ministry allowed Dr Reddy’s to submit the Russian safety data for approval of the vaccine in India. "Further, the SEC (subject expert committee) also observed that in view of the safety and immunogenicity data already generated by Dr Reddy's in India on the first dose component of Sputnik V (in other words, Sputnik Light), there was no need for a separate Phase III trial of Sputnik Light in India," it added. This is in view of the fact that Sputnik Light is the first dose component of Sputnik V. It also recommended that Dr Reddy's should submit safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data from the phase III clinical trial of Sputnik V in Russia to the SEC for its consideration of marketing authorisation of Sputnik Light in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-one-dose-sputnik-light-set-for-rollout-in-september/articleshow/85288930.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

The figure translates to about 5.6% of the total 2,552 cases reported in Karnataka’s capital during the period. Pointing to this as evidence and trashing rumours that suggested cases were surging among children, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials say there is no steep rise in fresh cases among kids. They say most of the children who tested positive for the infection are primary contacts of Covid positive adults. Doctors also confirmed that there has been no increase in admissions to ICU beds for paediatric patients. TOI analyzed data of children below nine years of age who tested positive between July 1 and August 11 (six weeks) and found that they accounted for 4.2% or 748 of the total 17,719 positive cases registered in Bengaluru during this period. Of the total 350 to 400 fresh cases being reported in Bengaluru every day, about 20 to 26 are children who test positive for the infection. Dr Basavaraj GV, member of the paediatric clinical experts’ committee set up by the state health and family welfare department, said the numbers suggest only a “slight” increase in Covid cases among children. “But that should not be a cause for worry for parents,” Dr Basavaraj said. “Instead, it should be seen as an opportunity to enhance training for medical personnel and improve infrastructure for paediatric critical care.” He said children will be as vulnerable as any unvaccinated adult during the third wave and it is not true that they will be the worst affected should a third wave of infections hit. No ICU care neededIndira Gandhi Institute of Child Health confirmed it does not have any Covid-19 case in its ICU. “We do have Covidinfected children who are being treated here, but there is no increase in the number of cases. Though we have beds reserved, at present no child requires ICU care,” said Dr Mahantesh M, resident medical officer, Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health. Randeep D, special commissioner, health, BBMP, said that while absolute numbers may seem high, as a proportion of total positives, the share of those infected in the 0-9 years age group is in the range of 12-14% since the last week of July. He said hospitalisation has not abnormally increased and there have been no paediatric deaths in the past 10 days in Bengaluru. “What we do need to ensure and what is most important is Covid-appropriate behaviour and regular sanitisation of school premises when high schools reopen. Symptomatic students must be encouraged to report their symptoms and get tested,” said Randeep. Health department authorities, however, said getting children to wear masks all the time and to comply with Covidappropriate behaviour like social distancing would be a challenge. “Hence, symptomatic adults must stay isolated from all family members and get tested at the earliest for Covid,” they said. Well preparedGaurav Gupta, BBMP chief commissioner, said, “There is no need to panic as there has been no surge in cases among children reported so far in Bengaluru. We are consistently monitoring and analysing the pattern of spread and are prepared to face a possible third wave. We are especially geared up to treat children.” But Gupta said parents have to be responsible too and set an example by scrupulously adhering to Covid safety protocols to shield their children from infection. He said adults should be careful as chances are high that they can be the source of the spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-big-rise-in-covid-cases-among-kids/articleshow/85289176.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: ‘No shot, no ration’ draws flak in Yadgir||YADGIR: In a controversial decision aimed at ramping up Covid-19 vaccination coverage in the district, Yadgir deputy commissioner Ragapriya R allegedly instructed staff at a review meeting on Monday to stop supply of free rations to people resisting the shot. The information department sent out a release to reporters, stating: “DC Ragapriya R has instructed deputy director (DD) of food and civil supplies department to withdraw free ration to citizens refusing to take vaccination.” However, when contacted on Thursday, Ragapriya said she was misquoted. The reluctant lotRecently, residents of Kanchagarahalli village had locked their houses and fled when officials arrived to administer the vaccine. The district has been reporting many similar incidents. However, in the case of Kanchagarahalli village, senior officials counselled residents and many initially reluctant took the shot. The deputy commissioner’s orders has drawn flak from various quarters. Many say that when neither the central nor the state government has made vaccination mandatory, it is wrong on the part of the DC to force and threaten people to take the shot. Every citizen has the freedom to choose, they say. Officials in the food and civil supplies department confirmed to TOI that the DC did indeed pass the order. An official said, “The DD of our department received oral instructions to stop rations. But there is no written order. The DC has done this for the good of the people and to encourage them to take vaccine.” ‘I asked to act against those who attack warriors’To get or to not get Deputy commissioner Ragapriya insisted she was misquoted. “I only told officials to stop rations to those who attack Covid warriors. I orally gave these instructions and asked officials to file FIRs against these people. We have been receiving a good number of vaccine doses and are working hard to reach the target. The direction was in the interest of citizens and to protect them from a possible third wave of infections.” Dr Srinivas Kakkilaya, one of those who criticised the DC, said, “If the DC has the courage, she should pass written orders. In the name of Covid, officials are suppressing freedom of people. This instruction from the DC violates constitutional rights.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-shot-no-ration-draws-flak-in-yadgir/articleshow/85289183.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Bengaluru||Popular govt colleges see rush for PU seats in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: With more than 8.7 lakh students clearing SSLC exams in the pandemic-hit year, some popular government PU colleges in Bengaluru and elsewhere in the state are receiving a record number of applications for admission. Thanks to the no-fail policy, at least 2.5 lakh more students are knocking on the doors of PU colleges in the state. For instance, Government PU College, 13th Cross, Malleswaram, has issued 1,400 applications since Tuesday and admitted 200 students on Thursday. “Last time, we received around 1,500 applications. We’ve already reached those numbers now. This time, we expect to get about 2,500 applications. Since ours is a government college, we have to admit as many students as possible,” said principal Ravi AS. Infra may be limiting factor this year As on March 21 this year, there are 5,551 PU colleges in Karnataka: 1,234 government, 799 aided, 160 bifurcated, 3,344 unaided and 14 local bodies’ institutions. Last year, Government PU College in Yelahanka received 2,000 applications and admitted 1,600 candidates. “This year, we have already issued 1,700 applications. Commerce, especially with the computer science combination, is in high demand. While there’s no cutoff for any stream, we cannot take more than 250 students for this course because of limited computers. We have already got 700 applications for this stream,” said Palaksha T, principal. The increase in demand is attributed to two major reasons. “One, with all students promoted this year, we may be having an additional 2.5 lakh students seeking to continue education. Two, with the pandemic, many cannot afford fees in private colleges. So they are all flocking to government colleges. We’re expecting an increase of 30% in our student strength this year. We have additional buildings and classrooms ready this time,” said Jayaram U, principal of Government PU College, Peenya. Government colleges usually don’t send back students. This year, infrastructure and faculty strength could be the limiting factors. Students who cannot get into preferred streams are often asked to opt for other courses. “While we are expecting 1,500 applications, we cannot accommodate more than 1,000. Even while we try to reallocate faculty resources, the space to accommodate students could be an issue,” said Ratnakar Shetty, principal, Government PU College, 18th Cross, Malleswaram. “We have placed two extra benches till the blackboard in one classroom. In some cases, the teacher’s podium limits the expansion plan. While commerce and arts streams are full, some seats in science are vacant. We are asking students to consider that,” said a principal from Dakshina Kannada. Many other colleges and private institutions, in particular, did not confirm the trend. “We have to watch how enrollments turn out,” said Ningegowda AH, president, Karnataka State Pre-University College Lecturers’ Association. “There is no specific intake in government colleges. We do not restrict the number of students getting admission in a college. The college can increase the number of sections without prior nod from the department. A government PU college cannot deny a student a seat. The issue is only with colleges where the infrastructure is not enough. If lecturers are deficient, we can make alternative arrangements; but facilities like classrooms need time. Such colleges have to find solutions like a shift system. But the demand for PU seats is not uniform. Some colleges have a rush, others do not even after giving enough publicity,” said a PU department official. Last date for admissions without penalty is August 31. Students can join with a penalty of Rs 670 between September 1 and 11. Students can pay a special penalty fee of Rs 2,890 till September 25. Physical classes for I PU students will begin on August 23 and online classes from August 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/popular-govt-colleges-see-rush-for-pu-seats/articleshow/85289193.cms||---

The vehicles —Mahindra Thar and Toyota Fortuner —were doused with petrol before they were torched around 1.25am, according to CCTV footage. The Thar was purchased a month ago, the three-time MLA told cops. Duo barged inside, covered CCTV cam with cloth: DCP  Reddy’s four four-wheelers were parked in the frontyard and the other two cars were left untouched. “It looks like the work of my rivals. We have shared CCTV footage with cops,” the 48-year-old Bommanahalli MLAsaid. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said in Mangaluru that Reddy is in public life and miscreants seem to have targeted him over rivalry. “Investigations will be carried from all possible angles. We will arrest the suspects at the earliest,” the CM said. Three teams have been formed to nab the miscreants. According to police, four men on two motorbikes came near the back gate and two of them sneaked into the house. “They poured petrol on the bonnet of two vehicles and set them on fire. The miscreants took the same route to escape,” an investigating officer said. A security guard and a police constable deployed at the front gate, about 50ft from the vehicles, heard the sound of batteries and tyres exploding and rushed to the spot. Reddy and other family members poured water on the burning vehicles. After a family member called the police control room, a fire tender doused the fire by 2am. Front portions of both vehicles were destroyed in the fire. Deputy commissioner of police (south east) Srinath Mahadev Joshi said, “Taking shelter behind a tree and with faces covered in cloth, two men barged into the house. They covered the CCTV camera with a cloth and turned it in another direction. They entered at 1.23am and fled at 1.30am.” Home minister Araga Jnanendra, city police commissioner Kamal Pant and other senior cops interacted with the investigating police officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/two-suvs-of-bjp-mla-set-on-fire-in-bluru/articleshow/85289198.cms||---
---||India||Sonia Gandhi likely to chair opposition meet on August 20||NEW DELHI: Congress chief Sonia Gandhi is likely to chair a meeting of opposition leaders on August 20. The meeting is expected to be virtual, during which the leaders, including NCP president Sharad Pawar and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee will join a brainstorming session to discuss the issue of strengthening opposition unity and the agenda going ahead. Sources said the meeting would be attended by, apart from Congress CMs, opposition chief ministers like Shiv Sena’s Uddhav Thackeray (Maharashtra), DMK’s Stalin (Tamil Nadu) and Mamata (West Bengal). This gathering assumes significance in the wake of the coordination that opposition parties managed to show during the monsoon session of Parliament, when their united stand that the government hold a discussion on the Pegasus snooping scandal first led to a standoff, and ultimately paralysed the proceedings in both Houses. The opposition sees this as a victory for the anti-BJP bloc which has been reeling under fragmentation since 2019 when BJP returned to power. Even as the opposition huddle of around 15 parties has come together with pledges to strengthen their unity, the issue of the bloc’s leadership remains unresolved. Many opposition leaders have repeatedly stated that the ticklish subject should be left for a later stage by when coordination and agenda is settled. The focus of the opposition camp is now on setting an agenda and a programme with which it can pitch itself as an alternative to BJP. The opposition has been emboldened since the TMC’s victory in Bengal. However, the Bengal outfit has shown some reservations about its participation in joint activities that are headed by Rahul Gandhi. Even Mamata Banerjee’s visit to Sonia Gandhi doesn’t appear to have ironed out this reservation of TMC. It is viewed as rooted in the question of future leadership of the opposition bloc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sonia-gandhi-likely-to-chair-opposition-meet-on-august-20/articleshow/85289122.cms||---

She will be appointed as DSP according to the sports policy of the state government. Earlier this year, world championship gold medallist sprinter Hima Das was appointed DSP in the police department. Sarma said the state government has decided to give Lovlina Rs 1 lakh monthly as a scholarship for her preparations for the Paris Olympics in 2024 and will continue to do so till the Games. Thanking her for scripting Assam’s name in world sports by winning a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, Sarma announced that a road in the capital city – Guwahati — will also be named after her as gratitude towards her remarkable contribution to the field of sports, which has “ignited a billion dreams”. “Lovlina has ignited a billion dreams with her success at the Tokyo Olympics and set an example for budding sports talents in rural areas to aspire to achieve big at the world stage,” the CM said. Sarma also thanked all the coaches — Padum Barua, Prashanta Das, Sandhya Gurung and Rafael Gamavaska — for guiding and training Lovlina to make her able to win a medal at the Tokyo Olympics. Indian boxing coach Padum Boro spotted Lovlina as a promising boxer during his visit to Golaghat in 2013 in search of talent under a project of the Sports Authority of India (SAI). All the four coaches, who were a part of Lovlina’s boxing journey, will be honoured with Rs 10 lakh each as a token of gratitude from the people of Assam, the chief minister said. He also announced that a sports complex with a boxing academy will be set up at the cost of Rs 25 crore in the Sarupathar constituency, under which Lovlina’s village Baro Mukhiya falls, to groom many more rural talents. Sarma said, “Lovlina has etched her name in gold in the pages of the state's history by bringing the first Olympic medal to the state. I congratulate her and her parents as well at this moment.” Meanwhile, a delegation of Assam Pradesh Congress Committee led by president Bhupen Borah felicitated Lovlina and handed over a cheque for Rs 3 lakh as a token of blessing and goodwill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/lovlina-awarded-1cr-for-igniting-a-billion-dreams/articleshow/85282736.cms||Mukut Das

The revenues for the quarter stood at Rs 2,951 crore as against Rs 651 crore in the year-ago period. “Margin performance was severely hurt by negative operating leverage and reported loss after tax was higher than our estimate of Rs 187 crore primarily on the back of lower than anticipated EBITDA,” said a report by ICICI Direct Research.

---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Pink Line for women’s safe travel||VADODARA: Formed 107 years ago in the erstwhile Baroda state, an institute by Maharani Chimnabai Gaekwad, wife of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad, aimed to uplift living conditions of poor women and also empower them financially. Continuing its crusade for women’s benefits even a century later, the Shree Maharani Chimnabai Stree Udyogalaya (MCSU) will soon launch a project — Pink Line — to help women travel safely in the city. For this, it will train women to drive four-wheelers and heavy public transport vehicles. “Women use public transport in large numbers. But very few female drivers find a chance in the hugely male-dominated job. We, however, wish to bring about a change in the thought process. Our institution will be launching a training programme wherein women can learn driving cars, auto rickshaws and heavy vehicles,” said Radhikaraje Gaekwad, trustee and vice-president of MCSU. “Many women have to face sexual harassment in public transport and the horrors of Nirbhaya rape case is fresh in public memory. Having more women as drivers in public transport will ensure safety of female passengers. This is my dream project,” Radhikaraje told TOI. The royal scion further stated that MSCU’s service will not end with the women’s training but will be extended to getting them help with bank loans and driving licenses. “Our focus will initially be on women who have lost an earning member of their family during Covid. This driving training project will serve the dual purpose of increasing safety of women in public transport and giving livelihood to the needy women,” she explained. To fund this project and also a range of planned vocational courses, the MCSU has organized a two-day exhibition from Friday at its premises opposite Sursagar Lake. “The exhibition ‘Urja 2021’ is a fund-raiser for MCSU that is now going through a makeover and stepping into the new age. We are planning to introduce contemporary courses including English speaking, on operating household machines and geriatric care for women,” Radhikaraje added. MCSU core committee member, Hema Chauhan said artisans from different parts of the country will display their handmade products in the exhibition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/pink-line-for-womens-safe-travel/articleshow/85283506.cms||Tushar Tere

No untoward incident was reported from any centre. Lalit Narayan Mithila University teacher and BEd entrance test’s state nodal officer, Ashok Kumar Mehta, told this reporter that 86.5% applicants took the test in a fair manner.

Ten families live here, isolated from the world, with children crossing the river in crude canoes to get to school until recently, when a bandhara built by the WRD made it possible for them to walk across safely. This settlement of around 50 people lived lives of hardships, not imagining that things could get worse, until the floods of July 23. The joint family home of brothers Uttam and Shanu Gawade collapsed as the Mhadei breached its banks to a level never seen before, and swallowed the house. The surging water also washed away the concrete steps leading to the WRD structure that had finally linked the ward to humanity, even if it was by foot. With no road connecting Bonkivhali to civilisation, it is nearly impossible to get any construction material to the ward to reconstruct a house for the Gawade family. “We are living with another family for now. Whatever belongings we could gather have been stashed in their cow shelter. We are surviving. But we cannot celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi in our neighbour’s house now, can we? How long before the government machinery realises we need help to make construction here possible without a road being present?” said Usha Gawade. The family recollects with horror having to eat food that fell out from packets as they were dropped from helicopters on the day of the floods. “Even if we had known in advance that floods would hit us, we wouldn’t have been able to afford to buy provisions in bulk and store them. There is no work here other than growing some horticultural crops. If there was a road, our lives would have been different. It is funny that everyone is able to make it here to campaign for the elections, but when we ask for roads or other facilities, they say it is difficult to get here,” said Sangita Gawade. Janaki Joshi, the landlady at Bonkivhali, has provided the Gawade family another patch of land on higher ground to construct their new home, but she knows the work cannot begin anytime soon. “Somehow, we managed to get an excavator here to clear the new plot. But with no road, the excavator kept slipping and the work could not be done. When my partially paralysed son was ill, he had to be put on a chair and carried on shoulders to the other side of the river in an unconscious state for medical help. How soon one can construct a new house here in such conditions is anyone’s guess,” said Janaki’s son-in-law Chintamani. The Joshis themselves have lost a pumphouse and horticultural crops to the floods. The water levels in the Mhadei began rising at 5am. By 8am, the Gawades’ house, the Joshis’ crops and pumphouse and the stairs to the WRD bridge were washed away. “What use is any government compensation without a road to transport the material here?” asked Uttam. He wonders what is in store for his son Sarang, a Class VI student, who apart from having to study without mobile network and deal with eight-hour long power cuts, has now also been left without a single book. Getting to his school in Usgao to get new textbooks means trekking to the river bank for half-an-hour, crossing the WRD structure and hitching a ride from passersby. “We have three children here who have lost not just their home, but all their books and clothes. With years of pleas to construct a road having gone unheard, the least the government could do is build a temporary shelter for us so we do not continue to be a burden on our neighbours,” said Pratiksha Gawade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/flood-waters-ruin-lone-bridge-hopes-of-remote-bhironda-ward/articleshow/85286658.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Mumbai||Little-used Byculla jumbo centre has cost BMC Rs 52 crore||MUMBAI: The BMC has spent Rs 52.38 crore on setting up and running the Richardson and Cruddas jumbo Covid centre in Byculla. Even though the BMC has been spending around Rs 2.44 crore every month on just paying rent for the centre and despite the high rent and operational costs, it remains one of the most under-utilised jumbo centres in Mumbai. TimesViewThe BMC’s jumbo centres have proven to be a game changer in the city’s fight against Covid-19. However the BMC must ensure that all existing jumbo centres are fully utilised and capacity is not wasted. Spending Rs 52 crore on a center that doesn’t have any ICU or oxygen beds is unacceptable. In the eventuality of the third wave, there is a need for ICU beds, so ICU beds and oxygen beds must be increased wherever there is a scope at jumbo centres.In April this year, after opposition netas demanded BMC set up oxygen beds at the centre since it hardly had any patients and there was a high demand for oxygen beds, the BMC had claimed it would have 700 oxygen beds there. However, the oxygen beds aren’t in place yet. In a written reply given to Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh, the BMC stated that it has been paying around Rs 2.44 crore as monthly rent since the setting up of the centre in July 2020. The BMC has spent around Rs 30 crore on rent so far. It had spent around Rs 8.22 crore when it set up the centre on having healthcare infrastructure like tents and medical equipment. The BMC has also spent Rs 13 crore on conducting RT-PCR tests at the centre and on Covid-related medicines and drugs and another Rs 43 lakh on food for patients admitted there. According to BMC data, 119 high-risk persons (symptomatic but suspected, yet to be declared positive) have been treated at the centre. A total of 7,470 passengers were quarantined there. Another 3,047 (positive but asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) were treated at the CCC2 facility there, and 905 (positive with symptoms) were treated at the dedicated Covid health centre there. Ever since the second wave started, almost 80% of beds at the centre remained vacant as most were regular beds, while there was a scramble for getting oxygen and ICU beds. While the centre has a capacity of around 800 beds, less than half are operational. There are very few beds with oxygen support, and no bed with a ventilator. Shaikh said through the second wave, fewer than 20% of the beds were operational. “The BMC was housing international travellers here. There was a need for ICU beds with ventilators and Bi-PAP machines. We had asked BMC to have all 800 beds with oxygen support. Had this been done, the entire load of South Mumbai would have been taken care of. But BMC hasn’t done anything. They are just wasting public money. Close to Rs. 2.5 crore a month on rent is unacceptable,” he said. Shaikh had earlier written to the then AMC (city) Sanjeev Jaiswal asking the civic body to start an oxygen support unit and ICU at Byculla urgently. “ BMC had promised the centre would have 700 beds with oxygen support. They said ‘Dura’ cylinders will be ordered and for the long term, they would install a liquid medical oxygen storage tank. Nothing has been done,” Shaikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-little-used-byculla-jumbo-centre-has-cost-bmc-rs-52cr/articleshow/85286067.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Patna||HC raps govt over delay in national highway projects||PATNA: The Patna high court on Thursday came down heavily on the state government while orally observing that it’s the failure of the executives that has led to delay construction of several national highways in the state. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar was hearing a batch of at least 28 PILs regarding NH construction projects in the state. At least 35 PILs have been taken up suo motu by the high court after it started monitoring the projects in March this year. During the hearing, the bench orally observed that it doesn’t have any interest in monitoring the projects, but is doing so as the executives have failed in discharging their duties which has caused delay of up to 10 years in completion of some projects. The court also orally observed that the cost of the projects, borne by NHAI, increases exponentially due to delays. “The state government has failed in acquiring land required for construction work and hand them over to NHAI in time-bound manner after removing all types of encroachments,” it said. The court observed that the state government should think of establishing a permanent monitoring cell which would be responsible for monitoring the NH construction projects, thereby saving high court’s precious time. The high court directed the authorities concerned to ensure that encroachments are removed from Hajipur’s Ramashish Chowk and a police building be cleared within 24 hours so that the land could be handed over to the NHAI for construction of NH for connecting the place with Muzaffarpur. On Wednesday, the court had directed the contractor involved in construction of a stretch of Chhapra-Hajipur NH to complete it in next 45 days. Senior counsel SD Sanjay appeared for NHAI while additional advocate general Anjani Kumar represented the state government in the court. The matter will now be taken up by the high court on August 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-raps-govt-over-delay-in-national-highway-projects/articleshow/85283880.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The DM, in a press statement, said the probe team comprising the SDO, two DSPs, a senior deputy collector, assistant director of child protection unit and the SHO of the district women’s police station would conduct an in-depth investigation and submit its report at the earliest. On Wednesday, an inmate of the shelter home had alleged that she was sexually assaulted by some employees of the facility during her stay there between July 13 and August 10 this year. In her affidavit submitted to the court of CJM II at Nawada, the girl, a Class IX student, narrated the trauma she underwent during her stay at the shelter home for girls located near Saxena Mor at Bodh Gaya. Taking a cognizance of the complaint, the court directed the Nawada civil surgeon to conduct medical examination of the girl. The girl was subsequently sent to the sadar hospital for medical examination. The medical report is awaited. According to the girl, she was sexually assaulted after being offered intoxicant-laced milk after dinner at night. She used to feel body ache and found her clothes scattered every morning. The girl was sent to the facility at Bodh Gaya on July 13 on the directive of Nawada court after her parents refused to allow her to stay with them. She had eloped from her house with her boyfriend in early July. She was recovered and produced before the court on July 12. On August 4, her father submitted a petition in the court, requesting it to release his minor daughter as he wanted to keep her with them. The court ordered the girl inmate’s release. On August 10, she was released from the shelter home. Assistant director of district child protection unit, Divesh Kumar, had earlier denied the allegation. The facility is under observation of 20 CCTV cameras and five women constables have been deployed there. Meanwhile, a former public prosecutor of Nawada court Shiv Nandan Sharma said that the the girl's family has demanded a probe by the CBI into allegations of sexual assault of Nawada girl.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/committee-to-probe-bodh-gaya-shelter-home-sexual-assault-case/articleshow/85283763.cms||Ramashankar

A portion of the canal identified about two-feet below the surface is touted to be from the Sangam era as archaeological evidence pertaining to that period were previously identified in the same site.On the 13th day of excavation being conducted by the excavation director Ela Iniyan, an assistant professor in the archaeology department, the 10-member team identified a brick canal. The 32-cm-long and 23-cm-wide structure is considered to have served as a feeder of a moat. Based on the studies conducted so far, archaeologists said that Porpanaikottai situated about 11 km from Pudukkottai town had a soil-cum-brick fort.Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had granted TNOU the approval for the field excavation that began on July 30. “This is the first incident of identifying a habitat-based archaeological structure in Pudukkottai district. So far, we have identified Sangam era age stone inscriptions and earthen pot remains during surface-level studies,” A Manikandan, founder of Pudukkottai archaeological research forum said. TNOU has dug five excavation pits on the site and the university has sanctioned a sum of Rs 1 lakh for the excavation.Archaeologists said that they could ascertain the period to which the canal structure belonged to only after exploring further. Archaeologists said that further study through the support of ground-penetrating radar may reveal more facts about the remains of the brick canal structure found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/canal-structure-found-at-porpanaikottai-site/articleshow/85286016.cms||Deepak Karthik

Apart from the main markets, all posh localities in the town are submerged with knee to waist-deep rainwater. On Thursday, the district recorded 68.2mm rainfall. Rainwater entered the residential premises, forcing residents to shift their kitchens either to the upper floors or the rooftop. “Life has come to a standstill for the last couple of days. Drinking water has become scarce for the residents as water supply is disconnected. Garbage, waste and human excreta are flowing in rooms,” said Ajay Tripathi, a resident of Motijheel. A similar condition is prevailing in other localities like Brahmapura, Bibiganj, Bela, Rahul Nagar, Bhagwanpur, Pankha Toli, Nayatola, Jawaharlal Road, Balughat, Sikandarpur and Lakri Dhahi. The local sadar hospital is no exception. “People had to wade through knee to thigh-deep water to reach the sadar hospital to take Covid vaccines. The road leading to the hospital has been blocked. Rainwater has also inundated the emergency ward,” said Pramod Kumar, a social activist. Civil surgeon Dr Vinay Sharma said dozens of letters were written to the municipal corporation, drawing its attention towards waterlogging in the hospital, but to no avail. “This happens every year during monsoon. It’s a perennial problem here,” he said. The residents complained that rainwater has not been drained out for over a month in some localities, leading to spread of skin diseases. The main markets like Sutapatti, Saraiyaganj, Motijheel, Kalyani, Station Road and Kiran Chhapra are closed as water has entered shops and business establishments. “We have been ruined. Covid-induced lockdown and heavy rainfall have caused huge financial losses to us,” said Anil Gupta, a local trader. Former mayor Vivek Kumar said people should boycott the municipal corporation election to be held next year due to hellish condition prevailing in the town. He blamed the political-bureaucratic “nexus” for the sorry state of affairs. On Wednesday, deputy mayor Mar Mardan Shukla reviewed the situation in waterlogged localities. Shukla, who is also mayor incharge, told the officials of municipal corporation to drain out water at the earliest. Town commissioner Vivek Ranjan Maitrey, city manager Om Prakash and sanitation incharge Kaushal Kishore were present at the meeting. Maitrey told the mayor incharge to engage motor pumps to drain out water from waterlogged localities. More than 34 motor pumps have been pressed into service to drain out water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/heavy-rain-floods-markets-posh-localities-in-muzaffarpur-town/articleshow/85280782.cms||Ramashankar
---||Ahmedabad||Surat: Dil ka Rishta— Her daughter’s heart gave life to her ‘son’||AHMEDABAD: Surat-resident Amita Patel lost a daughter but gained a son— all with a change of heart. Patel, who was distraught after losing her fashion designer aspirant daughter Jahnvi, takes heart in the fact that whenever she really misses her girl, her son Lalji will call her. “Lalji has Jahnvi’s heart beating inside him. Who else will understand a mother’s feelings than a loving daughter’s heart?” says Amita. Amita and 26-year old Lalji’s is a ‘dil ka rishta’ which began after Amita and her husband decided to donate their 21-year-old fashion designers organs following her brain death in aftermath of an accident. Her heart went to Lalji who was at the doorstep of death with his vital organ failing. This one gesture united two strangers in a way that Lalji and Amita have become family for life. Lalji is now a ‘son’ to Amita who was even part of her husband’s cremation. August 13 is celebrated as the World Organ Donation Day, and their story underscores how organ donation can connect families and lives. Amita still recalls that day in 2018 when Jahnvi went on a fun ride with her friends. She had just turned 21 a few days ago. She fell off a car’s closed boot and had a concussion on November 17. After three days of ICU treatment, she was declared brain-dead. Counselling by a team from Donate Life NGO led the family to donate her heart, kidneys, liver and corneas. The heart went to Lalji Gediya, a resident of Surat, who was admitted in a hospital in Mumbai on November 20, 2018. A green corridor was created and the heart was sent in time to save Lalji’s life. He was 23 years old then. “My heart was not pumping adequate blood. I was in and out of hospital and doctors had told me that heart transplant was the only option. I was near death when I got Jahnvi’s heart. I am the only brother to four sisters and bear the responsibility of the family,” Lalji told TOI. He currently works as a construction contractor. “He was present when Tejas, Jahnvi’s father was on deathbed. He also remained present during the last rites and helped the family. I have a younger son, but Lalji is very much part of our family who ensures that we don’t feel the void left behind by Jahnvi’s untimely departure,” says Amita. Amita says Jahnvi was a foodie and loved dressing up! Lalji did not share these likings but seems Jahnvi’s heart has led him to warm up to good dressing and gastronomical adventures. “I am alive because of Jahnvi and feel a special conncet with the Patels, especially with mom,” says Lalji. “Parts of my daughter are living in five persons. Organ donation is the biggest donation possible,” says Amita. “There are several misconceptions, and we try to dispel them whenever we come across such cases.” Nilesh Mandlewala, founder of Donate Life, an NGO working for the promotion of organ donation, said that generally the organ donors and recipients don’t meet due to several reasons, but this case was exceptional. “An organ from a brain-dead person can give a new lease of life to someone. There are several such stories where the families have got connected through this noble act,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dil-ka-rishta-her-daughters-heart-gave-life-to-her-son/articleshow/85283887.cms||Parth Shastri

The corporation on Thursday appointed Noopur Chaturvedi as CEO of NPCI Bharat BillPay (NBBL). Earlier, Chaturvedi headed the small and medium business vertical at fintech PayU. A former Citibanker, she had also worked with Airtel Payments Bank, ING Vysya, Samsung and Infosys. Bharat BillPay is a digital platform that enables anywhere, anytime bill payment by allowing utilities and other billers to plug in at one end and payment entities at the other end. In April this year, NBBL was hived off as a wholly owned subsidiary. The company has grown rapidly on account of the ease and accessibility it offers to customers and the one-stop solution to billers for low-cost collections. Currently, NBBL offers recurring payment services to customers across several segments. These include bill payments for electricity, telecom, DTH, gas, education fees, water, and municipal taxes, NETC FASTag recharge, loan repayments, insurance, cable and housing society charges. Chaturvedi holds a bachelor’s degree in computer science and management from IIM-Lucknow. As CEO, her mandate is to work on RBI’s vision to scale up the Bharat BillPay platform and make it the most preferred solution for all bill payments. She will work closely with the BBPS ecosystem to grow digital bill payments with superior customer experience. According to NPCI MD & CEO Dilip Asbe, the appointment followed a selection process and Chaturvedi was found to be the right person, given the RBI’s objective to scale up the payments platform. “The RBI has recently extended the scope of NBBL to allow prepaid recharges and the payment categories are being increased,” said Asbe. The advantage of a platform like NBBL is any service — internet banking, mobile banking, mobile apps, ATMs, bank branches or even business correspondents. Once a biller is on NBBL, all the channels are available. Similarly, when a bank or any payment provider plugs into NBBL, it can offer its customers payments for all bill categories without partnering with the biller. Although NPCI is a not-for-profit organisation, it has two for-profit subsidiaries. The second arm is NPCI International (NIPL) through which it is extending UPI in other countries. NIPL is also building an acceptance network for RuPay and UPI outside India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/payu-exec-to-head-billpay/articleshow/85287147.cms||---

If this plan fructifies, this will be the first of its kind move. The current Sebi rules say that promoters cannot dilute their stake to below 20% within 18 months of an IPO. It also stipulates that the promoter of a large company with a market capitalisation of Rs 1 lakh crore can take up to two years to dilute holding to 10%. Read Also2021: Year of mega fund-raiseThe IPO frenzy on Dalal Street continued with four offers together this week trying to mobilise about Rs 14,600 crore, making it one of the busiest weeks for IPOs in several years.Among the options being talked about for LIC is that of cornerstone investors, marquee asset managers who could put in large funds ahead of the IPO, which is expected to be the largest in the country’s history. Usually, government-owned companies don’t opt for any type of share placement with investors before an offer, which includes selling to cornerstone investors, pre-IPO placement to large institutions or selling part of the IPO to anchor investors a day before the issue opens. Sources said that officials involved in the IPO process believe that with so many offers already closed and several others in the pipeline till the LIC offer comes to the market, a large amount of investors’ funds will already be absorbed. So far in 2021, over 25 IPOs have garnered nearly Rs 70,000 crore. Paytm, the tech-enabled money transfer entity, has also filed for an IPO to mop up about Rs 16,600 crore. This would make the Paytm IPO the biggest Indian offering. Currently, Coal India’s Rs 15,475-crore IPO in 2010 is the largest. Read AlsoCentre to list LIC by end of current fiscal, says government officialThe government expects to list state-owned Life Insurance Corp (LIC) by the end of the current fiscal year (2021-22), and collect around Rs 50,000 crore as dividends from state-run companies, a senior finance ministry official said on Wednesday.“All the options are on the table (to make the LIC offer a success),” an official close to the transaction told TOI, without elaborating about the options. International institutions, including sovereign wealth funds and private equity funds, are seen as potential investors. Some potential investors have reached out to get an idea of the embedded value (EV) and the EV multiple that the government is looking for in pricing. Read AlsoExplained: Why Zomato IPO is creating a buzz among investorsThe much-awaited initial public offer (IPO) of food delivery major Zomato is now open for public subscription from Wednesday. With this, Zomato will become the first online delivery company and also the first Indian unicorn startup to get listed on the bourses.In 2021, the Rs 9,375-crore IPO for tech-enabled food delivery services major Zomato has been the largest. The issue was subscribed over 38 times. However, the Rs 5,000-crore offer for Nuvoco Vista Copr, the cement maker run by the founders of Nirma detergent, which also happened to be the second largest IPO in 2021, struggled. It closed on August 11 with the issue subscribed just 1.7 times. In recent times, to help the LIC offer sail through smoothly Sebi has changed some of the rules for IPOs. For example, Sebi in February said that if a company can get a post-IPO market capitalization of Rs 1 lakh crore, it could reach 10% public shareholding in two years and 25% level in five years.

The rule was perfectly in sync with the finance minister’s statement that the government will hold at least 75% in LIC up to five years post its IPO which will eventually fall to 51%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/ipo/in-a-1st-lic-looks-to-split-mega-ipo-into-2-offerings/articleshow/85298138.cms||Partha Sinha
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Second wave stole spotlight in first lap, but more health challenges lie ahead||CHENNAI: The DMK government assumed office in May when Tamil Nadu was reeling under a deadly second wave. Lockdowns and heavy restrictions were among the first orders issued by chief minister M K Stalin as overcrowded hospitals ran out of beds, oxygen and lifesaving drugs. A good part of the first 100 days of governance was devoted to tackling the Covid onslaught that seemed to spiral out of control, testing the prowess of the new cabinet, the bureaucracy and that of the well-established healthcare system. As a new government, it did its best – continuing surveillance, ramping up testing, lobbying with the centre for oxygen, drugs and vaccines, and more importantly putting in place an effective team and a war room to handle crises. Besides Stalin, ministers, MPs and MLAs fanned out to crowdsource funds for Covid-19 relief and create awareness about Covid appropriate behaviour. And TN was lauded for its efforts to bring down vaccine wastage and increase vaccinations. It is also the only state which does the maximum number of the gold standard RT-PCR tests. Nearly three months since, Covid-19 cases have come down and hospitals aren’t overwhelmed anymore. But the state will have bigger public health challenges, both long and short term, warn public health experts. The threat of premature deaths due to heart attacks and strokes triggered by undiagnosed or uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes is one of the biggest risks the state could be facing. “The burden of non-communicable diseases is likely to be much bigger,” said WHO chief scientists Dr Soumya Swaminathan. In addition, lack of jobs may have pushed several people into debt and poverty, which is likely to increase risk of malnutrition. “And that is likely to bring a host of health issues among children and adults. It will also increase risk of diseases such as tuberculosis,” she said. The state’s grand idea to take medicare to people’s doorsteps through the ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam’ is probably the steppingstone to comprehensive healthcare. Over the last five days, the state has reached out to nearly 40,000 people. Medicines have been given at doorsteps to 17,000 people with hypertension, 11000 people with diabetes, nearly 8,000 people with both diabetes and hypertension. Besides, health workers have reached out to people for home dialysis, palliative care and physiotherapy. “We want to bring down deaths due to non-communicable disease by half in the next five years. For this, we must diagnose early and treat people adequately,” said health minister Ma Subramanian. Preliminary studies by the state showed that most people skipped tests and delayed revisits although treatment and medicines are free at government hospitals. This was because to make these visits they had to spend from their pocket for transport and lose at least half-a-day’s salary. Health volunteers, Subramanian said, would deliver these drugs at people’s doorsteps. “They will continue to test them for diabetes and blood pressure periodically and refer them to doctors when required. The infrastructure we build during the pandemic such as beds, oxygen pipelines and hospitals should help us deliver secondary and tertiary level care,” he said. Meanwhile, although Covid-19 cases are slowly moving from a pandemic to endemic stage, the state cannot let down its guard, said senior Vellore-based virologist T Jacob John. “We should have exclusive vaccine campaigns to administer anti-covid vaccines to the elderly and vulnerable people before schools reopen, because children can bring infections back home. At the same time, children themselves must take all the scheduled vaccines and boosters before they get back to school. There is a higher risk of diseases such as measles and diphtheria than Covid-19 when schools reopen,” he said. In addition, school health, social welfare and civil supplies departments should work with the state to ensure there is no increase in malnutrition triggered by poverty, said public health expert R Sunderraman, former director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre. “During lockdown many breadwinners lost jobs and it led to poverty and debts. If this is not addressed, it can lead to malnutrition and a other problems such as tuberculosis. Policies should address the huge burden of undertreated and undetected mental health issues that could increase risk of self-harm and suicide,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/second-wave-stole-spotlight-in-first-lap-but-more-health-challenges-lie-ahead/articleshow/85286056.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar: Bhagalpur residents launch campaign for air service||BHAGALPUR: Upset over the delay in commencement of air services from Bhagalpur, the denizens have launched a ‘Twitter abhiyaan’ (campaign) -- #Bhagalpur Wants Greenfield Airport -- to draw attention of PM Narendra Modi, civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar besides the Airports Authority of India officials towards their demand. They have also decided to start a postcard abhiyan - ‘Bhagalpur mangey airport’ — as part of sustained demonstration, including hunger strike, march and other means of peaceful protest in support of their demand for commercial flight operations from the Bhagalpur airfield, which was built in 1983. Gautam Singh, who led the Twitter campaign, said the Bhagalpur airfield has sufficient area and basic infrastructure for initiating commercial flights. Neglect at the central and state government levels besides silence of the people’s representatives resulted in delay in air services from Bhagalpur. He said their protest will continue. Former president of Eastern Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries (EBCCI), Shailendra Kumar Saraf, said private operators had operated small aircraft from the Bhagalpur airfield way back in 1983. However, due to non-viability (low passenger volume) at that time, the air services were withdrawn, he said.  Eastern Bihar Industries Association (EBIA) general secretary Alok Agarwal and other members of EBIA, demanded air connectivity from Bhagalpur. They said it will give a boost to local silk industries as well as other businesses. Silk exporters and foreign buyers avoid coming to Bhagalpur in the absence of air connectivity. Dr Sandeep Lal, president of Bhagalpur chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) and other IMA members, expressing concern about the delay in starting the air-services from Bhagalpur, said that it is not only necessary for fast traveling but also for medical emergencies. Many critical patients die due to poor means of transportation, added Dr Somen Chaterjee saying air-connectivity would be helpful in air-lifting critical patients to big hospitals with emergency facilities in metropolitan cities. Meanwhile the JD(U) MP from Bhagalpur Ajay Kumar Mandal said that there is an urgent need to provide air connectivity from Bhagalpur under the ‘Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - Udan’ in view of the city being developed under the ‘Smart City Mission’. He will take up the issue at the appropriate forum, added Mandal. Other associations of people including District Bar Association (DBA), Bhagalpur University Teachers Association (BHUTA), Bhagalpur University Service Teachers Association (BHUSTA), Resham Bunkar Khadi Evam Gramodyog Sangh (RBKEGS), Nagrik Vikas Samiti, Lions International Club, Rotary International Club and others also expressed their resentment about neglect of Bhagalpur region in starting air-services from Bhagalpur while coming forward to express solidarity with the twitter campaign. Meanwhile, the denizens forum, in a meeting today, considered forming a peoples’ committee on the issue to deliberate on the modalities of protest for drawing attention of the PM, Civil Aviation Minister, Bihar CM, AAI and others towards the long pending issue that dates back to 1983.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhagalpur-residents-launch-campaign-for-air-service/articleshow/85282986.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Goa||‘Goa’s water has seven types of coloured microplastics’||PANAJI: Seven different coloured microplastics — black, blue, red, grey, brown, green and transparent — were identified in the water samples collected and tested by the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) and Delhi-based advocacy group, Toxics Link, from across the Goa. TOI had reported on Thursday that a study titled ‘Clean Drinking Water: A Pipe Dream?’ assessing water collected from different sources — tap and water treatment plants — had revealed the presence of microplastics. Black coloured microplastics were dominant in all the water samples followed by blue, red, grey, brown, green and transparent, the study done by lead researcher, NIO, Mahua Saha stated. Microplastics (MP) are particles of plastic that are less than 5mm in size and have been recognised globally as one of the most critical emerging marine pollutants due to their persistence, ubiquity and toxic potential. The highest level of microplastic abundance was found in Mapusa with maximum concentration of ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH). “It may be due to the drainage of untreated wastewater into the river, small industries etc. EVOH is a formal copolymer of ethylene and vinyl alcohol. Due to its strong barrier against oxygen and gas, food packaging manufacturers use it in their packaging structure to extend the shelf life of food products,” the report stated. TOI had reported on August 12 that increased concentration of microplastics was noticed in the tap water samples collected from Mapusa as compared to the water sources. This, the study said, could be due to the transportation of water through PVC pipelines. In the case of the Margao sample, polyacetylene was found to be the maximum among all the microplastics. A total of 11 water samples were analysed and were collected from residential areas of Margao, Panaji, Mapusa, Marcel and Canacona, besides pre and post-treatment water samples were collected from the Assonora, Opa and Salaulim plants. The research identified 129 microplastic particles in all the locations and a total of 26 different polymer types were found. Among all the microplastics analysed, at 28.4% polyacetylene was found to be the maximum followed by EVOH (ethylene vinyl alcohol) at 25.9%, styrene/isoprene ABA block copolymer at 9.9%, polyvinyl alcohol at 9.9%, polyamide at 8.6%, poly vinyl chloride (PVC) at 8.6% and polyvinyl pyrrolidone at 8.6%. The plastic industry adds pigments to polymers, like in the case of marine application plastics different coloured alkyd resins are used. Polyester fibres are blue, while polyamide fibres are whitish grey and they are thinner than polyester ones. Blue-coloured microplastics were most commonly found, which, according to the study, might have originated from fishing nets or the use of other plastic packaging products. Polypropylene (PP) fibres were found in typically blue or red colour. These are widely used in the packaging, fisheries and textile industries. The main sources of the transparent and white microplastics are plastic carry bags and packaging materials and can also be sourced from fishing lines, the study stated. “The black MPs might have been released into the environment during transportation through black-coloured plastic pipes or may be through abrasion of tires on the road surfaces as regular wear and tear,” the study stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-water-has-7-types-of-coloured-microplastics/articleshow/85286511.cms||Nida Sayed

The victim was identified as Ajay Shukla (40). Police said Shukla, a resident of Telhara in Nalanda district, had been living alone in a rented accommodation at Mahavir Colony under Beur police station area for the last three years. The spot where Shukla was killed is hardly 500 metres away from his rented accommodation. This is the second major killing in the district in 48 hours. On Tuesday night, Mantu Kumar Gupta (40), a jeweller, was shot dead by a group of six criminals inside his shop at Bihta market in western Patna. Police said Shukla was also a transporter and his vehicles used to operate from Patna airport. Several deeds and agreements were recovered from his rented accommodation during a search by police. Phulwarisharif SDPO Manish Kumar Sinha said police have obtained CCTV camera footage of the incident. He said four criminals on two bikes intercepted Shukla and opened fire. “At least three bullets were pumped into his abdomen and another bullet hit his head,” the SDPO said, adding Shukla, who died on the spot, probably knew the criminals. “As soon as Shukla saw them from a distance, he tried to hide himself behind walls. However, he could not succeed as the criminals had already spotted him,” Sinha said. The SDPO added police were investigating the case from different angles. “Several agreement papers and deeds of plots were recovered from his residence. His two cellphones will be examined to get clue,” Sinha said, adding Shukla’s body was handed over to his family members after post-mortem at AIIMS-Patna. “Police are trying to identify the killers and arrest them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/criminals-kill-property-dealer-in-beur-escape/articleshow/85280403.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||NCLT rejects Siva Industries proposal for restructuring||Chennai: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Chennai bench has rejected the debt resolution proposal of Siva Industries, which was cleared by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) led by IDBI Bank. The NCLT has also ordered liquidation of Siva Industries.Siva Industries went under CIRP with admitted claims of Rs 4,863.87 crore from financial creditors, Rs 461.02 crore from operational creditors and Rs 40.55 crore from other creditors. There were two initial bidders who withdrew and the third Royal Partners’ proposal was rejected by the CoC. Soon after, the promoters of Siva Industries came up with a settlement plan for Rs 328.2 crore and sought the withdrawal from CIRP, with a condition that should there be a default, then the creditors can press for liquidation of Siva Industries. The Bench, comprising R Sucharitha and Anil Kumar B, wrote: “The purported settlement plan proposed by the promoters of the Corporate Debtor is not a Settlement simpliciter, rather it is a “Business Restructuring Plan”. As per the plan, there is no final offer made by the promoter of the corporate debtor and also the acceptance made by the CoC in this regard. There is no finality reached between the promoter of the Corporate debtor and the CoC of the Settlement proposal; hence based on ambiguity of the terms of settlement, we cannot order for the withdrawal of CIRP.”The order also said that seeking liquidation should there be a default was beyond the scope of IBC. RCK Vallal, who is the promoter of Siva Industries (father of Sivasankaran), said that the NCLT order questions the commercial wisdom of the CoC in arriving at the debt resolution plan. The Supreme Court had earlier said the commercial wisdom of the CoC is to be taken into account while deciding on the merits of any IBC case. IDBI Bank, which has the highest exposure to the company, will lose a substantial amount of funds as the company goes for liquidation. He said that he will move the NCLAT immediately for relief. The NCLT said the application made by RCK Vallal, one of the shareholders of the company, is not conforming to the Section 12A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Section 12A of the IBC gives an opportunity to the promoters to get back their companies if 90% of the lenders agree and the promoters’ clear their dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclt-rejects-siva-industries-proposal-for-restructuring/articleshow/85284759.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli
---||Patna||Dipankar favours caste census||PATNA: CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharyya on Thursday reiterated his stand that caste census was necessary in the country as it would provide logical edge to the job quota. He said caste census should be conducted for all social groups and Hindu-Muslim difference, as was being referred to by some people, was not at all a factor. “The caste census of all the people of the country should be conducted,” he said. Bhattacharya, who was talking to mediapersons, said the Centre has brought in the issue of population control, but it was being done only to divert attention of people from the main issues. “In the last several decades, population growth rate has come down. Hence, population is not an issue now,” he said. “The caste census will help in updating the job quota, because the Mandal Commission recommendations were made on the basis of the 1931 census figures,” Bhattacharya said. He added job avenues in the government sector were shrinking, and, therefore, the job quota should be provided in the private sector also. Bhattacharya said the Centre has not been paying heed to the demands of the agitating farmers with regard to the repeal of the three farm laws. “The central government has been conducting itself in the mould of the British colonial government in the country,” he added. He said the CPI (ML) will organise a “people’s parliament” on health issues here on Friday. Bhattacharya also condoled the death of former Patna University teacher Daisy Narayan and described her as a “source of energy” for the democratic struggle of the people of the state. Narayan had died last week due to brain stroke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dipankar-favours-caste-census/articleshow/85283723.cms||---

We are waiting for final notification from the state government in this regard. At Ibiza, our main attraction is the sprawling swimming pool. We would strictly abide by the restrictions and Covid protocol,” said Subhadip Basu, GM of Ibiza The Fern Resort and Spa, Kolkata. At AltAir hotel in Sector V and Raj Kutir resort on EM Bypass, the authorities said they already undertake regular clean-up of the swimming pool but once they have got the government sanction to allow guests into the pool, they would run another round of thorough sanitization process. Several resorts in and around the city also has similar plans. “The pools are already sanitized but we will undertake a thorough clean-up before allowing guests again,” said Nitin Kohli, director of Ambuja Neotia Hospitality. City clubs, too, welcomed the move and said they were ready to operate with 50% capacity but were just waiting for the formal notification from the state. “Our members, especially children, are waiting for the swimming pools to reopen.

Most residential complexes also said they would open the pools once get the government sanction. “The residents were looking forward to the reopening of the pool. Once the CM has allowed it, we will throw it open from next week itself,” said Debjani Mukherjee, director of Urbana Facility Management. Swimming coaching centres, however, rued at the timing of the order as the swimming season is due to end by September. “The reopening order came at a time when the swimming season is about to end. We don’t expect students to pay fees for the entire year just to swim for barely one-and-a-half months. Why did the government have to delay the opening when Delhi had already reopened swimming pools long back? The support staff associated with pools are suffering like anything,” said Ramanuj Mukherjee, the president of Bengal Amateur Swimming Association and vice-president of the Swimming Federation of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/swimming-pools-get-ready-for-reopening-next-week/articleshow/85283427.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

His wife is not yet accused in the FIR, but her name may be included after further inquiry.This is the first legal action by EOU in the sand smuggling episode in which it had conducted an internal inquiry and found involvement of at least 45 government officials, including former SPs of Aurangabad and Bhojpur, Sudheer Kumar Porika and Rakesh Kumar Dubey, respectively.At least 60 officers were removed from field posting in the crackdown against sand smuggling which began on July 14.

---||Patna||Centre urged toremove hurdles on ethanol issue||PATNA: State industries minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain on Friday called on Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri in Delhi and sought removal of the bottlenecks in the way of setting up ethanol plants in Bihar. Shahnawaz informed Puri that proposals worth Rs30,382.15 crore for setting up ethanol units have been received and processed. However, for the want of a tripartite agreement, banks have not been forthcoming in financing the projects. He said if a 7-year tripartite agreement among the oil marketing companies, banks and ethanol units for 100% buyback of ethanol is executed, then the companies could fast set up units in Bihar. Shahnawaz sought the petroleum ministry’s help in this regard. He also demanded maximum ethanol sourcing quota for Bihar. Bihar has a relatively much higher quantity of raw material required for ethanol production. “Therefore, if a higher quota is set for Bihar, then it will help achieve the biofuel mission of the Modi government, besides helping Bihar’s industrial mission,” he told Puri. Under the National Biofuels Policy, 2018, the Centre has revised the target year for 20% blending in petrol from 2030 to 2023 and reached out to various states for promoting production of ethanol and other biofuels. Bihar is the first state in the country which came out with its ethanol production promotion policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/centre-urged-toremove-hurdles-on-ethanol-issue/articleshow/85313719.cms||Madan Kumar

The STF personnel intercepted the four at Suryagarha in Lakhisarai district when they were returning to Delhi via Darbhanga on Wednesday night.

He was involved in 23 criminal cases registered with different police stations in Delhi.

---||Business||TN govt urged to cap stamp duty on M&As||Chennai: The Tamil Nadu government should introduce a ceiling cap on stamp duty with respect to amalgamation or reconstruction of companies, to avoid revenue loss to other states, India’s largest asset backed lender has said.The state government introduced a tax whereby 2% of the market value of immovable property involved in the transfer or 0.6% of the total market value of shares involved in the transfer. The registration fee on such transactions were fixed as Rs 30,000. The circular and subsequent government orders (GOs) would lead to a situation where the impact of the stamp duty would be enormous in the case of a scheme of amalgamation or reconstruction of large companies having their registered office in the state, who may not have any immovable property or negligible property in the state, DV Ravi, MD of Shriram Capital wrote in a letter to the government.The letter said that imposing stamp duty where there is either no or negligible immovable property being transferred will place a very high stamp duty burden on companies with their registered office in the state. “This would act as a deterrent for companies which have their registered office in the state from pursuing genuine schemes of amalgamation due to the onerous stamp duty burden. Alternatively, such companies will be forced to look at a change in their registered office outside the state to save on unreasonable stamp duty rates, the letter said. This may lead to revenue loss for the state, loss in employment if the office gets shifted out, loss in states share of GST paid by these companies and loss of state’s share of Income Tax paid by these companies. Competing states like Gujarat charges 1% of the market value of shares issued capped at Rs 25 crore and Maharashtra has 0.7% of market value of shares issued, capped at Rs 50 crore. Shriram’s Ravi sought amendments which will exclude companies which have no immovable properties or where the immovable properties are less than 10% of the total value of properties transferred. For those which are not excluded he sought a stamp duty cap of Rs 5 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tn-govt-urged-to-cap-stamp-duty-on-mas/articleshow/85284500.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli
---||Patna||Six years on, central university at Vikramshila site yet to take shape||PATNA: The announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi almost six years ago regarding establishment of a central university at the historic site of Vikramshila University in Bhagalpur is yet to take shape. The central government had also allocated Rs 500 crore for the purpose. Sources claimed that things were moving at a snail’s pace allegedly due to official apathy. The committee constituted by the Union HRD ministry more than 18 months ago for selecting the final site for the proposed university submitted its report to the Centre recently. State education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary told this newspaper on Tuesday, “The Centre had asked Bihar to provide 500 acres of land for setting up the university. The state government, however, expressed its inability in procuring this much land in Bhagalpur and offered 200 acres for the purpose as most of the lands are agricultural and fertile. The central government accepted the proposal and asked the state to provide two to three alternative locations.” The state government in December 2018 furnished the details of three locations in Kahalgaon circle of Bhagalpur district. The Union HRD ministry constituted a five-member committee consisting of a joint secretary of the ministry, UGC secretary, vice-chancellor of Central University of South Bihar, principal secretary of state education department and chief engineer of Central Public Works Department for selecting the site. But perhaps due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the committee could not visit the site in time and submit its report. The minister said, “The entire project is being monitored by the Union HRD ministry and the state government has been providing all the required facilities to the Centre. Moreover, the allocated fund of Rs 500 crore has not been received by the state till date.” The minister, however, hoped that as the pandemic normalizes, things would move fast and the proposed central university at Vikramshila site would soon see the light of day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/six-years-on-central-university-at-vikramshila-site-yet-to-take-shape/articleshow/85283697.cms||B K Mishra

Investors were upbeat after US data showed moderation in inflation rate in July and UK data indicated a jump in economic growth in the three months to June. As a result, the index rallied 318 points to close at 54,844 with ICICI Bank, Infosys and L&T leading the gainers. The day’s high for the sensex was at 54,874 points, while on the NSE, the Nifty, after touching a high at 16,376 points, closed 82 points up at 16,364 — a record too. According to Geojit Financial Services head (research) Vinod Nair, market breadth continued to be skewed in favour of the bulls amid mixed global cues and strong support from IT, power and utility stocks. “Chinese jitters over tightening regulatory scrutiny of online insurance companies were outweighed by the slowdown in pace of the US inflation data and rebound in UK GDP numbers. US (annual) consumer price inflation stood at 5.4% in July, unchanged from June’s data, taking some heat out of concerns over early tapering by the US Fed. UK GDP grew by 4.8% (on a quarterly basis) in Q2 as activity and demand rebounded with the easing of Covid restrictions,” Nair wrote in a post-market note. The day’s session also witnessed a smart rally in mid- and small-cap stocks. In the last two days these stocks had faced under strong selling after the BSE on Monday had proposed a stricter risk management rule for all stocks with market cap of below Rs 1,000 crore. While BSE’s mid-cap index closed 1.1% higher, the small-cap index closed 2% up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-nears-55k-on-global-cues/articleshow/85287035.cms||---

The development comes months after she stepped down from the board of its promoter Tata Sons. Tata Steel now has two women members on its board. The other woman independent director is Mallika Srinivasan, chairperson of Tractors and Farm Equipment and wife of Venu Srinivasan, who is also a director of Tata Sons. Khambata, an alumna of Cambridge university and London Business School, is the co-founder of Cartica, a private equity fund based in the US, and her term at Tata Steel begins from August 12, subject to shareholders’ approval. She has also been appointed on Tata Steel’s audit and risk management committee. With Khambata’s appointment, Tata Steel’s board strength has increased to 10 members. The metal producer is the latest listed Tata Group company to have two women directors after TCS, Tata Motors, and Indian Hotels Company, although rules mandate one woman director on the board of a publicly listed entity. Khambata was brought into the board of Tata Sons by former chairman Cyrus Mistry. And her term at Tata Sons ended some months ago. In the recent past, Tata Steel had kept an independent director seat vacant after the court directed it to do so. The directive was after some minority Tata Steel shareholders wanted a special resolution as against the norm of an ordinary resolution to remove a company’s independent director. The petition, however, was later withdrawn by the complainants. Meanwhile, Tata Steel on Thursday reported a profit of Rs 9,768 crore during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-steel-appoints-khambata-on-board/articleshow/85287094.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Business||Zee insider trading: Sebi bars 15 entities||Mumbai: Sebi has barred 15 entities from the market, including some of the top executives with foreign and domestic broking houses like UBS and Edelweiss, for insider trading in Zee Entertainment stocks in August 2020. The markets regulator has also impounded “ill-gotten gains” of nearly Rs 24 crore from these entities. All the 15 entities “are restrained from buying, selling or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever until further orders”, Sebi said in its interim order in the matter. Sebi’s internal surveillance system had shown unusual price movement in the Zee stock in August last year. After an investigation, Sebi found that Bijal Shah, a top executive at Zee, had passed on information about the media company’s forthcoming results to Gopal Ritolia, a director at UBS India, and Jatin Chawla, an ex-director at Credit Suisse and currently director at First Voyagers Advisors. Based on this unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI), Ritolia and Chawla bought large chunks of Zee shares ahead of the announcement of its quarterly and annual results. These trades were done in the accounts of their respective mothers, the Sebi report said. Chawla passed on the UPSI to Amit Bhanwarlal Jajoo, the authorised person (AP) of Edelweiss Broking, who gave it to Manish Kumar Jajoo, his cousin who also worked with the same broking house. Amit and Manish too bought large chunks of the Zee stock before the company’s results. They used the trading accounts of seven family members. The Sebi investigation, which included scanning social media, call data records and bank statements, found that all the nine trading accounts were used for insider trading. These nine had started building their positions from August 11, 2020, just after Zee disclosed to the bourses that its board will be considering its results few days later on August 18. “Further, all the said entities had significant concentration in (Zee) scrip only around the announcement as compared to the earlier periods. All the masterminds had used the trading accounts of their family members in order to avoid regulatory detection,” the Sebi order noted. The investigation also found that Ritolia and Chawla, through the trading accounts of their respective mothers, had taken significant positions in Zee prior to the announcements of other price-sensitive information, which include earlier financial results and the launch of the cinema-to home service, ZEE Plex. Ritolia and Chawla were batchmates at IIM-Lucknow. Shah, Ritolia and Chawla knew each other for over 15 years, having worked together at IIFL Securities and other brokerages in the past, the order said. Sebi found the repetitive nature of trading activity around the significant announcements by Zee to be highly suspicious and, therefore, passed an interim order debarring the entities from accessing the capital markets and also impounded the ill-gotten gains, the regulator said. On Friday, a spokesperson for Edelweiss Broking said, “As a responsible market participant, we promote, endorse or subscribe to compliant behaviours and are not part of any of the alleged activities carried out by Manish Jajoo or Amit Jajoo mentioned in the interim order. These activities have been carried out by them in their individual capacity without the permission or knowledge of Edelweiss Broking.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zee-insider-trading-sebi-bars-15-entities/articleshow/85286924.cms||---
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Hundreds of dead fish found in polluted Rockfort temple tank||TRICHY: Hundreds of fish in the Teppakulam tank of Rockfort temple were found floating dead on Thursday. Preliminary investigation by fisheries department indicates that continuous dumping of plastic and food waste by the public and street vendors caused the death. “Fisheries department has collected water samples. Food waste was said to have contaminated the water, there were also oil layers spotted,” an corporation official said. Some of the fish were reportedly relocated to other water bodies to ensure oxygen availability. The tank belonging to the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment department (HR&CE) was taken on lease by the Trichy Corporation and has been brimming with water since January. A foul smell was coming from the tank for last few days and and upon inspection on Thursday it was found that hundreds of fish were dead and afloat in the tank. The corporation workers removed the dead fish and also removed at least 100 kg of plastic and food waste dumped into the waterbody. Officials said that as NSB and Nandhi Koil commercial streets are dotted with street vendors and small shops, the vendors and public dump food and plastic waste directly in the tank. “We have insisted the corporation to improve the safety measures. There is not CCTV surveillance in the locality,” a senior official with the HR&CE department added. Locals, however, slammed the civic body for not maintaining the quality of the water as it is beautifying the tank at an outlay of Rs 8 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/hundreds-of-dead-fish-found-in-polluted-rockfort-temple-tank/articleshow/85286028.cms||---

Addressing the annual session of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Sitharaman also said the government and the RBI will both push growth and take all necessary steps to keep inflation contained. “Government’s commitment to recovery is shown in so many different ways and we are going to continue doing that because recovery and its sustainability is something which the PM is very keenly invested in,” said Sitharaman. “I am not looking at growth versus inflation. We shall attend to inflation and keep it contained, take all the necessary steps but never forget the fact that growth is that will make all the difference to the economy’s revival, growth will eventually remove poverty and bring in a level-playing field for all Indian citizens,” FM said, adding that both the Centre and RBI are working as partners to address issues linked to the economy. She said the messages and the indications that are coming in are very clear that the economy is revving to come out. The FM said the financing needs of the growing economy have been successfully met by the over Rs 5 lakh crore of capital, which was put in the hands of various stakeholders through the credit outreach programmes of the government. Sitharaman also said the economy has not reached a level where the liquidity which was pumped in during the pandemic can be pulled back. “I don’t think we have reached that level and I am glad that RBI has been voicing that understanding that too quick a retrieval or sucking out of the liquidity from the economy may not do the necessary stimulus, which is required. I am glad that RBI has kept that understanding and they have not given any indication about wanting to suck out the liquidity which is available there,” the FM said. Sitharaman cited the passage of crucial bills in Parliament in the just concluded monsoon session as the government’s commitment to push ahead with reforms. The FM made it clear that the government will push through stake sales in all the companies such as Air India, BPCL this year as well as proceed with the asset monetisation plan. “Policy-driven disinvestment and privatisation will continue with the same fervour,” said Sitharaman, adding that “necessary rigorous work is going on and the government is committed to the disinvestments announced in the budget. The FM urged the industry to venture into new areas and take decisions to expand. “I thank the Indian industry for being very level headed to face the challenge of the first and even face the challenge of the second wave of Covid-19 when many countries are still wondering how they would face their economy and pick the economy from where it is left behind,” said Sitharaman. “Indian industry is moving into totally new areas. It is time for the Indian Industry to come around in a big way and it is time to show its risk-taking capacity”, said Sitharaman, adding that the stock market was showing the way. “Please do follow it,” said the FM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-will-do-everything-to-revive-growth-says-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/85289606.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: CBI gives clean chit to ex-BSP MLA Puja Pal in murder case||LUCKNOW: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has given a clean chit to former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA Puja Pal, her brother and five others in the Lalit Verma murder case of Prayagraj. The CBI had registered an FIR in September 2019 and started a probe following orders of the high court. Lalit Kumar, 28, was shot on February 3, 2016, after which his father Vinod had lodges a case alleging that former BSP MLA Pooja Pal’s brother Rahul Pal, Dilip Pal, Prithvi Pal, Rajesh Tripathi, Sandeep Yadav, and Mukesh Kesharwani had attacked him, his son Lalit and nephew Vikram Kumar when they were going to meet a lawyer. Vinod said the accused travelling in an SUV had intercepted the bike of Vikram on which Lalit was riding pillion and shot the latter. Vikram also sustained minor injuries and was a witness to the incident, Vinod said, claiming he had a property dispute with a former MLA and her brother. Prayagraj Police started a probe and traced a motorcycle and pistol, but it was inconclusive. Vinod, meanwhile, moved court demanding CBI probe. A senior officer said, “We scanned CCTV footage and found no SUV passing at that time. Besides, the named accused were at a party and there were videos to prove this. We also found that Vikram was not present on the spot.” “We used electronic surveillance and found Santosh Soni and Vikram Soni, both brothers and distant relatives of complainant Vinod, were there at the time of murder,” he added. “We conducted their brain mapping and polygraph tests with the court's permission and met with partial success. The duo broke down when we moved court seeking nod for their narco-analysis test,” the officer said. Santosh and Vikram murdered Lalit because they believed their younger brother Ranjeet had been killed by Vinod and wanted to avenge his murder. Ranjeet had died in a train accident while coming from Mumbai. “They also confessed that Lalit was having an affair with Santosh’s wife,” said sources. Vinod had several property disputes with MLA Pooja Pal and hence believed she and her brothers got his son eliminated and decided to implicate them. A countrymade pistol used in the attack was also recovered. CBI officials said the role of one Brijesh Pal also came to the fore. “One pistol was recovered, while another was given by Santosh to Brijesh Pal for further disposal,” said CBI officials. Central forensic laboratory will conduct a striation test on the bullet recovered from the scene and then a chargesheet would be filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cbi-gives-clean-chit-to-ex-bsp-mla-brother-in-murder-case/articleshow/85288129.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Trailer over, let the show begin||CHENNAI: A day after the election results indicated a victory for the DMK, the Chittaranjan Salai residence of the DMK president M K Stalin in Chennai bustled with activity with officials arriving to discuss the Covid-19 situation. There was hardly any time for Stalin to savour his victory. He confessed to family and friends that the crown on his head was a “crown of thorns” and not one of flowers. The emotions that the first-time chief minister was experiencing remains hidden behind the mask as he completes 100 days at Fort St George. The poor fiscal status saw the chief minister prioritising welfare schemes and resorting to austerity. A fine balance of continuity and disruption has been the hallmark of Stalin’s three-month rule. If Amma Unavagams and HR&CE temples continue to roll out dishes for the needy and poor, a tender worth Rs 120 crore was cancelled to rid any suggestion of corruption in a contract for Greater Chennai Corporation. A dream team of international economists was constituted to set right the economy even as his rivals dubbed it a move to gain optics. For now, the 68-year-old chief minister has set his goal to make Tamil Nadu a $1 trillion economy by 2030 and inked deals worth Rs 17,141 crore with investors. Criticism from rivals that the students had to appear for NEET despite a poll promise to do away with it has been a cause for embarrassment for the Stalin government. But it decided to introduce a bill to extend the 7.5% quota to other professional courses to steer the course of debate away from NEET. The previous Edappadi K Palaniswami government had announced 7.5% quota in medical admissions to government school students ahead of the assembly election. “The chief minister works relentlessly, holds reviews with us and officials frequently. He asks us to do field visits, study and rectify problems. Unlike our late leader’s tenure which was like free flow of water in the river with no big challenges, our CM has many and he is handling them well,” municipal administration minister K N Nehru said. The younger, less experienced ministers have a long way to go. The party has sought to shed its anti-Hindu image with an energetic P K Sekar Babu helming the HR&CE. On another front, Centre-state relations, where the government is drawing heavy fire, Stalin, having learnt lessons from his father, has sought to balance it with confrontation and cooperation. While he meets Prime Minister Narendra Modi as protocol warrants, his minister decries GST at the council meeting as ‘rubber stamp authority’. He urged the eight coastal states to oppose the draft Indian Ports Bill, 2021 that reduces state’s autonomy. On river water disputes, the belligerent former Karnataka CM and BJP leader, B S Yeddiyurappa, has been appropriately warned. Stalin’s analogy: The DMK and its government is an elephant that none could tame – the four legs reflect the principles of social justice, self-respect, linguistic and ethnic affinity and state’s autonomy. The politics of hostility has taken a back seat, instead ‘inclusive’ governance is making headlines. A clarion call to all parties to work together for Covid management ensured that AIADMK and BJP MLAs took part in the government’s review meetings. Former AIADMK minister C Vijayabaskar was included in the government’s Covid-19 management panel. Stalin’s enthusiasm to reach out to the opponents was widely acknowledged, especially by the PMK. In what may change political equations in the future, Stalin issued an order to implement the contentious 10% vanniyar quota. The bureaucracy tries hard to keep up with the chief minister’s pace. He visits the secretariat twice a day and sits for long hours, travels to districts and reserves Sundays for his Kolathur constituency for the ‘Ungal Thoguthiyil Muthalamaichar’ scheme. The first lap looks promising for Stalin, who is now earning praise as people’s chief minister even if it means obliging a middle-aged woman by stopping his car on the highway, removing his mask and showing her his face. What next? The electoral promises of cracking down on alleged corruption by the previous AIADMK regime will pick up pace. The going will be tough with the state’s finances still weak. As things stand now, tough decisions are expected like levying more taxes even as Stalin allowed a White Paper to speak ahead of budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/trailer-over-let-the-show-begin/articleshow/85286126.cms||Julie Mariappan

He told the cops that he used to have regular arguments with his wife because she used to frequent her maternal place regularly. Circle Officer Bhognipur Prabhat Kumar said that the incident was reported on Tuesday night when Ram Kumar, a street vendor, and a resident of Majariya Umariya village reached the police station and asked the cops to visit his house where his wife Uma’s body is lying.

He eliminated Uma as she had hit him with a brick over the same dispute in the night,” said CO. When she fell unconscious, he dragged her to their room and himself left for police station. The man used a spade to kill his wife. “Police later recovered the spade from the room itself,” he added. Uma’s father Chandrapal also reached the spot. He told investigators that there was a programme at his home in which his daughter Uma also came. Two days back, Ramkumar had taken Uma from her house. “My daughter has been murdered for dowry,” said Chandrapal.

---||Varanasi||Startup to provide technical support to handloom weavers||Varanasi: ReshaMandi, a Bengaluru based agri-tech startup digitizing India’s silk supply chain, has created a network of handloom weavers in Varanasi to address their root issues with the help of technological interventions. “Currently, ReshaMandi has a network of about 200 weavers in Varanasi who predominantly use handlooms, thus preserving the authentic art of traditional weaving,” said co-founder of ReshaMandi, Utkarsh Apoorva. He said that as Covid-19 related restrictions caused a detrimental impact on the silk weavers, who lacked the market linkages to procure silk yarns and sell their products to retailers resulting in loss of income, defaulting on loans and threatening their survival, the company is working with key stakeholders with a vision of making India ‘atmanirbhar’ in silk production. He said that ReshaMandi is also engaging with the weaver communities in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to address their issues like timely procurement of quality assured yarns, lack of working capital funds and quick turnover of their goods with the help of technological interventions. Apoorva claimed that these weavers saw a rise in demand for their goods from retailers and were able to get over 8-17% profitability in their manufacturing as they had completely cut down Chinese yarn and were procuring Indian silk yarn from ReshaMandi. The company works as a grassroots-level enabler that works directly with sericulture farmers, fabric weavers, silk reelers, and retailers, enabling them to get the best price for their produce, reducing the time to market, and making sure that they are supplied with the best raw materials and quality assurance testing kits. It implements traditional interventions like yarn grading before every dispatch to provide the weavers with quality products, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/startup-to-provide-technical-support-to-handloom-weavers/articleshow/85255401.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai man uses fear of cop cases to cheat neighbour of Rs 96L||MUMBAI: A Worli resident allegedly cheated a 41-year-old assistant manager working with a private firm of nearly Rs 96 lakh by claiming that the police were looking for him in a woman’s attempted suicide case and another woman was going to file a sexual assault case against him. The accused, Aditya Waghela (25), allegedly also created a fake Facebook profile of a woman to chat with the complainant, his neighbour. Waghela had filed anticipatory bail applications before the sessions court and the Bombay high court, but both were rejected. After he surrendered, he was sent to judicial custody. Worli police are likely to approach the court on Friday to take Waghela in custody for interrogation. Waghela and the complainant were neighbours in a chawl in Worli, but a couple of years ago the latter shifted to Palghar with his wife and children while his parents still stay there. It all began in 2017, when Waghela told the complainant that a woman in their chawl was to get Rs 40 lakh after selling her land, but she needed money to cover the court expenses and legal fees as the land was in dispute. In various instalments, Waghela allegedly took Rs 35 lakh from the complainant to help the woman. Waghela allegedly even opened a social media account posing as the woman and chatted with the complainant, said the police. In his complaint, the victim said he got scared after Waghela told him that woman was going to lodge a sexual harassment complaint against him and another woman had attempted suicide and was going to blame him. The complainant said he paid him Rs 15 lakh to Waghela to settle the police case. The accused allegedly took the names of two police officers while collecting the money. Later, the complainant learnt there were no such officers at Worli police station. He then informed his family about the cheating and approached the police in June. The accused had allegedly also forged a letterhead of the cyber police. “The complainant has said in the FIR that he was cheated on various occasions of a total Rs 96.2 lakh. We will interrogate the accused,” said Anil Koli, senior inspector of Worli police station. According to the FIR, the victim had transferred the money into the accused’s bank account and even given him cash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-uses-fear-of-cop-cases-to-cheat-neighbour-of-rs-96l/articleshow/85288151.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Kanpur||Kanpur: SNK pan masala owner, director held for evasion of Rs 50 crore GST||KANPUR: A team of director general GST Intelligence raided the factory of SNK Pan Masala Group and arrested its owner Naveen Kurele and director Avinash Modi on Tuesday. The arrest was made with regard to GST evasion of about Rs 50 crores. After the implementation of the GST, it is being said that this arrest was probably the first case wherein an owner of a big pan masala group and its director were nailed in the city. Both of them have been arrested under Section 132 of GST. The raids started on Monday, wherein separate teams of DG GSTI swooped down on the establishments of pan masala companies across 15 districts of the state including Kanpur. Kurele and Modi were kept in the lock-up of Kakadeo police station on Tuesday night. They were taken to the court on Wednesday afternoon, where the officials of GST Intelligence placed an application for their transit remand. GST officers will now take them to Meerut after procuring their transit remand. This campaign was launched after raids at a Delhi company recently. From there the team found evidence of supply of packaging material without bills, after which several pan masala factories, including SNK were raided. The Delhi company supplies most of the raw material to the SNK Pan Masala company. When the intelligence wing of GST matched the plastic packing material supplied by the Delhi company with the books of pan masala company, it came to fore that there is a huge gap between the input and output. After which the team arrested both Kurele and Modi. A city police official said that GST Intelligence officials arrested Naveen Kurele and Avinash Modi of SNK Pan Masala Group late on Tuesday evening and brought them to Kakadeo police station after a medical examination in the night. “After the permission of police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun, Kakadeo Inspector Kunj Bihari Mishra kept the duo in lock-up for a night. On Wednesday morning, the officers of GST Intelligence prepared all the papers from the GST office located at Sarvodaya Nagar. After this, they were taken to Kakadeo police station around 12 noon and the police took them into custody. Later, at around 12:15, the officers took them to the court,” he said further. Inspector Kakadeo Kunj Bihari Mishra told reporters that officers of the director general GST Intelligence had brought pan masala traders to the police station on Tuesday night. “As there is no lock-up at the GST office here, the GST officials asked them to keep the duo in the lock-up of the police station. After permission from the city police commissioner, both were kept in the lock-up and were later handed over to the officers when they arrived in the morning,” said Mishra further. The GST team will now take both of them with them to Meerut, he added. To recall, the Central and state income tax department had raided the SNK Pan Masala Group recently. Company’s investment in the real estate business also came to fore in that raid. Undisclosed funds of about Rs 400 crore were detected which were brought into business through shell companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/snk-pan-masala-owner-director-held-for-evasion-of-rs-50cr-gst/articleshow/85255615.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Internal issues hit AIADMK's efforts to grow into an effective opposition||CHENNAI: If M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa shone as able administrators when in power, they were no less influential as opposition leaders. Karunanidhi, in fact, is known to be at his best as an opposition leader, setting the political agenda for the state every day. Jayalalithaa, though inviting criticism for periodical sabbaticals at Kodanad, never missed an opportunity to nail the ruling DMK and keep them on their toes. In contrast, the Edappadi K Palaniswami – O Panneerselvam dispensation presents the picture of a seemingly constructive but subdued opposition. Except for one protest, AIADMK was missing in action on the field for the past 100 days. OPS 's statements against the ruling party were nothing but soft nudges and gentle warnings. On the other hand, EPS does attempt to play a hard-hitting opposition leader, and regularly holds media interactions, highlighting the DMK’s gaps in governance. But his posturing is few and far between. Even as BJP makes the most noise against DMK, the principal opposition AIADMK appears to be weighed down by internal feuds, Sasikala factor, pulls and pushes of allies and last but not the least, the threat of legal action against ministers. Even in the joint statement issued by EPS and OPS in the wake of DVAC searches at S P Velumani’s house, all they could say was an oblique "We feel the searches are condemnable." In contrast, BJP’s Vanathi Srinivsan said she 'strongly condemned the raids which was an act of political vendetta born out of chief minister M K Stalin’s personal grudge against Velumani.’ “They had very little to do as opposition in the last 100 days and more to do with their own preservation. EPS and OPS are beginning to understand that they have to remain united to be strong. We have to see how they perform in the budget session before assessing them in the role of the opposition party,” said Ramu Manivannan, head of the department of politics and public administration in Madras University. The voice of the opposition party on various issues was not heard enough, also because AIADMK spokesmen were barred from participating in media debates. Former minister D Jayakumar, however, said they had performed `excellently’ as an opposition party. “We have raised key issues in the assembly, fought for people’s welfare, exposed the failure of DMK government in fulfilling their electoral promises,” he said. Jayakumar said as a responsible opposition party, they went to Delhi and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to uphold the rights of Tamil Nadu over Cauvery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/internal-issues-hit-aiadmks-efforts-to-grow-into-an-effective-opposition/articleshow/85286204.cms||V Mayilvaganan
---||Allahabad||HC turns down PIL seeking policy for online sale, home delivery of liquor||Revised Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking framing of a policy to permit online sale of liquor and its home delivery in Uttar Pradesh. Dismissing the PIL filed by Gopal Krishna Pandey, a high court lawyer, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Subhash Chandra Sharma observed, “Finding the subject matter as the policy of the state, we are not inclined to allow online sale of liquor.” The PIL was filed seeking direction for framing necessary policy for home delivery of liquor. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that certain state governments have issued notification to allow the delivery of liquor online and thereby home delivery would be made. It was in pursuance of the observations made by the Supreme Court to the states to consider non-direct sale, including online/home delivery of liquor to avoid overcrowding and to maintain social distancing norms in terms of Covid-19 guidelines. It is submitted that Madras High Court has permitted online sale of liquor. The chief standing counsel, representing the state government, opposed the petition and submitted that the prayer made is in reference to the policy decision and presently the government is not inclined to allow online sale of the liquor with home delivery. The permission to sell liquor online by a few states was in the era of Covid-19 when it was at its peak and was to avoid overcrowding in the shops. There is nothing on record to show overcrowding on the shops in the state of Uttar Pradesh and now the peak of Covid-19 and its second phase has gone. In the PIL, several reasons to allow sale were given like if liquor is sold online the sale would also increase and the increase in sale means increase of revenue. Secondly, the difficulty in deciding location of shops as per Uttar Pradesh number and location of excise shop rules, 1968 would be removed. Besides, there will be low cost of maintenance of shops for licensee of liquor shops. Further, senior citizens or other persons, who for any reason best known to them avoid counter purchase from the shops, would also be facilitated. In addition to the above, unnecessary and unsocial crowds usually collected around the liquor shops would also be reduced, as a result of which the law and order would also improve. Rejecting all pleas, the court said, “The petitioner has shown concern to increase the revenue of the state and other aspects which includes purchase of liquor even by those who may be shy in making purchases from the shop. The reasons given are not to avoid overcrowding or to maintain social distancing to follow the Covid-19 protocol, rather it is for different reasons observed by the apex court.” The court delivered this decision on August 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-turns-down-pil-seeking-policy-for-online-sale-home-delivery-of-liquor/articleshow/85255658.cms||---

He also asked if public representatives and mass support is being employed in rescue and relief work. I informed the PM about the active cooperation of public representatives and social and voluntary organisations in flood relief work,” he said. “The PM was also informed that UP Jal Shakri minister Mahendra Singh had already taken stock of the situation and chief minister Yogi Adityanath is likely to visit on Thursday in this regard,” he added. The PM also wanted to know whether NDRF was extending help in the on-going operations. Sharma apprised the PM of the arrangements of extra boats for assisting in rescue and relief operations, food packets, community kitchens, distribution of drinking water and milk in flood-hit areas. “After collecting all these details, the PM asked whether his help is required in any work,” said Sharma adding, “He asked me to contact him immediately in case of any requirement. I informed the PM that PMO is already monitoring the entire exercise.” The PM also talked to BJP city unit president Vidyasagar Rai over phone to get feedback on the relief work in the flood-affected areas and measures being initiated to meet the challenges in the current situation. Rai said that he informed the PM about the flood relief work being done by party cadres. Rai said, “The PM was informed that the party is ensuring that no one sleeps empty stomach in flood-hit areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/modi-dials-dm-seeks-detailsof-flood-related-work-in-kashi/articleshow/85255440.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Although, both the rivers are flowing over a metre above the danger mark (84.73m), but the water level in both the rivers has become stable. The administration is hopeful that the water would start receding from Thursday onwards. Both Ganga and Yamuna, as recorded at 8 am by the irrigation department on Wednesday, were far above the danger mark and showed a rising trend. Water level of Ganga at Phaphamau was 86.05 m (rising at a speed of 1.5 cm per hour), while at Chhatnag, the water level was recorded as 85.19 m (rising at a speed of 1 cm per hour). Likewise, the water level of Yamuna at Naini was recorded as 85.73 m (rising at a speed of 0.5 cm per hour). The rising trend of Ganga was recorded till Wednesday noon, after which the it started receding, albeit at a slow pace. This trend continued till 4 pm, after which the water became stable. At the same time, Yamuna, which was showing an increasing trend for the past one week, became stable on Wednesday evening. The water level (as recorded at 4pm) of Ganga at Phaphamau was 86.03 m, and at Chhatnag, it was 85.27 m. Water level Yamuna was also stable and was recorded as 85.77 m. Meanwhile, the district administration and the NDRF team continued to provide help to the locals trapped in the flood affected localities and to those who have been shifted to flood relief camps established at various places in the city. Along with providing food and other essential items, the administration is also conducting Covid tests in the relief camps. Although the administration claimed to have ensured proper hygiene, people have been complaining about the same in a few camps. In the flood-affected areas, including Chota and Bada Bagada, Salori, Ganga Nagar and parts of Gaus Nagar, the district administration, NDRF teams, local voluntary organisations and leaders of political parties distributed food packets and other essential items through boats and even by walking in the knee-deep water. In most of these localities, residents have either moved to the first and second floors of their houses or have locked their houses and moved to flood relief camps. People also experienced some relief from the rain, as the city did not receive showers after 3 pm. For the past two days, heavy rains lashed Sangam city, adding to the sufferings of the flood-hit people. However, with the water level stabilising in the evening, the administration felt relieved. “We have reasons to believe that the flood water will start receding from Thursday, as the upstream of Yamuna and its tributary has not received heavy rain. Once the water level of Yamuna recede, the same would have a positive impact on the water level of Ganga,” said executive engineer of the irrigation department, Brijesh Kumar Verma. However, as per the readings, recorded at 6pm, both the rivers have again started rising but with a very slender margin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ganga-and-yamuna-stable-after-weeklong-upward-trend/articleshow/85255715.cms||---

Calangute police inspector (PI) Nolasco Raposo told TOI that the report of the autopsy, which was conducted at the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, has attributed the cause of death to drowning and has ruled out any sexual assault. A case of unnatural death has been registered. The girl was last seen at Guirim where she was dropped by her father for onward travel to her workplace at Porvorim. However, when she did not turn up for work, her parents received a call from her employers, the police said. Her phone was later found at her home. Her father subsequently filed a missing person’s complaint at the Mapusa police station on Wednesday evening. The girl had been on leave due to medical reasons and was scheduled to resume duty on Wednesday. Early Thursday morning, Calangute police received a call that a female body had washed ashore. Police personnel rushed to the spot and conducted a panchanama.

---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: Ganga and Yamuna start receding in Sangam city||PRAYAGRAJ: With the water level of Ganga and Yamuna receding at Phaphamau, Chhatnag and Naini from Thursday, people of Prayagraj and the district administration are relieved. However, the rising Tons river in Meja has led to new problems. The district administration is keeping a close watch on its water level. Due to the sudden increase in the water level of Tons, Ganga and Yamuna are not receding at a faster rate as expected. The water level in both the rivers was, in fact, increasing as per the reading of 6 am on Thursday. However, around noon, Ganga started receding while Yamuna became stable. By 4pm, water level of both the rivers at all the three recording sites was receding. Water level of Ganga (at 6am) at Phaphamau was recorded as 86.09 m, and at Chhatnag it was 85.35m. Yamuna was flowing at 85.84 m at Naini, that is, 1.10 m above the danger mark of 84.73 m. By 4 pm, Ganga receded by around 16 cm at Phaphamau, and by 20 cm at Chhatnag. Yamuna receded marginally by just 2 cm, as per the recording of 4pm. Flood water further receded in both the rivers as per the recordings at 6 pm. Ganga was flowing at 85.89 m at Phaphamau and 85.08 m at Chhatnag. Yamuna at Naini further receded by 2 cm, and was flowing at 85.80 m. However, with both the rivers still flowing above the danger mark, several localities situated on their banks are flooded. The district administration, along with the NDRF team, visited many flood-affected areas on Thursday and distributed essential items, including potable water, to the stranded locals. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya too conducted an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas of the district. “I have seen the extensiveness of the flood, and have instructed the administration to keep providing all the necessary help that the stranded residents need. At the same time, the health department has been asked to be prepared for an extensive drive to minimise chances of the spread of various diseases which could trouble the locals when the flood water recedes,” said Maurya while talking to reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ganga-yamuna-start-receding-in-sangam-city/articleshow/85287321.cms||Rajeev Mani

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Defunct lights on Sion-Panvel Highway irk motorists||NAVI MUMBAI: Incessant rains in July have exposed the shoddy condition of the arterial Sion-Panvel Highway. And after dusk, several stretches along the highway are plunged into darkness due to defunct streetlights. Motorists are aghast over the deplorable state of the 10-lane, 25-km highway between BARC and Kalamboli which was re-laid six years ago. TimesViewThe Sion-Panvel Highway, a key connector between Mumbai and the southern states, was renovated in 2015 at a cost of Rs 1, 230 crore. And yet motorists complain of potholes and non-functional streetlights. Despite the intervention of the high court, the PWD failed to resolve the problems. This issue needs to be redressed at the highest level in the government.The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has evinced interest in maintaining the streetlights on a major portion of the highway, but the state public works department (PWD) is reluctant to accept the offer as that would mean allowing the civic body rights to advertise on the highway. Even as the state cabinet has approved the proposal to transfer streetlight maintenance to the NMMC, the PWD is dragging its feet on the issue. NMMC city engineer Sanjay Desai said, “The PWD has assured us that it will respond to our offer in a week’s time. A joint survey has already been done and it was found that over a hundred streetlights are non-operational.” NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said the PWD should clear all power bill dues before handing over the streetlight maintenance task. “I had a word with higher ups in the PWD and hope the issue will be resolved soon,” he added. When contacted, PWD executive engineer Omprakash Pardeshi said, “Our teams are on toes to fix the potholes in certain patches . NMMC’s offer to take over the streetlight maintenance is being discussed at the highest level since the civic body is asking for advertisement rights.” PWD secretary Ulhas Debadwar told TOI, “We will soon take a call on the streetlight issue; it is being examined by the chief engineer concerned.” Navi Mumbai deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Purushottam Karad has also written to the PWD, MSRDC and MMRDA highlighting the battered condition of the highway and to improve lighting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-defunct-lights-on-sion-panvel-hway-irk-motorists/articleshow/85286247.cms||B B Nayak

Tehsildar Chauri Chaura will accompany him and they leave for Delhi on Friday, SDM Chauri Chaura, Anupam Mishra confirmed. Ram Ganesh a resident of jungle Tinkonia number-3 Vantangia village, expressed his happiness and thanked CM Yogi , “ we were the most forgotten and neglected community in the country and CM Yogi started caring for us around decades ago and as soon as he became chief minister he gave our villages revenue village status. Earlier we were not part of the mainstream and we were deprived of even basic amenities. He started celebrating Diwali with us and for the first time our children tasted toffees, sweets and received gifts and now due to his efforts we are living a good life, our children are studying and I am invited for the Independence Day program.” “ It seems like a dream to us and I am short of words to express my feelings.” He added Van Tangia people are naked truth of years of suppression and exploitation in East Up from Gorakhpur-Kushinagar to Lakhimpur Kheri. Around 99 years before independence British Government started using people for cleaning and developing forests, these people were called Tangia farmers and later a cult of Vantangia was developed.  Tangia farmers were allowed to do farming on 9 ft land between the rows of forest trees. They were not allowed to grow crops of their choice as it was decided by the forest authorities so that the crop of the farmers couldn’t harm the growth of forest plants and doesn’t degrade the quality of fertility of soil. The farmers didn’t have any ownership right over the land and they had only right over their crops. Vantangia people used to cultivate crops inside the forest and were totally dependent on forest for their livelihood. Due to negligence of previous Governments Van Tangia people became homeless and jobless and remained deprived of basic amenities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/vantangia-ram-ganesh-will-be-among-10-special-guests-from-the-state-in-independence-day-program/articleshow/85287401.cms||---

Both Rasoolabad and Daraganj cremation ghats of the city are submerged in flood water since 10 days now, and the pyres are being set up on the concrete road. Moreover, owing to continuous rain and overcast conditions, there is dearth of dry wood for cremation. There is an increase in the number of people resorting to electric crematoriums to perform the last rites. At Rasoolabad and Daraganj cremation ghats, flood water has submerged not only the cremation platforms but has also reached the approach road. The cremation process has been stopped at Kakarhaghat Ghat too which is also filled with water. Local corporator Sahil Arora said that cremation is being done at a higher platform near the ghat. Situation at Kanhaipur ghat is also the same. bodies are being cremated in the premises of a nearby temple. Local corporator Deepak Kushwaha said that on people’s demand, a new site had to be finalised for the cremation. At Daraganj, cremation is being done on the slopes of the Veni dam. Shivsewak Singh, the local corporator, said that electric crematoriums of Shankarghat and Daraganj are unusually crowded as cremation ghats are inundated with flood water. People have to wait for hours at the electric crematoriums to get the cremation done, he added. A sizeable number of wooden logs have become wet because of the incessant rain for the past three days. Even on Thursday, the city was devoid of bright sunshine. Piles of wooden logs have been kept beside the road leading to the ghats. Families bringing the bodies of their loved ones have to wait on the main road as the entire ghat is submerged under the flooded Ganga. “Had it not been the last wish of my mother, I would have performed the last rights at the electric crematorium. But here I am, stranded at this ghat since 9 am and still waiting for my turn as each pyre is taking around four hours owing to the moist wooden logs,” said Yogesh, a local.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/swollen-ganga-and-yamuna-hamper-cremation-at-ghats/articleshow/85287353.cms||---

The levelling work was underway in the Chichauli village near the banks of Sai river for the past few days. Later, the news went viral on social media. This forced the district administration to take note of the incident. “A team for verification will visit the village on Thursday,” said a senior district official. Indra Bahadur Singh and Ramnarayan Singh, residents of Chichauli village, sold their seven bighas of land to Anirudh Verma, an employee in the irrigation department, resident of Dubagga, Lucknow, six months ago. The levelling work has been underway in the fields since the past few days. On Wednesday, the workers with the help of a tractor were levelling the land when they found three ancient swords. The workers became threatened and gave the swords to the supervisor, who later kept the weapons in a four-wheeler and left the place. The news however spread after it went viral on social media. SDM Purwa Rajendra Prasad said, “I tried to gather information in this regard, but failed to get any clue. We have formed a team that will visit the village on Thursday. There is a need for proper excavation at the site.” The swords covered with mud, circulating on social media groups have forced the villagers to connect the war weapons with the 1857 uprising. But, that is more a speculation and these iron weapons need to get authenticated by historians and archaeologists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/three-ancient-swords-found-on-sai-river-bank-in-unnao/articleshow/85255551.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The 63-year-old housewife from the eastern suburbs died of Covid in end-July, and genome sequencing confirmed on Wednesday that she had Delta plus. She has become Maharashtra’s second Delta plus fatality. The state now has 65 cases of the variant, including 11 in the city. “People shouldn’t panic but continue to wear masks and maintain physical distancing. The patient had a lot of co-morbidities and an underlying lung condition,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. Delta+ victim had lung disease, two contacts also +veCivic officials said the Delta-plus victim from the eastern suburbs was detected with Covid on July 21 and passed away on July 27, after three days in ICU. Six of her close contacts were found to be Covid positive. “Sample of the contacts who were found positive were sent for whole genome sequencing. Of those, two came positive for Delta-plus and the results of the others are awaited,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. Her family members are all asymptomatic. The patient was a known case of interstitial lung disease and obstructive airway disease for which she was taking oxygen treatment at home before the Covid infection, said Gomare, adding she had no travel history or that of reinfection. Her initial symptoms were dry cough, loss of taste, body ache and headache. The BMC said she was vaccinated with both doses of Covishield.

The other three female inmates — who alleged they were forced to give sexual favours after threat of punishment or in exchange for drugs — also underwent a medical examination. Dharmendra Rautela, in-charge of Clement Town police station said the scope of investigation would be broadened in light of the medical exam report. “We will speak to other inmates, including those who were there in the past, to find out whether they were subjected to similar treatment,” he said. TOI had earlier reported that a 19-year-old inmate had alleged that at least two former residents at the centre, who hailed from UP’s Saharanpur, were also raped by the manager. Police are investigating this claim. Four inmates — aged between 19 and 26 years — had escaped the centre last week and alleged that the manager, Vidyadutt Raturi, offered them “drugs of their choice” for sexual favours and threatened them with various forms of “punishment” if they refused. Raturi and the centre’s director, Vibha Singh, are in police custody. The centre, which had 17 men and five women staying in separate floors, started functioning in February this year. The facility allegedly had no medical professionals or counsellors. Raturi had spent some time in jail in 2017 after he fled with a woman in Tehri district and a case of kidnapping was lodged against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/medical-report-of-inmate-at-doon-rehab-centre-confirms-rape/articleshow/85281475.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The self-help group runs a Bakery Growth Centre in the city that has posted a turnover of Rs 38.72 lakhs by preparing several bakery products, including multigrain biscuits, in just eight months of its inception. The bakery — promoted under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) — employs 40 women and was the only unit in the state to be selected for communication with the PM based on its performance. During the interaction, PM Modi asked the women how the SHG has helped them financially. To this, Chandramani Das, the main operator of the SHG, told the PM that they prepare finger millet/ragi (madua) biscuits and that the group has, so far, prepared 99,000 packets of millet biscuits to earn a net profit of more than Rs 10 lakh with each member of the group earning Rs 7,500 per month. Meanwhile, the PM hailed the contribution of SHGs in uplifting the economic conditions of women across the country. He said, “The women self-help group movement has gained momentum in the country and there are about 70 lakh such groups that engage about eight crore women.” The conference was also joined by district magistrate Ranjana Rajguru, local BJP legislator Rajkumar Thukral, Rudrapur municipal corporation mayor Rampal Singh and other local officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pm-modi-interacts-with-rudrapur-shg-women-involved-in-making-millet-biscuits/articleshow/85281494.cms||Aakash Ahuja
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man who told girl ‘chal mere saath’ gets 4-year jail||MUMBAI: Observing that winking at a 12-year-old girl, showing her a Rs 100 note and saying “chal mere saath” (come with me) amounted to sexual harassment, a city Pocso court has convicted and sentenced a 28-year-old man to almost four years in jail. Holding the accused, Mohamed Mansuri, guilty, the court said his actions suggested that he “had committed the act with no other reason but sexual intent to commit sexual assault”. Mansuri was arrested in March 2017, and released on bail in January 2018. However, he absconded and was re-arrested in May 2018. He has been in jail since. The court sentenced him to the time he has served. The child’s mother told the court that in March 2017, her daughter came crying and told her about Mansuri. She said on a couple of occasions earlier too, the man had followed the girl and made similar gestures. The mother said she immediately informed her husband and they went looking for Mansuri, whom they found eating ice-cream at a nearby market. She said with the girl pointing at Mansuri, her father caught hold of the man and slapped him. Soon, a mob gathered and beat up Mansuri before he was taken to police station and an FIR was registered. Among the seven witnesses examined by special public prosecutor Veena Shelar were the child, her mother, a teacher to help establish her age and the investigating officer. “Upon evaluating the testimony of the star witnesses—the girl and prosecution witness 2 (her mother)—corroborated by other evidence, the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had stalked the victim on March 6, 2017 and even prior to that,” the court said. “There is no probability brought on record suggesting any previous enmity between the victim and the accused, so as to falsely implicate him. There is nothing in her testimony to suggest that she was tutored in any manner so as to falsely depose against the accused. There is no reason to discard or disbelieve her version,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/man-who-told-girl-chal-mere-saath-gets-4-yr-jail/articleshow/85288240.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Kundra was arrested last month for allegedly producing and distributing porn films through an app. The police said Bhomble’s arrest pertains to the FIR lodged by a model in July in which she claimed that he had played a part in producing porn films for the app controlled by Kundra. The model, who hails from Madhya Pradesh, alleged that Bhomble promised a break in films and forced her to perform “bold scenes”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-director-of-one-of-raj-kundras-firms-arrested/articleshow/85286347.cms||---

Yet, the picturesque Gandikota hasn’t got the recognition it deserves. The scenic place on the banks of Penna river in Kadapa district is not just famous for its natural treasures, but is also known for its man-made structures like the Ranganatha temple and the massive and historic fort on top of the hill that towers over everything else. The structure has managed to retain its originality and visual integrity as per the Unesco norms but isn’t nomination-ready yet. This is due to the encroachments and settlements dotting the fort’s premises. Unesco norms mandate that a structure must first be ‘protected’ before it can get a heritage tag. Gandikota serves as an offbeat tourism spot as one may not find noisy crowds photobombing selfies there or garbage being littered everywhere. It does make for an excellent camping spot with several enthusiasts setting up their tents atop the hill to enjoy the sunset and scenery of Penna river cutting through the Erramala range. Back in 2017, the erstwhile TDP government believed that the village was the easiest choice to secure the state’s first heritage tag from Unesco. “Gandikota is going to get Unesco heritage status within a month,” then marketing minister C Adinarayana Reddy had confidently said on World Tourism Day. The wait continues in 2021. Despite falling under Unesco’s ‘natural heritage’ definition and matching the ‘cultural heritage’ criteria, the announcement didn’t materialise as the government merely prepared a vision document but did not complete the application process nor rehabilitated the settlers near the fort. “Gandikota has the potential to get a heritage tag under the ‘mixed’ category. It has both cultural and natural heritage, and the structure is certainly well-maintained. However, a lot needs to be done to make it nomination-ready,” retired archaeologist Ch Babji Rao says. AP tourism development corporation (APTDC) managing director S Satyanarayana too acknowledged the potential of Gandikota in getting the heritage tag. “We do have plans for it considering the breathtaking view of the gorge and the Penna river it offers. Gandikota isn’t just about the fort. It also houses many other sites like the Ranganatha temple. We are planning to introduce some activities in the region and promote adventure tourism to make it realise its real potential,” he said. Experts feel a lot more geological expeditions need to be conducted in the region to understand its formation. “A lot needs to be done and we will be focusing on Gandikota and several other destinations and bring in the heritage tag they deserve,” Satyanarayana added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-plans-to-renew-efforts-to-get-unesco-tag-for-gandikota/articleshow/85281606.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Chennai||NEET could prove to be Tamil Nadu govt's most troublesome test||CHENNAI: In the first 100 days, the DMK government took two major decisions in education. One is to conduct re-exam for more than 4.25 lakh engineering students who appeared for proctored online test in February. Second, when a majority of parents and teachers wanted the Class XII state board exams to be held, chief minister M K Stalin, however, decided to cancel them based on views of medical experts. The first decision was not based on any logic as Anna University was the only state university in the country to come up with proctored online tests to conduct a semblance of an exam during the pandemic. Instead of helping other state universities to develop such online assessment tools and improve their assessment standard, the state government brought down the standard of Anna University exams to the level of other universities and announced that the re-exam will be unsupervised and only partly online. Academics called the move a regressive one as the job market would be flooded with lakhs of poorly qualified engineers. The second decision had to be taken in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The government had to come up with a weightage system keeping in mind the interest of rural and urban students and gave 50% weightage to Class X board exam marks. It affected the top scoring students as there was little difference between them and others. A majority of students and parents, however, were happy in the end. So, it's a mixed start with one bad decision and one good decision. There are many positives, however, in the approach of the new government. The government appointed a committee headed by justice A K Rajan to study the impact of NEET in medical admissions and another committee headed by justice D Murugesan to study the representation of government school students in professional courses. Now, with schools and colleges set to reopen physical classes, major challenges await the government. They include bringing back school dropouts, preventing child marriages and retaining students in government schools. More than 2 lakh children returned to government and aided schools from private schools. "Surveys conducted by non-governmental organisations show that the students studying in Class IX and above have started working to support their families. Once they start earning, it is difficult to bring them back to school," said Aruna Ratnam, former education specialist with UNICEF. Government colleges and state universities are crippled with faculty shortages and financial crises. At least three of the state universities are on the verge of collapse. Education will be one of the key parameters in which the success or failure of the DMK government will be rated. Steps that are going to be taken in the next few months will not just decide the future of this government, but the future of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/neet-could-prove-to-be-govts-most-troublesome-test/articleshow/85286376.cms||A Ragu Raman

The state has seen a 77% rise in cases registered under the IT Act in just three years. This year alone, UP has had 4,370 cases of cybercrime, data obtained by TOI from the ADG (law and order) office showed. “When I was SSP, crime was of a different nature. Extortion, abductions. That kind of crime has been taken care of. Now, cybercrime is the emerging challenge in the state. Anyone, including our cops, falls victim to it. At present, our staff is not adequately trained to tackle it,” said Goel, who took charge as the DGP on July 1. “But we are working in that direction and training our staff. We are hopeful of controlling cybercrime in the future.”Goel’s statement comes weeks after the Allahabad high court pulled up the state police for “not making serious efforts” in controlling these crimes after money was withdrawn fraudulently from the bank account of a retired high court judge. The court had then asked the Lucknow SP (cyber cell) to tell the court how many cases the state registers in a year. The rise in cybercrime has been steady. In 2018, the state registered 6,565 cases. The following year, it shot up to 10,095 and then to 11,618 by 2020. According to the latest NCRB data, UP has the second highest share of cybercrimes in the country, accounting for over a quarter of all cases. Fraud was the most common motive, going by NCRB data, followed by prank, causing disrepute, extortion and sexual exploitation. And over 4,000 cases from 2018 were still pending investigation in 2019.Just last month, a sub inspector from Shamli was duped by cyber criminals who made off with Rs 1 lakh from her bank account. The money was recovered and the criminals arrested. Around the same time, a cybercrime gang that issued counterfeit receipts to commercial vehicles from a fake transport department website was busted in Agra. On July 24, two men from Mathura were arrested for creating a fake social media account of the UP ADGP Vijay Sakhare and asking for money from those who were added as friends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cybercrime-huge-challenge-but-staff-not-equipped-up-dgp/articleshow/85281554.cms||Sandeep Rai

Senior counsel Anil Sakhare, for the BMC, said that by August 11, the number of those vaccinated at home rose to 1,685. He said the BMC would speed up the process now. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni expressed satisfaction with the Covid-19 vaccination drive by the BMC for bedridden and home-bound elderly citizens and expressed hope that it continues to vaccinate more in the coming days. The HC said other municipal corporation may now follow what the BMC has done. A PIL by advocate Dhruti Kapadia had sought a policy for doorstep jabs to the elderly and home bound, specially abled persons. The state came up with a policy for the special category and a pilot project was launched by BMCon August 1. —Swati Deshpande||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-lauds-bmc-for-vax-jabs-to-over-1300-home-bound/articleshow/85286375.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt issues GR to cut fees by 15%, critics cry ‘eyewash’||MUMBAI: The state government on Thursday issued a government resolution (GR) asking schools to slash fees by 15% in this academic year, a move critics dismissed as an “eyewash” in the absence of legislative changes in the Fee Regulation Act. The BJP dubbed it a move “by a government of education barons”. A similar GR issued on May 8, 2020 was challenged in the Bombay high court by the Unaided Schools Forum and stayed unimplemented. “This year’s GR is an eyewash again and will be challenged in the HC. Another academic year will pass in only fighting for a fee reduction,” said advocate Anubha Sahai, president of the India Wide Parents Association. Last month, the state had considered amending the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fees) Act of 2018. A draft ordinance was placed before the cabinet on July 14. On Wednesday, senior ministers took objection to promulgation of an ordinance. The GR calls for a refund to students who have paid complete fees. It also asks schools not to debar students from online classes for non-payment of fees. But most players in the education sector say the GR is a mere advisory in the absence of amendments to the governing law and has no legal mandate. Unaided Schools Forum secretary S C Kedia said the government has “obviously not read” the SC’s judgement in the Rajasthan case, which was meant to provide a framework for its decision. “It is clear that the state cannot use such a GR for reduction of fees under the Fee Regulation Act,” he said. The government had come out with a similar GR in May 2020 which was initially stayed by Bombay high court. It was vacated in March 2021, but the court reiterated that parents had to pay the fees. A group of 15 parents, however, filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court challenging the HC order. The apex court cited the Rajasthan schools’ judgement and asked the state to reduce fees by 15%. Kedia, however, said the SC judgement will not be applicable for fees of 2021-22. “We will challenge the GR in high court soon. Such a GR will again create chaos and unrest between parents and management,” he added. The GR was also criticised by the BJP which called it a move initiated by “a government of education barons”. It is unlikely that fees will be waived, or “it won’t be surprising if fees are raised and then reduced,” said Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis. Parents’ bodies too said the GR was toothless. Under the rules, any dispute has to be referred to a Divisional Fee Regulatory Committee. “A group of 25% parents are needed to approach the committee. We have been asking for individual parents to be allowed to submit their grievances before the committee,” said Prasad Tulaskar, one of the parents who had approached the SC. He said that only an ordinance can give the state the power to regulate unaided schools fees, “but that will not happen as many of the big schools are owned by politicians”. This is also why the state has delayed financial audits of private schools, alleged parents. BJP MLA Atul Bhatkalkar from Kandivli East said the chief minister must reveal names of ministers who opposed an ordinance or the BJP would reveal the number of schools run by them. “We will continue our agitation against the school fee hike,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-issues-gr-to-cut-fees-by-15-critics-cry-eyewash/articleshow/85288284.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Varanasi||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath inspects Kashi’s flood-affected areas, assures all help to residents||VARANASI: Assuring the flood-affected people that his government is committed to extending all possible help, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday asked the district officials not to let any stone unturned in ensuring the relief required for the people stranded in marooned areas or shifted to safer places. The CM on Thursday afternoon took stock of the flood caused by the Ganga and its tributary Varuna by a NDRF boat, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma and BJP city chief Vidyasagar Rai to know the ground realities of the flood situation, rescue and relief operations. While interacting with the people staying in a flood relief camp at Alia Garden in Saraiyya and also at JP Mehta Inter College flood relief camp, the CM asked about their health condition and arrangements made by the local administration. The CM asked them not to be worried as the government was standing with them to ensure all possible help. He also sought details of the arrangements made for flood-affected people from the officials. The CM distributed relief material including ration kits and vegetable bags among 37 families that have taken shelter at JP Mehta Inter College. On noticing an elderly woman standing in queue for collecting relief material, the CM asked her how she would take the kit as it was heavy. A boy accompanying the elderly woman came forward to carry the kit. After it, the CM also took stock of the shelter created for the cattle and other dairy animals. Earlier, the CM along with UP ministers Neelkanth Tiwari, Ravindra Jaiswal, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal, commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh and district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma boarded the NDRF boat at Rajghat for the inspection of the flood-affected areas. The CM’s fleet of boats entered the tributary Varuna and reached up to Puranapul. Viewing the flood menace in both the rivers, the CM inquired about each and every arrangement made by the administration to rescue the people and relief work done so far. The CM also flagged off teams engaged for carrying out special fogging drives in the flood-hit and adjacent areas. A total of three big and 20 portable machines left for the areas assigned after it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/yogi-reviews-flood-hit-varanasi-in-boat-assures-all-help/articleshow/85288294.cms||---

---||Lucknow||CM unveils Bahuguna’s statue, calls him great as Himalayas||Lucknow: In what can be seen as a bid by the BJP government to claim the legacy of former UP CM Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna, who had parted ways with Congress after the Emergency in 1977, chief minister Yogi Adityanath inaugurated a statue of Bahuguna at Yojana Bhawan on Thursday. With at least two of Bahuguna’s children in BJP now, including Prayagraj MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the move is being seen as BJP’s attempt to reach out to the Brahmins ahead of the UP assembly elections. During the inauguration, Yogi said that it was his idea that Bahuguna’s statue be set up in Lucknow so that people of the state can pay respects to the former CM. “In 2018, when Ritaji inaugurated the centenary celebrations for Bahugunaji, I had said that his personality was as great as the Himalayas but there was no statue of his in the state. It was my suggestion to install this statue at a place where the state’s decisions are taken. Therefore, it has come up at Yojana Bhawan. It could have been inaugurated in 2019 itself but I had told the artist that the design would be cleared by Ritaji and till she was satisfied, this work couldn’t be completed,” the CM said. The event was organised as part of the Chauri Chaura centenary celebrations and the Amrit Festival to mark 75 years of India’s independence. Calling Bahuguna a great son of India, Yogi said that he always stood for the country’s development and strengthening of democracy and had contributed immensely for the country’s freedom. “He provided leadership to the country’s youth during the Quit India Movement. He was born in a small village in Pauri Garhwal but came all the way to Prayagraj for his education. He always worked for the poor, marginalised and backward people and dedicated his life for UP,” he said. The CM also credited him with industrial development around Prayagraj. Thanking the CM for the inauguration, BJP MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi, who till recently was miffed with the party for having inducted a person who was responsible for setting her house on fire when she was in Congress and was instrumental in having him finally expelled, said: “You are managing the floods, Covid and the economy for crores of people and simultaneously keeping our culture alive, remembering the past and also overseeing the construction of a grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Only you can have the capacity for so much because you are a Yogi,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-unveils-bahugunas-statue-calls-him-great-as-himalayas/articleshow/85288314.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Meerut||No land to bury dead, 18 Muslim Banjaras from Uttar Pradesh ‘reconvert’ to Hinduism||SHAMLI: Mohammad Rashid was 13 when his father converted to Islam. The Banjara community at Kandhla, to which he belonged, had always struggled to find land to bury its dead. Locals say conversion to Islam seemed like one possible way out and, about 12 years ago, the community did just that. Over the years, however, land remained scarce. Now, with another promise of land for their dead, at least 18 Banjara Muslims have converted to Hinduism. And the RSS plans on bringing the remaining 200-odd people in the locality “back into the Hindu fold” as well. #Shamli No land to bury dead, 18 #MuslimBanjaras from UP ‘reconvert’ to #Hinduism . On August 4 all of them reconve… https://t.co/YK4VxdJn4i— TOIWestUP (@TOIWestUP) 1628827042000“People at the local temple promised us land for burial,” said Rashid, 25, who is now Vikas Kumar. “I remember how we would celebrate Holi and Diwali when I was a kid. Then, my father, Umar Ahmad, decided to convert to Islam … I can make my own decisions now.” So, on August 4, Rashid and 13 family members reconverted to Hinduism in a “shuddhi” ceremony at the Surajkund temple. That included Rashid’s wife Manju Bano and their four kids. Rashid’s brothers Adil and Deepak also joined, along with their wives and kids (Adil’s two children and Deepak’s one), as did their three sisters and parents. The priest who conducted the rituals, Yashveer Maharaj, said, “We had been visiting them regularly and convinced them to come back to the Hindu fold.” Shamli DM Jasjeet Kaur, however, said that, technically, the conversion is yet to go through. She added, “They wanted a change of names from Muslim to Hindu. Legal formalities related to conversion have not taken place.” Manju Bano, who is now Manju Devi, added, “My husband came across people from the temple. They convinced us to embrace Hinduism. But I am concerned where we will get burial land.” At Rai Zadgan in Kandhla, to which the families belong, all Banjara Muslims are packed into the margins of the mohalla. It’s a wasteland, swampy and grimy, its lanes narrowing the further in one goes. The people are labourers, most of them unlettered. The Banjara community, identified as a Scheduled Tribe in UP, was originally a merchant group that came to be associated with a nomadic lifestyle. Besides many Hindu sects, the Banjaras also have two Muslim sects — Turkia and Mukeri — that date back to at least the 17th century. After Rashid’s family’s “conversion”, the local unit of the RSS has bigger plans. “We will get all 200-odd people at Rai Zadgan to reconvert to Hinduism … We have written to the administration to give them a small piece of land,” said local RSS functionary Rikki Rawat. BJP councillor Deepak Saini wants an even greater intervention: “While we are trying to get them a piece of land, we are also trying to get them to the mainstream. We want them to go the Hindu way and cremate their dead.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/no-land-for-dead-18-muslim-banjaras-reconvert-to-hinduism/articleshow/85281725.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Mumbai||Can’t restrict liberty of thought or deny lawful protection: Bombay HC on IT rules||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday reserved for interim orders two public interest litigations (PILs) challenging the validity of the new digital media ethics code and intermediary guidelines under the Information Technology Rules, 2021, asking the Centre, “How can protection under substantive law be taken away by a delegated legislation?” The order will be passed on Saturday. Rules are delegated legislation or subordinate laws made by the executive, not by Parliament. “You are restricting the liberty of thought... (in the norms of journalistic conduct, it says) one has to be humble, if he is not, does he have to be penalised?” asked the bench of CJ Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, raising other questions to the Centre’s counsel, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who contested a plea for urgent stay of rules. The rules have incorporated what are mere guidelines under the Press Council of India and the Cable TV code and made them mandatory, stepping beyond the rule-making powers under the IT Act, besides breaching the reasonable restrictions permissible under Article 19 (2) of the Constitution, argued senior counsel Darius Khambata for a digital portal. Khambata said the rules are “manifestly unreasonable” and do no good to democracy. The bench too said during the hearing, “The Press Council guidelines are norms of behaviour. How can you put it to such exalted status of mandatory compliance? Let us know if you are restricting it to Article 19 (2) (reasonable restrictions on free speech).” Singh said the main grievance of the petitioners was against government oversight, but added that the proposed inter-departmental committee—which can even block public access to content in emergent cases—under the new IT Rules was not yet notified. But the HC observed, “Fear of rules operating in the manner that rules provide which will clip their wings under Article 19 (1) (a) (fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression) is the petitioner’s case, it will leave a sword of Damocles hanging over their head.” The ASG said public interest be considered since airwaves were not private property. The two PILs, one by Ashish Khetan from a digital portal and another by mediaperson Nikhil Wagle, said the new rules intended to control ‘online content’ and would have a chilling effect on speech.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-on-it-rules-cant-restrict-liberty-of-thought-or-deny-lawful-protection/articleshow/85315757.cms||Swati Deshpande

Recently, the power regulatory commission had turned down UT administration’s plea of implementing the Resco model. The Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (Crest) had moved the JERC for implementing the Resco model in the city. Crest, project's nodal agency, had proposed this model after the approval of UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, as residents were uncomfortable with the initial capital investment. Under the Resco model, the UT had planned that companies will install solar energy plants on private properties and in return, charge the building owner a much lower tariff than the normal electricity rate for about 15 years (or whatever period is agreed in the tender). Thereafter, the house owner will get the plant. The building owner and the private company will sign a deal. The plant will be installed under the net metering mode, whereby a solar energy unit is connected to the building's electricity system and power exported to the grid is adjusted in terms of units imported from the electricity department during a billing cycle. UT generates 45MW solar powerThe ministry of new and renewable energy has enhanced the city’s solar power generation target from 50 megawatt (MW) to 69 MW to be achieved by 2022. To date, the UT has achieved generation of around 45 MW. Deadline not extended after March 31The UT administration had last year extended the solar installation deadline to March 31, 2021, as the lockdown was in force. But it has not been extended further. At that time, the UT administration had also decided not to impose any penalty on residents till the lockdown gets over. The administration, in a notification issued on May 18, 2016, had made installation of rooftop solar power plants mandatory in residential houses measuring 500 sqyd and above and group housing societies. The Resco modelUT to rope in private companies under RESCO model The department will soon launch a website for those interested after the tendering is done Building owner will only have to give permit to the company to use its rooftop for installation of solar plant The capital investment on solar plant will be borne by the company The government will release subsidy to the company The owner will get energy at much lesser tariff as compared to the normal electricity rates For the surplus solar energy transferred to the electricity grid, the UT electricity department will pay the private company at Rs 3.44 per unit The plant will be maintained by the company and after 15 years, it will be the property of the building owner||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-to-file-review-petition-before-jerc-for-applying-resco-model/articleshow/85284201.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The accused allegedly pelted the police party with stones and also damaged three PCR Gypsies. The cops had to call extra force to tackle the situation. Complainant ASI Arvind said around 10.30pm on Wednesday, Sector 16 police post in-charge sub-inspector Sushil Kumar called him and informed about a scuffle near the house of Sumer, alias Smack. ASI Arvind with his team, including head constable Neeraj Kumar, constable Suresh Kumar, special protection officer (SPO) Brijesh, SPO Harvinder, and driver of PCR Gypsy, went to the spot. As there was a drain, they had to park their PCR Gypsy on the road and foot it to the spot through narrow roads. The police party saw around eight persons throwing stones at Sumer’s house from their rooftop and there was a melee. When the policemen asked them to maintain law and order, the accused directed stones towards them and more people gathered at the spot. The accused made the police party run away and they threw stones at the Gypsy, too. ASI Arvind called the police control room and demanded more force. Sector 14 SHO inspector Rajiv Kumar and in-charge of Sector 16 police post SI Sushil Kumar, along with their teams, rushed to the spot around midnight. A damaged vehicleThe accused from both sides gathered and again pelted the police party with stones. Three police vehicles and a few two-wheelers parked in the colony were damaged. When more policemen arrived, both the parties fled the spot. Cops said the accused have been identified as Sumer, his two wives, Radha and Usha, his friends Kulwinder, Sanjay, Sagar, Subhash, Savita and two other persons. Accused from the other group included Sunita, her daughter Khushi, her son Sahil, their friend Sundar, Vicky and three other unknown persons. Rajiv Colony residents tried to nab the accused, but they were carrying blunt weapons and stones. Most of the cops received minor injuries and they were taken to the civil hospital. A case under sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant from his duty) of the IPC was registered at Sector 14 police station in the early hours of Thursday. ASI Arvind, the investigating officer who was the first one to reach the spot, said “We had not expected that the accused would attack the police party and will gather in large number against us.” Panchkula commissioner of police (CP) Saurabh Singh and deputy CP Mohit Handa visited the Sector 16 police post. SHO Rajiv and his team conducted a search operation in the colony on Thursday. The DCP said, “We have rounded up a few suspects. All the nine injured cops have been given medication and they are out of danger.

The former MLA and his associate, Narasimha Rao, were convicted and they were directed by the local court to undergo imprisonment for six months and pay a fine of Rs 10,000 each. During the 2018 assembly election, an election flying squad caught Narasimha Rao while he was distributing cash to voters asking them to cast their vote in favour of Venkateshwarlu. Aswaraopeta police in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district had seized Rs 4,000 cash from Narasimha Rao. Following the seizure, police registered a criminal case and declared Venkateshwarlu and Narasimha Rao as accused. On Thursday, the court convicted the duo under Section 171-e (punishment for bribery) of the IPC. After directing the accused to undergo six months imprisonment, they moved a bail application and the court granted it. They might challenge the verdict in higher court. This is the fourth case wherein the special court awarded imprisonment to a public representative, while in five other cases the public representatives were penalised. Among the three convictions earlier, two cases were pertaining to bribing voters during the election. Mahabubabad MP M Kavitha, who is from TRS, was handed out jail term by the same court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ex-mla-aide-get-6-month-jail-for-bribing-voters/articleshow/85286541.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Senior cop pays fine for auto driver who turned up with son’s piggy bank cash||NAGPUR: Senior police inspector (traffic) Ajay Malviya, in-charge of Sitabuldi traffic zone, doesn’t fit into the usual image of strict, no-nonsense cops. The kind-hearted Malviya could not bear to see an autorickshaw driver paying a Rs2,000 fine using coins from his son’s piggy bank, and paid the amount himself. He also advised the autowallah to stick to traffic rules before letting him go. The traffic police had fined autorickshaw driver Rohit Khadse for parking his vehicle in a no-parking zone at the busy Rani Jhansi Square on August 8. The cops on duty had also discovered that Khadse was a habitual defaulter in violating traffic rules. On August 7, the Sitabuldi traffic police had issued a challan to Khadse for parking his autorickshaw in a no-parking zone and imposed a Rs200 fine. He had not paid fines for earlier challans too, including one issued on December 30, 2020, by Indora traffic zone for driving autorickshaw without uniform and licence. The fine amount was Rs700. The fine amount for the three challans added up to Rs2,000. However, Khadse couldn’t pay the fine and hence traffic cops detained his autorickshaw and parked it at the Sitabuldi traffic zone office premises in Civil Lines. Khadse drives the autorickshaw by paying Rs6,000 monthly rent, and it is the only source of income for his four-member family including wife and two children. Without the autorickshaw, Khadse was staring at a total loss of income. A distraught Khadse was finding it difficult to manage the situation. Just then, his five-year-old son Rehansh approached him with his piggy bank and offered him all the money to pay the fine. “I broke the piggy bank and counted the coins. To my great surprise, it was around Rs2,000,” he said. On August 10, Khadse went to Sitabuldi traffic zone to pay the fine. The traffic office personnel objected to receiving the fine in coins. Khadse then approached Malviya with a plastic carry bag full of coins and expressed his willingness to pay the fine to regain possession of the detained autorickshaw. Malviya was curious why Khadse had brought the fine amount in coins. It was then that Khadse narrated the entire story to the senior cop. The story melted Malviya’s heart and he paid the fine amount from his own pocket, returning the piggy bank money to Rehansh. Before allowing Khadse to leave, Malviya warned him to mend his ways and strictly adhere to traffic rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sr-cop-pays-fine-for-auto-driver-who-turned-up-with-sons-piggy-bank-cash/articleshow/85284250.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Govt unveils online e-pass facility for suburban trains||MUMBAI: The government on Thursday launched an online e-pass facility linked to CoWin to enable those fully vaccinated to travel on suburban trains. The BMC said the ‘Universal Travel Pass’ system allows travellers to obtain an e-pass without physical verification. On the other hand, the off-line system unveiled on Wednesday had more passengers lining up with identity cards and vaccine certificates in order to purchase monthly season tickets. The weblink- https://epassmsdma.mahait.org was initially developed by the state’s Relief and Rehabilitation wing to provide e-passes to those in essential services. Recent procedures to integrate the portal with CoWin were completed in less than three days with the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s consent and the help of MAHA-IT, Maharashtra Knowledge Innovation Society and a few start-ups. Now, it will be available to members of the public provided they are fully vaccinated. “This weblink will be available on all browsers. The e-pass must be saved on a mobile and, on showing it at a ticket window, commuters get a monthly travel pass. So offline verification will not be required,” an official said. Citizens who have completed 14 days after being administered a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine will be eligible for this e-pass facility. “Those who apply will be verified for their immunisation status through this link. No human interaction will be required. Anyone who applies before completion of 14 days after taking the second dose will receive an e-pass only after 14 days,” the official said. An official said the state is also considering using the universal pass for air travel and entry to malls. "The system requires only a photograph, all the other details are linked to CoWin. Once the photograph is uploaded, the verification takes a few minutes and a pass will be generated within 24 hours," said an official. Meanwhile, the off-line Universal Travel pass system continues to receive a steady response. The BMC desks verified 21,718 Covid certificates on Thursday, roughly 3,000 more than the number on Wednesday. The process requires a potential traveller to present her vaccination certificate and photo identity card to the facilitation desk along with a photocopy of the I-card. Once validated, the traveller can purchase a monthly season pass from the railway ticket window. A CR spokesperson said, “Till 6 pm, a total 17,775 season tickets were sold with most being at Dombivli (1,314), followed by Thane (1,042). A WR spokesperson said, “We sold 5,949 season tickets between 7 am and 6 pm.” A senior CR official said, “We expect an increase in issuance of MST (monthly season tickets) as online system has gone live.” (With inputs from Bhavika Jain)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-unveils-online-e-pass-facility-for-suburban-trains/articleshow/85286544.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

KTR had posted photos of the open area situated opposite the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bowenpally on Twitter on Wednesday. Responding to KTR’s tweet, Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) chief executive officer B Ajith Reddy directed the health and sanitation wing officials to lift the garbage from the spot. SCB senior superintendent M Devender who visited the site said that nearly 30 metric tonnes of garbage was lifted. “The five-acre open area belongs to the government but is caught in a legal tangle,” he said. “Though the area falls under the jurisdiction of Secunderabad Cantonment, the garbage was being dumped by residents of areas under Kukatpally circle, which is under the GHMC’s jurisdiction. There is no dustbin in the said area as the premises is a disputed land. However, the SCB workers are cleaning the premises on a regular basis,” M Devender told TOI. Apart from dumping of garbage by the locals of Anjaiah Nagar of GHMC area, waste from commercial units, vegetable markets and construction and demolition (C&D) waste is dumped in the open area. “We had requested the GHMC several times to place a dustbin in Anjaiah Nagar, but our plea fell on deaf ears,” said the SCB official. The SCB officials said that the GHMC must also take up the responsibility of keeping the area clean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ktr-nudge-jolts-officials-into-action-on-illegal-dumping/articleshow/85286537.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||HC notices to 2 collectors on revenue tribunals||Hyderabad: Expressing a sense of anguish over the way the revenue authorities in the districts were defeating the very purpose of establishing the revenue tribunals, Justice P Naveen Rao of the Telangana high court has issued show-cause notices to district collectors of Rangareddy and Nizamabad. He asked them to explain why action should not be initiated against them under the provisions of Contempt of Courts Act for violating the orders of the court. The judge was regularly getting flooded with hundreds of cases that were complaining about the unilateral way their land disputes were resolved without hearing them and without even notifying them before deciding the issues related to their land. The state, it can be recalled, established revenue tribunals to reduce litigation at the regular courts and transferred as many as 16,000 cases pending with various courts to these tribunals. Following complaints from farmers and owners of properties that these tribunals headed by district collectors and additional collectors were adjudicating matters in an unjust manner in the absence of the owners, the high court earlier directed these tribunals to follow principles of natural justice and resolve the cases after notifying and hearing the parties. Despite this direction, the collectors were showing an inclination towards massive resolutions with cryptic orders without assigning any reasons and without giving any opportunity to the claimants. Vexed with the flurry of cases that are coming to the high court with the same set of complaints that the collectors were deciding things without hearing them, Justice Naveen Rao observed that if this is the case then all the 16,000 cases would land up before the high court defeating the very objective behind the establishment of revenue tribunals. The judge said that there were instances where collectors were using the same format order in hundreds of cases by resorting to copy-paste method and without applying their minds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-notices-to-2-collectors-on-revenue-tribunals/articleshow/85286582.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh adviser for review of Citco’s functioning||CHANDIGARH: UT adviser Dharam Pal has decided to comprehensively review the functioning of Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Development Corporation (Citco) for revenue generation. The adviser has also directed the officials to submit a progress report on the initiatives taken by Citco to revive their hospitality section after the first and second waves of coronavirus, which hit the sector badly. Dharam Pal said he has called a meeting of Citco officers to review projects, proposals and financial condition, besides take suggestions on leasing out corporation’s outlets to private players. Having failed to evoke a good response from bidders, Citco recently floated a fresh tender for a party boat at Sukhna Lake. It had planned to introduce the city's first 80-seater party boat. The agency was to provide a new eco-friendly boat with terrace and lighting arrangement for night operation. It will be the responsibility of the agency to keep the boat in running condition at all times. Besides, the corporation did not get response from private players for running multi-cuisine restaurant Magic Wok at Hotel Mountview in Sector 10. Initially, there was no response for Hotel Shivalikview’s discotheque and lounge bar in Sector 17 too. Later, Citco received bids from three firms and in January it shortlisted two. The 4,148-sq-ft discotheque was available on lease for seven years under the formula of design, build, operate, and transfer (DBOT). But due to lockdown and pandemic, things didn’t move forward. Citco runs three big hotels—Mountview in Sector 10, Shivalikview in Sector 17 and Parkview in Sector 24. The administration has decided to lease them out to make them profitable, but the protesting employees saw this as privatisation. Drop In, Baithak leased outCitco has already leased out two restaurants—multi-cuisine Drop In in Sector 34 and Punjabi-style Baithak at Kalagram. The process for outsourcing the Stop-n-Stare eatery at Leisure Valley in Sector 10 is on. Sec 42 lake planThe second wave of coronavirus has put brakes on Citco’s plan to develop Sector 42 lake as a new tourism attraction and an expression of interest (EoI) for amusement activities was also invited.

---||Mumbai||New scrapping policy voluntary, but 20 lakh vehicles may be junked in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Nearly 20 lakh old vehicles in Maharashtra can be scrapped to reduce congestion and pollution once the state comes out with its standard operating procedure in a few days on the vehicle scrapping policy. The policy was nationally launched by PM Modi on Friday. “Although the Centre has launched the policy, the state will have to issue its own guidelines. We have studied the draft policy and issuing the SOP should not take much time,” said state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne. Another official said the state government will implement the central policy, which offers incentives for scrapping. Scrapping will be voluntary for owners. The rules will apply to commercial vehicles over 15 years old and private cars/bikes older than 20 years. One advantage of the policy is it will help tackle the problem of abandoned vehicles, or ‘khataras’. “The local municipal bodies can be the implementing authorities to clear such khataras from the road and send them to government-approved scrapyards. It will help declutter the roads and increase the carriageway,” said Dhakne. A significant volume of vehicular population will go to scrap as there was no such policy before this. “This policy mandates that we scrap old and polluting government vehicles by 2022, heavy vehicles by 2023 and private and commercial vehicles have to be sent to the junkyard by 2024,” the senior transport department official said. Once the state comes out with guidelines, the transport department will authorise setting up of scrapping centres across Maharashtra. Each scrapping centre will be a one-stop solution for phasing out any private or commercial vehicle. The entire process will be digitised, with CCTV cameras filming the scrapping. For example, a private car owner whose vehicle is over 20 years old can just hand over the car to an authorised vehicle scrapping centre, sit back and relax. The scrapping process will be done scientifically, the spare parts can fetch him a price, the oil, coolants and other material which can be polluting will not go back to the environment. During the scrapping process, the chassis number will be taken out before the scrap is sent for recycling. This will expedite the deregistration process. Also, the vehicle data will be uploaded on the Vahan portal and deregistering the car will be completed on the same day. The scrapping centre will remove the car parts and segregate them into rubber, plastic, iron, etc. Owners can get price for tyres, battery, tool kit, CNG cylinders, etc. The final certificate for scrapping/deregistration will be sent to the owner digitally. At present, there is a green tax in Maharashtra for vehicles over 15 years. Once the new scrappage policy is implemented, RTO will conduct stringent checks to ensure people pay green tax and also get fitness certificates for older vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/new-scrapping-policy-voluntary-but-20l-vehicles-may-be-junked-in-state/articleshow/85315797.cms||Somit Sen

---||Hyderabad||Four years on, DNA tests and selfies reunite three sisters in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: In what would appear to be a script of a popular Bollywood potboiler of the 1970s, three siblings who got lost four years ago in Hyderabad were reunited this week, thanks to a chance selfie and a DNA test. Daughters of a knife sharpener of Kukatpaly, Aishwarya (12) Akhila (11) and Asha (7) suddenly found themselves all alone during the summer of 2017 when their father died of a heart attack and their heartbroken mother, a daily wager, disappeared. A few locals chanced upon Aishwarya and Akhila and took them to an orphanage at Ameenpur, while Asha was rescued by her grandmother from the streets. “She used to take Asha to a shrine at Kukatpally for begging and in 2020, she also died. Asha was handed over to local police and they in turn shifted her to the child care institution (CCI) at Yousufguda,” said district welfare officer, Hyderabad, P Akkeshwar Rao. Meanwhile, both Aishwarya and Akhila were shifted to an orphanage run by an NGO called ‘Helping Hands Humanity’ (HHH) at Marredpally in Secunderabad Cantonment as the Ameenpur orphanage shut down for various reasons. Lady luck smiled upon the siblings when a common friend — Sumitra* of Kukatpally, who knew the three sisters, readily identified Asha at Yousufguda CCI and immediately took selfies with her and informed authorities. It didn’t take much time to verify and trace the other two sisters at the Secunderabad orphanage, officials said. Akkeshwar Rao, then got a DNA test conducted on three sisters and reunited the siblings. “We collected samples from the three orphans and conducted DNA tests. For this, we have spent Rs 55,000. And with the blessings of the almighty, all girls are together and safe. Now I am happy,” Rao told TOI. Authorities said they were forced to go for a DNA test because Asha initially failed to recognise her sisters. “But Aishwarya and Akhila identified Asha and hugged her,” said the DWO. When TOI correspondent visited the orphanage, the three girls were eating food from the same plate and seemed cheerful. “I thought that Asha would never come back again. We had lost all hopes,” Aishwarya said, as tears of joy rolled down her cheeks. “My grandmother tried to sell me for money when I was eight years old, but I bit her hand and escaped,” she wept, while narrating. The three sisters aim to become teachers in future. “We will work hard to reach the goal and for now we are regularly having breakfast, lunch and dinner in one plate,” added Asha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-years-on-dna-tests-and-selfies-reunite-three-sisters/articleshow/85288467.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Donor gave my daughter a shot at life’||AHMEDABAD: When a girl was born on Ganesh Chaturthi in 2004 to the Bhatt family in Bharuch, the parents named her Tarjani, meaning the index finger. The parents started worrying about her when she would urinate more than normal. The diagnosis pointed to nephrocalcinosis, a condition where too much calcium is deposited in the kidneys, severely hampering their functioning. “The condition also caused frequent kidney stones, resulting in 15-odd operations. Even after spending Rs 2.5 lakh, her condition kept getting worse. We also got another daughter in 2007, who also was found to have the same disease,” said Apexa Bhatt, her mother. In 2008-09, Tarjani was brought to IKDRC where she was put on hold for a transplant, as the science for pediatric transplants was still nascent at the institute. Meanwhile, she was put on dialysis in 2013 with her condition getting worse. “At the age of 9, she became the first pediatric liver and kidney transplant recipient in 2013 as she got the organs from a brain-dead child in Bhavnagar. She survived. However, our other daughter did not survive even after I donated part of my liver to her,” recounted Bhatt. Today a school student, Tarjani leads an active life, has won laurels for her NCC participation, skating and other activities. “We cannot imagine what would happen to her if we had not found a suitable donor in time. My daughter got another shot at life, all thanks to the family that lost their boy but gifted life to us,” said Bhatt. As August 13 is celebrated as World Organ Donation Day, state-based experts said there are scores of such patients who have got several years to live thanks to often faceless donors who give the gift of life. Experts said that so far in 2021, the state recorded 98 organ donations, which is 89% of 110 organ donations in 2020. Since July 1, the state has recorded the donation of nine kidneys, seven livers, four lungs and one heart. Four cadaver donations were from Ahmedabad, and three from Surat, said State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTTO) officials. Dropadi Gwalani, now 71, had her liver transplant a decade ago due to cirrhosis. “I was a nurse before retirement. The disease was so bad that I was counting my days. I didn’t know how much would I live, but I am here thanks to the organ donors. I still talk about donations as I feel that there are so many misconceptions about the procedure and outcomes,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/donor-gave-my-daughter-a-shot-at-life/articleshow/85284359.cms||Parth Shastri

He said Chandigarh was the first to launch the project on a pan-city basis with deployment of pedal-assisted hybrid e-bicycles too. The project will ultimately be extended to 5,000 bicycles and 617 stations in a year’s time, making it India’s densest and largest PBS. Residents can now go for their daily chores on bicycles and leave their worries of parking their vehicles aside. The advantages of this system are its nominal user charges and ease of locating the nearest docking station through the SmartBike mobile app, he said. Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said the UT, with the launch of the project with 1,250 bicycles and 155 docking stations, has entered the elite category of Indian cities to have their own PBS system. Tracking of garbage collection vehicles The UT administrator, along with UT adviser Dharam Pal, also inaugurated projects under the Smart City mission in Chandigarh, including system for tertiary treated water distribution, system for monitoring of door-to-door waste collection vehicles and online building plan approval system for commercial units, at the Rose Club, Sector 16. The administrator said the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system aims at improving the efficiency of collection, transportation and disposal of municipal solid waste from Chandigarh in a cost-effective and environment-friendly manner. It will help to monitor, track and manage various solid waste management tasks related to door-to-door trash collection through GPS-enabled devices mounted on 642 vehicles. The movement of the vehicles will be monitored by a team at the command and control centre to ensure assigned routes are followed.He said that citizens can register on Clean Chandigarh app to get a notification on their mobiles when the vehicle is about to reach their vicinity. They can also see the route of the waste collection vehicle assigned to their area. In the event of vehicle breakdown, the command centre will get an alert and a replacement vehicle will be assigned to complete the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/badnore-launches-first-phase-of-bicycle-sharing-project/articleshow/85284345.cms||---

Sidhana is accused of allegedly being involved in the violence on January 26 near Red Fort. Additional sessions judge Gagandeep Singh said, “Let the IO file on record the footage on which they are relying, specifically that of a day prior to the incident, when the alleged incitement took place, and play them on the next date of hearing.” The court also directed the IO to file a status report regarding the other accused named in the FIR as being the alleged conspirators and instigators. Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta and advocate Jasdeep Singh Dhillon, who appeared for the accused, told the court that Sidhana had asked the protesters to remain peaceful while exercising their right to protest.

A group of men came up and asked why I was there. I told them Teej was approaching, when women get mehndi applied. They lost their cool, threw away everything I had and said no stall could be set up at the mandi,” Chandra said in his complaint to the police. “While leaving, they threatened to kill me if I set up shop again without their permission. They abused me verbally and physically.”On the basis of his complaint, Saini, along with 10 others, and “20-25 unidentified people”, were booked for voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult to provoke breach of peace, criminal intimidation and mischief causing damage at the New Mandi police station. They have not been arrested yet.SP Vijayvargiya said, “Inquiry is being conducted and action will be taken on the basis of that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/kranti-sena-men-booked-for-drive-to-shut-out-muslim-mehndi-artists/articleshow/85281851.cms||Mohd Dilshad

However, the gun turned out to be a dummy after police took him in custody. The video also appeared to be doctored as it had the sound of a bullet being fired, police said. The video was from a party on Sunday at a local guest house where the rowdy-sheeter, Arif, was found carrying the ‘gun’ in his car. “Arif had bought the dummy weapon from an e-commerce website. We found that the video was edited by unknown person to given an impression that the bullets were fired in the air,” a cop from Nizamabad said. Police have registered a suo-moto case against the rowdy-sheeter Arif and he is still being questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/viral-gun-video-sends-cops-into-a-tizzy/articleshow/85286597.cms||---

Sources privy to the development said a faction of doctors is still not in favour of a truce, but the majority of the doctors across the state accepted the offer of the state government. Resident doctors in Rajkot, Surat, Vadodara, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar resumed duty, whereas in Ahmedabad, senior resident doctors agreed to the proposals. The Junior Doctors Association (JDA) office bearers could not be contacted despite several attempts to know their stance. On Thursday, the state health department issued a GR where they mentioned that the senior residency (SR) years of resident doctors would be considered as part of the bond period in the ratio of 1:1. They will also get deputation at district or sub-district hospitals and would only get stipend for it, sans DA or other perks. ‘The doctors on bond will have to complete the period according to the new arrangements. The arrangement is only for the 2021 batch and won’t serve as a precedent for the future. Senior residency provisions will remain the same,’ the GR states. The GR also revoked the order to doctors to vacate hostels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/resident-doctors-strike-all-barring-a-few-join-duty/articleshow/85284432.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Covid impact? Deaths by suicide on Mumbai's railway tracks rise sharply over 2019||MUMBAI: Deaths by suicide on Mumbai's railway network in the first seven months of this year (33) have exceeded those in the pre-pandemic period of January-July 2019 (21) by 57%. Nine deaths were reported during the same period in 2020 when services were few and entry to station areas was restricted. Mental health experts said the high number of suicides was the impact that the pandemic could have had on people's mental and emotional state. One of the reasons for a high number of suicides occurring on railways is because they are likely to get clubbed as accidents in police reports and this translates into less shame for family members. Overall, 926 fatalities were reported on the railways this year, about 38% higher than in January-July 2020. In the corresponding period in 2019, a total of 1,554 deaths were reported. Illegal track crossing was the biggest killer in all three years. In July, a homemaker from Ulhasnagar jumped to her death before a running train at Asangaon, along with her two-year-old daughter. A police investigation established that she was being harassed by her husband and in-laws who also doubted her fidelity. “Instances of domestic violence increased during the pandemic,” said psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty. “The focus has largely been on Covid-19 and resultant fatalities while the focus on mental health has been much less. The suicide figures are an indicator of a silent mental health epidemic.” Data suggests that more suicides were reported on Central Railway than on Western Railway, and in the fringes of the city. A majority of the deceased (78%) were men. In April, an engineer who had recovered from Covid-19 developed respiratory trouble thereafter, which is said to have pushed him to end his life. CCTV cameras at Dombivai station captured him sitting on the platform for a few minutes before leaping in front of Konark Express. “In the absence of clear CCTV footage or a strong statement from the motorman or eyewitness, it becomes difficult to establish if a death on the railways is suicide or not,” said a police officer. At times, the police or the motorman might report a suicide as an accident so that the deceased's family can seek insurance, particularly if they are not doing well financially. “The pandemic has led to financial ruin, loss of jobs, unemployment, and lack of opportunities, which has triggered feelings of anxiety and depression, helplessness, hopelessness as well as worthlessness. The government needs to involve mental health experts and create a nationwide media campaign to alleviate public distress and offer increased mental health support as part of the National Health Mission. It could involve NGOs and other mental health experts in helping identify people who are at risk by using standardised tools to measure ‘life stress’. This will definitely help in managing an unnecessary loss of life,” said psychologist Narendra Kinger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-impact-deaths-by-suicide-on-rly-tracks-rise-sharply-over-2019/articleshow/85315833.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Delhi||Organ transplant recipients may need third Covid vaccine shot as extra shield||NEW DELHI: Organ transplant recipients may benefit from a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. This has been confirmed by scientists from Canada. The scientists recently conducted a randomised trial wherein 120 organ transplant recipients, who were fully vaccinated, were divided into two groups. No patient had a previous diagnosis of Covid-19. While one group received a third dose of the vaccine, the other received saline. When tests were conducted to check which group had a better immune response — decided primarily by antibody levels greater than 100 U/ml against the spike protein of the virus — the researchers found the response rate was 55% among those who had received the third dose compared to 18% who hadn’t. The study, details of which have been published in New England Journal of Medicine, also found positive outcomes in terms of neutralising antibodies and T-Cell response in patients who had received the third shot. Dr Gagandeep Kang, an eminent virologist, said several studies had shown that the standard two doses of Covid-19 vaccine led to sub-optimal response in immune-compromised patients, including organ transplant recipients. “This study has demonstrated how a third dose may offer additional protection to immune-compromised patients. However, available evidence shows the general population may not require a third dose. Even in the US, UK and other countries, the governments are considering a third dose for the vulnerable population,” added the CMC Vellore professor. Studies suggest that immune-compromised patients act as hosts for mutations of SARS-CoV-2 because of prolonged infection. Public health experts say a third dose may help avoid the emergence of new variants by preventing severe illness and need for hospitalisation. While healthy individuals tend to recover from Covid-19 in 2-3 weeks, there have been multiple instances of immune-compromised patients continuing to be positive for 2-3 months. Dr Rajesh Malhotra, chief of AIIMS Trauma Centre, recently told TOI that they had more than 50 patients with chronic kidney failure who persisted with the virus for more than three months, especially during the first wave. “We had to keep them hospitalised till they turned negative, though they were stable otherwise because there were hardly any centres doing dialysis for Covid-positive patients outside the hospital setting,” he added. Another group of 40 patients, who remained Covid-positive for over a month, had haematological and other types of cancers. “Patients with fungal infection of lungs, those with previous lung disease such as tuberculosis and bronchiectasis, also kept shedding the virus often for more than three months,” said Malhotra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/organ-transplant-recipients-may-need-3rd-covid-vaccine-shot-as-extra-shield/articleshow/85286645.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Delhi||Planning to alter DDA flats in south Delhi? You can now apply for nod online||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has issued a circular specifying an online module for obtaining permission for alterations/additions in DDA flats. These alterations and additions can be done as per policy notified by DDA and the SDMC’s initiative aims at simplifying the process for getting permission under ease of doing business. “To avail the facility, architects will need to fill the common application form online. The compounding charges of the existing structure beyond sanction but within the permissible limit will be calculated by architect on the basis of rate chart for various kinds of alterations provided on the website,” stated the circular issued on Wednesday. Residents, meanwhile, claim that there are thousands of instances of people making illegal extensions, but no action has been taken anywhere. To this, a civic official said: “We were transferred the areas from DDA on ‘as is where is basis’, so it would be really difficult to check the status with the actual plan and take action. We, however, take action on residents’ complaints.” RWAs also wonder what steps are being taken by civic bodies/DDA to repair the common areas in old flats. Sunil Sareen shifted to Gurgaon recently due to poor condition of the DDA flat in Dwarka Sector-19. He said, “We were fed up with daily complaints of seepage. We made several representations to DDA officials, but they always told us that there is no policy for old flats’ maintenance.” A senior SDMC official said that in cases of old flats wherein no maintenance fund had been created and the cost of flat did not include maintenance charges, RWAs should create the funds with contributions from the flat owners for major maintenance work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/planning-to-alter-dda-flats-in-s-delhi-you-can-now-apply-for-nod-online/articleshow/85284451.cms||Vibha Sharma

The caller used a spoof app, which showed that the call had come from the NCP leader’s south Mumbai residence Silver Oak. However, the senior official who received the call got suspicious and alerted the police. A case was registered with Gamdevi police against unknown callers under Indian Penal Code sections of cheating, forgery, punishment for attempting to commit offence, destruction of evidence as well as under the Information Technology Act. Spoofing is the act of disguising a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. Spoofing can apply to emails, phone calls, and websites, or can be more technical, such as a computer spoofing an IP address, address resolution protocol, or domain name system server. The anti-extortion cell of the crime branch, which conducted a parallel investigation based on technical help, traced the caller to Pune. A team, led by inspector Yogesh Chavan, arrested Kiran Kakad (26), Vikas Gurav (57) and Dhiraj Pathare (35). All three were produced before the 37th metropolitan magistrate and were remanded to police custody till August 20. In a related development, Pimpri Chinchwad police in Pune on Thursday booked the three accused for impersonating as Pawar and attempting to extort Rs 5 crore from a realtor from Khed Taluka on August 9. Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said they will take their custody after Mumbai Police completes its probe. A source from Mumbai said: “Gurav can accurately mimic Pawarsaheb’s voice. We are interrogating the other two accused to find out on whose behalf they called Mantralaya and demanded the transfer of a revenue officer. We will also probe whether the officer concerned had told the accused to pull off the stunt.” Mumbai Police said they will probe whether the same set of accused had made similar calls posing as state home minister Dilip Walse Patil from NCP regarding land transactions from Chakan in Pune district on August 9. An FIR was registered at Chakan police station in the matter. In 2014, the property cell of the crime branch had arrested Baramati resident Rahul Gade for allegedly mimicking Sharad Pawar as well his nephew Ajit Pawar, Ramdas Athawale, late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and Gopinath Munde to dupe government job aspirants.

Abhishek Sharma said in his police complaint, “I had gone to Zirakpur for some work. When I was driving towards Derabassi, I pulled over near the flyover around 10pm to relieve myself. I left the keys in the car.”Suddenly, a car stopped in front of his. “Four of its occupants stepped out and two of them tried to sit in my car. When I objected to it, one of them took out a pistol to threaten me. As I continued to protest, he fired two shots—one near my feet and the other flew past my ear,” he added.Abhishek ran for his life and the four sped away with his car towards Delhi. Derabassi DSP Manoj Gorsi said, “We have registered a case and are checking the footage of CCTVs of the toll plaza.” Police doubt claimsPolice said they doubted Abhishek’s claims as he has been changing his statements. “Besides, he has not been able to tell the exact spot from where his car was robbed. Firing of gunshots also seems doubtful as the spot has many buildings and eateries, which remain open till 11:30pm. People living near the spot were questioned and they said they did not hear any gunshots,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/shimla-man-robbed-of-car-at-gunpoint-in-derabassi/articleshow/85284371.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||After triple talaq ban, Muslim women in Telangana face abandonment||HYDERABAD: The Union ministry of minority affairs recently announced that August 1 would be celebrated as the Muslim Women’s Rights Day to mark the passing of the law banning instant triple talaq. But the hype and euphoria may hide a darker truth. The passing of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights of Marriage) Act two years ago has made life even more difficult for women in troubled marriages. Their husbands are simply abandoning them without asking for talaq. In the process, the women are neither able to ask for maintenance nor remarry. Meet Zakira,* whose marital bliss lasted exactly 18 days. Booked for murder, her husband was sent to jail the next morning and the young bride promptly shipped back to her parents’ home in Hyderabad’s Shaheen Nagar. Since then, Zakira -- now with a toddler in tow -- has been awaiting a ‘reunion’. The man, though, has taken a new wife since he was granted bail. For the record, the bail money was raised by Zakira’s family. “We paid Rs 25 lakh for his bail, yet he abandoned me,” the 25-year-old said, the pain of dejection evident through her niqab. “He has bluntly refused to give me a divorce or pay maintenance. In fact, he has threatened to take my son away if I insist on a divorce,” added Zakira, looking for solace in the women around her, sitting crammed inside the Shaheen Women's Resource and Welfare Association, in Sultan Shahi. Each of them has a similar story to narrate. Sultana* was first married off at the age of 14. One child and a forced khula later, her parents found her a second groom. Now Sultana has two children and no husband. “My second husband decided to just walk out one day because he was in love with someone else. I don't even know how to track him down,” she said, confessing how the guilt of living off her parents gets unbearable. “Now, when we try to counsel the men, they tell us to our faces that they will not file for a divorce at any cost, in order to avoid all legalities,” said Jameela Nishat, founder of Shaheen. About 70% of cases that come to her are of women who’ve been abandoned – at times by nationals of other countries – and left to struggle financially. “Though there is a provision to seek allowance from the Waqf Board, the process is long-drawn -- it involves getting an order from the family court that can take up to a year or even more -- and often ends with the women getting nothing,” said Nishat. Read AlsoNow, triple talaq petitioner wins alimony battle, asks women to join fightIn yet another victory for Atiya Sabri, one of the six petitioners in the Supreme Court against instant triple talaq, a family court in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur has directed her estranged husband to give her a monthly maintenance of Rs 21,000 so that she can raise her two daughters.Mohammad Saleem, chairman of the Telangana State Waqf Board, however, maintains that aid is being extended wherever possible. “We are disbursing Rs 5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh every month. So far, 360 such women who have got court orders, have been supported. Depending on the order we pay Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 per month,” he said though admitting to abandonment being the new phenomenon in Muslim society. Islamic scholar, Moulana Abdul Kareem, said that many cases of abandonment are referred to local mosque committees. “In some instances, we succeed in convincing the man to take the woman back. We also dissuade men against divorce,” he said. (*Names of some of the respondents have been changed to protect their identities)30% cases end up with women being deserted:Though there isn’t any official data , religious leaders and officials say that at least 30% of cases that would have ended in divorce earlier, now end up with women being deserted. Hafez Peer Khaleeq Ahmed Saber, general secretary of Jamiat Ulema, Telangana and AP, feels more cases of abandonment are being reported after passage of the legislation. He contests Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi’s claim that the lot of Muslim women has improved, arguing that in absence of data the remarks make no sense. Abandonment only route to avoid jail:In the years after the instant triple talaq was banned, abandonment has become the only route for many men to avoid jail term, say social activists. “It is mostly young women with two and more children who are being abandoned. These women are extremely vulnerable and do not have the means to seek legal recourse as they struggle for day-to-day existence,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari of Helping Hand Foundation that works with many such women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-triple-talaq-ban-muslim-women-face-abandonment/articleshow/85288525.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

---||Kochi||Cardinal George Alencherry should face trial in land deal cases: Kerala HC||KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Thursday dismissed a total of seven petitions filed by Cardinal George Alencherry to quash the cases related to Syro-Malabar Church land-sale row. This means the cardinal would have to face a trial. Dismissing the petitions, Justice P Somarajan also ordered the state government to conduct an enquiry on whether one of the lands sold by the cardinal was originally government land and was encroached. The court issued the directive after noticing that the settlement deed by which the church acquired the property does not reveal how the right over the property was acquired. The court held that the cardinal cannot seek refuge under Canon Law, which is a personal law applicable to the church, to escape liability under general law of the land. “There is clear breach of trust by the petitioner in the execution of sale deeds in favour of various persons,” the court held. That the lands were sold without any public auction or notice to the parishioners at a throw-away price shows criminal conspiracy, the court said. The court also pointed out that money was paid to the bank account of the church only after a police complaint was filed by Joshy Varghese of Pulluvazhy about the land deals. Through the judgment, the court also gave an important ruling that lands and properties held by a church are held under public trust, unless the properties are integral to religious worship. The court also held that a church cannot divert its fund or property for non-religious purpose, such as establishing an educational institution or charitable organization, without complying with Section 92(3) of Civil Procedure Code. As per Section 92(3), a court has to grant permission if the funds or property of a charitable or religious trust is to be used for purposes other than the one it was formed. The court also said the powers of a bishop in an Episcopal church over temporal and spiritual affairs of the church does not include the right to sell property that has the character of a religious endowment. “The ecclesiastical law-Canon law cannot be applied in derogation of the requirement of the general law, when the property held is either in endowment or in trust,” the judgment said. Further, the court said in the judgment that it is unfortunate that no endowment legislation has been passed so far to address the various issues connected with the legal status of church authorities regarding properties held in public trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-dismisses-cardinals-petitions/articleshow/85281980.cms||---

Their petition said their mother lived in a flat in Heliopolis and has a garage in Patropolis in Colaba. In 2017 she found it increasingly difficult to attend to her day-to-day affairs and her condition steadily deteriorated. “Increasingly started to become unaware of her surroundings...losing her memory...having difficulty in recognising family, friends or staff members, refused to eat or take medication…on several occasions had to be stopped from attempting to jump from her 5th floor flat.” The sisters and their brother, who resides abroad, were advised to put her in a care facility for her safety, treatment and care. She was admitted to the facility in February 2019. Their petition said their mother was a successful, independent business woman who primarily banked with Vijaya Bank, Colaba branch, for decades. The manager agreed to release payments for medical, society and other expenses, but they were irregular. With Vijaya Bank’s merger with Bank of Baroda in April 2019, the branch was transferred to the Cuffe Parade branch.The present manager, after verifying her condition, agreed to release payments for medical and personal caregiver expenses and declined for other expenses The petition said their mother has a substantial savings and term deposit accounts, and her average monthly expense is Rs 1.14 lakh per month. She has outstanding dues and liabilities and is incurring “unnecessary interest and penalties.” “She requires constant care and attention in the performance of even the simplest bodily functions,” the petition added.Senior advocate Iqbal Chagla, for the sisters, said that recently, their mother was hospitalised, and the bank didn’t release payment of the bills. The high court judges, in their order, said that before proceeding further, it would be appropriate to have a report from JJ Hospital “on her present status.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jj-hosp-told-to-submit-report-on-84-yr-old-with-dementia/articleshow/85286713.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Mumbai||Parking policy a must, don’t create chaotic situation: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday lamented the absence of a policy for parking vehicles and cautioned that it will be a chaotic situation in future. “Don’t create a chaotic situation in future. There has to be a reduction in cars unless there is guaranteed parking. There has to be a policy,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni. The bench’s comments came while hearing a PIL by Sandeep Thakur for providing adequate parking space in development control regulations (DCR). Thakur said a state-appointed committee had recommended stricter parking norms to be included in the DCR of Navi Mumbai, but the government, while applying uniformed DCR for Mumbai metropolitan region, drastically reduced it for Navi Mumbai. The judges said new planned cities must not become like Mumbai, where there are cars everywhere and no place to walk. “Forty percent roads are taken for parking on both sides,’’ said Justice Kulkarni. He cited the example of the road at the signal leading to Cooperage and Mantralaya that was concretised. “We pass everyday from there. After 3-4 months the work was completed. For what? For parking cars,’’ he added. The judges said crores are spent on concretising roads and its utility is for car parking. Justice Kulkarni referred to parking woes at Crawford Market, saying “there is no place for citizens to walk in the bylanes’’. Justice Kulkarni said, “If we don’t control it now, it will be a difficult path to be left for the future.’’ The judges also wondered what became of the state’s policy to register new vehicles only after showing proof of parking space. They said people cannot be allowed to purchase cars without parking space.“You can permit cars provided there is parking available,” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges asked Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s advocate Sandeep Marne if it has a policy not to allow parking on roads. “At least we thought Navi Mumbai would be sensible,’’ said Justice Kulkarni. Marne said in redevelopment the FSI goes up to 4 and will provide more parking spaces. The judges said NMMC should permit 3-4 level basement parking. Justice Kulkarni said, ‘Pune is permitting 3-level basement parking in a building of 14 storeys. Why can’t you?’’ The matter was adjourned after the state’s advocate sought time to reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/parking-policy-a-must-dont-create-chaotic-situation-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/85288588.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Delhi||Delhi govt to resend file on oxygen deaths probe to LG||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain if oxygen-related deaths took place during the second Covid-19 wave without a probe. In a letter to Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, Sisodia stated that Delhi government was once again sending the file to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to approve the formation of a committee of health experts to probe the deaths. He also urged Mandaviya to inform the LG so that the file was not rejected. “Delhi government is ready to investigate the deaths that occurred due to lack of oxygen. This investigation will be done with full responsibility. After forming the committee of health experts, the deaths will be probed as early as possible and the government will take necessary steps and also inform the central government about the facts,” Sisodia stated. On Wednesday, Mandaviya had tweeted that his ministry had sent a mail to Delhi government on July 26 seeking details of deaths caused due to lack of oxygen, medicines or medical equipment. Sisodia had replied that in the communication received by Delhi government on July 26, the Centre had given time till noon the next day to submit the data, a time-frame of just 12-14 hours. It was never mentioned that the data could be submitted by August 13, he added. “It would be wrong to assume that there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen during the second wave of Covid-19 in Delhi. We have to admit that there have been deaths due to lack of oxygen,” Sisodia said during a digital press conference, adding that more than 25,000 people had died in Delhi till date. The deputy CM alleged that earlier the Centre had adopted a very irresponsible and insensitive attitude and refused to accept that there were any deaths due to lack of oxygen in the country. “If no deaths were caused due to lack of oxygen, were all hospitals that were sending SOS messages lying?” he asked. Sisodia said that after the court’s rebuke, the Centre was now asking for data from state governments. When Delhi government formed a high-level inquiry committee of health experts to investigate the deaths due to lack of oxygen and provide compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the families of the victims, the central government dismissed the committee through the LG, added the deputy CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-resend-file-on-o2-deaths-probe-to-lg/articleshow/85286718.cms||---

The CNG-based cremation incinerator is being constructed by the streetlights department at a cost of Rs 52.17 lakh. Zoo officials said on Thursday that the crematorium – the first of its kind in the state – will be used exclusively for birds and animals of the zoo and that there is no proposal of allowing registered pets to be cremated there for a fixed fee. The proposal was prepared in 2019 and sent to the central zoo authority for which the grants were also received. “This will be an exclusive crematorium for resident animals and birds at the zoo,” said a senior AMC official. Zoo officials said that the smaller animals and birds which died in the zoo were being buried until now, while the bigger animals were being cremated using firewood. “The new crematorium will be exclusively meant for birds and animals of the zoo. There is no proposal to allow other registered pets to be cremated here,” said zoo superintendent R K Sahu, who added that the crematorium is expected to be completed by four to five months. He added that very few bird and animals die every year at the zoo, and the new facility will be useful for the zoo. “This is definitely the first of its kind in the state. There might be only four or five such crematoriums in the country,” Sahu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/zoo-crematorium-to-be-ready-in-5-months/articleshow/85284506.cms||Meghdoot Sharon

She allegedly killed herself after her in-laws stopped her from attending her husband’s last rites, her family has claimed. Arvind Chauhan, 24, had joined the Indian Army in 2017 and was found dead in Rajouri garrison on August 8. The defence ministry has ordered a “court of inquiry” to investigate the circumstances leading to the jawan's death while Jammu and Kashmir police are also investigating the matter. Aarti Chauhan, 22, had married Arvind in 2019 and allegedly killed herself after her in-laws did not allow her to attend the last rites of her husband in his village of Bijori on Tuesday, her family in Dadera village claimed. Kotwali Dehat police station house officer Jagdish Chandra said, “The woman was found hanging from the ceiling fan in her room. No suicide note was recovered. No complaint has been received from the family of the Army jawan or her wife.” Satish Chauhan, uncle of the jawan, said that they still do not know details of Arvind's death. Chauhan had interacted with his elder brother via a WhatsApp video call in the afternoon, hours before his death. A senior police officer on condition of anonymity told TOI, “Arvind had allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself at his duty station. He took the extreme step following domestic strife. His wife wanted to attend the funeral but she was stopped by her in-laws. The couple had a troubled relationship. They had no kids.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/days-after-army-jawans-mysterious-death-wife-kills-self/articleshow/85282004.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Kochi||Income tax department demands Rs 3.42 crore from Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese||KOCHI: The income tax (I-T) department issued a notice on July 6 demanding a remittance of Rs 3.42 crore from Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese as tax after an enquiry into its controversial land deals in 2017-18 found that there was an underreporting of income. The archdiocese has submitted an appeal against the notice to the appellate authority of I-T department, said sources. The notice was issued under Section 156 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. A copy of the 13-page long assessment, order scrutinizing the controversial land deals of the archdiocese, was also served to the archdiocese. The order, also dated July 6, states that the archdiocese itself is a trust established for religious and charitable purposes. “The assessee (Archbishop’s house, Ernakulam) had taken a loan of approximately Rs 58 crores for purchase of land near Matoor, Aluva wherein a medical college was proposed to be established. However, the project didn’t materialize and the interest on Rs 58 crore loan had become a burden on the archdiocese. Hence the assessee decided to sell land owned by it which were located at various locations in Kochi city… The property was sold by developing them through professional real-estate agents who acted as intermediaries. The sale considerations in a number of transactions were accepted in cash and were also not utilized for the objectives of the trust,” stated the order. As per the order, the sale ‘consideration’ was used for purchase of another property. “Full consideration paid for purchase of this property was not disclosed in the books of accounts. The property thus purchased was to be developed and sold for further profit. Another property was also purchased at Munnar, the true value of which was not disclosed in the books of accounts. No clear source of payment has been provided for purchase of the second property. In effect the assessee engaged itself in real estate business. The funds of the archdiocese have not been used for its objectives, that is funds from the accounts of archdiocese have been diverted,” the order stated. The order also states that during the course of investigations evidence indicating suppression of the true value of land sale were recovered. “If you do not pay the amount of tax within the period specified above penalty (which may be as much as the amount of tax in arrear) may be imposed upon you after giving you a reasonable opportunity of being heard in accordance with Section 221,” said the notice. Meanwhile, an official archdiocese source said the appeal was filed within the 30-day allocated window. “The total remittance demanded from us on multiple occasions was over Rs 5 crores. We have paid a portion of it to be eligible to file an appeal. What we have highlighted in the appeal is that the archdiocese was not directly involved in these dealings but was deceived by certain others,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/income-tax-dept-demands-rs-3-42cr-from-archdiocese/articleshow/85282035.cms||---

The woman had alleged that she was paralysed below the waist due to the forced sex. “It is very unfortunate that the young girl suffered from paralysis. However, the applicants cannot be held responsible for the same. Looking into the nature of allegations made against the applicants [husband and in-laws], custodial interrogation is not required,” judge Sanjashree J Gharat said. The woman said she married the man in November 2020. She alleged that after the marriage her husband and in-laws started forbidding her from doing various things. The woman also accused them of taunting and abusing her and demanding money. She said that a month after the wedding, the husband had sex with her against her wish. The woman added that when they went to Mahabaleshwar, the incident happened again. She said that when she became unwell, the doctor diagnosed it to be paralysis. The woman then complained to the police, accusing her husband and his family of cruelty. The accused sought anticipatory bail on grounds that they were “falsely implicated”. They refuted allegations of demanding dowry. While the husband said he had filed a complaint against the woman, two of his family members, also named in the case, said that they were based in Ratnagiri and stayed with the couple for only two days. The woman’s sister-in-law said she was pregnant and ready to co-operate with the investigation. The prosecution objected to their pleas for pre-arrest bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-forcible-sex-with-wife-not-illegal-man-gets-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/85286806.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 90-year-old’s body found in fridge, grandson says had no funeral money||PARKAL (WARANGAL): The body of a 90-year-old man, who had been living with his grandson, was found stuffed in the refrigerator of their rented home in Parkal in Warangal district on Thursday. The body was discovered after a neighbour complained about the foul smell to the house owner who called in the police. The grandson, V Nikhil (26), told police that his grandfather Balaiah had died a few days ago after a prolonged illness and he had kept the body in the fridge as he had no money for the funeral. It was on Balaiah’s pension that the two were surviving as Nikhil was unemployed, police said. Balaiah, a retired government lecturer and a native of Kamareddy, had been bed-ridden due to various ailments since two years. “Balaiah’s wife used to take care of him till she died due to Covid-19 in May. After her death, Balaiah’s health deteriorated,” Parkal ACP Shiva Ramaiah said. Since his retirement, Balaiah had been staying in Parkal with his son, who died two years ago in an accident. His daughter-in-law had passed away over 15 years ago. During the preliminary probe, police found that two days ago neighbours had enquired with Nikhil about the foul smell from his house. “Nikhil lied to them and said it could be from a dead rat. He then shifted Balaiah’s body into the fridge. On Thursday, due to heavy decomposition of the body inside the fridge, neighbours again found a foul smell coming from the house and alerted police,” the ACP said. Doctors who did the postmortem said they did not find any external injuries and the viscera has been preserved for forensic analysis. “We suspect that Balaiah died due to ill health. Nikhil is claiming that he did not inform anyone about the death as he did not have money for the funeral. Balaiah and Nikhil were living on the old man’s pension. We have registered a suspicious death case under CrPC section 174. Based on the viscera analysis report we will take appropriate legal action. No arrests have been made,” the ACP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/grandson-keeps-90-yr-olds-body-in-refrigerator/articleshow/85288596.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

A proposal was passed at a standing committee meeting on Wednesday and the project includes free processing of C&D waste from all designated sites in north Delhi and payment of Rs 5 lakh as rental charges per month for the land to the civic body. The project will begin with processing 500 metric tonnes of waste every day and soon, its minimum capacity can increase up to 2,000 metric tonnes per day. “The project also includes collection and transportation of unclaimed C&D waste from city Sadar Paharganj and Karol Bagh zones for a period of 15 years. The civic agency will pay the transportation charges to the concessionaire at Rs 47 per metric tonne, which can be increased/decreased annually on the basis of wholesale price index,” sated the proposal. AAP councillors have, however, raised an objection. “We are giving a huge site to a private concessionaire and in comparison to market rates, the amount collected as monthly rent is too less. This is leading to financial losses to the civic body,” said AAP councillor from Mukundpur, Ajay Sharma. To this, a senior official said that the monthly rental will be increased annually at 5% irrespective of the quantity of waste received from departments and private parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-allocates-7-acre-plot-to-private-firm-for-cd-waste-processing-facility/articleshow/85284562.cms||Vibha Sharma

Police recovered 475gm gold biscuits worth Rs 24.28 lakh from mastermind Amin Shaikh and his aides, includes a senior citizen, Shashikant Kolwalkar (63), who planned and executed the offence during the one-hour trip, posing as commuters in BEST bus route 440 on July 19. Each member of the gang is assigned a role in the moving bus before one of them escapes with the booty. Shaikh, Kolwalkar, Mahendra More (45), Manoj Medhe (33), Vijaykumar Gupta (38) and accused Manish Darji (34) and Shaitansingh Rajput (38) were remanded to judicial custody on Thursday. Police are searching for four more. All those arrested are college dropouts. “They boarded the bus from different locations after following Madhukar Kavinkar (44) from Dahisar bus-stop. Shaikh snatched the bag of gold while an aide diverted Kavinkar’s attention. They then fled to Rajasthan with the booty after hiring a self-drive cab,” said DCP (zone X) Maheshwar Reddy. Kavinkar, heading to Zaveri Bazar to deliver the order, said, “I was seated when few people who boarded the bus from different stops created a crowd. Suddenly, my bag was stolen. A commuter told me he noticed a person jumping from the moving bus and speed away towards Vile Parle on a bike.” Reddy supervised senior inspector Vijay Belge, assistant inspector Ganesh Pisal, sub-inspector Digamber Pagare and detection staff. “Shaikh and his aides travelled to Rajasthan and later to Jalore district (Ujjain), where they sold the ornaments with the help of Darji and Rajput. With that money they travelled to Indore, before returning to Mumbai. But they were nabbed at Dhule toll naka,” said Belge. “We will get court permission to apply MCOCA against the accused who have dacoity and robbery cases against them here. More has two cases, Medhe was booked in three, Shaikh has nine, Kolwalkar four, Gupta 12, Darji three and there is one case against Rajput. They target people after observing bags and sensing valuables with experience,” said Pisal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-match-200-cctv-grabs-with-database-in-rs-47l-dacoity/articleshow/85288612.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Delhi||2.5 acres of fun... South corpn to run Dwarka adventure park in PPP mode||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation will run the woodland adventure park for children in public-private partnership mode. The children’s park, which is spread over 2.5 acres, is being developed in Dwarka Sector-19. It will be the second such park after a similar GK-1 facility. Bids have been invited to hire a private company for maintenance and operation of the park. The basic development work has been completed at the site, while toy train, rope climbing, rock climbing, tree decks and some other facilities/features will be developed by the private agency. Kamaljeet Sehrawat, former mayor of the south corporation and councillor of Dwarka-B 38-S ward, said that the project was conceived three years back and the municipal corporation had initially decided to develop the park on its own. “We did not have a financial crisis back then. We have completed 40% work on the development of green area and slides. But now, we have decided to rope in a private concessionaire to develop features like mechanical rides, toy trains, etc,” she added. Sehrawat stated that this park would be an advanced version of the Nandan Van park developed in Greater Kailash. “There is currently no park in Delhi with features like toy trains for kids,” she claimed. The work on the adventure park is likely to be completed in six months, the former mayor said. Th park is located right next to Vardhman Mall. The novel coronavirus pandemic has also delayed the work on this park. The overall cost for development of the park was earlier estimated to be Rs 90 lakh. The project to install a toy train with tracks alone was likely to incur costs of around Rs 15 lakh. The train will have five coaches with capacity to take five children in each coach. With Appu Ghar now closed, Nandan Van parks will serve as mini-amusement parks for toddlers and kids. People pay a nominal entry fee at the Nandan Van facility of GK and a similar model will be followed in the Dwarka park too, said an official. The bids for Dwarka’s woodland adventure park will be finalised by August-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-5-acres-of-fun-south-corpn-to-run-dwarka-adventure-park-in-ppp-mode/articleshow/85284618.cms||Paras Singh

The minister expressed his gratitude towards British Association for Physicians of Indian Origin for aiding the centre with its knowledge support and the Sant Nirankari Trust and its volunteers for making the healthcare facility. He said the centre had treated Covid patients with a recovery rate of over 90% and with no deaths. “The facility could be completed in such a quick time because of the selfless efforts of the volunteers and their collaboration with Delhi government,” he said. “Covid-19 has made us use technology more than ever, and this centre is a perfect example of how we are incorporating technology to create knowledge-sharing platforms, especially for healthcare experts, so that the best treatment can be given to the people of Delhi,” he said. “Telemedicine is an emerging trend that we are looking to harness more in the future, and this is a good beginning,” he said. Jain said the government worked on a war footing, bringing various NGOs and voluntary groups close to make these Covid care centres. “Delhi government is committed to making this Covid care centre better. Rest of the centres, too, will be made more effective, efficient and patient-friendly for which it is making all efforts, and this ICU telemedicine centre is a concrete step in that direction,” Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jain-opens-300-bed-icu-facility-at-burari-centre/articleshow/85286837.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh e-tender scam probe hits a wall; reports pending with national agency||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh Economic offences wing (EOW) is caught in a peculiar situation owing to its pending investigation into the mammoth e-tendering scam. Investigation hit a wall as the reports are pending with Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), Delhi. A fresh reminder is being sent to the national agency for support in the matter. Officers say, the Covid lockdown hampered the probe to a large extent. EOW had sent multiple reminders to CERT-In in the past. “It’s a huge amount of data which has to be examined. Unless we get a report from the CERT-in, there can’t be any significant progress in the case” said a senior officer. CERT-In had initially detected breach in 54 more tenders that was sent to it by the probe agency. EOW officials say they are waiting for CERT-In’s official report to act against all those involved. EOW officials had been trying to connect the dots between IT professionals, new private companies, bureaucrats and political leaders believed to be involved in the scam. Names of a former minister and two of his personal secretaries have also cropped up during investigations. A previous report by the computer emergency response team pointed out to the fact that tampering in the e-tendering process was done from the systems used by the private IT company accessing Wi-Fi connections and mobile hotspots, some beyond international borders. Alleged breach in Madhya Pradesh state electronic development corporation (MPSEDC) software had led to the Rs 3,000- crore scam, forcing the government to revoke nine of its major tenders floated in 2018. Investigators believe all tenders issued by MPSEDC since 2013 worth over Rs 80,000 crore have been tampered with. In July, the Supreme Court asked a trial court in Madhya Pradesh to conclude the trial and pronounce the judgment in ‘e-tendering’ scam within 12 months. The apex court dismissed a special leave petition (SPL) bail plea filed by one of the accused, who had been in jail for the last two years. The trial court was directed to conclude the trial and pronounce the judgment within a period of one year from the date of receipt of the copy of the order. On April 11, 2019, a day after registering an FIR into the e-tendering scam against directors of seven private companies and ‘unknown bureaucrats and politicians’, Madhya Pradesh state economic offences wing (EOW) had rounded up three software professionals and raided a company jointly operated by them, for allegedly hacking government portal and ‘modifying contents’. IP addresses of the systems used to breach the e-tendering software of Madhya Pradesh State Electronic Development Corporation (MPSEDC) were allegedly traced to the desktop and mobile phones of the company and its directors. The portal was using encryption keys via internet connections used by this company, say officials. E-tendering is said to be the biggest ever ‘scam’ that the agency has ever investigated. The probe began on the orders of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The then chief secretary BP Singh asked EOW to begin an investigation based on an interim report submitted by former director of MPSED, senior IAS officer Manish Rastogi, after the cancellation of 9 tenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/e-tender-scam-probe-hits-a-wall-reports-pending-with-natl-agency/articleshow/85284595.cms||P Naveen

In the beginning, children were relatively happy with the option of not going to school, examination stress and others. It was like a long holiday. As the disease spread and the pandemic timeline stretched the children started feeling detached, said MD psychiatrist and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Dr Samiksha Sahu. Parents have adapted and found out a way to deal with the pandemic stress. But children are unable to understand and cope with the stress. Lot of them are developing serious anxiety. As children are not able to go to school, they are away from their day-to-day activities, she added. According to experts like consultant psychiatrist, Dr Satyakant Trivedi, excessive crying and annoying behaviour should be taken seriously by parents. Increased sadness or difficulties with concentration and attention is another trigger to understand. There are changes in, or avoiding, activities that children enjoyed in the past, which needs to be understood, he added. Furthermore there can also be unexpected headaches and pain throughout their bodies and changes in eating habits, which need to be understood, especially in adults.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pandemic-to-have-long-lasting-impact-on-kids-mental-health/articleshow/85284615.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi HC slams SDM in interfaith marriage case||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has hauled up a sub-divisional magistrate who prima facie committed contempt of court in a case of inter-faith couple trying to marry under the Special Marriage Act (SMA). The high court was irked that the sub-divisional magistrate sent a notice to the residence of the couple in violation of its order prohibiting any such dispatch. Justice Najmi Waziri, hearing a plea by the inter-faith couple, issued notice to the official and asked him to show cause as to why contempt proceedings should be not initiated against him for obstructing the administration of justice. TimesViewIn many cases, interfaith couples want to keep their marriage a secret from their parents for a variety of reasons. They must feel supported by the system, not harassed or let down by it. The high court has taken the correct stand in this matter.“Issue notice to the respondent to show cause why contempt proceedings be not initiated against him for obstructing the administration of justice and for committing contempt of court,” the court ordered recently. The plea was filed through advocates Utkarsh Singh, Mohammad Tauheed Arshi and Mohammand Humaid. The high court reiterated that whenever a couple desires to get the marriage registered under the SMA, notices are not to be sent to their residences. There is a prohibition on sending such notices which could jeopardise the plans of the applicants or become a cause for a threat to their lives or limb, it further added. It reminded the authorities that the high court had in April 2009 passed an order directing that notices under the SMA be displayed on the office notice board instead of being sent to the homes of the couple and directions to this effect were also issued to all the deputy commissioners by the Delhi government. In the present case, a notice was sent by the sub-divisional magistrate to the residence of one of the applicants in connection with the registration of marriage sought by him and his partner under the SMA. “The aforesaid issuance of notice is in clear breach of this Court’s directions dated 08.04.2009. Prima facie, the court is of the view that the respondent has committed contempt of court,” justice Waziri observed while seeking an explanation from the official. The Delhi high court will next take up this matter for hearing on September 8. In 2009, the high court had cited the threats faced by inter-faith couples and directed all marriage officers not to dispatch notices to the residence of the applicants seeking to get their union registered under the SMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-slams-sdm-in-interfaith-marriage-case/articleshow/85286872.cms||---
---||Dehradun||What’s impeding Chamoli’s project to turn plastic waste into recyclable tiles?||CHAMOLI: In July 2019, the Chamoli municipality, devised a plan to recycle the old plastic. The plastic that is left to decompose on the sides of several tourist spots was to be turned into recyclable tiles that will be used on roads. However, the ambitious project — initiated by the Municipal Corporation, Chamoli, — has run into some complications. Anil Pant, executive officer, Chamoli municipality told TOI, “We used to sell the plastic waste earlier, so, we planned to convert the old plastic into recyclable tiles. We started the work on an experimental basis but where to discharge the chemical-laden water that is generated by the end of the process. Thus, before investing public money in the project, it has to be made sure that it is a feasible and functional process.” The process of converting plastic into recyclable tiles is done in three phases. All the trash is first sorted into old usable plastic and unusable trash, then the old plastic is recycled and put into moulds and finally, shaping is done to make it look like a perfect tile. The idea was to make use of the old plastic generated in the district instead of selling it and contributing to pollution. But, in order to cool the moulded plastic to form tiles, a huge amount of water is required that works as a coolant. This water, by the end of the process, is laden with chemicals, and the Municipality is still trying to figure out how to dispose of this water safely. Discharging the chemical water on the roads or in the rivers is as harmful to the environment as plastic. So, how to dispose of this chemical water so that it does not harm the environment is still a challenge.

On Wednesday, the police and public health authorities from Ichalkaranji carried out a sting operation with the help of a pregnant woman. The accused doctor carried out the sex determination procedure and informed the woman that she is expecting a girl. Baburao Mahamuni, the deputy superintendent of police, said, “The woman was asked to pay for the illegal sex determination and another Rs 25,000 for aborting the girl child. We have detained the doctor and an agent allegedly involved in the racket. We suspect that illegal abortions were being carried out in the hospital. We have collected some equipment, prescriptions and documents. The process to file the FIR is underway. We have asked the health authorities to study the documents and provide medical opinion to proceed further.” In 2009, the doctor was booked for illegal sex determination but he got acquitted by the local court due to lack of evidence. Recently, police started receiving several complaints regarding illegal sex determination being carried out by the hospital. District superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade had ordered an investigation and accordingly the sting operation was carried out. “We took the pregnant woman and her family members in confidence. She was accompanied by members of the Nirbhaya team and health authorities. We are going to investigate the case deeply for which we appeal to the citizens to give us needy inputs regarding the illegal activities taking place in the hospital,” Mahamuni said. In the past month, this the second case of illegal sex determination busted by Kolhapur police. Earlier, a racket was busted by Karveer police and so far 10 people have been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/doc-detained-in-ichalkaranji-for-illegal-sex-determination/articleshow/85286876.cms||---

A priest from Kedarnath shrine, Acharya Santosh Trivedi, wrote a letter, on Wednesday, in blood to PM Narendra Modi demanding immediate scrapping of Char Dham Devasthanam Board. The Char Dham temple priests, who have been protesting against the board since June 12 this year, are blaming the government for "delaying tactics" and not taking any decision on the board's dissolution. This comes after the CM had recently ordered a high-level committee to look into the matter. On Thursday, priests of Kedarnath shrine led by Kedar Sabha chairman Vinod Shukla assembled in front of the Himalayan shrine and raised slogans against the board. Acharya Trivedi who sent the letter to PM said that by setting up of Devasthanam board, the state has shown its stubborn attitude and will have to pay a price for it, adding that "all the priests associated with BJP are now resigning from the party in a phased manner". The protesting priests are blaming the state government for trying to change the tradition rather than improving the facilities for pilgrims on Char Dham Yatra. Priests of Kedarnath shrine claimed that they along with members of their family in the Kedar valley will protest against the board in Rudraprayag on September 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/devasthanam-board-row-char-dham-priests-intensify-stir/articleshow/85282253.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks why no FIR against supplier of ‘inferior’ chikki||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday inquired why no FIR was registered by police against the supplier of “substandard” chikki that was fed to children in anganwadis and primary schools. A bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni pointed out that “your (State’s) officers register offences in (respect of) small violation in pedas and barfis.” “Why not in this case where children are suffering?” they asked. The court heard two PILs filed in 2015, including one by activist Sandeep Ahire, that the chikkis were “infested with gravel, mud particles and granule stones.” Ahire urged action against then women and child development minister Pankaja Munde who had favoured a few suppliers. The judges asked advocate Gauri Godse, assisting the court as amicus curiae, to concentrate on the procedure for procurement right from selection of suppliers till discharge of obligation. “Whether it complied with norms, whether there was illegality in the award of the contract…thereafter we’ll look into the illegality of the supply,’’ said Justice Kulkarni. Godse submitted that “even if the State has relied on 1992 government resolution, still it will be under obligation to show in what manner it was followed to enlist suppliers.” Also, that the GR nowhere says the government should not follow a tender process. She said the petitioner has relied on a 2014 GR to contend that the government has to follow a tender process. “There is nothing on record to show tender procedure was followed while selecting this particular institution,” Godse said of supplier Suryakanta Mahila Audyogik Sahakari Sanstha. The judges then asked the government pleader, Priyabhushan Kakade, if any offence had been registered against the supplier for violations and was told it was not. “Why is no offence registered under the Food Safety Act against the supplier?’’ asked Justice Kulkarni. It was then that the judges said that officers register cases for minor violations. They adjourned the hearing to September 2 while seeking English translations of relevant documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-asks-why-no-fir-against-supplier-of-inferior-chikki/articleshow/85287030.cms||Rosy Sequeira

This is the fourth such incident in two months, leaving 13 children dead. In the latest incident, two girls - aged five and six years - out to attend nature's call, fell into the deep pit and drowned. It occurred at Tharriya village in Shahjahanpur's Mirzapur area. These deep pits are usually left open by local brick kiln owners after collecting clay to prepare bricks. And children find it difficult to detect, especially at night. The earlier cases were reported from Budaun, Sambhal, Baghpat and Roorkee. Locals said that police, in such cases, register FIRs, but no preventive measures have been taken so far. The families of the victims in most cases are labourers and small farmers, and they find it intimidating to file complaints against brick kiln owners. On Wednesday evening, when Ragini and Laxmi didn’t return home, villagers started looking for them. They later found them dead inside the pit near a brick kiln. Mirzapur SHO Maan Singh told TOI, “The girls used to live in the same neighbourhood. Their bodies were handed over to the family after autopsy. The incident was reported from a plot of land which belongs to a brick kiln owner. The girls' parents did not file any written complaint. So, no FIR has been registered yet. A district administration team met the girls' kin and assured them of adequate compensation under the State Disaster Management Act.” Shahjahanpur SSP S Anand said, “We will look into this matter. Action will be taken against the brick kiln owner if any negligence is found.” Earlier, on August 5, three children, all from the same family, drowned in a deep pit near a brick kiln in Sambhal district. On June 23, two boys, 11 and 13, drowned in a similar brick kiln pit in Roorkee. Three more children were found dead in such a pit in Baghpat on May 29. While three kids, aged between seven and 11, fell and died in a large pit dug for illegal sand mining near river Sot in Budaun district on June 2||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/2-more-children-drown-in-brick-kiln-pits-which-are-turning-into-death-traps-for-kids/articleshow/85282306.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Additional sessions judge Charu Aggarwal directed the station house officer (SHO) to file the ATR by September 9. The complainant, who worked as an assistant professor, alleged that the principal and four professors hatched a conspiracy to terminate her from service by forging documents, creating false records, fabricating and giving false evidence and for intentionally insulting, abusing, intimidating her based on caste. The complaint, filed through advocate Mehmood Pracha, claimed that from the beginning, the behaviour of the principal had been casteist, demeaning, discriminatory, threatening towards her, and on August 10, 2020, she was refused rejoining. “Not only has she (principal) slurred the career & assassinated the character of a good teacher at a time when ad hoc teachers are jobless and orders were passed by MHRD not to replace or remove them as they had no scope for fresh recruitment or interviews, which were lulled due to the pandemic, but she has also illegally recourse to misuse of principal’s powers,” it alleged. It also sought registration of an FIR against the erring SHO for dereliction of duty and against DCP, north Delhi, for not taking legal action against the SHO and other erring officials and give directions for penal proceedings against them under sections of the SC/ST Act. The professor added that she still was regularly receiving threats by various anti-social elements on behalf of the accused people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sacked-du-prof-seeks-fir-against-principal-over-casteist-remarks/articleshow/85286985.cms||Usha Das

The drive will also focus on spreading awareness among people about the bad effects of consumption of antidepressant tablets. Additional SP Chandrakant Khandvi of Malegaon said the drive would be undertaken under the guidance of SP Sachin Patil. “While people of the textile town would be educated on the bad effects of such tablets, they would also be sensitized about the importance of bringing such illegal sale of drugs to the notice of police so that immediate action can be taken against such people,” he said. The consumption of such medicines leads to addiction and people generally start with one tablet, but their body slowly gets used to get the tablets. They slowly start increasing the dosage and that can be harmful for the body. In the past too Nashik rural police and FDA have seized huge quantity of such drugs brought to the textile town for illegal sale. “Consumption of such drugs can be stopped through proper awareness among a section of people who are vulnerable to getting addicted to such drugs. Once people realize the bad effects of the drugs, they would not purchase it in the first place even if it is available. On learning the bad effects of the drugs, they would also notify the police if someone is into illegal sale of the drug,” Khandvi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rural-cops-to-start-spl-drive-against-illegal-sale-of-meds/articleshow/85286930.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Instead, he suggested using photos of homemakers or children in advertisements and reiterated his stand against dowry. Khan, who is the chancellor of all universities in the state, was addressing the press after attending the seventh convocation ceremony at Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (Kufos). Meanwhile, all the students who graduated from Kufos on Thursday have submitted their declaration against dowry before accepting the degree certificates. As many as 386 students (290 girls and 96 boys) who completed various undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral courses from the varsity handed over an affidavit stating they would never give or receive dowry. All these declarations were compiled and given to the governor by Kufos vice-chancellor K Riji John before the certificate awarding ceremony began. Fisheries minister Saji Cherian was also present. The governor congratulated the new graduates of the varsity for saying no to dowry. “By signing affirmation against dowry, you stand out as leaders of the campaign against a nefarious practice that robs young men and women of their dignity,” Khan said. The Kufos VC said that the directive to sign affidavits against dowry was given to all students after the governor suggested the same during the vice-chancellors’ conference he convened in Kochi in June. “We have received the minutes of the conference from the Raj Bhavan along with a format of the declaration. All the students signed and submitted their declarations to the varsity and the same has been handed over to the chancellor,” John said. Khan has been urging to take various measures to end the dowry practice and he had even observed a day-long fast at Raj Bhavan to create awareness among the public against dowry system and violence against women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/avoid-using-brides-photos-in-ads-guv/articleshow/85282294.cms||---

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who took along Vivek in his car to the felicitation ceremony at Minto Hall, offered the job to the 21-year-old during the ride. It’s the first time a sportsman is being directly made a DSP in the state. And it came about this way: CM Shivraj: “Mein tumko DSP bana deta hoon (I’ll make you a DSP).” Vivek (puzzled): “Sir, mein DSP ban jaaonga toh kheloonga kaise. (Sir, how will I play then)?” CM (smiles): “Tumko PHQ mein nahee baithna hai, bus khelo. Yeh Pradesh sarkar kee taraf se tumko tohfa hai (You need not sit at the police headquarters. You keep playing. This is a gift from the state government to you).” Recalling the conversation at the felicitation event, Chouhan said: “He wasn’t very enthused when I gave him the job of DSP. I told him he will focus only on his hockey and win medals for the country. Only then did he accept the offer.” Vivek hadn’t even told his family about the job. They were clueless about it until the CM made the announcement.  Vivek dedicates his medal to his parents Rohit and Kamla PrasadThe reception that Vivek got left his family overwhelmed. His father, Rohit Sagar, a school teacher, was moved to tears when the hockey star put the Olympics medal around his neck. He had tried to stop Vivek from playing hockey as a child, wishing him to focus on studies and get a job. The fighter that he is, Vivek has ended up with the best of both worlds — a government job and Olympics glory. “This is the best day for us,” said Vivek’s elder brother Vidya Sagar. Sports minister Yashodhara Raje Scindia, who built the hockey academy where Vivek was trained, received him at the airport. Tears in her eyes, she held the Olympics medal and touched it reverently to her head. “CM Chouhan has motivated every athlete of this state. He has been the biggest motivator for the players. Appointing Vivek as DSP is a great gesture,” said Scindia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/oly-medallist-vivek-gets-dsp-job-rs-1cr-from-shivraj/articleshow/85284751.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Dehradun||Partners of agency accused in Kumbh fake testing scam approach HC, seek protection from arrest||NAINITAL: The two partners of Max Corporate Services, the agency accused in the Kumbh fake Covid testing scam, have approached Uttarakhand high court (HC) seeking protection from arrest. The court heard the case on Tuesday after which the government counsel told the court that he is awaiting instructions in the matter. The court has now listed the case for further hearing on August 20. The petition was filed by Sharat Pant and Mallika Pant, partners at Max Corporate Services. The duo has argued that they had no active role in conducting tests during Kumbh and sought protection from their arrest. The bench of Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe, however, refused to grant them relief and asked the state government counsel to come up with instructions on the matter. The Pants had approached the court in June as well. The court had at the time granted them protection from arbitrary arrest while also directing them to join the investigation. The government last month filed an application in court asking it to recall the protection. On July 21, the court extended the protection by two weeks. The protection has now expired. The SIT conducting the investigation has already questioned them in the case. As reported by TOI earlier, Max Corporate Services had signed an MoU with Hisar-based Nalwa Laboratories, which is also named in the FIR, to conduct testing during Kumbh. Nalwa had roped in another lab, Delphia, to carry out the actual tests.

Experts from a private firm hired by DMC said that teams are conducting manual measurements of the properties, while drones will soon be used for final surveys after clearance from the Dehradun DM. For the use of drones, clearance from authorities like DGCA, ITDA, police and district administration are mandatory. The world bank funded project will not only map the properties but will also take note of the road width and other amenities which will be fed in a dedicated mobile application. The new survey will help to include properties where owners are living in other cities or abroad. The officials from DMC said that this will be the first full survey of residential and commercial properties in the municipal limits of Dehradun. Earlier, satellite images were used as a base map for charging property tax. Dharmesh Penuili, tax superintendent, DMC, told TOI, “This will be the first-ever survey which will include all the properties which come under the purview of property tax. Earlier, a lot of people used to hide the size of their properties to evade paying more tax. However, under the new survey, nothing will remain hidden.” The mapping of properties will also take place in Haridwar, Rudrapur and Haldwani districts of Uttarakhand and will be carried out by the same Noida-based company. Pradeep Verma, from the company carrying out the drone mapping in the state, said, “Once the survey is complete, a month’s time will be given to residents and other commercial property owners for any clarification after which the maintenance will be handed over to DMC for its future use.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dmc-starts-pilot-project-in-kaulagarh-to-conduct-house-tax-surveys-with-drones/articleshow/85282292.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The incident had happened at their home on April 9, 2017. Though the prosecution had alleged that the woman, who had mental illness, was murdered by the accused after she resisted a rape bid, the charges of murder and rape bid could not be proved. The prosecution had alleged that the accused used to sexually abuse his mother while she used to be under sedation after taking medicines for mental illness, the charge could not be proved. Additional public prosecutor C Vasu said that it was the witness statement by the younger brother of the accused that he saw the accused pushing the mother which turned decisive for conviction under culpable homicide.

---||Delhi||Intelligence on IEDs with magnets causes alarm||NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies are learnt to have received specific inputs about Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) having smuggled “magnetic IEDs” to execute a terror strike before Independence Day. An alert accessed by TOI shows IEDs with magnets placed slightly apart. If the device is tilted or mishandled, the magnets will stick to each other, complete the circuit and activate the explosives. “Such consignments have already been delivered to people inside Indian borders for execution of a terrorist action,” the alert reads. Police officers, railway police and paramilitary forces have been advised to exercise extra caution in case they discover suspicious objects over the next one week. The IEDs are estimated to have 2-3kg of explosives and “spring and toggle switch-based pressure mechanism” reportedly prepared under a Pakistan Army officer. Like previous years, Pakistan-based terror outfits are learnt to have escalated efforts to target security establishments and forward posts. They have been vigorously pushing arms and ammunition into the country. Alerts issued by security agencies in the last one week, which were accessed by TOI, unanimously pointed towards aggressive infiltration attempts. One of the inputs stated that around six Lashkar commanders under the leadership Mohammed Sadiq were currently based in Kotil in Pak-occupied Kashmir (POK) and may infiltrate into the country and target security establishments just before August 15. Another input issued on August 9 stated that five Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were camping in Datote in POK along with their guide and had plans to carry out an IED blast near forward locations of security forces. There was also an input of August 8 about four Lashkar terrorists currently camping in Tundwala forest of POK, who could later move to the Kashmir valley. In Delhi, police and other agencies have escalated security arrangements in the wake of these inputs. At Red Fort, a seven-layered security structure would be in place. Apart from the anti-drone system, police have arranged for special safe houses to escort dignitaries to in case of a contingency. Surveillance has been stepped up at nearby markets and vital installations in central Delhi. The routes would be sanitised 24 hours prior to the ceremony. Visitors would be scanned for body temperature and oxygen saturation level. Policemen at the sole entry and exit gate would wear PPEs and there would be an isolation chamber to frisk the reduced number of guests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/intel-on-ieds-with-magnets-causes-alarm/articleshow/85284812.cms||Raj Shekhar

Apart from taking guard for the security alert, cops are also set to tighten their drive against violations of night restrictions. The Kolkata Traffic Police, which has so far prosecuted close to 2 lakh people for being on the roads after 9pm without a valid reason, said they would carry out checks from 11pm from next Monday. “The maximum violations were reported between 9pm and 11pm. So, if we start around 11pm, a drop in the number of violators is likely. But the strictness of the night drive will not change. We will put the maximum number of men on the road till midnight,” said a Lalbazar officer. The city police commissioner, Soumen Mitra, himself did the rounds after 12am on Thursday to take stock of both night curbs and city’s security. Sources said Mitra’s visits started around 2am, when he went to several police stations and nakas to check his force’s preparedness. Among the areas reportedly visited by Mitra were Park Street, Sarat Bose Road, Minto Park, Hazra, Alipore and Taratala. “We might see some overhaul in night patrolling after his visit, especially in carrying out naka checks,” an officer said. Mitra had recently cycled around Maidan early in the morning to take stock of security. Police said manning the night nakas continued to be a tough job, given the rise in the volume of vehicles even after the curbs. “Almost no one can go past checkpoints now. It has three layers, cross-crossing each other. Since last weekend, is we put up many check points on the top of bridges. Also, we chose some popular bylanes, often used by motorists to dodge cops on thoroughfares,” said a police officer. “We are choosing our areas carefully, given the number of violations we noticed at each of these spots in the past three months,” said DC traffic Arijit Sinha. Across the 25 traffic guards, the prosecutions were almost evenly distributed so far. Between 9pm and 10pm, cops on an average check 720 vehicles, of which 420-500 get tickets. Between 10pm and 11pm, another 615 are checked, of which 370 are found to have broken the rules. This number goes down to around 100 by midnight. East, South, Southeast and Ultadanga guards have been seeing high number of violations till midnight, while at Garia, Vidyasagar, Diamond Harbour Road and Beliaghata traffic guards, the number is high after midnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-on-24x7-patrol-duty-for-i-day-security-night-checks/articleshow/85284785.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Jewellery purchases for weddings are usually made on auspicious days and in the run up to the festivals of Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami a significant drop in prices has spread cheer among jewellers. Gold prices have declined by Rs 1,700 per 10g over a 13-day period — down by 3.4% from Rs 50,000 per 10g on July 30 to Rs 48,300 on August 12. The decline was due to a stronger US dollar and optimistic signs from US job data which was recently released, according to analysts.Explaining the demand trend, Manoj Soni, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller said, “The majority of purchases taking place of late are those for weddings scheduled for after Diwali. The reduction in prices is certainly a boon for customers.”According to jewellers, the scale of exchange remains high. At least 50% of gold volumes are purchased in exchange for bullion or jewellery and the remaining is paid for by cash, cheque or other digital payment modes. A weak monsoon in Gujarat has sparked fears of slowing demand from rural areas in the days to come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-price-dips-jewellers-expect-good-festive-season-sales/articleshow/85284808.cms||---

Police said that the woman’s five-year-old son had defecated outside the house of the juvenile accused. A day later, the accused went to attend to nature’s call outside the victim’s residence. The two had a major fight over it on Wednesday night and the woman was attacked with a knife and died. The cops received information about a woman’s murder around midnight. A police team reached the location and found a woman’s body with a slit throat. The woman was identified as Savita Rana. Rana’s five-year-old son was in the area at the time of the attack, while her husband was away. Preliminary investigations revealed that the juvenile was Rana’s neighbour. She ran a small clinic in the area and her house, too, a stone’s throw away. Police also said that the victim and the accused had several fights over defecation in front of houses and some days ago, Rana's son had defecated outside the juvenile’s house. In retaliation, the juvenile had urinated outside the victim’s house. The two had also argued the day before and the victim had threatened legal action against the teenager. A PCR call was also made that day, but both parties compromised and the matter seemed resolved. Later, the juvenile went to speak to the woman, but again an argument ensued and in a fit of rage, he attacked the woman with a kitchen knife. Pranav Tayal, DCP (Rohini) said, “The accused was later apprehended by police. The victim’s son was playing outside the clinic and her husband was away when she was attacked. The juvenile also has previous involvements in criminal cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/open-defecation-juvenile-held-for-stabbing-woman/articleshow/85284813.cms||---

As per the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, the open parking space is part of the common area of a real estate project and provided free of floor space index (FSI). MahaRERA chairman Ajoy Mehta told TOI that the notification was issued last week. “We have been receiving several complaints from citizens regarding parking being allotted on the discretion of the developers. This notification ushers in clarity and transparency between both the developer and the homebuyers, thus, reducing complaints,” he said. The notification, signed by MahaRERA secretary Vasant Prabhu, stated that developers would, henceforth, be required to specifically mark the garage, open and /covered parking space in the real estate projects in accordance with the approved/sanctioned plans and tag it to the allotted apartment. The regulatory body has also directed that the garage/covered parking space when sold/ allotted for monetary consideration, the type, numbers, size as well as the place where such garage/ covered parking space is situated should be mentioned in the sale agreement. It should be annexed to the agreement. Credai vice-president Shantilal Kataria said still the issue of allotting parking space to each flat buyer remained unclear in case of less covered parking space as against the apartments in a project. “There is a request to allow allot open parking, if sanctioned by the local authorities,” he said. Consumer rights activist Shrikant Joshi said the notification would help in keeping a check on errant developers and benefit consumers. Ramesh Prabhu, chairman of the Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association, said the earlier judgments of the SC, HC and even MOFA Act stated that open parking cannot be sold. “During conveyance, the builder has to hand over the open car parking to the society,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/realtors-not-entitled-to-sell-open-parking-maharera/articleshow/85284784.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Addressing farmers at a programme organised at Nashik Panchayat Samiti to promote Raan Bhaji: Vegetables produced by tribal community, the minister said, “Farmers are doing their best in producing legumes, but they are not good in marketing their produce. Hence, a state-level task force is being formed to promote the same.” The state was leading in production of agriculture produce, but farmers lack information in fetching good price and even exporting goods where there are opportunities. “Since farmers in rural areas do not have any access to markets across the country and abroad, the task force will assist them with all the information and procedure needs to be followed for selling their produce,” Bhuse said. The minister also added that the agriculture department would also take steps to provide guidance to the tribal community for selling their produce. “Raan Bhaji as the name suggests is grown in the jungles and contribution of people belonging to the tribal community in conservation of these legumes having medicinal values is incomparable. We have therefore decided to appoint officers who could bridge the gap between the producers and consumers,” he added. On the provision of providing urea to the farmers, Bhuse claimed there is a process in place for efficiently providing urea to the farmers. “We have a buffer stock of urea for the farmers. The system put in place this year ensured that the unscrupulous elements were unable to fiddle with the same,” Bhuse added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-to-form-task-force-to-help-rural-farmers-export-agricultural-products/articleshow/85287037.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Most colleges are run with in-charge principals even though it is mandatory for every college to fill up the post with a regular principal.

He called his fellow fishermen to help him. To their amazement, they found a large adult mugger crocodile entangled in the net. As the reptile struggled to free itself and tried to creep back into the water, two of the fishermen caught it by its tail, dragging it back. But they were no match to its strength and the mugger disappeared into the water. A video of the purported incident has gone viral. According to sources, the incident took place on Wednesday. After watching the video, Bharat Lal, Bareilly’s divisional forest officer, termed the encounter with the mugger as “unbelievable” and “very risky” to come so near it. “The ill treatment of the reptile is an act of cruelty. I have directed the range officer of Aonla to visit the village and collect the details of the people who were seen ill treating an animal protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife (protection) Act.” A villager who witnessed the episode told TOI that mugger sightings are common in monsoon but catching one in a net is rare. He said, “It has happened for the first time that a crocodile got stuck in our net and most of us didn’t know what to do but we did not want to risk going close to it. Surprisingly, two men caught its tail and attempted to drag it out of the river.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/2-men-drag-struggling-croc-caught-in-fishing-net-by-its-tail-in-bareilly/articleshow/85282446.cms||---

Of an estimated 45,000 new cases of cancer detected each year in Telangana, lung cancer accounts for about 5000-6000 patients. In all, lung cancer currently accounts for 15% of cancer cases found in the state. Smoking and alcohol are the commonest causes of it, say doctors. While lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality among men in Hyderabad as per previous studies, the incidence is also growing among urban women due to rise in smoking habits. Also, the survival rate is just around 15%, which is mostly due to delayed screening and misdiagnosis of lung cancer in the initial stages. A previous study of lung cancer patients done at a private tertiary care centre in Hyderabad (Study name: Clinicopathological profile of lung cancer at a tertiary care centre) found that 49.1% of the patients in the study (out of total 466 lung cancer patients) were between the age group of 40–60. This indicated that rise in smoking and exposure to carcinogens was effecting the younger generation more rapidly in the city, the study said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lung-cancer-accounts-for-15-of-cases-in-t/articleshow/85285929.cms||---

After the suicide, rumours started circulating on social media speculating that the death was due to blackmailing from fraudsters, who secretly recorded a nude video of the victim during a private chat. According to Langar Houz police, the victim was an unemployed graduate from Laxmi Nagar and his father a businessman. On Thursday morning, family members found it suspicious as he did not come out of the room till 7.30 am. “His bedroom door was latched from inside and as the victim did not respond to his family members’ calls, they broke the door latch and found him hanging from the ceiling fan,” Langar Houz inspector K Srinivas said. Police said that during the preliminary verification of the victim’s phone records, they had noticed that he had browsed porn content, but there was no indication that he was blackmailed. “There are indications that he received messages from unknown persons inviting him for a personal chat. The victim also may have seen some obscene content over the phone, but there are no messages or videos indicating that he was blackmailed by someone referring to his nude videos,” the inspector said. There was no suicide note and a suspicious death case was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/24-year-old-ends-life-blackmail-suspected/articleshow/85285950.cms||---

Head constable Ajay Kharade and five others had moved MAT after the Pune police transferred 1,289 policemen on September 19 last year. The petitioners of the rank of constable, police naik, head constable and assistant sub-inspector had contended that their tenure with the respective police stations and the crime branch was for five years. They claimed that their mid-term transfer by the commissionerate was in gross violation of the Section 22 N (2) of the Maharashtra Police Act (MPA). The petitioners’ lawyer Punam Mahajan pleaded to quash the transfer order because it was not in accordance with the provisions of the act. K S Gaikwad, representing the state, argued that the policemen were transferred on Police Establishment Board recommendations. After hearing both the sides, MAT member A P Kurhekar in the August 6 order observed that the “the impugned orders are in blatant violation of the law and are liable to be set aside.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mat-quashes-mid-term-transfer-of-6-pune-cops/articleshow/85284848.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Rapid spike in stage-4 lung cancer cases in Hyderabad, say doctors||HYDERABAD: Cases of advanced stage lung cancer have seen a significant rise over the last six months, according to doctors in the city. While some corporate hospitals have reported a 30 per cent rise in the number of stage-four lung cancer cases, the biggest government-run tertiary care in the state — MNJ Institute of Oncology and Cancer Research — has witnessed a 20 per cent jump in cases. Individual doctors have also reported a rise 15 to 20 per cent rise in stage-four lung cancer cases which have progressed rapidly from earlier stages due to delayed or no medical attention sought during the course of the pandemic. “There is a gradual increase in presentation with majority of the cases coming in delayed stages. Unlike earlier, when slightly advanced cases could be managed with medication, majority of the cases now have to be put on palliative chemotherapy,” said MNJ Institute of Oncology and Cancer Research director Dr N Jayalatha, adding that the death rate in such cases had also gone up significantly. She also informed that since lung cancer patients are immunocompromised, they tend to experience more complicated Covid-19 infection too. Doctors said that advanced metastatic presentations have seen a rise due to patients being unable to seek timely help due to fear of infection as well as various logistical problems during the pandemic. “Before March-April this year, there was very little oncology practice happening due to the pandemic but now we are seeing a lot of people coming with advanced stage lung cancers as well as other cancers. I have seen 40 per cent of the cases in the last two months present with advanced stage. Covid-19 has done collateral damage to cancer patients,” said Dr Chinnababu Sunkavalli, surgical oncologist at Apollo Hospitals. While stage-one lung cancer is completely curable, stage-four lung cancer could reduce a patient’s expected survival to less than a year. “Lung cancers double in size in a short span of three to six months. Delaying medical care for that long a period complicates the condition and the risk increases manifold because prognosis of stage-four lung cancers is still not great,” said Dr Tapaswi Krishna P, consultant pulmonologist at Gleneagles Global Hospitals. Dr Tapaswi Krishna informed that it is crucial for patients to seek timely medical intervention to arrest progression of lung cancer or even ensure it is cured at an early stage. “It is to be noted that tumour size and spread of cancer cells is the biggest cause of death among those suffering from lung cancers,” the doctor said, adding that a near-50 per cent rise in stage-four lung cancer cases seen at the hospital’s cancer centre has been a cause of concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rapid-spike-in-stage-4-lung-cancer-cases-in-city-docs/articleshow/85285899.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad cops, officials rely on DNA test to put all doubts to rest||HYDERABAD: DNA profiling has slowly become the key tool in reuniting people missing for long with their families. Also, for officials responsible for locating families, a DNA match puts all doubts to rest. There have been quite a few cases in the state too of people, especially missing children, being united with their parents after a DNA match. In February 2021, Cyberabad Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (ATHU) found the family of a girl 15 years after she went missing at Mecca masjid while on pilgrimage with her parents to the city. The girl was living at a children’s home in Miyapur and police had traced her family in Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh. But before she was handed over, the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) insisted on DNA mapping. Only after the test confirmed that police had found the right family, she was sent home along with her parents. Similarly, when there’s a mix-up of infants at government hospitals, doctors turn to DNA test to ensure the respective babies are given to the right parents. “Since the DNA test scientifically proves relationship, it is the best method to resolve any confusion,” an official of Cyberabad ATHU told TOI. Last month when the child welfare department and Hyderabad police rescued nearly 100 children found begging on roads, the officials first did a DNA test before handing them over to parents. This helped officials cut out traffickers hoping to lay their hands on the children by falsely claiming to be their parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-officials-rely-on-dna-test-to-put-all-doubts-to-rest/articleshow/85285983.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Hyderabad||Added costs of indirect routes concern students as Canada extends flight ban||Hyderabad: The Canadian government’s decision to extend the ban on direct flights from India till September 21 due to rising Covid-19 cases has come as a big blow to students who now have to shell out huge amounts to reach their destination. The ban on direct flights from India was first imposed on April 22 and has been extended for the fifth time. The August 9 order will now mean students have to travel via different routes to Canada which can result in a rapid escalation of costs. Many are exploring options to travel through places such as Belgrade, Cairo, Abu Dhabi, Male, and Doha in order to be able to pass the Canadian borders. Tickets for these indirect routes are two to three times more expensive than those for direct flights. For instance, flight tickets from Hyderabad to Toronto in mid-September — when most students are likely to travel — cost anywhere between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh, depending on the route. “Usually, a direct flight to Canada would not cost more than Rs 1 lakh. But now, since it is a connecting flight, the prices are sky-high, making travel an extremely costly affair for students like me,” said Ashish Patnaik, who has secured admission for masters’ in global business administration at the Humber Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning in Toronto. Adding to the students’ worry is the testing and accommodation guidelines in transit countries which may burn more holes in their pockets. “Some connecting flights from destinations such as Albania are after 24 to 48 hours. In such a situation, we have to look for an accommodation for which we have to get an RT-PCR done. This will only increase our expenses,” said C Varsha, a student. Many students and parents have taken to social media expressing their dissatisfaction over this move. “...Can we request Canadian government to accept our RTPCR test. It’s such a struggle to find flights for our children traveling to Canada for studies. For the sake of parents and students, can’t we have a better solution,” tweeted Sunder Vaidyanathan, tagging the Canadian embassy and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/added-costs-of-indirect-routes-concern-students-as-canada-extends-flight-ban/articleshow/85286049.cms||Preeti Biswas

She said in a press conference that more than five lakh traders participated in a signature campaign launched by the AAP against rising trade and factory licence fees. AAP has demanded that the east and south corporations should also withdraw their decision of increasing licence fees. The party has demanded that shopkeepers and traders who have deposited the hiked fee should be given their money back. Atishi claimed that AAP’s opposition also forced the municipality to withdraw its proposal of giving weekly bazaars to private contractors. She said that AAP’s protest on behalf of Delhi’s people, traders and street vendors had been successful. She said the licence fee of category A and B licences was increased from Rs 500 to Rs 8,625, and the licence fee of category C and D licences was increased from Rs 500 per metre to Rs 5,750 per metre. “I don’t think that we have ever seen such a big increase in the licence fees meant for factories and shopkeepers in the past few years,” the AAP functionary said. People of Delhi have made up their mind to throw BJP out of MCD and bring in AAP, she claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pressure-from-aap-forced-rollback-of-licence-fee-hike/articleshow/85284873.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Band-o-bust! A business goes out of tune||NEW DELHI: Dilshad Ali has been playing the euphonium for over 15 years at weddings in Delhi and neighbouring areas. This year, he has only got to play the brass instrument at five weddings. With celebratory events turning into small, intimate affairs due to the Covid-19 imperatives, business for wedding bands has been off-key. A fourth-generation euphonium player, 38-year-old Ali said, “Playing an instrument at weddings is seasonal work and Covid has shown how precarious an income source it can be.” Ali, a native of UP’s Rampur, who does some farming in the non-wedding period, said he was close to penury this year. Ali’s band mate, Anas Ahmad, is now learning how to repair electronic devices after being a drum player for around 14 years. “In the off-season, I sell vegetables and other items to support my family of seven. Drumming up tunes at functions is my main income source, but there is hardly any demand now because of scaled-down events,” said Ahmad, 32. The bands aren’t getting bookings for non-wedding functions either. Nawab Jaan, 62, band master of Shiv Mohan Band, last played for a week in July. “I was hoping to get to play at temples and religious events, but there are no takers for bands,” said an exasperated Jaan. The new wedding season begins in November, but bookings are tepid with people anticipating a third Covid wave. Sanjay Sharma, owner of Master Band and secretary of Delhi State Band Association, said, “There were very few ‘shubh’ days in January and February and the bookings we got for March and April were cancelled due to the second wave of Covid. The bands managed only a few days of work in July.” He was optimistic that if the expected resurgence in infections didn’t occur, business could be good in November. Most bands have lowered their rates to lure customers. Piyush Sharma, owner of Hari Om Band, said, “There are enquiries, but people are reluctant to finalise anything. We have assured clients that if the third wave hits social functions, we will refund the advance they pay us.” He added that band players were finding it tough to make ends meet and with the younger generation not motivated to join, there could be shortage of music players within five years. The reduced demand for band bajas has also hit the ‘ghodi’ (mare) providers. Veeru Sindhi of Sindhi Hiranand Godhiwale claimed to have sold 10 horses in the past year. “It’s not possible to spend Rs 700 daily to maintain a horse when there is no income,” he said. Only a few big players have remained afloat. Jea Band, performing since 1936, already has some bookings for the coming matrimony season. Band owners Anil Thadani and Karishma Thadani said they had to introduce new ways to attract customers, including coming out with Victoria buggies and innovative illumination. “We are also creating our own fusion tunes with a mixture of Marathi, Gujarati and Bengali,” said Anil. Jea Band welcomed the Olympic medal winners at IGI Airport on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/band-o-bust-a-business-goes-out-of-tune/articleshow/85284900.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

But luck ran out even before they could be allotted the houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY). A massive scam unearthed in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), allegedly masterminded by two staffers, has revealed that names of 382 beneficiaries of PMAY had been replaced by those of some other people. The duo - Pramod Vasava, an executive engineer and Nishith Pithva, a software expert - are accused of clandestinely changing names of the beneficiaries and uploading a fraudulent list on the civic body’s website. The beneficiaries were selected in a computer draw organized on August 7 as part of the completion of five years of the Vijay Rupani government. The draw was done to allot 382 housing units at the event held at Sir Sayajirao Nagargruh.  Based on a complaint lodged by city engineer Shailesh Mistry, an offence of criminal breach of trust by public servant and forgery was lodged at Navapura police station againt them and cops picked up the duo for questioning. However, investigation was handed over to the detection of crime branch (DCB) on Thursday evening, looking at the seriousness of the scam. The scam came to light when the beneficiaries, who were allotted houses in the draw done by minister Yogesh Patel found that their names were missing from the list on the website. When Pithva was asked by Mistry about the anomalies in the names that were selected during the event and the list of the events, he spilled the beans. Pithva gave a written statement that he was asked by Vasava not to publish the selected beneficiaries’ list if the names shared by him on mobile phone were not selected. Pithwa was asked to run the computer draw programme again and prepare a new list. Pithwa said that he did as told and Vasava, who is in the affordable housing department, certified the new list which was later uploaded on the website. VMC officials had also became suspicious as the list was not pasted on the allotted houses as per the procedure and was directly uploaded on the website. In his complaint to police, Mistry stated that besides Pithva’s statement, the difference was also highlighted by comparing the fraudulent list with the original one which was prepared immediately after the draw at the event. The video recording of the event also revealed the differences. When Vasava was asked by media persons on Thursday about the scam, he refuted the allegations and said that Mistry was in-charge of the event, while Pithva said that he only did whatever he was told by his superiors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/housing-scam-hits-vmc-names-of-382-beneficiaries-changed/articleshow/85283693.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||2 Nanded patients defeat Delta Plus variant in home-isolation||Aurangabad: Contrary to the fears associated with the Delta Plus variant, it has come to fore that two Covid-19 patients from Nanded who were infected with such a variant could easily defeat the virus by remaining in home-isolation, health authorities said on Thursday. Notably, one of the two patients, a 38-year-old female from rural parts of Loha taluka was not even vaccinated before sourcing the infection on July 2 while the other 18-year old female dental student, who tested positive on June 24, had received only one dose of the vaccine. Nanded district surveillance officer Dr Shivshakti Pawar on Thursday said both the patients are hale and hearty at present. “We have traced the history of close contacts of both the patients and none of the relatives, friends or acquaintances of both patients have reported any health complaints so far. Even if both the patients witnessed uneventful recovery, we should be collectively watchful about the Delta Plus variant,” he said, adding that the variant has been officially considered as the ‘Variant of Concern’ due to the increased transmissibility and the stronger binding to receptors of lung cells. Nanded district, which is the geographically largest districts in Marathwada having 17 talukas, has a relatively better contained spread of Covid-19 in the region with only 57 active cases by Wednesday. Earlier, Aurangabad and Beed have reported a single case each of Delta Plus variant, taking total number of such cases in Marathwada to four till Thursday. As part of the state-level exercise, the random samples of Covid-19 positive patients from aforesaid three districts of Marathwada were sent for carrying out the genome sequencing to the National Institute of Virology, National Centre for Cell Science and CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, health authorities said. The total detected cases of Delta Plus variant has reached up to 65 in Maharashtra by Wednesday. Jalgaon district has the highest 13 such cases, followed by Ratnagiri (12), Mumbai (11), Thane, Pune (both 6), Palghar (3), Nanded, Gondia, Raigad (each 2) and Chandrapur, Akola, Sindhudurga, Sangli, Nandurbar, Aurangabad, Beed and Kolhapur (each one), said an official release issued by the state public health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-nanded-patients-defeat-delta-plus-variant-in-home-isolation/articleshow/85280104.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Sponge roads to suck water faster’||AHMEDABAD: Our uncontrolled development and construction activities, without respecting the city’s contours, have led many parts of Ahmedabad — more than 55 spots — vulnerable to severe waterlogging during extreme rain events. A new experiment to use porous concrete or sponge was done at Nirma University. The experiment was published in the Elsevier Journal recently and shared by the roads and building department engineers at Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). “The porous nature of the previous concrete pavement (PCP) acts as a drainage pipe and the water accumulated on the road or pavements drains out immediately,” claims the study carried out by Nirma University’s civil engineering department. Within the Nirma University campus a small PCP stretch of 3mx10m as constructed and curated for 28 days. A percolation well was also constructed alongside this porous pavement. “In case of the porous pavement properties of pervious concrete (PC) such as void ratio, compressive strength, permeability and density was evaluated,” claim Tejas Joshi and Urmil Dave of Institute of Technology, Nirma University. Once the site was prepared, researchers tested the efficacy of porous pavement by first pouring 5,000 litres and then 10,000 litre of water on the site. The water filtered through the surface within 10 minutes. Researchers found that 40% to 45% of water could be collected from the pavement in the percolation well, constructed on the side of the porous pavement. The method of construction involved first digging 0.6 metre below surface and then laying a 0.15m layer of 40mm coarse aggregate. On top of this was laid a perforated pipe system with a slight incline to collect storm water to a nearby percolation well. The pipe system was then topped with another layer of 40mm coarse aggregate , then another layer of 0.15m of 20mm coarse aggregate was laid and levelled. Once the level was achieved the porous concrete was poured and levelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sponge-roads-to-suck-water-faster/articleshow/85284953.cms||---

The villagers have alleged discrimination against the village by the authorities and claimed that other similarly situated people in the nearby villages have been given the relief. In a public interest litigation (PIL) filed through advocate Bhaumik Dholariya, Ambardi residents have listed names of 79 families whose properties were damaged. They claimed that the government has not given them the compensation according to the resolution issued for extending help to the cyclone-affected. The petitioners have stated that a team of four members had undertaken the survey of the damage in the village, but the engineer, without consulting other members of the team, arbitrarily assessed that very little damage was caused to the houses, cattle sheds etc. with a view to depriving the people from the relief. “The petitioners are sorry to state that the government machinery, while implementing the scheme targeted the villagers who belong to lower strata of society and especially persons belonging to the Scheduled Caste and they have been totally deprived of the relief,” the petition reads. This PIL is likely to come up for the haring in near future. Last month, the HC sought an explanation from the state authorities over a PIL that alleged discrimination against members of the SC communities in granting compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ambardi-villagers-move-hc-for-cyclone-relief/articleshow/85284920.cms||---

The civil construction of the Priority Section had commenced on November 15 in 2019 and the casting of the very first pier of the corridor near IIT was completed on the night of December 31, 2019. Also, all the 624 U-girders of the Priority Corridor have been cast in the Lakhanpur Casting Yard. Out of these, 571 U-girders have already been erected on site. Metro stations have also taken shape and appear to be ready from the outside. However, from the inside, the construction work is going on at a rapid pace. If everything goes as per the plan, people may get a chance to ride in Kanpur Metro in early next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/85-civil-works-completed-in-metro-priority-corridor/articleshow/85287209.cms||Abhinav Malhotra
---||Aurangabad||RTE admissions done after ‘lapsed’ deadline||Aurangabad: Around seven admissions under RTE Act 2009 have been allegedly carried out in Aurangabad post the stipulated deadline of July 31, prompting educational activists to demand an official inquiry. Armed with official records, educational activist Prashant Sathe suspected that these admissions were performed in lieu of money. “These admissions have taken place at two leading schools in Aurangabad. While no such admission has taken place across Maharashtra post the deadline of July 31, it remains suspicious that how could these seven admissions were carried out,” he said. Sathe, in his memorandum submitted to the state government, has demanded a thorough probe into admissions in question. “Any backdoor entry in the name of admissions under RTE Act is a matter of grave concern. Such an illegal and unethical practice encroach upon the rights of genuine beneficiaries,” he said. When contacted, education officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Ramnath Thore said the admissions in question were legal. “The education department has extended the deadline for admissions post July 31,” he added, skirting further queries. Educational activists, however, refused to buy an argument made by Thore. “There was neither official announcement on the official website for RTE admissions nor any order was issued by the government declaring extension to the July 31 deadline. The education officer must produce proof in support of his statement,” Sathe said. Total 603 schools from Aurangabad had participated in admission process under RTE Act 2009 for academic year 2021-22, declaring collective intake capacity of 3,625 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rte-admissions-done-after-lapsed-deadline/articleshow/85280176.cms||---

Uniformity is the need of the hour,” Nilesh Bhansali, director, Travel Agents Association of Pune, told TOI.Pune-based Arun Sinha, who planned to take his family to Jaipur on a 10-day holiday later this month, has cut short the trip to four days. “I don’t want to be in a situation where the Rajasthan government suddenly changes the regulations. The states need to change rules for fully vaccinated travellers,” Sinha said. While the Union tourism ministry is pushing states to do away with the negative RT-PCR report for the fully vaccinated, many states continue with the requirement.Yashwant Kumar, managing director of the Chhattisgarh Tourism Board, said tourism will not be affected by the state mandating a negative RT-PCR report. Kapil Jain, president of the Chhattisgarh Travel Trade Association, disagreed. “People think twice before coming to the state. What is the point of being fully vaccinated if one has needs an RT-PCR report?” he said.Jeevan Vyas, who owns a travel agency in Pune, said two of his clients wanted to cancel their trips to the northeast scheduled for August.

He was later handed over to police which said that the allegation of conversion against him appeared to be unfounded. Police have booked 12 persons for rioting on the complaint of the victim, Afsar. Police swung into action after the video clip of the incident showing the man's little daughter crying and trying to cling on to him and begging for mercy from a group of assaulters, went viral on social media on Thursday. The video footage also shows a few men in the mob shouting 'Jai Shri Ram' after assaulting Afsar. Police said that Afsar is a relative of one of the three youths accused of molesting their neighbour's daughter recently. An FIR was also lodged against them at the Barra police station in this regard. The police stated that the girl's family had also made allegations of conversion against Afsar's relative and demanded to add a section pertaining to 'forceful conversion' in the FIR. Later, they had also met a local representative and demanded him to instruct the police to lodge a case against the alleged molester in this regard. Police, however, said, "Investigation with regard to conversion is still continuing and action would be initiated only on the basis of evidence." However, pursuing the same case, a group of local activists on Wednesday evening had assembled at the Ram Gopal Chauraha in Barra area, indulging in religious sloganeering and demanding to book the molester on charges of conversion. Later, on seeing the alleged molester's relative Afsar passing by along with his minor daughter, they dragged him and beat him up mercilessly. The video of the incident was shot by some passers-by, who later made it viral on social media. DCP South, Raveena Tyagi, said that a case of rioting against a local person who runs a marriage band, his son and around 10 unknown people, based on Afsar's complaint had been lodged at Barra police station. She also mentioned that the families of Afsar relative and his neighbour were also involved in a property dispute. "We have seen the video. Based on a complaint by Afsar, we have filed an FIR under relevant sections of the IPC and are in the process of identifying the assaulters. Further investigations are underway," said Tyagi further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-man-assaulted-in-frontof-minor-daughter-for-conversion/articleshow/85287235.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Civic officials inspected 118 police stations and malkhanas, out of which mosquito breeding was found at 62 due to collection of rainwater. SDMC has issued notices in 58 cases and a challan has been issued in one case to the caretaker. A department official said the most common sites for mosquito breeding at police stations were seized vehicles, office furniture, coolers and flower pots. “Mosquito breeding was destroyed on the spot using insecticides and police personnel were educated about preventing water stagnation,” the official added. “All these police stations have been advised by department officials to take anti-mosquito measures on the premises.” Some of the police stations where breeding was detected were Sector 12-RK Puram, Mehrauli, Fatehpur/Jonapur and Ghitorni, Ambedkar Nagar, Jamia Nagar, Sector 9 and 23-Dwarka, and Raghubir Nagar. The zone-wise distribution of the data generated during the special drive shows that maximum mosquito breeding was observed in police stations under Central zone, where 25 stations were checked and breeding was found in 28 containers. Some police stations had multiple sites/containers with mosquito larvae. Under the same zone, 15 of the 23 inspected malkhanas also had mosquito breeding while 12 out of the 87 houses checked in the police colony had conducive conditions. In West zone, five out of the 19 inspected police stations had mosquito breeding and legal notices have been issued in two cases. Some violators under Najafgarh zone included police stations in Sector 23-Dwarka, Baba Haridas Nagar and Najafgarh. Notices have been issued to all of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-detects-mosquito-breeding-in-more-than-50-police-stations/articleshow/85287261.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||SC stays HC order granting two-week furlough to Sai||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed a Gujarat high court order granting two-week furlough to rape convict Narayan Sai, son of self-styled godman Asaram Bapu who is also undergoing life term for another rape case in Rajasthan. The apex court said however that it needs to examine whether rules allow the annual furlough as per calendar year or from 12 months after the last one was granted to a prisoner.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah issued a notice to Sai on Gujarat government's plea challenging the high court's single-judge order and stayed it till further orders.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Gujarat government, said the single-judge order of June 24, 2021, granted furlough to Sai for two weeks but the division bench had stayed it till August 13 and therefore the state has moved the top court challenging the June 24 order.“The idea of furlough is that a prisoner gets away from the environment of jail and is able to meet his family members,” the bench said, and asked Mehta what are grievances with the order. Mehta replied that under the rules and even in a judgement of this court, it has been held that furlough is not an absolute right and it depends on various factors. He said Sai and his father were arrested for offences under rape charges and they wield considerable influence with money and muscle power. Mehta said that last year Sai was granted furlough for two weeks as he wanted to visit his ailing mother and it was purely on humanitarian grounds that the state government did not find it appropriate to challenge that order. “Whether once every year means once every calendar year or once every year means since the last time he got furlough. This is the point we need to examine. We are issuing notice to the respondent (Narayan Sai),” the bench said. It asked the counsel appearing for Sai to file his reply within a week and posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.On April 26, 2019, Sai was convicted under the Indian Penal Code sections 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offences), 323 (assault), 506-2 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (conspiracy) by a Surat court and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Key sources close to the development said, Covid-19 cases in the state have come down to below 100 and in the coming months, it appears as if the situation will remain under control. “The state government is planning to organise Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit which was postponed this year due to the pandemic. To start soft marketing for the event and to build a momentum for the January 2022 event, the CM is planning to take part in Dubai World Expo starting from October 1, 2021.

Of them, a majority of 51,901 are civil while 9,501 are criminal cases, both of which are pending over the years.The RTI reply filed by HC administration’s deputy registrar Dhyaneshwar More added that in the year of Covid pandemic, from April 1, 2020 to July 20, 2021, about 11,242 cases were filed in the Nagpur bench and 6,546 are disposed of. As per a senior official from HC registry, the 61,000 cases also included a number of civil and criminal applications filed in the same petition, but actual pendency is less if those are considered as single case. Like in Covid PIL, over 20 applications were filed by various intervenors, but ideally it should have been taken as one pending case, the official said. Due to the pandemic and a series of lockdowns, the filing of new cases was severely affected. Even the hearing was affected, as the courts had allowed only urgent matters to avoid crowding inside the premises. The online hearing made the matters more complicated, as many were unable to use the system initially last year, as per the lawyers. The reply filed in response to queries asked by veteran RTI activist Abhay Kolarkar however didn’t mention the number of days the court was closed and on how many days it was working in virtual mode.In another reply regarding the number of cases pending till November 11 last year before the second wave, the registrar, also the public information officer, added that 61,753 cases were pending at that time. Of them, 50,370 were civil and 11,383 were criminal. Of them, there were 52,869 cases which were pending for over a year, 21,214 over five years and 9,158 over ten years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-61k-pending-cases-in-hc-nagpur-bench-rti-query/articleshow/85282707.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Digital payments for retail, e-commerce sales grew 260% during second wave||Pune: Digital transactions found favour with roadside fruit sellers and local bakeries during the lockdown-like restrictions in 2021 as against a similar period last year. A comparative analysis between the lockdown phases in 2020 and 2021, explored in a report released by a fintech company, reported that there has been a 52% increase in digital transactions in India since May 2021. Digital transactions for retail and e-commerce increased by 260% during the second wave of the pandemic with big and small traders accepting the new-age mode of payments. Rajas Parchure, director of Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, said, “The online transition for payments has been a very good development. The pandemic has been a trigger for the increase in users of these online payment modes as people were stuck at home and did not want to visit banks or ATMs, and shopkeepers preferred not to accept cash as they feared it could spread Covid.” In December 2020, there were 207 banks available on UPI with a monthly volume of 2,334.16 million transactions. By May 2021, the platform gained 100 million monthly active users in India with the goal of bringing the number up to 500 million by 2025. Fruit seller from Vimannagar Zakir Shaikh said, “It is easier for customers to pay small amounts online. Nowadays, hardly anyone pays in cash.” A Camp-based bakery, which wouldn’t accept digital payments earlier, has now set the system in place. “It is a safer option as there is no contact involved,” an employee said. “After the first wave, when the labour staff came back to work, I helped set up their bank accounts, so salaries could be transferred digitally,” said the owner of a restaurant chain. Hemang Dattani, head of data intelligence at a fintech company, said, “Given that the lockdown was staggered and geographically restricted, the growth of digital payments has been steady, especially for retail, logistics and pharma.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/digital-payments-for-retail-e-commerce-sales-grew-260-during-second-wave/articleshow/85285003.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

They might control fever but cause severe platelet depletion,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. He also appealed people not to go for remedies like papaya leaf juice and goat milk, as they may cause vomiting and lead to low BP.Doctors are also insisting on better containment measures to control dengue spread. When asked about it, NMC officials said they have been doing their job well.“Zone-wise survey of mosquito breeding spots is underway across the city. On August 12, our teams surveyed 9,266 houses in city. Out of them, 365 houses had breeding spots,” said an official. NMC teams also found 102 patients with high grade fever, collected blood samples of 193 people and sent them for tests.As far as dengue deaths are concerned, the treating doctors have claimed that they are losing many lives due to dengue. However, death audit committee of the district administration meets every two or three months, to decide whether a death was really due to dengue or not.“Tehsil health officials conduct initial audit in case of any suspected death due to dengue. They submit all related documents and patient’s history to district health authorities. A final review is taken by the state death audit committee, after which we will get final death toll due to dengue,” said a senior official.

Police said Ankuksh Khadse (30) of Chinchwad and Vishnu Chitte (31) of Rahatani had bludgeoned the victim to death on January 24, 2017, at Rahatni. The duo had found only Rs200 with the victim. Khadse, in a drunken state, recently told a man about his involvement in the murder. “The person was an informant of police constable Nitin Gengje, attached to the Wakad police. A police team, led by senior inspector Vivek Mugalikar, laid a trap to take Khadse into custody,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. He said that during questioning, Khadse admitted that he and his friend Chitte had killed one person. “On January 24, 2017, the suspects had consumed liquor at Pimpri. The victim, who was already drunk, demanded liquor from them. After the man got completely drunk, the duo decided to rob him,” the commissioner said. He said that they took him to Rahatani and tried to rob him. “The man, however, resisted. Following which they bludgeoned him to death. They found only Rs200 with him,” Krishna Prakash said. After the news of Khadse’s arrest spread, his accomplice, Chitte, fled his house in Rahatani. “Our team found him at Alandi and arrested him,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-held-for-murder-4-yrs-ago/articleshow/85285031.cms||---
---||Delhi||E-health card for all Delhiites: Cloud-based info management system by early next year||NEW DELHI: Delhi government’s ambitious cloud-based Health Information Management System (HIMS) is going to be implemented by early next year. The massive project would see every Delhiite get an e-health card and have their medical history available online when they see a doctor after taking an appointment from home. The process of vendor selection and bidding process has been completed and work is going on a war-footing to streamline the project and place it before the cabinet. After reviewing the progress of the project along with health minister Satyandar Jain, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal instructed officials to expedite the process. “Delhi government is committed to providing the best and most modern healthcare facilities to people. We want people to access world-class facilities without any problems. HIMS is a monumental step in this direction, so we must be extremely serious towards its implementation and expedite the timeline,” he added. The progress of a helpline and e-health cards was also reviewed by Kejriwal. The government said vendor selection for the helpline would be completed soon and call centres were targeted to be set up in the next three months. A committee of the e-health card project had outlined and reviewed the request for proposal. After HIMS is implemented, Delhiites would be able to take an online appointment and consult the designated doctor within a fixed time-frame. Plans are afoot to distribute the e-health cards through a door-to-door campaign, apart from providing them at hospitals and other dedicated centres. The card would contain the medical history of patients and they would be able to get treated at any hospital on the HIMS system without the need of carrying medical reports and documents. The QR code-based cards would be issued on the basis of voter ID and population registry, from which demographic and basic clinical information of each patient would be obtained. Family mapping would be done for health schemes and programmes and integrated with HIMS for seamless information exchange. While HIMS would be implemented in all government hospitals initially, private hospitals would also be connected to it in a phased manner. All patient care services, like hospital administration, budgeting and planning, supply chain management and back-end services and processes would be brought under this system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/e-health-card-for-all-delhiites-cloud-based-info-management-system-by-early-next-year/articleshow/85285064.cms||---

When she moved a plea against the accused witchdoctor Imtiyaz Shaikh before police, his three brothers thrashed her husband, she alleged in her FIR. She stated in the FIR that as she did not have a child after eight years of her marriage life, she was seeking various remedies to become a mother. On advice of her friends, she went to Imtiyaz asking for some help so that she could conceive. “On August 7, Imtiyaz came to my house and I told him that I could not become a mother. Having heard this, he straightaway told me that I would have to have sex with some other man to bear a child,” she alleged in the FIR. She alleged, “He further told me to come with him to a hotel to have sex so that I would become the mother of a child.” The woman told her family members about the indecent demands of the accused and they approached cops and gave an application to file a complaint against him. But police did not take action against him. Then his three brothers rushed to the complainant’s house and began abusing her. When her husband intervened, they thrashed him badly. After this, she called up police and filed a complaint of sexual harassment, causing hurt and criminal intimidation against the witchdoctor and three others with Vejalpur police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/witch-doctor-asks-childless-woman-to-have-sex-with-him/articleshow/85285035.cms||---

Three families of martyrs had approached chief minister Vijay Rupani last year, with a request to designate a public square or an area where citizens can pay their respects to those who laid their lives for the country. Land for the purpose will be reclaimed right of the eastern banks of river in the second phase of the project. An area more than 1 lakh square feet has been tentatively earmarked for the martyr’s park. “We had requested the Gujarat government to have a memorial built in memory of our brave martyrs from Gujarat on the Sabarmati Riverfront. I thank the Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani for accepting that request,” said Jagdish Soni, father of martyr Captain Nilesh Soni of the 62nd Regiment, Indian Army.

---||Delhi||Schools of Specialised Excellence open for admissions, 50% of seats for govt students||New Delhi: Admission to Delhi government’s Schools of Specialised Excellence (SoSE) is open to all students who are residents of Delhi. However, 50% of the seats are reserved for students of Delhi government schools. The admission process started on Thursday and the last date for registration is August 19. The existing Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas and Schools of Excellence are being converted to SoSE, 20 of them at the moment before the former two are eventually phased out altogether. Admission to the four streams offered by the 20 schools will be based on entrance exams to be conducted between August 23 and 29. Students will be notified about the details later. The forms can be filled online at www.edudel.nic.in. The minimum qualifying mark in the general category is 60% in Class VIII for admission to Class IX and 75% aggregate in the best of five subjects for entry to Class XI. Apart from the 50% seats reserved for Delhi government school students, the students belonging to SC/ST/OBC and Children with Special Needs will have the benefit of 5% relaxation in eligibility marks for admission. Eight schools will offer science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), five humanities, two performing and visual arts and four will offer high-end 21st century skills. Apart from STEM education, all the other courses offered will, this year, only be taken up in Class IX. These 20 schools will follow the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme. In the first two years of the STEM stream, students will build an academic foundation in languages, natural sciences, mathematics, social sciences and personality, perspective and citizenship. In IX and XII, students will continue to study language, but in addition they will engage in an interdisciplinary exploration of the natural and social environment through environmental studies. Students will specialise in the sciences with either mathematics or biology or both if they opt to. In humanities, students will be allowed to choose from a range of specialised subjects according to their interest. They may choose from history, economics, political science, psychology, geography and sociology as additional subjects. They will also study languages with an added emphasis on literature and application of language in research. In the visual and performing arts curriculum for classes IX and X, apart from the foundational learning of subjects as in the other streams, students will be exposed to the primary form of an art of their choice. They will also have the flexibility to explore other areas of the arts through modular courses. In the first year, music (vocal and instrumental), theatre and visual arts will be on offer. While students opting for the high-end 21st century skills programme will get a similar foundation learning in the first two years, they will also be exposed to specialised skills through short taster courses. Specialised learning will be offered in the areas of digital media and design, electro-mechanical production, finance and accounting, food production, culinary arts, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/schools-of-specialised-excellence-open-for-admissions-50-of-seats-for-govt-students/articleshow/85285019.cms||Shradha Chettri

This is the fourth such incident in two months, leaving 13 children dead. In the latest incident, two girls - aged five and six years - out to attend nature's call, fell into the deep pit and drowned. It occurred at Tharriya village in Shahjahanpur's Mirzapur area. These deep pits are usually left open by local brick kiln owners after collecting clay to prepare bricks. And children find it difficult to detect, especially at night. The earlier cases were reported from Budaun, Sambhal, Baghpat and Roorkee. Locals said that police, in such cases, register FIRs, but no preventive measures have been taken so far. The families of the victims in most cases are labourers and small farmers, and they find it intimidating to file complaints against brick kiln owners. On Wednesday evening, when Ragini and Laxmi didn’t return home, villagers started looking for them. They later found them dead inside the pit near a brick kiln. Mirzapur SHO Maan Singh told TOI, “The girls used to live in the same neighbourhood. Their bodies were handed over to the family after autopsy. The incident was reported from a plot of land which belongs to a brick kiln owner. The girls' parents did not file any written complaint. So, no FIR has been registered yet. A district administration team met the girls' kin and assured them of adequate compensation under the State Disaster Management Act.” Shahjahanpur SSP S Anand said, “We will look into this matter. Action will be taken against the brick kiln owner if any negligence is found.” Earlier, on August 5, three children, all from the same family, drowned in a deep pit near a brick kiln in Sambhal district. On June 23, two boys, 11 and 13, drowned in a similar brick kiln pit in Roorkee. Three more children were found dead in such a pit in Baghpat on May 29. While three kids, aged between seven and 11, fell and died in a large pit dug for illegal sand mining near river Sot in Budaun district on June 2||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/2-more-children-drown-in-brick-kiln-pit-which-are-turning-into-death-traps-for-kids/articleshow/85282728.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The case was adjourned by six weeks.In his petition, the petitioner stated that more than 60% of the Catholic population in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry are dalits, however, they are facing discrimination. Though the Catholic hierarchy speaks about promotion of dalit equality, the same is not being followed. The foremost thing which could be done to promote such equality is to consecrate dalits as bishops, he said. The petitioner stated that out of 170 bishops in the country, there are only 11 dalit bishops. Similarly, in Tamil Nadu only one dalit bishop is appointed out of the total 18 dioceses. Though various dalit organisations have urged to increase the number of dalit bishop appointments in the state and country, no steps were taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-stop-prejudice-in-selecting-dalit-bishops/articleshow/85285051.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Man deprives wife of sex, thrashes her||AHMEDABAD: A 28-year-old Shahibaugh resident has accused her husband of depriving her of sex for around two years after he was involved in an extramarital affair. She also accused him of thrashing her often. Filing a complaint with Madhavpura police on Wednesday, the complainant said she got married in 2011. She told police that her husband, who hails from Dahod, was married twice earlier. The complainant, who is the daughter of a policeman, said in her FIR that her relation with her husband was fine till he had an affair with another woman in 2019. “He stopped loving me and did not have any physical relationship with me. When I sought my right to have physical relations with him, he abused and thrashed me,” she said in the FIR. She alleged that her husband stopped giving her money for household expenditure as he used to spend it on his girlfriend. She claimed that his girlfriend used to call her and demand that she leave her husband. She alleged in the FIR that her husband’s girlfriend threatened to kill her if she did not do so. When she raised this issue before her in-laws, they allegedly blamed her for her husband’s behaviour and asked her to leave him. She returned to her father’s place in July following which family and community members tried to convince her husband for a reconciliation. However, he did not pay any heed to their pleadings and she finally approached the police and filed a complaint of domestic violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-deprives-wife-of-sex-thrashes-her/articleshow/85285057.cms||---

In his petition, the petitioner stated that though the legal profession is considered as a noble profession, several people without any basic qualifications are getting themselves enrolled as advocates cheating the courts as well as the people. This practice is prevalent across the country, despite the effective steps taken by the Bar Council of India and Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to weed out such people from practising as advocates.Referring to a few cases, the petitioner stated that people who apply for law courses have started to obtain degrees without even attending the classes. Such practices would deteriorate the standard of the legal profession. A fool-proof mechanism should be in place to upload the details of the enrollment details of the advocates by the bar council. This would help the people to verify the details of an advocate before approaching them with their cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bar-council-must-ensure-law-degrees-are-genuine/articleshow/85285053.cms||---
---||Delhi||Reopening of schools in Delhi: Parents not on board||NEW DELHI: Acquiring consent from parents for reopening schools for students of classes X and XI has been a slow process for most private schools, as many parents are not happy about the decision. Schools are hoping that parents will agree once the classes start for practicals and project work. Most schools have sent out Google forms to the parents seeking consent as many institutions are reopening from Monday. Delhi Disaster Management Authority had allowed schools to re-open for classes of X and XII for practicals, projects and admission-related work. Jyoti Arora, principal for Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said, “We are still collecting the responses and so far, very few parents have agreed. However, when we had called students for practicals in January, many had attended.” Even Ashok Pandey, director for Ahlcon Schools, thinks as it is just for practicals, most parents will consent. “Students will be coming in small groups and they will just perform their practicals and head home. Parents know practicals are an important part of the boards, so most should join,” said Pandey. At Bal Bharti School, Gangaram, there has been a poor response to the consent forms sent out to parents. Devasish Tewary of Srijan School, Model Town, added, “Many parents do not want to take the risk of sending the students physically to schools.” However, at MM Public School, principal Rooma Pathak said there has been a mixed response. “The school took in parents’ response regarding sending their wards for offline classes through Google forms. On analysing, the responses have been mixed. Many are happy to send the students to school for practical learning, which is not possible in online classes. According to such parents if a child is visiting his/her relatives, malls, etc. then why not send them to school with precautions,” said Pathak. “Approximately 20% parents opposed it, as they feel sending students to school without vaccinating them may cause health hazards.” Schools like Amity International School, Saket are still working on the modalities of re-opening. Principal Divya Bhatia said, “We have not started the exercise of taking consent as we are still figuring out the modalities. We have received the SOP’s, but we did not want to rush it.” However, at government schools, there has not been much hesitancy among the parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/reopening-of-schools-parents-not-on-board/articleshow/85285089.cms||Shradha Chettri

A week after the scheme was announced, the Pune Municipal Corporation has received zero applications. PMC mooted the proposal a month-and-a-half ago. The proposal was approved by the standing committee in June, while the general body gave it the go-ahead in July. “We are appealing to citizens using illegal water connections to come forward and have them regularised. A one-time penalty will have to be paid for it,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of PMC’s water department. PMC data shows there are 4.5 lakh water connections in the city, and an equal number of illegal lines. Pawaskar said the scheme was not aimed at giving blanket amnesty to every illegal connection. Only those connections which otherwise could have been approved but are currently illegal due to non-completion of formalities, will be allowed to be regularised, he said. Any property with six flats is allowed a half-inch diameter pipeline. If a building as 12 flats, 3/4th of an inch pipeline is allowed. A one-inch pipeline is allowed for any property with more than 24 flats. Under the amnesty scheme, commercial and residential illegal water connections with pipelines of up to one-inch diameter will be regularised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-one-applies-to-regularize-illegal-water-connections/articleshow/85285148.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Delta plus not as transmissible as Delta, fear unnecessary, say experts||NAGPUR: After confirming Delta Plus variant in some samples from Vidarbha sent for genetic sequencing recently, there is visible panic among people. But doctors as well as ICMR authorities have confirmed that there is no point in panicking. “Delta Plus is not as dangerous as the Delta variant. It’s less transmissible and brings only mild to moderate disease. All four Delta Plus patients, who were detected in Vidarbha, have already recovered,” authorities confirmed on Thursday. One sample each from Akola and Chandrapur and two from Gondia tested positive for the variant. In Gondia, both the patients were women in the 18-45 year age-group. They were admitted in mid-June when their samples were collected and sent for testing. The women are from Salekasa and Sadak Arjuni tehsils and recovered at least a month ago in home isolation. “Both the women are hale and hearty and none of their close contacts reported any health complaints so far,” said Dr SB Khannade from Gondia GMCH. Akola divisional deputy director (health) Dr Rajkumar Chavan said the only Delta Plus patient of the district was from Akot and was admitted in Akola on June 29. “As per the protocol, 100 random samples are sent for genomic sequencing every month. The one sent in July tested positive. The patient has already recovered and we know his whereabouts,” said Dr Chavan. In Chandrapur too, the sole Delta Plus patient recovered in home isolation. Likewise, two Delta Plus patients in Nanded are in home isolation after recovery. One of them was unvaccinated, but still recovered fully. The official release from the state health department clearly mentions that mutation is the most common phenomenon of virus and there is no need to panic as far as the cases or deaths are not growing. Of the over 4,000 samples tested from all districts in Maharashtra, 65 tested positive for the Delta Plus variant. So far, only one death, of an 80-year-old highly comorbid man, was reported. “Enough evidence is available to prove that Delta Plus is not more dangerous than Delta,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. “It’s necessary to study the variant for which we must continue the genome sequencing exercise. But, there is no need to panic at all,” he said. On August 11, TOI had reported that the samples which tested positive for Delta Plus were old and if the variant would have been so dangerously transmissible, the number of cases and deaths would have spiked by now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/delta-not-as-transmissible-as-delta-fear-unnecessary-experts/articleshow/85282770.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The fourth edition of the festival, launched by WWF India, will continue till February 2022 and aims to spread awareness about the importance of the winged creatures to the overall ecosystem. Every year, the Dragonfly Festival records species spotted in NCR, possible hotspots and ideal breeding grounds. Experts say dragonflies are indicators of a healthy ecosystem and as both predator and prey, play a crucial role in maintaining a balance in the environment and in controlling insect populations. The festival is being conducted in partnership with Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), United Nations Environment Programme, Zoological Survey of India, Dragonfly South Asia Society, Indian Dragonfly Society, Society for Odonate Studies, MIT-WPU University and India Biodiversity Portal. An official said that the event will also see participation from adults and children, with a host of fun activities that will see the involvement of several schools. Since the first Dragonfly Festival launched in 2018, close to 10,000 people have so far been engaged through field visits, on-ground counts, online workshops, digital resources and photography competitions with the festival. This year, the festival will engage people across 10 Indian states that boast a diverse dragonfly population. “The success of the past three editions has encouraged us to further shine the spotlight dragonflies”, said Radhika Suri, director, education, WWF India. “Children at a younger age must understand the big role the tiny species play — only when they observe and connect with nature, can we truly see the positive effect on the planet.” Audiences will be encouraged to upload their observations on the iNaturalist app and the India Biodiversity Portal during the festival. Young children will also be able to use the SeekApp to discover the dragonflies around them. “Public participation in scientific research and citizen science is very important as it helps in improving the scientific community's capacity, as well as increasing the public's understanding of science,” said Sohail Madan, BNHS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/taking-wing-4th-edition-of-dragonfly-census-from-today/articleshow/85290559.cms||---

Despite chances of her recovery almost nil and several doctors suggesting passive euthanasia and organ donation, her family feels that Dolly should live her life till the last breath. Dolly’s brain had suffered an irreversible hypoxic damage during an alleged suicide attempt at her parents’ place at Ganeshpeth in July 2016. She was miraculously saved.Now, her legs and arms are gradually getting twisted on the bed as the family had to discontinue physiotherapy due to Covid threat. “We were told to stop feeding or giving her medicines or gradually withdraw them so that the life peters out. But, we decided to fight it out together to keep her alive,” said mother Neelima.Once quite an expressive woman, Dolly now rarely responds and occasionally communicates only through some facial gestures. Even when rodents nibbled her chest or ants mounted on that festering wound in the night, she remained immobile until someone from the family noticed it. It’s an everyday acid test for the Berrys, who own a transport business, but their efforts seem to be making their resolve firm to keep Dolly alive. “For days, we slept holding her after seeing rats and ants on her body,” said eldest sister Deepika while recalling the day when her mother had called up to say that Dolly had hanged herself in the bathroom.Deepika, who is a teacher, alleged that the six hours delay at Mayo hospital turned Dolly immobile. “The doctors there did nothing between 11am and 5pm to salvage her after she had shown some signs of life after the suicide attempt,” said Deepika.Dolly had a love marriage with Nitin Mirchandani in December 2015. The miscarriage in February 2016 aggravated her already disturbed married life. On the third day after her sister brought her home on her birthday, Dolly attempted suicide. The family is also fighting a legal battle with Dolly’s husband after the incident.Following the episode, Dolly was on ventilator for 60 days followed by another month on oxygen supply. After a three-month-long stay at a private hospital, the family had to foot a bill of Rs25 lakh. It was followed by monthly expenditures of Rs50,000 from September 2016 to August 2020, which included physiotherapy. The family feeds her five times with the tracheostomy tube fitted to the throat. A catheter is used to pass urine while the youngest sister wears hand gloves and helps Dolly pass stool.“We give her Daliya (a preparation of mashed vegetables) for meals, tea and biscuits, warm milk with haldi and dry fruits apart from juices through different means,” said Neelima.Deepika said Dolly’s body behaves like any other human being during seasonal changes. “We can make out she has developed cough and cold. We give her warm milk and haldi accordingly and clear her tube manually to ensure there is no choking,” she said.Neelima said they celebrate birthdays and festivals in Dolly’s room so that she feels a part of it.Neurosurgeon Dr Nilesh Agrawal of New Era hospital, who had treated Dolly in the initial days, said that the chances of recovery are almost nil as the brain had suffered substantial damage.A chanting device kept in her room helps keep the energy positive and clean, said the mother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-vegetative-state-for-5-yrs-woman-lives-through-with-familys-resolve/articleshow/85282790.cms||Soumitra Bose

After the lockdown conditions were relaxed from June 22, there has been a flood of visitors to the park. “We expect more crowd now as local authorities have further relaxed conditions allowing the park to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays. Earlier, the park used to close by 4pm,” said Pramod Panchbhai, divisional manager, Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM). “Since January 27 till date, the park actually remained open for 82 days only due to Covid restrictions. During this period, we recorded over 23,000 visitors, generating revenue of Rs60 lakh, which comes to Rs73,000 per day,” said Panchbhai. With week-end tourism culture picking up in the city, the number of visitors will go up due to three consecutive holidays starting from Saturday. There have been many inquiries about bookings but due to monsoon online booking is closed. The first trip starts at 8.30am and there will be buses after every 45 minutes.

---||Nagpur||Finally, 2nd serosurvey in Nagpur this month-end||Nagpur: The health department and divisional administration have finally decided to conduct a second survey to check Covid-19 seropositivity of the population in Nagpur district. The survey was earlier scheduled to be held in March 2021, but got delayed due to the the second wave. It is is most likely to commence in the last week of August .It is generally conducted once the case graph hits the baseline. Divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Varma has now made it clear that the serosurvey will be held as early as possible. The administration will take blood samples of people from Nagpur city and district, and will test them for IgG antibodies, which indicate exposure to the novel coronavirus. The first full-fledged serosurvey was conducted in October 2020, in which nearly 50% prevalence of Covid-19 was found in the people of Nagpur city. The sample size of the earlier survey was 4,000 but the administration has decided to increase it significantly this time. “We will be conducting the second serosurvey soon. We have appointed the nodal officer to look after it. The microbiology department of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Nagpur will conduct the survey,” said Varma. Dr Uday Narlawar of GMCH Nagpur, who was the nodal officer for the October serosurvey, will head the second survey too. He said that his department is ready to start the survey as soon as it receives funds and kits from the state health department. “Last time, the results took around a month. But this time they will come earlier,” added Dr Narlawar. Survey significance Provides estimate of prevalence of Covid-19 infection in populationPeople who experienced mild or asymptomatic illness with no symptoms and did not seek medical care or test will be surveyed Citizens from 10 zones of Nagpur city and 2,000 from 13 tehsils of Nagpur district will be tested||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/finally-2nd-serosurvey-in-nagpur-this-month-end/articleshow/85282821.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Delhi||Feeder service trial starts: Swipe your Metro card to get in and out for contactless travel||New Delhi: Riya, a student and resident of northeast Delhi, was pleasantly surprised to find a sleek electric bus waiting outside the Shastri Park metro station. “I had read in the newspaper that the new feeder service was going to start from today, but hadn’t expected the buses to be so nice and comfortable,” she said as her fellow travellers nodded in agreement. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation put electric feeder buses into service on trial for the first time from Thursday. On the two routes that offered service on the first day, DMRC deployed the 25 new low-floor electric buses it had inducted in the last few months. “I have travelled by Delhi Metro’s feeder buses quite regularly, but it feels nice to board an electric bus for the first time. Compared with the earlier ones, these vehicles are more comfortable,” said lawyer Zahid Jamal. The new e-buses, which can travel around 120km on a single charge, are conductor-less, the first for Delhi. Of the 25 vehicles, 15 have ‘validators’ installed at the front doors, where a commuter has to tap a Delhi Metro or Metro DTC smart card and cross a turnstile to enter the bus. The validator deducts the maximum fare on that particular route, but when the commuter disembarks and taps the smart card again at another validator at the rear gate, the actual fare is deducted and the balance restored. In the 10 buses that don’t yet have this system, personnel have been deployed with handheld validators. The e-buses can seat up to 24 passengers and are monitored from an operations control room through GPS. The other security features of the e-buses include multiple panic buttons, stop request buttons and CCTV cameras. Only metro users are permitted to travel on the e-buses, partly ensured by entry being allowed only from the stations. No entry is allowed along the route, with only passengers being dropped at designated stops. On the return route, entry is allowed at all stops but exit is permitted only at metro stations. DMRC said this has been done to ensure that only genuine Delhi Metro passengers use the service. Dedicated depots have been set up at Shastri Park and Majlis Park, with first-of-its-kind automatic wash plants, for the maintenance and stabling of these buses. “Unlike wash plants that clean the trains as they move through them, the bus cleaning plants slide back and forth to clean the stationary vehicle. The buses will ply between Shastri Park station and Gokulpuri station via Khajuri Chowk and Shastri Park station to Mother Dairy area. The minimum fare is Rs 10, and then Rs 15 for 4-8km, Rs 20 for 8-12km and Rs 25 for distances beyond 12km. DMRC will have 100 e-feeder buses on the roads in phases by the end of October. These will run from 14 metro stations and cover 10 routes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/feeder-service-trial-starts-swipe-your-metro-card-to-get-in-and-out-for-contactless-travel/articleshow/85285184.cms||Sidharatha Roy

He called his fellow fishermen to help him. To their amazement, they found a large adult mugger crocodile entangled in the net. As the reptile struggled to free itself and tried to creep back into the water, two of the fishermen caught it by its tail, dragging it back. But they were no match to its strength and the mugger disappeared into the water. A video of the purported incident has gone viral. According to sources, the incident took place on Wednesday. After watching the video, Bharat Lal, Bareilly’s divisional forest officer, termed the encounter with the mugger as “unbelievable” and “very risky” to come so near it. “The ill treatment of the reptile is an act of cruelty. I have directed the range officer of Aonla to visit the village and collect the details of the people who were seen ill treating an animal protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife (protection) Act.” A villager who witnessed the episode told TOI that mugger sightings are common in monsoon but catching one in a net is rare. He said, “It has happened for the first time that a crocodile got stuck in our net and most of us didn’t know what to do but we did not want to risk going close to it. Surprisingly, two men caught its tail and attempted to drag it out of the river.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/2-men-drag-struggling-croc-caught-in-fishing-net-by-its-tail-in-bareilly/articleshow/85282855.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The university also informed the court that the reports of the selection and scrutiny committees would be placed before the syndicate of the university for a decision to be taken with regard to these appointments.Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar directed MKU to submit the reports before the court. The judges also sought the decision of the syndicate to be placed before the court and adjourned the case to September 13.The court was hearing the public interest litigation filed by M Lionel Antony Raj, from Madurai. The petitioner stated that from May 2017 to June 2018, several appointments of teaching and non-teaching staff were made by the then vice-chancellor illegally without following the UGC norms. He stated that no rule of reservation was followed in these appointments and it also caused huge expenditure to the university.

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Pothole-ridden FCI Road nightmare for motorists||COIMBATORE: The pothole-riddled 1.3km stretch of FCI Road, which connects Gandhimanagar with Sathyamangalam Road at Ganapathy, has turned into a nightmare for motorists. The road provides easy access to places such as Avarampalayam. Motorists said they had been demanding local authorities to relay the road for the past couple of months, but to no avail. B Balamurugan, a resident of Gandhimanagar, said, “Whenever I travel on the road, I am down with back pain. I try my level best to avoid the stretch, but I end up using the route whenever I am late to work.” The entire stretch, he said, should be levelled and the road should be relaid without any further delay. “We had staged several protests, demanding authorities to relay the road, but in vain.” P Meenal, a regular commuter on the stretch, said people falling off their two-wheelers was a common sight on the stretch. “Vehicles often skid because of the bad condition of the road, causing accidents. Many people are forced to take adjoining roads, crowding them in the process.” P Stephen, a resident of EB Colony, said the dust emanating from the road was another cause for concern. “Regular commuters suffer from eye irritation and respiratory problems. The road is not in a condition to be repaired. It has to be completely relaid.” The residents said the road would become slippery and turn into pools, whenever it rained. They said it was the Food Corporation of India (FCI)’s responsibility to maintain the road in a good condition, as the stretch belonged to it. The residents have been demanding authorities and elected representatives to bring the road under the control of the city corporation, which they hope would maintain the road in a better condition. Former Singanallur MLA N Karthik said he had taken up the issue with various officials several times in the past few years, without any results. “I had met the district collector recently and took up the issue with him. He had assured me to find a solution at the earliest.” When contacted, city corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said he would check with officials about the road problem and take appropriate action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pothole-ridden-fci-road-nightmare-for-motorists/articleshow/85285215.cms||V Devanathan

Nearly 200 hawkers were removed and 100 stalls demolished during a recent drive carried out on Satara Road, Deccan, Lohegaon and Ahmednagar Road. The anti-encroachment staff initiated action against roadside food joints and other establishments which were operating without permits. The action was also taken as a precautionary measure to contain the spread of Covid-19. A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said that several stalls had been put up without proper permission. In some cases, additional floor space index or transfer of development rights had been consumed illegally. Apart from permanent structures, even temporary structures were demolished. The official said non-availability of labourers was one of the major obstacles in carrying out action against illegal constructions during lockdown. “We have set up flying squads in 15 ward offices. Around 300 people, including civic staff and contractual workers, have been pressed into service for the drive,” said Madhav Jagtap, head, PMC’s anti-encroachment department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-intensifies-action-against-encroachments/articleshow/85285230.cms||---

However, the court stayed the bail order until August 18 after the prosecution moved a plea that it intended to challenge it. “It is true that the accused is in custody since April 6, 2021 and this court has exercised discretion in his favour. However, the fact remains that a fair opportunity needs to be given to the prosecution to test validity and legality of the order passed by this csourt for a limited period of seven days,” the special PMLA court said. Seeking bail, Deshmukh’s lawyer submitted that the previous bail plea was rejected on grounds that the probe was on. The defence said that after rejection of a previous bail application, there is no progress in respect of the co-accused. The lawyer submitted that since the chargesheet is already submitted and cognisance has been taken, there is no point to keep him in custody. The prosecution, however, opposed bail on grounds that while rejecting the earlier plea, the court had observed that there is sufficient prima facie material showing Deshmukh’s involvement in the crime. The prosecution said that in the absence of change in circumstances, he is not entitled to be released on bail. Granting Deshmukh bail, the court observed, “Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, there is no further progress in the investigation, the co-accused have been given protection from arrest and the applicant has given consent for making the attachment [by the probe agency] absolute, in my view all these circumstances would weigh in favour of the applicant, so as to exercise discretion to release him on bail.” It is alleged that Aastha Group defrauded NSEL of Rs 250 crore and Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik’s company Vihang Group helped it launder the money. It was alleged that Aastha Group and Sarnaik’s company, Vihang Group, had formed a joint venture, Vihand Housing Project, and purchased several plots at Titwala with Deshmukh’s help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nsel-money-laundering-bail-for-bizman-stayed-for-a-week/articleshow/85287437.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Dindigul SHG leader gets PM pat for recycling plastic||MADURAI: A self-help group in Dindigul was among those chosen to participate in an interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi as part of the Atma Nirbhar Naari Shakti Se Samvad programme. The manager of the panchayat level federation was hailed for her efforts to recycle plastic and keep the local body clean. S Jayanthi, leader of Indusiwa SHG and member of the Nalla Panjampatti Plastic Recycling Centre (shredder), Dindigul, was among the five SHGs selected from across the country to interact with the Prime Minister. A shed was erected for the purpose in front of the federation office at Panjampatti. The panchayat level federation was constituted in 2010 during the previous DMK regime to bring all the SHGs in a village under a single umbrella. This also improved social inclusion, as women from all castes and communities came together and they benefited from financial inclusion. The SHG at Panjampatti has been recycling plastic they collect from the village and the shredded plastic is used for laying roads. Jayanthi and members of the SHG listened to the PM addressing them on a giant LED monitor installed for the purpose. Modi told the women that they should work for the development of their entire village without just limiting themselves to obtaining loans, earning a livelihood and repaying the loans. In 2010, chief minister M K Stalin, who was then minister for local body administration, handed over a cheque of Rs50,000 to Jayanthi as revolving funds to the SHGs in a welfare distribution function. This became the seed money for accelerated growth of the unit. Machineries for shredding, grinding,etc.were purchased and 36 members of the SHG joined the unit. Plastic waste is punched for Rs5/kg. After processing plastic spending approximately Rs10-15/ kg, the pellets are sold for Rs30/kg. The processed plastic is purchased by contractors as an ingredient for road laying. The members of the SHG earns Rs400 per day. Jayanthi said that their federation had recycled as much as 102 tonnes of plastic waste since 2010 and provided it for laying roads to a length of 215km. A Hindi teacher, Rajini, translated the Prime Minister’s speech to Tamil and Jayanthi’s replies to Hindi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dindigul-shg-leader-gets-pm-pat-for-recycling-plastic/articleshow/85285201.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Gadchiroli collector shows the way by taking cattle off the roads||Nagpur: Gadchiroli district collector Deepak Singla last week issued instructions to the municipal council and police department to ensure stray cattle are kept off the carriageways to avoid accidents, traffic chaos and unhygienic conditions. The collector has also instructed the animal husbandry department to tag stray animals for convenient identifications of their owners. Just as Singla is taking up the issue of stray cattle on the roads seriously, Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) ambitious Rs125 crore proposal for ‘Nandagram project’, to relocate cowsheds from city to a designated place, remains a distant dream as budgetary allocation from state government is still awaited. Accidents due to cattle are common in the city, and several such incidents are being reported in the rural areas too. NMC’s Nandagram project, spread over 44 acres and having capacity to accommodate 4,000 bovines, is being planned to relocate city’s 1,046 cowsheds or tabelas to the new site near Wathoda, informed nodal officer, solid waste management, Dr Gajendra Mahalle. The project will be a godsend. Last week, an elderly security guard was killed in an accident after his scooter rammed into a buffalo on Godhni Road. Around a week ago, a cow was seriously injured and died later, after a vehicle hit it at Besa. Also, a truck turned turtle on the highway near Mouda trying to save a cow which suddenly came onto the carriageway. The driver of the truck died. Singla said there are several provisions under various enactments, like Bombay Police Act and Municipal Act, by which the owners of the straying cattle and buffaloes can be booked. “We are aiming to levy fines and take punitive action against owners whose cattle are found on the road. Following legal provisions, the animals can be auctioned too,” said Singla. CEO, Gadchiroli, Sanjeev Ovhal said around 40 bovines were seized from different locations between Gadchiroli and Chamorshi Road. “We have formed a team and an officer has been deputed to lead the drives against stray animals,” he said. Meanwhile, it’s learnt Nagpur mayor Dayashankar Tiwari has taken up the Nandagram matter with animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar to get funds sanctioned. Tiwari told TOI that he had sought Rs100 crore from the state animal husbandry department for the purpose. During the bhoomipujan of Kadbi Chowk to Golibar Chowk railway overbridge, Tiwari had urged Maharashtra animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar to provide financial assistance to the cash strapped NMC. The civic body had prepared development project report of Nandagram several years ago but could not make it a reality due to crisis of funds. Kedar confirmed that his ministry has received a proposal from NMC and he assured to look into its demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadchiroli-collector-shows-the-way-by-taking-cattle-off-the-roads/articleshow/85282832.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Nagpur||IIM Nagpur to start offshore campus at Singapore in 2 yrs||Nagpur: The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) here has set up an ambitious plan to start its offshore campus in Singapore in the next two years. It has already started its second campus in Pune which will start functioning from September. The premier institution would also be starting another campus at Hyderabad next year. “We aim to be in the top ten IIMs in the next few years. Already we are among the top performing institutions from our batch of IIMs. We’ve doubled our capacity to 240 from the last academic session (2020-21) from 120,” IIM-N’s newly appointed director Bhimaraya Metri told TOI in an exclusive chat. Explaining on its offshore plans, he said one of IIM-N directors Puneet Pushkarna, who is an alumnus of Laxminarayan Institute of Technology (LIT) here, was settled in Singapore and he had started efforts to start a campus there. “Earlier, other IIMs had opened their branches abroad, but those couldn’t sustain. But we are confident that we will be successful.” The B-school would be organising a big international conference from December 27 to 30 where who’s who of management are expected to participate. “It would be conducted under the aegis of the ‘International Society for Data Sciences and Innovation (ISDSI). It would be the first of its kind conference in the city, where the students would get a rare chance to interact with global management gurus. We’re targeting around 1,000 registrations.” The prestigious institution plans to shift to the new building in Mihan in phases by first shifting the second year batch. The state-of-the-art complex would have 13 classrooms, of which six would be completely digital ones, where the faculty from abroad can deliver live lectures and even students can interact with them. “Except minor works, our building is almost ready. You will feel the difference once you enter the academic block. Our digital classrooms would be enabled with artificial intelligence and IT systems,” Metri said. Explaining on the Hyderabad campus, he said, they had inked a pact with Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT) where all IIM-N’s regular programmes would be offered along with automobile related courses. “We would be talking with the Telangana government for the land, as ours would be the first IIM in that state. We’ve identified 32 acres and are hopeful of getting it.” IIM-N exe MBA prog admissions start IIM-N has started an ‘Executive MBA’ programme for working professionals in Nagpur and nearby places where the classes would be held on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. “It would be a two-year programme and the first batch would have 60 seats. Experienced graduates would be granted preference and the classes would be held in the evening on Friday and Saturday from 6.30pm to 9.30 pm with 30 minutes break and on Sunday morning. Currently, the classes would be held online, but after the government allows regular classes, we would invite the students to our campus here. It’s the reason, we are targeting the students from Nagpur and nearby areas,” Metri said. He added that they would be starting this programme in Pune in September. The IIM-N has also started many online short-term certificate courses in management for the professionals and students from various areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/iim-nagpur-to-start-offshore-campus-at-singapore-in-2-yrs/articleshow/85285225.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Vijayawada||Dammalapati case: Arguments conclude, HC reserves order||Vijayawada: The high court reserved orders in the petition filed by former advocate general Dammalapati Srinivas, seeking to quash the FIR filed against him by the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) in the alleged Amaravati land scam case. Following the Supreme Court’s direction to decide the matter in four weeks, the high court heard the arguments of Srinivas and the state government on Thursday. Arguing on behalf of Srinivas, senior counsel Sidharth Luthra said the case is a “classic example of regime revenge”. Stating that the allegations levelled against Srinivas are “false and frivolous”, he said the intention behind the case is to harass his client as he had appeared as counsel in several cases where judgements went against the ruling dispensation. Luthra further argued that Srinivas neither purchased government or assigned lands, nor was there any grievance from the land sellers. As he or his family members purchased lands from private parties, no case can be made out in such transactions. Neither the Prevention of Corruption Act nor the charges of cheating and conspiracy would apply to such transactions, he added. Relying upon a recent Supreme Court judgement on alleged insider trading in the Amaravati case, Luthra said the high court and the apex court both observed that the information pertaining to the capital are very much in public domain and the land transactions in the core capital area cannot be termed as insider trading. “The crime investigation department (CID) has also shown the alleged transactions as insider trading and the ACB registered a case under the PC Act. The case registered by te CID has been quashed by the high court, and the same was upheld by the Supreme Court,” he said. Arguing on behalf of the state government, advocate general S Sriram said the case was registered based on a complaint received by the ACB. The actions of the ACB are bona fide because it responded according to law considering the seriousness of the allegations in the complaint which require deeper investigation, he said, adding that the locus standi of the complainant cannot be questioned as anyone can lodge a complaint with relevant authorities if they came across discrepancies. As the arguments have concluded in the three petitions, Justice Manavendranath Roy reserved orders and asked the state government to file counters in the remaining petitions. Further hearing of the matter has been posted to August 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/dammalapati-case-arguments-conclude-hc-reserves-order/articleshow/85283191.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Nagpur||Sealing order for brothel, show cause to half a dozen places in Ganga Jamuna||Nagpur: A day after Ganga Jamuna was barricaded, the female sex workers there remained anxious about their future. Sources said that two prominent NGOs from Pune and Sangli are eager to visit Ganga Jamuna, a red light area having a history of almost 300 years, to stage a protest in the coming days. City police chief Amitesh Kumar on Thursday issued an order for sealing a brothel while half a dozen places were issued show-cause notices. Cops are now set to soon notify the locality as ‘Prohibited zone having brothels with illegal flesh trade rackets in them’. This notification, under Section 7 of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (ITPA), would further seal the fate of residents as any activities involving sex work would be held as violations of the order and hence liable for action. After clogging the lanes with barricades and a heavy police deployment cordoning off the area, the top cop issued a notification on Thursday under 144 Criminal Procedure Code (Crpc) making entry into the locality for sex related work a crime. “The notification under section 7 of ITPA too would be issued soon,” said the CP and added, “Residents can stay and continue to live and access essential commodities and services but no sex work or related activities like soliciting, hiring out brothels and so on are allowed. We are now issuing the sealing orders for brothels as per the law.” The two notifications of CrPC 144 and section 7 (3) of ITPA would make any person liable for action if they visit Ganga Jamuna for sex work. Social worker Hemlata Lohave, project manager for Indian Red Cross Society, said that a sustained campaign is required at Ganga Jamuna “to protest this police action jeopardizing the livelihood of so many families residing here”. Zonal DCP Lohit Matani said that most sex workers flock to Ganga Jamuna from outside. “There are many unauthorized constructions in the area which need to be legally tackled and encroachments removed,” he said. In the meanwhile, NCP leader Jwala Dhote visited Ganga Jamuna to raise voice against the “arbitrary action” of the police. She vowed to launch a stir after Independence Day celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sealing-order-for-brothel-show-cause-to-half-a-dozen-places-in-ganga-jamuna/articleshow/85285300.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Jadavpur University students attend open-air classes, Presi protest next week||KOLKATA: The clamour for on-campus classes, following Covid-safety norms, has begun to grow louder with a section of students and teachers from prominent universities taking their demand “to the street”. A group of students at Jadavpur University has been attending classes on the pavement just outside Gate No. 4 of their campus. Some students from Presidency University, too, plan to attend classes in the open on Monday and Tuesday. “Online classes are creating a digital divide, excluding a large number of students who are struggling to keep up with the others,” said Srabana Ghosh, a computer engineering student at JU. But a senior official of a university pointed out if campuses reopened, it would not be only a handful of students attending classes in the open. “Thousands of youngsters from the city and the state will commute to campuses by public transport, posing risk to their families, classmates and faculties. It will not be wise to reopen campuses till a big section of students and teachers are vaccinated,” he said. On-campus classes have been suspended since March last year, with a brief reopening for certain sections before the second wave. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee last week said the government might reopen campuses after Durga Puja but nothing has been finalised yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ju-students-attend-open-air-classes-presi-protest-next-wk/articleshow/85285312.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The chief minister told us to gather all information with regard to finance, understand it and then let the public know about it, encourage a public discourse, and then formulate schemes. This is for the people to know about it, for them to comment on it and then for the experts to take their views on it. This is true democracy, he said.He said that former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had said that if they borrowed Re1, they had invested 50 paise, but in a responsible financial management system there should not be any deficit, he said.

---||Delhi||4 minors begging on streets rescued from Chirag Dilli||NEW DELHI: Four children, who were living on the streets and begging, were rescued at Chirag Dilli flyover near Saket Metro station on Thursday. The rescue operation was carried out by a joint team of Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), district administration and Delhi Police. The rescued children are from Rajasthan’s Sawai Madhopur and have been sent to childcare institutions. They will be sent back to their communities after the due legal process. The rescued children were aged between 8 and 16 years, of them, two were girls and two boys. They were found begging with no masks, while being exposed to potentially threatening situations, including physical violence, sexual exploitation and emotional abuse. After their rescue, they were provided medical care.  DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu, said, “Children forced into begging or in street situations have either faced or are at a much greater risk of facing traumatic situations. Hence, it is extremely critical that they are rescued from such vulnerable circumstances, and adequate measures undertaken to ensure their well-being, including providing relief such as sponsorship to families or keeping in children homes where there is no one to take care of the child.” DCPCR officials said a drive had been started to rescue children from the street. Though the rescued kids have been shifted to childcare institutions, they will be produced before the child welfare committee. “Streets are not a place for them. Such rescued children can be helped through the sponsorship policy of Delhi government,” said Kundu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-minors-begging-on-streets-rescued-from-chirag-dilli/articleshow/85287468.cms||---

They were not using the land to make bricks. The officials had inspected the land and issued notice to the encroachers to vacate the land two month ago. However, the brick kiln owners didn’t hand over the land to the officials,” the source said.Meanwhile, R Senthilvelavan, joint commissioner, HR&CE department, Coimbatore zone, ordered the removal of encroachments on Thursday.A team of HR&CE officials subsequently visited Chinna Thadagam in the morning and demolished the units on the temple land in the presence of revenue department officials and police personnel. “They have retrieved around 8.8 acres of temple land and installed a board stating the land belongs to the HR&CE department,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rs-6cr-worth-temple-land-retrieved-from-brick-kiln-unit-owners/articleshow/85285249.cms||---

Subsequently, the couple fought with each other and separated. When Velusamy approached Muthusamy for the lease amount, the latter refused to pay him and killed him with the help of Amsaveni, with whom he was having an illicit affair. The two then burned Velusamy’s body,” the officer said.While Velusamy’s family members didn’t lodge any missing person complaint with police, the officer said, Amsaveni had revealed the truth to her husband, who began to blackmail her, demanding money to buy liquor daily. He had also threatened to reveal the truth to the villagers, if she failed to pay him.“Unable to bear his torture, Amsaveni and Muthusamy murdered Ravi by beating him with wooden logs on the farmland on January 3 and set the body ablaze,” the officer said.Amsaveni later lodged a complaint with the Mulanur police, stating her husband had gone missing. Police registered a case and launched a probe.“During inquiry, we came to know about the murder of Velusamy from the villagers as Ravi had told them the same under the influence of alcohol. We picked up Amsaveni and Muthusamy for questioning and they confessed to both the crimes,” the officer said.The two were arrested and remanded in judicial custody on Thursday. “We took them to the crime scenes and recovered the skeletal remains of the victims. Forensic experts have collected the same for the lab test,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/42-yr-old-woman-77-yr-old-lover-arrested-for-killing-hubby-farmer/articleshow/85285272.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Edu trusts’ association not to reopen schools till govt fulfils demands||Nagpur: An association representing educational trusts in Maharashtra on Thursday said that it will not reopen schools till the government fulfils their pending demands. Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sanstha Mahamandal (MRSSM) executive office bearer Ravindra Fadnavis said that his members in Nagpur and Amravati division have unanimously decided to write to the government about first clearing their pending issues. Almost all schools under MRSSM are grant-in-aid vernacular institutes. Hundreds of schools in Nagpur and Amravati division will follow this decision, claimed MRSSM at a press conference. Fadnavis said that they have five main demands which the government has been ignoring for a long time. “Since 2009, the issue related to non-salary grants is unresolved as we have not got arrears,” he said and added that “technically” since 2012, the government has not completed recruitment process of teachers. According to Fadnavis, in 2017, permission was granted for recruitment but it was not done completely because excess teachers were found. “The teacher recruitment app called PAVITRA must be scrapped and we must revert to the original process where management goes ahead with the hiring process,” he said. MRSSM said that Class IV employee recruitment has completely stopped, which hinders the work of schools. “Every school needs a peon but now we cannot hire them because of this recruitment being put on hold,” said Fadnavis. The association also demanded grant of financial aid to schools so that they can be viable. “The government had itself committed to granting financial aid to schools but that has not been done completely yet. We demand that grant-in-aid status be given to eligible schools immediately, else it will be impossible for them to function,” said Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/edu-trusts-association-not-to-reopen-schools-till-govt-fulfils-demands/articleshow/85285344.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Pune||Pune: Four assault biker after minor accident in Kondhwa Khurd||PUNE: A motorcyclist from Dehu Road was brutally assaulted by four men outside a housing society at Kondhwa Khurd after his vehicle grazed past another bike around 8pm on August 9. The two men on the bike started an altercation with the motorcyclist, Parvez Pathan (25), after the minor incident. Then they kicked and punched him. One of them assaulted him in the back and hand with a sharp weapon. Two more men joined the duo in assaulting Pathan, who lodged a complaint with the Kondhwa police on August 10. Pathan, a car driver, said, “I left Kondhwa after meeting a friend for my residence in Dehu Road on motorcycle. I applied sudden brakes after the two men on the bike came in front of my vehicle while taking a sharp turn. My vehicle grazed the footrest of their bike and a quarrel started.” He said, “When the duo charged at me, I pushed them and told them that I was not at fault. But they attacked me. The pillion rider pulled out a knife and assaulted me on my left hand. I sat on the roadside after my hand started bleeding. But the suspect again assaulted me on my back.” Pathan told TOI, “I could not bear the assault and fainted on the road, when the suspects called their two friends. The latter reached there on another bike and all of them attacked me. Some people passing by the scene did not intervene on seeing knife in the hands of one of the assailants. But they appealed them not to attack me.” He said, “I stood up with extreme difficulty and rushed to the office of my employer nearby. I pulled down its shutters because of fear of being attacked again. The four men chased me, but they could not gain access to the office. They then attacked two passers-by and sped away on their bikes after the incident triggered commotion in the vicinity.” Pathan said, “I later went to the Kondhwa police chowky for lodging a complaint, but the police referred me to the Sassoon hospital for treatment. I got 11 stitches on my left shoulder. After discharge, I lodged a police complaint.” The Kondhwa police have invoked charges under sections 324 and 323 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), and 504 (intentional insult) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. Sub-inspector Swapnil Patil said on Thursday, “Pathan and the attackers are not known to each other. He was attacked because of a petty road rage dispute. He has given us the description of the suspects and their bikes at the time of registering the complaint. We hope to arrest the suspects at the earliest. The suspects attacked two more men, but they have not approached us yet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-assault-biker-after-minor-accident-in-kondhwa-khurd/articleshow/85285356.cms||---

Even though no one was injured, officials said the incident caused panic among the shopkeepers and visitors as some shops had to be vacated. The incident was reported around 5.30pm when a call was received by Delhi Police control room reporting that a shop in Nehru Place caught fire. A police team was sent to the spot and the Delhi Fire Service was also alerted. “When the officials reached the spot, they found that the fire was in a cloth shop on the first floor of building no. 51-52, Gedore House. At least five to six fire tenders were also rushed to the site and the firefighters vacated the shops nearby. After an hour, the fire was doused,” said a senior police officer.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 357cr payment approved by Guv kept pending, state gets HC rap||Mumbai: Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday frowned at the state government for deliberately stalling the release of Rs 357 croreto a road contractor — a payment that was approved by governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari during the President rule in the state in November 2019.  “This appears to be deliberate. What is the explanation?” asked justice Anil Menon. Manaj Tollway Pvt Ltd — that bagged the four-laning and maintenance contract of two state highways in 2011 -— sought withdrawal of the amount deposited with HC. On March 5 this year, the HC dismissed the state’s review plea of a December 2019 order that recorded its undertaking to pay Rs 358 crore to the contractor. It upheld the governor’s power to approve payment of the amount. The state had then sought time saying the judgment will have repercussions. Senior advocate Aspi Chinoy, with advocate Cherag Balsara, for Manaj, said it should be permitted to withdraw the amount with accrued interest. “It is an unfortunate behaviour on the part of the state government,” said Chinoy. The state’s advocate Jyoti Chavan sought time saying it is “awaiting opinion of the law & judiciary department on the future course of action to be taken in respect of the March 5 order.” Justice Menon allowed Chavan’s request for time. “Now no excuses. Otherwise I will call your principal secretary (PWD) to court,” he added, posting the hearing on August 24. After disputes, Manaj had opted out in 2015 and invoked arbitration clause and an award of Rs 358 crore was made. On December 13, 2019, the state paid Rs 1 crore. During the winter session, it took the the legislature’s sanction to pay the balance Rs 357 crore. When the amount was not paid, Manaj moved HC for contempt and the amount was deposited with HC. The state’s review plea said the consent terms were hurriedly entered into during President’s rule and its approval was not sought.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-357cr-payment-approved-by-guv-kept-pending-state-gets-hc-rap/articleshow/85287505.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Singh met Muzaffarnagar DM with an application, urging the administration "not to consider his faction aligned with the main BKU led by the Tikait brothers". Singh was the state president of the BKU when the organisation founder Mahender Singh Tikait was alive. Later, he made his faction — BKU (Bhanu). Singh was also part of the farmer protest but had withdrawn after the Republic Day violence and even stopped opposing the farm laws. He told mediapersons, “I have come to meet DM. I will introduce him to my workers. I will tell him that my workers will work with utmost honesty. None of my party workers will behave like Rakesh Tikait, who is spreading terrorism at the Delhi border.” Singh further said, “The ongoing protest at the Delhi border is being funded by the Congress and other anti-BJP parties.” Targeting the upcoming BKU mahapanchayat on September 5, Singh said, “No honest Jaat neat will participate in the mahapanchayat, but netas who are being funded will join them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/rakesh-tikait-is-spreading-terrorism-at-delhi-border-says-bku-bhanu/articleshow/85283014.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The deceased boy’s decomposed body was recovered eight days after he went missing, police said. The matter came to fore when the boy’s mother, a 40-year-old woman, approached Geeta Colony police station on August 3 and reported that his 17-year-old son was missing since August 1. “A case was registered on the woman’s complaint and search for the boy started.

---||Mumbai||Cannot share call records without state nod, Maharashtra intel department tells CBI||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra State Intelligence Department (SID) refused to share the call records where certain phone numbers were intercepted to authenticate complaints of corruption in police transfers and postings with the CBI citing lack of approval from the state government. The SID, however, in its reply to the CBI, said that the records are safe and preserved on its server. These calls were recorded during the tenure of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh by then SID commissioner Rashmi Shukla.Earlier, the CBI had issued notice to SID expressing its concern over the safety of recorded phone calls and asked for these to examine in a corruption case it is investigating against Deshmukh. The present SID commissioner Ashutosh Dumbare wrote to the CBI on July 27, stating, “It is once again confirmed that the intercepted telephonic conversation, which is the subject matter of the investigation, have been and shall be preserved in the call recording server at SID and shall be provided, as desired, as soon as possible, subject to further directions received from the Maharashtra government in this regard.” The SID told the CBI that “these records, digital and physical, have already been provided to the cyber police station of Mumbai police.” Last year, Shukla was commissioner of Maharashtra’s SID when telephones of influential people were tapped by her department. Some of the people were politically connected and were allegedly heard discussing transfers and posting of police officers, including IPS officers, in exchange for money. Shukla had submitted a related report on the phone tapping to the government through then DGP Subodh Jaiswal, but no action was taken on it. Jaiswal and Shukla were not on good terms with the state government, and they opted for Central government deputation. Jaiswal is now CBI director. Shukla is currently special director general of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and her SID report was leaked recently after former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh made corruption allegations against Deshmukh in March. Singh is also facing investigations in extortion charges. Earlier, former chief minister and leader of opposition in Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis had claimed that he had a copy of Shukla’s report which he had submitted to the Union home secretary, demanding a detailed inquiry on it. After this, the Maharashtra government asked the cyber police station of Mumbai police to investigate the leaking of the report. The CBI is investigating the corruption case based on Singh’s letter to the chief minister alleging that Deshmukh had asked dismissed police officer Sachin Waze to illegally collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners in the city every month for him. The CBI wanted to examine Shukla’s report too in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cannot-share-call-records-without-state-nod-maharashtra-intel-dept-tells-cbi/articleshow/85287569.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Delhi||You can now get rapid PCR test results in less than 60 minutes at IGI||New Delhi: Rapid PCR test facility is now available for passengers at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, which will be able to give results within 45-60 minutes. While the RT-PCR test facility is already operational at the Delhi airport, it normally takes 3-4 hours for passengers to receive the results. The new rapid machines aim to reduce the waiting time considerably, officials say. The new facility with rapid PCR machines was made operational on August 10 and a test will cost Rs 5,000. This NABL-approved facility is being run by Genestrings Diagnostic Centre, which is also handling the existing RT-PCR test facility at the Delhi airport. “Acting on the latest travel guidelines issued by the United Arab Emirates, Genestrings Diagnostic Centre has set up a rapid PCR test facility at Indira Gandhi International Airport. The rapid PCR machines are based on ID NOW technology and more such machines will be added in the coming days. Reports should be available within 45 minutes,” said Dr Gauri Agarwal, founder-director, Genestrings Diagnostic Centre. A Genestrings official said, at present, 50 rapid PCR test-machines were operational for passengers and more such machines expected to be imported in the coming months. “At present, these machines have almost finished in India, however, a new batch of machines will be imported in the next few weeks,” said the official. While the cost of a normal RT-PCR test is Rs 500, the official added that rapid tests cost considerably more because of an overall increased cost of equipment and testing kits. “One machine can only give test results for one individual at a time and the overall cost of the equipment and the raw material make it more expensive. However, it will save on waiting time,” said the official. The machines were made operational to cater to the travellers, particularly those headed to the United Arab Emirates, which has recently lifted travel restrictions. It, however, has made it mandatory for test reports to be produced before entering the country. Footfall has been gradually increasing at the Delhi airport of late. Terminal-2 was made operational from July 22 onwards to ensure social distancing is maintained inside the premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/you-can-now-get-rapid-pcr-test-results-in-less-than-60-minutes-at-igi/articleshow/85285469.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Vid assembly sessions should have longer tenure: Gorhe||Nagpur: Maharashtra legislative council’s deputy chairman Neelam Gorhe on Thursday said the assembly sessions in Vidarbha should have a longer tenure with a view to discuss a range of issues. The senior Shiv Sena leader asserted that the issues related to Vidarbha like farmer suicides, drought and others were discussed in the sessions held in Mumbai as well. She also termed the recent incidents in parliament where the opposition members tried to create a ruckus as ‘unfortunate’ and equated them to similar happenings in the monsoon assembly session in Mumbai where 12 BJP MLAs were suspended for unruly behaviour. “Though December 7 is fixed as winter session date this year, the final decision would be taken after taking a review of the Covid-19 situation in the state. We were happy when the monsoon session was held in Vidarbha, but felt the same experience as in Mumbai,” she said, while taking an indirect dig at BJP, during whose tenure, assembly couldn’t function on July 6, 2018, due to excessive rains and waterlogging on the premises. Stressing on expediting vaccination, Gorhe said if those were made available earlier by the central government through diplomacy, many lives would have been saved in the second wave. “You can’t expect multinational companies to do business with the states. Only the Centre can negotiate with them for vaccinations.” The MLC from Pune was in the city to take a review of Covid-19 situation and monitor the implementation of various government schemes for women and children. Accompanied by Sena MLCs Manisha Kayande and Dushyant Chaturvedi and Ramtek MLA Ashish Jaiswal, she conducted a series of meetings with collector Vimala R, other officials from the collectorate and later with Zilla parishad CEOs and sarpanchs. “I interacted with the sarpanchs of villages which managed to remain free from coronavirus. They told me they raised awareness through loudspeakers and took care that all residents in their villages strictly follow Covid distancing. They acted after watching chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s addresses on social media to tackle the situation,” she said. Gorhe directed the collector and other officials to release funds for those affected by Covid-19, particularly widows, orphaned children and tribals. “I asked them to take help from various NGOs and also avail of district mining funds for the purpose. I directed all stakeholders to take precaution as the new Delta variant is discovered and it’s not known whether vaccine would be effective on it. I asked them to find out how many citizens were infected with the deadly virus after taking both jabs. They found that the population of such individuals is just 0.11%,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vid-assembly-sessions-should-have-longer-tenure-gorhe/articleshow/85285459.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

That was before Covid struck. At present, his factory has been closed for the last two months due to a lack of orders.The lockdowns and restrictions imposed to curb Covid spread have hit the imitation jewellery industry hard. Rajkot, the hub of imitation jewellery, is facing existential crisis. Nearly 6,000 production units out of 15,000 are non-functional for the want of orders. Around 3 lakh people working with the industry, mostly coming from west Bengal and Bihar, have returned to their native.The marriage season, festivals like ‘raksha bandhan’ and ‘janmashtami’ haven’t yielded the expected demand. After the second wave of Covid, the payment and demand cycle has been disturbed. The rising price of raw material added to the woes of the imitation jewellery industry.Almost 1,000 wholesalers purchase the imitation jewellery in bulk from these production houses. The credit period is six months but at present the entire payment cycle has been disrupted. According to the production houses the payments are outstanding since the last eight months and they are not in position to give more credit.On the other hand, the traders are complaining of piling up the stock. Jignesh Shah, president of the imitation jewellery association, said that the traders are saddled with last year’s stock. “Raksha bandhan is one of the biggest festivals for our business but last year there was no business because of a complete lockdown and we are still clearing the old stock.“This year there is no new production. There is a cap on the number of guests at marriage functions while no permission has been given to various ‘shravan melas’. All these factors have led to drying up of demand,” Shah said.Many ‘melas’ are organized in Saurashtra during the month of ‘shravan’. The five-day fair of janmashtami is organized at Rajkot, Jamnagar and Porbandar while the ‘Tarnetar mela’ is held at Surendranagar. But this year all these fairs have been cancelled due to Covid situation. There is big demand for imitation jewellery from the rural population at these ‘melas’.Pratipalsinh Chudasama, who is involved in gold-plated jewellery, said, “Earlier, I was doing the job-work of Rs 80 lakh per month which has reduced to Rs 10 lakh at present. I had a team of 25 employees but I was forced to lay-off all but four.”“The industry’s turnover was around Rs 3,000 crore per year but currently it has come down to just 10%. Lockdown in other states and cities, especially Mumbai, coupled with shrinking export markets has resulted in decline in demand,” Shah added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/ncov-hit-imitation-jewellery-industry-stares-at-recession/articleshow/85283155.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

WRD has not carried out any investigation with the help from panel members of dam safety, experts in hydrology neither any scientists from the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO). Similarly while WRD had been allocated World Bank (WB) funds to construct cyclone shelters the work has not been completed. An agreement between the government of Goa and WB stipulates the date for completing the work as October 2019. However, it is learnt that not even 50% of the work is completed. The terms of agreement between the state and WB state that funds would be available as a loan and the government of Goa has to repay this starting from November 2020 up to March 2040. Similarly, 75% of the cost for the cyclone shelters has been funded by WB as a loan—the remaining 25% is to be borne by the state. If the executing authority which is WRD fails to complete the work of constructing shelters within the stipulated time, then the entire cost has to be borne by the state. Sources point out that if the government of Goa had completed the work on cyclone shelters as per the agreement, these shelters could have been used as homeless/quarantine/isolation centres during the current pandemic as well as during recent floods for the flood-affected persons. WRD chief engineer Pramod Badami told TOI, “As soon as I took over as chief engineer I looked into this project and held a meeting of the WRD officials and of the contractors. I have issued directives to complete work before December 2021. Also by the end of August we will inaugurate the cyclone shelters, which are in the process of completion. We are investigating the conditions responsible for the recent floods and landslides, as well as the mitigation measures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-misses-world-bank-deadline-for-cyclone-shelters/articleshow/85285455.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The statement was made by the minister in the backdrop of the demand from Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University (SRTM), Nanded, to allow physical classes, considering the contained spread of Covid in the district. “Both university officials and Nanded district administration told me that colleges can resume and they were willing to frame SOP for the same if the state government approves it. I have told them to hold a joint meeting to discuss modalities, including the possible percentage of classroom attendance. If the formula is acceptable, we will consider replicating it at the state-level,” he said. Nanded district has 57 active Covid cases with a lower positivity rate as compared to Marathwada. Samant, who began his official tour of Marathwada from Nanded by visiting SRTM University, however, did not elaborate on official plans to reopen colleges in Maharashtra. Earlier, in a formal event held at the university, the minister felicitated different Covid warriors including volunteers of the National Service Scheme and university students from the Microbiology department, who were part of Covid-related duties and services. “While the society at large was struck with panic during the early stages of the pandemic, Covid warriors led the battle against Covid from the front. We remain indebted to them for such courage and service towards the society,”he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nanded-can-frame-formula-for-reopening-of-colleges-says-minister/articleshow/85280793.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Narrow escape for bikers on potholed road in Salt Lake||KOLKATA: An accident was averted on Thursday morning, close to the same spot near Baisakhi Island in Salt Lake where a 25-year-old biker died after getting tangled in snapped cables on Wednesday evening, when two bikers skidded off the road after encountering potholes. Witnesses said the bikers had not been speeding since the stretch is already in a terrible state. One of the bikers almost fell, but managed to control the vehicle and rode off. However, the other could not control his bike and fell. He, fortunately, escaped with some minor bruises. “I don’t usually take this stretch and did not know the condition of this road is so bad. I will think twice before taking this road again,” said the biker who was heading for Sector V. Locals said such incidents were happening almost regularly due to the deteriorated state of the roads in the township. Patched up or repaired surfaces are breaking down within a short span of time and roads are developing large craters after heavy rain in many places. “The sudden potholes and craters cause problems for bikes and can cause accidents any time,” said Avik Raychaudhuri, a resident of GD Block. BMC officials said it could take up thorough road repair work only if there is a spell of dry weather after the monsoon. “As of now, we are conducting patchwork repairs,” said an official. BMC is making a list of places in Salt Lake where roads are deteriorating within a few months of being repaired and will take up the matter with the agencies engaged. The civic body will ask the agencies concerned to look after road maintenance for three years, failing which, action will be taken against them. “Roads are being repaired, but it is a waste of money if they get damaged in a short span of time. We are taking stock of the matter and will ask the contractors to maintain the roads properly for three years,” said BMC board of administrators’ chairperson Krishna Chakraborty. The civic authorities had recently taken up patchwork of roads in several places, especially the lanes inside blocks, using the Rs 30 crore sanctioned by the government. But work had to be stopped due to the incessant rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/narrow-escape-for-bikers-on-potholed-road/articleshow/85283252.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Delhi||7 Delhi Police officers get MHA medal of excellence||New Delhi: Seven Delhi Police personnel and five officers of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) have been awarded the Union home minister’s Medal for Excellence in Investigation for the year 2021. NCB zonal director KPS Malhotra has been awarded the medal for investigating international drug trafficking being carried on the Darknet and the “Kasaragod Network”, which led to the release of a young couple lodged in Qatar jail after being framed in a drug trafficking case. This case also opened the doors for diplomatic channels and signing of an MoU between India and Qatar. Malhotra, currently posted at the commissioner’s secretariat in Delhi Police, was earlier serving in Crime Branch where he carried out investigations in high-profile cases, including the ministry of petroleum and natural gas espionage case, EWS admission scam, Narayan Sai’s arrest and cases pertaining to the underworld. At NCB, Malhotra and his team busted the first Darknet vendor of psychotropic substances, who was using a VPN to evade law enforcement agencies. His IP address was tracked using invasive technologies. His team also busted the first Ethereum mining rig in India and a cyber-terror case. He also headed the SIT that investigated the drugs-related aspect in Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. The other officers awarded the medal include Sameer Vankhede, Rohit Shrivastava, Latchubugatha Sanyasi Babu and Ashish Ranjan. In Delhi Police, additional DCP Harshvardhan Mandwa received the medal for his probe into the recruitment scam in the examination conducted by Arunachal Pradesh Staff Selection Board. Inspector Satish Sharma from Delhi Police was awarded the medal posthumously for his investigation in the Batla House case. He had probed and prepared the chargesheet in the arrest of an accused, Shahzad, which was highly appreciated by various courts and the human rights commission. The court sentenced the accused to rigorous imprisonment for life. Later, another accused, Ariz Khan, was arrested and sentenced to death in the case. ACP Lamba and inspector Gurpreet from Crime Branch were awarded for their investigation in a Delhi riots case wherein head constable Ratan Lal was killed and others, including IPS officers, were grievously injured. In all, 22 accused were identified and arrested with the help of video stabilisation technology, enhancement and matching software. Inspector Virender Singh has been awarded for his probe in the DDA land pooling case where 250 people were duped of Rs 30 crore.

Executive engineer under scanner, Pramod Vasava, told the civic body’s top brass that he changed the list to accommodate names as instructed by an elected representative. Mayor Keyur Rokadia too mentioned that Vasava had claimed that he changed the names under pressure. However, Rokadia denied to divulge further details when asked if the pressure was from an elected member of VMC. Sources pointed out that the status of the corporator was a major reason why no names were being taken. Rokadia said that the probe was started after he and in-charge city engineer Shailesh Mistry received complaints over phone regarding change of beneficiaries after the draw. An elected representative also raised the issue with Mistry. On Monday, Rokadia ordered investigation into the allegations. “On Tuesday, Mistry confirmed that the list had been changed. We asked the MIS consultant about the change and he told us that it was done at the behest of Vasava who, in turn, claimed he did it under someone’s pressure,” the mayor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/did-a-corporator-influence-the-list/articleshow/85283760.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Safer mode of breast conservation surgery introduced in city||Nagpur: Doctors at Kingsway Hospital claim to have recently conducted the first-ever sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) of Central India. All the complications of breast conservation surgery were avoided in the technically advanced process. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the most common cause for cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. The treatment modality for breast cancer is either removal of the entire breast or breast conservation surgery. In the conventional method of conservation surgery, axillary lymph nodes (located under the armpit) are dissected. Due to this, many women suffer from decreased sensation in the back of the arm or armpit, tingling, numbness, stiffness, weakness, or lymphedema (swelling of the arm). The SNLB process helped avoid those issues. “In initial stage of cancer, SNLB helps to estimate the risk. If the sentinel node is negative for cancer, a patient may be able to avoid more extensive lymph node surgery. This reduces further complications, in case many lymph nodes are removed,” said surgical oncologist Dr Nitin Bomanwar. According to Bomanwar, advanced machines and skills are required for this type of surgery, which are now available in Nagpur. “In a particular case where we conducted surgery, the sentinel lymph node was negative for malignancy. So the breast conservation surgery was done and the axillary lymph node dissection was avoided. The patient had no axillary complications and was discharged on the third day,” he added. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging method was used for this surgery, which is standard practice in advanced surgical oncology in western countries. Assistant surgeon Dr Fahad Mulla, the anaesthesia team, operation theatre staff and technicians of Kingsway Hospital conducted the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/safer-mode-of-breast-conservation-surgery-introduced-in-city/articleshow/85285499.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The association has written to the chief secretary, chief minister, Goa governor and state commissioner for persons with disabilities regarding the same stating that there are over 3,000 deaf persons in the state. Section 3 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates equal opportunity and non-discrimination of persons with disabilities and Section 42 mandates that communication should be in accessible format for persons with disabilities, president of the association Avelino de Sa stated in the letter. “Last year, the state government had complied with the above for the Independence Day programmes,” de Sa stated. Following efforts of the association, Goa became the second state after Nagaland to have a sign language interpreter for the chief minister’s address to the state on the Independence Day in 2020, de Sa added. The association, which started 17 years ago, is working to bring people with disabilities into mainstream society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-must-have-sign-language-interpreters-for-i-day-events/articleshow/85285545.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||‘A responsible rider, didn’t deserve to die this way’||Kolkata: Putul Dhar (50) was still waiting for her elder son at her Ultadanga home with lunch served on a platter when her younger son broke the news that Subham had met with a fatal accident a few minutes ago when his bike skidded on a mesh of cable wires strewn on a Salt Lake road on Wednesday evening. Since then, she has been losing her consciousness time and again, unable to cope up with the grief of losing her “soft-spoken” and “bright” son. Subham Dhar was riding home on a bike when he suffered fatal head injuries after the front wheel of his motorcycle got caught in a mesh of cables lying on the road between Salt Lake's Baisakhi Island and Tank No. 4. He was flung off his bike and a water tanker ran over him. Dhar, a medical representative, was wearing a helmet but it had come off under the impact of the crash and he had died even before he could be taken to the hospital. TOI visited the Canal East Road slum in Ultadanga on Friday to find a pall of gloom settling down at the entire Potuapara neighbourhood where the youth used to stay with his younger brother and parents. He was about to get married to a woman living in the neighbourhood next year. The girl, too, has fallen sick since they got to know about his death. “He was a very bright and soft-spoken young man, contrary to the other youths in the neighbourhood. After completing graduation, he had started working as a medical representative and had taken up the responsibility of running the entire family,” said Moumita Pundit, one his relatives. Anjan Pal Chowdhury, who lives in the same neighbourhood, said Subham had been riding for the last seven years but had never met with even a minor accident. “He was a very responsible rider. He always used to have his helmet strapped on and rode at a safe speed. Why would he die such a death? Why won't the government or police do anything to clear the clutter of cables that took his life?” said Pal Chowdhury. Subham’s father is an electrician and mother used to work as a physiotherapist three years ago. His younger brother Sayan is still pursuing his graduation. “On Wednesday, he had taken his mother for an eye check-up and dropped her home in the afternoon. He had left the home for a quick meeting with his colleagues and had told her that he would be back home soon and would have lunch. Her mother served the food and had kept it covered while waiting for him. But he could never come back home,” said Dipen Shaw, a neighbour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-responsible-rider-didnt-deserve-to-die-this-way/articleshow/85283277.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Plan to phase out single-use plastic takes shape||NEW DELHI: With the first phase of eliminating single-use plastic and other related items slated to commence from September 30, the environment department and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) have come up with an Information Education and Communication (IEC) plan. This has been shared with urban local bodies and other agencies after the chief secretary’s approval. The final action plan, which would include ways to fine offenders and phase-out the usage of such items, would be ready by August 16. Local bodies have been asked to be ready for implementation with the assistance of RWAs, market associations and NGOs. “After a series of meetings over the last couple of months, an IEC plan was approved on Tuesday. This plan focuses on how awareness will be done on eliminating plastic bags that are of less than 120 microns. Other plastics not on the list of prohibited items also need to be reduced and each urban local body and department has been given a set target,” said an official. A senior DPCC official said the final plan to eliminate certain plastic items would be ready by August 16, with agencies asked to be ready by September 30 to ensure plastic bags less than 120 microns are not available compared with the existing 50 microns. The Centre had asked for single-use plastic items to be eliminated from across the country in three phases. In Phase-II starting from January 1, 2022, the sale and manufacture of earbuds, plastic sticks, balloons, plastic flags, candy sticks and polystyrene (thermocol) would be stopped. From July 1, 2022, 13 items, including plastic plates, cups, glasses and other cutlery, would be phased out. Ashish Jain, founder and director of Indian Pollution Control Association, an NGO working on the elimination of plastic waste, said it had been four years since the Prime Minister took a pledge in the United Nations assembly to eliminate single-use plastic from the country, but very little time was left now to achieve the target. “We are still struggling to define single-use plastic and find alternate solutions for it. However, working together can help bring solutions forward,” said Jain, whose NGO has launched an awareness drive at Sadar Bazar to sensitise shopkeepers on reducing plastic waste and consumption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plan-to-phase-out-single-use-plastic-takes-shape/articleshow/85285566.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Pune||Can cover all by December-end using only domestic vaccine supply: NTAGI chief||PUNE: Negotiations over indemnity may delay availability of foreign vaccines, but India can cover its adult population by year-end just by using domestic supply, a top central official has said. Foreign manufacturers — Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson — want protection from legal action if their shots trigger side effects. But India's negotiators are insisting there should be a clause. The ongoing talks may delay actual availability. NK Arora, chairman of the Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), said focus is on to make full use of domestic production and supply. “The country has not been dependent on foreign vaccines so far. We will be able to vaccinate the whole adult population by the end of this year with domestic supply. A plan has been drawn out,” Arora told TOI on Thursday. If foreign manufacturers are given indemnity, it will apply to domestic manufacturers too. On the domestic supply plan, Arora said there is a commitment of 135 crore doses till December 2021. He said, “In the coming weeks, Zydus Cadila's ZyCOV-D vaccine will hopefully be given emergency use authorisation. And over the next few months, two more shots should be available: Corbevax from Biological E and the mRNA shot from Gennova. The estimated number of doses to be available till December 2021 has not taken into account any imported vaccine dose.” On Covid shots for children, he said drives may start by the first quarter of 2022 — only after the adult programme is over. Three trials are ongoing to test the shots in children, he added. “The July 2021 sero survey shows children are as exposed as adults. But children below 10 make up just 3% of all the symptomatic patients, which means they mostly have asymptomatic or at the most, mild infection. It is expected that paediatric immunisation will be taken up in the first quarter of 2022,” Arora said. He also said there’s currently no plan to reduce the interval (84 days) between two Covishield doses. Studies from across the country, he said, show some given one or both jabs of Covishield have gone on to contract Covid. “But these infections are mild and mostly need neither hospitalisation nor oxygen or ventilator support," Arora said. He said the Centre is also set to deploy National Vaccine Tracker (NVT), which will monitor effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines — by type and beneficiary status (partial or complete) — across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/can-cover-all-by-dec-end-using-only-domestic-vaccine-supply-ntagi-chief/articleshow/85285541.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Traders based in the city have said that many employees have received their first dose. The government should now ensure adequate supply to complete second doses at the scheduled time, they said. Over 30,000 members have registered with the Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP) for vaccines. FTAP secretary Mahendra Pitaliya said, “We are ready to complete employees’ vaccination, but the supply is not consistent. The vaccine has not been available for the last four days. Also, on some days, the PMC supplies only 200 to 300 vaccine doses. This is hampering the vaccination process. About 7,000 employees have been completely vaccinated. Most employees in the18-44 age group are still to get first or second doses. We are demanding for consistent supply so that the vaccination process is completed at the earliest.” Sachin Nivangune of the Pune District Retailers Association said that the supply of vaccine must be streamlined. “Shopkeepers cannot spend Rs800 to vaccinate employees as they are already running in losses. Hence, most traders depend on supply from the government,” he added. Meanwhile, the authorities from Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) said that 60% of people associated with APMC, which include commission agents, employees, workers and porters, have been completely vaccinated. The APMC has established communication with PMC-run centres to complete the vaccination of stakeholders. Besides, a dedicated camp has been set up at the APMC premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traders-seek-more-doses-to-inoculate-employees/articleshow/85285576.cms||Sarang Dastane

Sawant said that 93 houses will be reconstructed as part of this relief programme. He added that the contractor will design a house which can be built within two months at a cost of Rs 4 lakh. The contractor will share the design with the people, Sawant said during a function organised for electronic fund transfer of the compensation to those affected by the flood. Around 5,000 houses were damaged in the floods last month, the chief minister said, adding that a separate team has been constituted to investigate the reason. Sawant said that after assessment of the damage to houses, three types of losses were identified. Those whose houses are damaged will get Rs 50,000 or Rs 1 lakh to take up repair work. Sawant said that those who have not been called for the function will get their cheques at their respective taluka headquarters. The chief minister said that the state government will take all necessary steps to avoid such disasters in the future. He urged any person who has not yet availed the state government’s relief, to approach authorities as the state government doesn’t want to deprive anyone. Sawant said that they have approached the Union government to get funds to provide relief to those people whose agricultural activities were badly affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rs-4l-house-in-2-months-for-flood-hit-homeless-cm/articleshow/85285571.cms||---

The unplanned digging of roads during the ongoing monsoon season is posing a serious threat to commuters. The recent rains not only left many areas inundated, but the dug-up roads also turned into life-threatening zones. On Thursday, the PHED started fresh digging in Tilak Nagar area. People have been criticising the civic body officials for allowing digging of roads and taking up such works during the monsoon season. Rama Jain, a resident said, “While repair work of previously dug-up roads is not properly done, the agencies have started fresh digging. With the recent rains, open trenches in other lanes have gone deeper and bigger and are posing a threat to two-wheeler riders.” A PHED official, however, said, “The project is already delayed due to various reasons and department is working to meet the deadline. The road cutting amount has been deposited at the JMC and repair will be started soon after the monsoon is over.” Few locals supported the project of laying new pipelines, but not the timing. Devendra Singh, a resident of Tilak Nagar, said laying pipelines was a good idea as the lines of PHED are really old and needed to be changed, but digging at this time is risky as people cannot see the dug-up roads due to waterlogging during the monsoon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fresh-digging-of-roads-adds-to-residents-woes/articleshow/85285570.cms||---

Students should apply online from August 13 to 23. Students should submit filled in application along with the marks memo of SSC examinations and other necessary documents. Students can choose the group and college of preference. Board authorities said admissions made in offline mode would be considered as invalid. BIEAP said it has taken the offline issue seriously. It is heading to initiate stringent action. “We have directed colleges not to go for offline admissions. But we are receiving a number of complaints that colleges have completed admissions. Offline admissions will be considered illegal and strict action will be taken. Parents should apply online for admission,” board secretary V Rama Krishna said. Meanwhile, students who have already taken admissions in the private colleges are in limbo with the board’s decision.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Reopening indecision puts schools & families on edge||PUNE: The confusion over reopening of schools has left institutions, students and parents fretting over planning of classes. Last week, education minister Varsha Gaikwad had announced that in-person classes would commence in rural areas for students from Standard V to VIII and classes will be held for students from Stds VIII to XII. SOPs were issued on Tuesday for the reopening. But on Wednesday, health minister Rajesh Tope said the task force members were opposed to reopening schools as they were apprehensive about students not being vaccinated and sought to avoid any kind of risk. Schools said they were just getting ready to reopen with all the safety norms, scheduling shifts of staff and facilitating arrangements for reopening, and the decision to not reopen has taken them by surprise. Parents and students said their planning had collapsed with respect to managing the transportation and their work from home timings. At the same time, education activists said the government should have better coordination between themselves regarding the reopening and announce it only after proper planning. Director of a school in Nigdi, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We had just started to sanitise the school, get ready for signboards, had given the board for printing, put up a detailed schedule for staff considering alternate attendance and many other preparations. All of a sudden, we are now told the schools won’t reopen putting a break on all our preparations and causing financial loss.” Spokesperson of the Aam Aadmi Party Party, Pune unit, Mukund Kirdat, said there is no coordination between the task force and the ministers. “The education department announced it would reopen and the government instructed them to cancel the decision in two days. The guidelines drafted by the education department were also very weak and the entire responsibility was shouldered upon the local governments and the education commissioner,” he added. Others said the government did not seem serious about improving vaccination nor was it taking strong steps to improve education-related issues, curriculum, evaluation which was very shocking and frustrating for the parents of students. A parent of a Std VIII student, Ashima Choudhary, said, “The moment we start preparing to take decisions regarding sending our daughter to school there is a change. It is so frustrating to schedule and reschedule things as we are already working from home and have our office schedules fixed. The planning by the government is extremely poor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/reopening-indecision-puts-schools-families-on-edge/articleshow/85285621.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

While the police have not ruled out the possibility of sexual assault, the investigators said they were waiting for a post-mortem report (PMR) to shed more light on the case. Till late Thursday night, local residents of the area were protesting outside the police station, refusing to claim the body and demanding immediate arrest of the suspect. A posse of senior police officials was trying to pacify the protesters, assuring a swift probe in the case. Sharma said that while the girl’s body was found on Thursday morning, she was missing from her house since Wednesday late evening. “Her father left the house on Wednesday evening to go to a cattle shed. His daughter said that she would accompany him too, but she did not. When the father returned, he found the girl missing,” Sharma said, adding that the father went to Narena police station on Thursday morning and filed a complaint. Around the same time, a local resident spotted the girl’s body near the pond. “A post-mortem was conducted under the supervision of the medical board. We are waiting for the medical team’s report on the nature of the death. However, the preliminary investigation indicates it was not a natural death, nor does it appear to be a case of death due to drowning,” he said, adding that Jaipur police have set up special teams to look into the case. The police said that the pond where her body was found is located about three km away from her house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4-year-old-girl-found-dead-in-narena-cops-suspect-murder/articleshow/85285604.cms||---
---||Goa||War of words continues, Lobo hits back at Mauvin for ‘ignoring’ waste||Panaji: Waste management minister Michael Lobo and transport minister Mauvin Godinho are at loggerheads with each other over the installation of taxi meters. The war of words which started on Tuesday continued on Thursday with Lobo hitting out at Godinho. “Whatever he (Godinho) is thinking, same he wants to execute. When the age of a person increases, at the same time his knowledge has to increase, but sometimes when age increases, he becomes rancid,” Lobo said. It should not harm the party’s prospects in the upcoming assembly election, he said. Lobo said that the party formed the government for the people and not for Godinho, and that Godinho had come to BJP from Congress and the party had accepted him. “You (Godinho) should not become a burden on Goans,” he said. The waste management minister said that Godinho worked fast in the interest of automobile dealers and slashed 50% road tax on purchase of new vehicles, but he does not provide free meter to taxi operators. Lobo said that he is a junior minister and Godinho is a senior minister, and hence requested him to provide 100% subsidy and not harass the taxi operators. “Don’t hurt the Goans who have elected us, and instead resolve their issues,” Lobo said. He said that if we don’t help Goans then it can have an adverse effect on the upcoming elections and the results could be like 2017 assembly polls. Lobo said that a taxi meter costs Rs 11,500 and the transport department gives only Rs 8,000, and further asked who will pay the remaining money to the taxi operators. He also said that 99% of taxis are on loan and instead of helping them, the minister wants them to pay and reimburse later. The waste management minister said that the operators are ready to install meters, but they don’t have the money to pay for it. Lobo said that he has not spoken against Godinho. “I am not interfering in the transport department,” he said. Lobo reiterated his request and urged chief minister Pramod Sawant to provide free meters to taxi operators Reacting to Godinho’s statement to first take care of the garbage and then comment on other departments, Lobo said that his department has treated the waste which was lying for years in Mormugao taluka. Lobo said that Godinho, who claims to be a tall leader, has not treated waste in his own constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/war-of-words-continues-lobo-hits-back-at-mauvin-for-ignoring-waste/articleshow/85285598.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Rescue operations by teams of the Indian Coast Guard and the local fire brigade was on till late on Thursday night. According to sources, the incident occurred when the labourers were working inside the chimney at the height of 45-foot doing painting work inside. “A scaffolding made out of iron pipes was erected inside the chimney for this purpose. However, the scaffolding collapsed due to some unknown reasons and six labourers fell down from the height of at least 40 feet,” said Porbandar district collector AM Sharma. “The fire brigade and Indian Coast Guard teams are engaged in rescue work. A chopper has been engaged by coast guard. Two teams of NDRF (National Disaster Response Force) are also pushed into service,” he added. “Six workers are currently trapped inside the chimney under the metal debris of the scaffolding,” said Sharma. Camera-mounted drones were sent inside the chimney to locate the workers and establish contact with them, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/six-trapped-inside-chimney-of-factory/articleshow/85283361.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Many restaurants in malls likely to reopen soon||Pune: A bulk of restaurants in the seven city-based malls are likely to reopen between this weekend and the next. “Almost 60% of restaurants in the malls are closed as of now despite the withdrawal ofsome curbs. This is because a lot of resto service staff are still unavailable. Many of them are expected to join work by this Friday or Saturday, when many restaurants in the malls are likely to restart operations,” Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, chief operating officer of Amanora Mall, told TOI on Thursday. Rajpurohit, who is also a member of the Shopping Centres Association of India, said, “There’s a feeling that the authorities may extend the mall operation deadlines in Pune to 10pm as per the state’s latest Break the Chain order. If this happens, then it could be an impetus for most of restaurants in the malls to reopen.” The centre director at another large city-based mall said almost 50% of restaurants in the facility were still closed. “We think many more may open by this weekend and or next week. After the first round of curbs were lifted, almost 70% of restaurants had reopened in malls. This is likely to happen this time too, mostly by month-end. Many restaurants are currently waiting and watching,” he said. A restaurateur said, “Some large restaurant brands are assessing the situation to see that nothing contrary to what is being claimed by the authorities happens in the next few days. It has to make business sense at the end of the day.” The marketing manager at another mall in the Shivajinagar area told TOI, “Another reason why many restaurants have not opened is because of the rule on double vaccination of the mall staffers. Big retail stores have 100-200 employees and they can choose a good number of fully vaccinated staffers from among them to work at the outlet.” The manager said, “This rule poses a problem for quick service restaurants, where the staff is limited. The number of fully vaccinated people in such outlets is low as most of their staffers are in the 18-44 age group and became eligible for the vaccine in May.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/many-restos-in-malls-likely-to-reopen-soon/articleshow/85285614.cms||Neha Madaan

According to police records, the FIRs were registered at Moti Doongri, Kho Nagoriyan, Sanganer, Adarsh Nagar in the zone, Kalwar, Bhankrota, Jhotwara in western zone and Ramganj in Jaipur north. In some cases, the incident had taken place on Tuesday but the FIR was filed a day later on Wednesday. Most of the vehicles stolen included bikes, but a car from Laxmi Narayanpuri area under Ramganj police station and an auto-rickshaw from Galata gate police station area were also reported. A resident of Varun Path area alleged in his FIR to Mansarover police station, that thieves stole his bike from his house. The police said they were examining the CCTV cameras of locations where thefts took place. Jaipur police had conducted an examination of all major hotspots of areas where vehicle lifting was most rampant. The survey revealed that Pratap Nagar and Jawahar Circle were major hot spots of auto thefts. “Most of the accused involved in auto thefts are youths. Many of them are addicted to narcotic substances. Vehicle lifting is a lowrisk venture for such youths. It pays for their addictions,” an official told TOI, adding that besides stealing cars and bikes, the same accused may have also been involved in snatching cases. “If they could not get their hands on a car or bike, they snatch chains and mobile phones from pedestrians,” the official added. Jaipur police said they had issued notices to nearly 1,133 ‘hardcore addicts.’ The exercise was undertaken after police found many of them could participate in crimes. “We have a database of such people and they are under constant supervision,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/19-vehicle-theft-cases-in-jaipur-in-one-day/articleshow/85285597.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Experts praise Raj for empowering girl child||Jaipur: Health experts have praised state government’s efforts in safeguarding and empowering adolescents for leading the charge in promoting girl children. However, they pointed out that much is still at stake, especially as the Covid pandemic and its associated lockdowns and school closures have taken an enormous toll on teenagers. Dr Shobhita Rajagopal, professor, Institute of Development Studies, Jaipur, said, “Especially during this pandemic, adolescents’ issues must not be neglected and must receive a greater investment of resources so that the youth can have unhindered access to health information and services.” Programmes such as the Mukhya Mantri Rajshree Yojana aim to improve indicators such as maternal mortality, infant mortality and child sex ratio and experts say that the need of the hour is for the state to continue building on its existing achievements. Rajasthan is the only state with a policy for girl children and the state has spearheaded several campaigns for resolving issues related to the adolescent population. “Adolescent health is an area which if addressed compassionately in a mission mode can advance the overall health and wealth of the nation. In 2020, legislators, bureaucrats and academicians in the state took part in the social media campaign — ‘Zero Teenage Pregnancy’. This kind of hand-holding adds a much-needed impetus to problem solving,” said Dr Amita Kashyap, senior professor (PSM), SMS Medical College. This work is particularly relevant because as per the Census 2011, Rajasthan’s adolescent population is currently pegged at 23 per cent of the total population of 6.86 crore. Divya Santhanam, Senior State Program Manager at Population Foundation of India, said, “We collaborate with key stakeholders on the need for and means to promote adolescent reproductive and sexual health (ARSH) in Rajasthan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/experts-praise-raj-for-empowering-girl-child/articleshow/85285648.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nandurbar third district in Maharashtra to be Covid free||NASHIK: The decline in Covid cases in many parts of Maharashtra has started reflecting in districts becoming free of the infectious disease. On Thursday, the tribal-dominated district of Nandurbar in North Maharashtra became Covid-free, the third in the state after Bhandara and Dhule. The overall decline in cases has resulted in ten districts in the state — Amravati, Akola, Washim, Buldhana, Wardha, Gondia, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Hingoli and Nanded — showing less than 100 active cases on Wednesday night. Covid cases in Nandurbar district had become a cause of concern during the second wave of the pandemic. The last Covid patient in Nandurbar was discharged from a private hospital in Nandurbar town on Wednesday afternoon. Nandurbar has a population of over 16 lakh. “The second wave of the pandemic was deadly in our district as compared to the first one. The local administration rose to the occasion to curb the spread of the virus,” district guardian minister K C Padavi told TOI. Padavi admitted that the administration had initially faced infrastructure and manpower constraints due to a sharp rise in daily cases during the second wave. “The state government extended a helping hand by providing funds to ramp up medical infrastructure in the district. People too followed the restrictions imposed,” he said. The first wave in Nandurbar, which unfolded on April 17, saw 9,523 Covid cases. But in the second wave, the total cases were 28177, three times more. Even the death toll in the second wave (726) was much higher than that in the first (224). “Nandurbar was one of the Covid hotspots in April-May this year, when the active cases were over 9,000. There were days when the daily positive cases were over 1,200. We had shortage of beds at Nandurbar civil hospital, which is one of the main Covid treatment facilities in the district. We will have to continue with the vigil since there is a prediction of a third wave,” said district civil surgeon Dr Ragunath Bhoye. They faced the challenge of convincing tribals with Covid-like symptoms to get tested and treated for the disease. However, former district collector Dr Rajendra Bharud, along with the health department, deployed field staff to undertake vigorous contact tracing in villages and isolated patients with no or mild symptoms at village schools and other facilities. The administration stopped home isolation of patients. IAS officer Manisha Khatri recently replaced Bharud as the district collector. “Nandurbar was the only district in North Maharashtra that had a Covid care train at the railway station to admit and treat mild Covid patients since the Covid Care Centres in the district were full,” recalled Bhoye. Additional civil surgeon Dr Kantrao Satpute said that vigorous testing and tracing of contacts of positive patients for over four months this year yielded results. “We are presently undertaking over 500 tests daily but we will immediately ramp up testing if fresh cases start emerging in the district,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nandurbar-third-district-in-state-to-be-covid-free/articleshow/85281016.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Pune||Woman with complications travels 122km to Pune for cure||PUNE: Lack of proper health infrastructure and skilled doctors at civic as well as state-run hospitals in Ahmednagar forced a 20-year-old woman to cover a distance of 122km and come to Pune for seeking urgent medical intervention for her inside-out uterus, which kept protruding through the vagina for seven days after her normal delivery. The woman had delivered the baby at Ahmednagar civic-run Deshpande hospital at 1am on July 17. She had unusually rapid (precipitate) labour that led to spontaneous expulsion of the infant vaginally. “The possibility of attachment of the placenta towards the woman’s spine and short cord might have led to uterine inversion, a potentially life-threatening complication of childbirth,” said Sassoon hospital’s gynaecologist, Shilpa Naik. Normally, the placenta detaches from the uterus and exits the vagina around half an hour after the baby is delivered. Uterine inversion means the placenta remains attached, and its exit pulls the uterus inside-out. Since the doctors at Deshpande hospital couldn’t handle the complication, they referred the woman to bigger hospitals in Ahmednagar city, including a medical college hospital. According to the woman’s mother, the medical college hospital refused to admit and treat her. The woman was finally admitted to the state-run Civil hospital around 8am on July 18. “Doctors at Civil hospital admitted her, but could not fix the problem for seven days for want of equipment and skilled doctors,” said the woman’s mother. Later, the doctors gave her resuscitative management at the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU) and put her on higher antibiotics to avoid complications arising out of hospital infection. When contacted, Satish Rajurkar, chief of the Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation’s health department, said, “We do not have ICU back-up. Hence, we refer such complicated cases needing tertiary care to Civil hospital.” Civil surgeon Sunil Pokharna, head of the Civil hospital in Ahmednagar, said, “We have gynaecologists but the post of the physician is yet to be filled. The opinion of a physician matters in certain cases where other medical conditions are involved, in addition to uterine inversion.” The woman was kept in the Civil hospital’s ICU for seven days and later referred to the Sassoon hospital in Pune on July 24. “By the time, she was moved to the Sassoon hospital, she had already developed sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body’s response to an infection damages its own tissues,” said Sassoon hospital’s senior gynaecologist Ramesh Bhosale. Doctors then carried out laparotomy, a surgery to open up her abdomen, and reposited the uterus and saved the woman’s life. “We managed to conserve her uterus despite all the problems,” Bhosale said. “Obstetric emergencies need timely, skilful and expert management to decrease mortality and morbidity. Timely referrals are key to the outcome of such cases. Private-public partnerships, the help of obstetrician in practice could have helped this mother,” said Sassoon hospital’s dean Muralidhar Tambe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-with-complications-travels-122km-to-pune-for-cure/articleshow/85285643.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Jaipur||Organ donation awareness drive across Rajasthan from today||JAIPUR: Organ donation programme in the state has been hit badly because of the pandemic. Taking it on a serious note, the State Organ Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) is launching an awareness campaign in which it will encourage people to take pledge to donate organs. In the past two years, the state has reported only 10 cadaveric organ donations. On November 28 last year, the state had reported its 39th cadaveric organ donation and in the next eight months, just three more organ donations took place. Launching the programme from Friday (World Organ Donation Day), the SOTTO will encourage the medical students of MBBS 1st year and 2nd year batches to take pledge to donate their organs. On Saturday, doctors on the call of SOTTO will take out a cycle rally, in which it is expected that more than 200 doctors will pedal their bicycles with an aim to generate awareness on organ donation to speed up the transplant programme. “We are trying to ensure that more than 1,500 people take pledge of organ donation in the city in the next three days, before Independence Day,” said Dr Manish Sharma, coordinator, SOTTO. Officials said during Covid pandemic, cadaveric organ transplant remained badly affected as even elective surgeries were avoided during the period and people need to be more aware about it. “People are still hesitant about donating organs, so a huge gap exists between transplants awaited and organs available. The entire process depends on certain medical parameters of a donor. As per statistics, one organ donor has the potential to save more than eight lives in a lifetime by donating organs that are functioning properly,” said Dr Sandeep Gupta, additional director, urology, andrology and kidney transplant surgery at a private hospital. Organ donation can happen either from a living donor or a donor who is brain dead. Living donors can donate some of their organs and tissues such as a kidney or part of the liver, part of the pancreas, part of the lungs, or part of the intestines, but most donations occur after the death of the donor. Usually, organs that can be transplanted are kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas, intestines, lungs, bones,bone marrow, skin, and corneas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/organ-donation-awareness-drive-across-raj-from-today/articleshow/85285675.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||UT takes up population mismatch with Government of India||CHANDIGARH: The UT health department has taken up the discrepancy in total beneficiaries with Government of India (GoI) again. UT adviser Dharam Pal said, “I have already spoken with the Union secretary of health and he has assured to make the correction. However, till now, we have not received anything on this.” The UT health department has also added 17% to the census of 2011 for the last one decade rise but this still does not match with the government of India’s record of 15 lakh population (above 18 years of age) for Chandigarh. The GoI is taking a baseline of 15 lakh as the number of target beneficiaries. “We don't have that much population. We have a voter list of around 6.9 lakh. This is the latest 18 plus data. There is nothing more accurate than that. We have taken projections of 7.26 lakh as our target, which is still on the higher side,” said the adviser. He added, “The Centre is applying some formulas on the 2011 census and projections are being made. Nobody is looking at the fact whether those projections are correct. It cannot be uniformly applied to all the cities. Growth rate of each city is different.” According to the latest vaccination coverage data in the city, 98.22% of the beneficiaries have been given the first dose, while 32% have been given the second. “We have correct figures. So on that front, we should be able to touch 99.9% second dose coverage by August 15. For the second dose completion, the deadline is December 15. However, we will continue vaccination thereafter as many are coming from outside the city as well,” said Pal. If the current GoI figure is taken, Chandigarh is placed on the sixth slot for its first dose coverage. Dadra and Nagar Haveli has achieved 95% of their target and are at the top slot, while Lakshadweep, Sikkim, Goa and Ladakh are ahead of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-takes-up-population-mismatch-with-goi/articleshow/85283421.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: 36 years on, SIT probing anti-Sikh riots in Kanpur finds evidence of killings||KANPUR: More than 36 years after the anti-Sikh riots that singed the country following the assassination of the then PM Indira Gandhi, a special investigation team (SIT) formed by the UP government has found evidence of the murder of father-son duo in an unlocked part of a house of Kanpur. The SIT has found human remains of the two victims killed by rioters from the house in Dabhauli area of the city. The team had visited the site on Tuesday. According to SIT SSP, Balendu Bhushan Singh, on November 1, 1984, rioters had attacked house number 28 in L block of Dabhauli. After killing businessman Tej Pratap Singh and his son Satyaveer Singh, their bodies were set afire. An FIR was registered in the Govind Nagar police station but the police closed the case after putting a final report in it. Now, when the SIT started the investigation, one after the other evidence came to the fore. “The crime scene was not disturbed. The FSL team which accompanied us established that murders took place at the spot,” Bhushan said. According to SIT sources, the new occupants to which the house was sold after the victims’ family moved to Delhi, reportedly kept to the first floor, keeping the rooms on the ground floor associated with the killings locked. The SSP said that when the forensic team reached the spot on Tuesday, human blood stains were found there. Signs of arson were also found on the burnt doors and walls. The investigation team has collected this evidence. The SSP said that no documents related to this case were found. “Therefore it was not being investigated earlier,” he said. The state government had set up SIT on February 5, 2019, to inquire into the circumstances leading to the riots in which at least 127 people were killed in Kanpur. The team was set up after the apex court issued notice to the state government in August 2017 on a petition seeking SIT probe into the riots. When Inspector Sunil Awasthi and Kamlesh Kumar went to Delhi in connection with the investigation of other cases, they met Satyaveer Singh’s son Charanjit Singh, now 61. He was an eyewitness in the incident and narrated the whole incident and provided the copy of the FIR lodged in the case. Then this case was also included in the investigation, added SSP. The four-member SIT is headed by retired UP DGP Atul. The other members are retired district judge Subhash Chandra Agarwal and retired additional director (prosecution) Yogeshwar Krishna Srivastava. SP Balendu Bhushan Singh is its member-secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/36-yrs-on-sit-probing-anti-sikh-riots-in-kanpur-finds-evidence-of-killings/articleshow/85287735.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Chargesheet by ED against former MLA in bank scam||Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate has filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) against former MLA Vivekanand Patil and the Karnala Nagari Sahakari Bank (KNSBL) in Panvel in the over Rs 500-crore money laundering case. Patil, of the Peasants and Workers Party, is the bank’s ex-chairman. The ED probe began based on an FIR registered by the police in 2019. Patil was arrested on June 15 and is in jail. The ED said Patil had been defrauding the bank using 67 fictitious loan accounts since 2008. The money would be withdrawn in cash from those accounts and deposited into 12 accounts linked to the Karnala Charitable Trust and Karnala Sports Academy, founded and controlled by Patil, who used it to build assets like sports academy, schools and so on. Patil would ensure money was re-deposited in the accounts so that they did not turn into NPAs. Patil, who controlled the bank management, got the loans sanctioned without collateral. The ED found Rs 560 crore (including interest) had been siphoned off. The fraud came to light after an RBI audit in 2019-20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-chargesheet-by-ed-against-former-mla-in-bank-scam/articleshow/85287740.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||India||Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman exit may give collegium space to discuss Supreme Court judge picks||NEW DELHI: Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, the second most senior Supreme Court judge, retired on Thursday marking the exit of a brilliant legal mind from the judiciary’s highest echelon, which is palpably stuttering with 10 vacancies that could largely be attributed to his firm stand on the elevation of two high court chief justices to the top court. Chief Justice of India N V Ramana said, “I am losing a lion of a judge”, which is true both in reality and metaphorically. Seldom does the SC gets a judge whose assertiveness, arising from his profound knowledge in domestic and foreign laws, cowers arguing counsels into putting their best foot forward in court. A Leo, he could seldom hide his exasperation at mediocrity, though he had it much under control for the last seven years, since his appointment as a SC judge directly from the bar on July 7, 2014. But the respect for his knowledge and intellectual integrity flowed unhesitatingly from solicitor general Tushar Mehta to seasoned senior advocates and green horns alike and his ceremonial farewell went for an unprecedented 35 minutes. Unprecedentedly, Justice Nariman did not speak a word except acknowledging the farewell wishes. If lawyers mourned the exit of a brilliant judge, those aspiring for an SC judgeship would rejoice as his retirement could give tailwind to selection of judges by the collegium, which had failed to recommend a single name to the government since August 28, 2019. Insiders say that Justice Nariman would stoutly stall the collegium from recommending any name without his choices and his retirement will give the five-judge panel the space to deliberate on candidates. Justice Nariman probably inherited a liking for the legal profession as he grew up in the care of his father Fali S Nariman, who was one of the most sought after lawyers for four decades since becoming an additional solicitor general under the Indira Gandhi government and then scaled new heights by stepping down on declaration of Emergency in 1975. Once he joined the profession in 1979, Rohinton assiduously honed his skills, acumen and acquired a wide knowledge in both domestic and foreign laws and jurisprudence. Carving out a niche for himself in the corporate, company and taxation fields, he built his own aweworthy image, consciously moving away from the shadows of his father’s towering personality. He baulked at any comparison with his father. He had figured in TOI’s 2010 compilation of top 10 advocates of the SC alongside his father, Soli J Sorbjee, Ram Jethmalani, K Parasaran, K K Venugopal, Ashok Desai, Harish Salve, A M Singhvi and Mukul Rohatgi (Kapil Sibal and a few others were left out as they were ministers and law officers at that time). He authored the 2015 judgment that struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act and was part of the majority in a constitution bench judgment that opened the gates of Sabarimala temple to women of all ages, and another that struck down ‘triple talaq’. In a career spanning a little over seven years on the SC bench, Justice Nariman is credited with the impressive figure of disposing of more than 13,500 cases and authoring nearly 400 judgments. He was one of the few judges who seldom kept verdicts reserved for more than a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/justice-rohinton-fali-nariman-exit-may-give-collegium-space-to-discuss-supreme-court-judge-picks/articleshow/85290075.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The elderly woman is now staying at Sakhi centre. On getting information, district collector Lok Bandhu went to the centre and met the woman Madan Kanwar and assured her of fair action. He directed to get her maintenance allowance. Kanwar (65), a resident of Kusip village, has been residing at Sakhi centre in Barmer for the last five days. She left the house due to harassment and torture by her son. Her only son Narpat Singh and daughter-inlaw Mamta Kanwar allegedly have been harassing her for the last many years. Some part of her land and plot were sold and to acquire the remaining, she was being harassed. Two days ago, she reached SP Anand Sharma and narrated her ordeal. SP Anand Shama said that the elderly woman had come to him and he had bound her son and daughterin-law, but the elderly woman does not want to go back to her son and therefore, she is staying at Sakhi centre. Centre counsellor Imarti said that Madan Kanwar is very scared and she said that if she goes back home, then she will be killed. She is so scared that she is not able to meet her daughters. Lok Bandhu met the elderly woman at the centre and directed to get her the allowance. Madan told the collector that for the last five days, she is staying at the Sakhi centre. Collector called the Siwana SDO and directed to immediately sanction the amount under Elderly Maintenance Act. He also told the tehsildar to get her the right on her share of the native land. Lok Bandhu directed women and child development department Dy director Prahalad Singh Rajpurohit to provide help to Madan Kanwar by coordinating with all the concerned officers. In the meantime, the district collector inspected the Sakhi kendra one-stop centre and took stock of the arrangements and gave necessary directions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-wife-beat-up-mother-throw-her-out-of-home-collector-assures-action/articleshow/85285710.cms||---

Their mother Sunita Devi had no option but to take this step as from the savings of her late husband Sunit Singh she could manage only basic needs of the family. Sunit succumbed to suspected Covid-19 on April 17. However, as the family had no Covid certificate or medical report to establish their claim they failed to avail the UP government aid meant for orphans. Similarly, Shashi Pandey, mother of two, is left heartbroken following a phone call which informed her that her application for the government aid for her children has been rejected as she failed to provide her deceased husband Vinay Pandey’s Covid certificate. According to the district probation office, Lucknow, there are over 2,500 orphans in the state capital alone who don’t have Covid certificate to avail government aid. Speaking to TOI, DPO, Lucknow, Vikas Singh said, “On August 6, V Hekali Zhimomi, principal secretary, child development and nutrition, UP, issued fresh orders in which all orphans (irrespective of the cause of death of guardian/parents) ---from March 1, 2020—will be eligible for government aid.” “The applicants can contact DPO office via WhatsApp and phone (75180 24019) or can reach office (room 34B, Lucknow collectorate) to get their queries addressed and file application under UP mukhyamantri bal vikas yojana samanya for the financial aid. Those orphans whose forms were earlier rejected, also need to file fresh applications. All applications will be processed and the sum will be transferred within 30 days from the date of filing application,” said officer Vikas Singh. Under the government financial aid scheme, the orphan with Covid certificate will be provided Rs 4,000 per month as well as laptop/tabloid after class IX for online classes, while orphans without Covid documents will be given Rs 2,500 per month. Further, orphan students who have cleared intermediate and will pursue or are pursuing undergraduate, diploma courses or students who have excelled in NEET, JEE or CLAT will receive financial benefit till they attain the age of 23. Meanwhile, the DPO said, “By next week a task force led by DM will take a decision as to what has to be done for private school fees. An order will be issued to DIOS and BSA for the same. Currently, all government schools have waived the fee for orphan students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/orphans-sans-covid-cert-need-to-apply-afresh-for-aid/articleshow/85287766.cms||Arvind Chauhan

One more kid in Churu has been diagnosed with the same disorder.The Parliamentary group submitted a memorandum to Mandaviya, drawing his attention to the urgent need for prioritisation of treatment for patients, diagnosed with group 3(a) rare genetic conditions. “Despite the notification of the much-awaited National Policy for Rare Diseases 2021 in March this year, these patients continue to be at grave risk due to the lack of any sustainable funding mechanism for treatment,” the MPs said.Led by Dr Fauzia Khan and her party colleague from the NCP Vandana Chavan, the memorandum was signed by MPs from several states, including Maharashtra, Kerala, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Rajasthan and Gujarat, to name a few.“We would like to draw your immediate attention towards the need to prioritise treatment for at least the ultra-rare diseases – treatable conditions which have an even lesser prevalence as compared to others; and for which the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approved therapies are available in India,” the memorandum stated, requesting the Union health and family welfare minister to (a) Extend the Umbrella Scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN) to all group 3(a) patients with treatable conditions, and (b) Transfer the unspent funds from the previous years’ budgetary allocation to provide treatment for eligible patients diagnosed with treatable conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/23-rs-mps-meet-union-min-for-kids-with-rare-diseases/articleshow/85285698.cms||---

The scheme, which was supposed to end in March this year, has been extended and will close on August 31. Vendors selected by the government for this scheme said the sudden rise in photovoltaic panels, steel, copper wire prices since the beginning of the year have made the scheme unviable. Under the scheme, the government had fixed the prices with one kilowatt requiring investment of Rs 43,000 including subsidies of 40% for projects below 3 KW and 20% for 4-10KW, which is the upper capacity limit. Ramakant Jangid, a vendor for the scheme said, “In the face of sharp rise in raw material costs, it’s difficult for the vendors to implement the projects at the rates fixed by the government.” He said projects costs have gone up 40% which is not manageable. “After the significant rise in PV module, wire and invertor prices, it was a loss-making proposition for the vendors. That’s why not many projects came up this year.” He said many disputes between vendors and customers have surfaced because of this. “The vendors cannot spend from their pocket. They wanted the customers to pay the extra cost due to rise in raw material prices. But customers think the vendors want better margins. That has led to many disputes. There are many projects stuck due to the disputes.” A member of Rajasthan Solar Association said the government should factor in the raw material prices increases before floating the new tenders. “The next scheme should have adequate safeguards so that there is no dispute between the vendors and the customers. Besides, the new tender should ensure periodic review of the raw material costs and price various accordingly so that the scheme does not duffer,” said the member. Payment delays is another factor that has an impact of the projects. “Subsidies have to be given without delay so that the capital of the vendor does not get stuck. While for the current scheme, the payment time of subsidy has improved compared to previous schemes, more steps can be taken to release the subsidy on time,” added Jangid. From now on, instead of Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation, the scheme will be implemented by the discoms as per a decision last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rising-prices-of-solar-panel-steel-wire-hit-rooftop-energy-projects/articleshow/85285757.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Traders said they were expected a further rise in business in the coming days as more and more restaurants gradually open. They said there was adequate stock in the market to meet the demand. “A night-time slot was missing so far, which meant the demand for vegetables was restricted. But now that eateries have started operating till 10pm, it has pushed demand up – there has been a 10-15% increase in daily trade”, a wholesaler from the vegetable-fruit section of the market said. Vilas Bhujbal, leader of the association of commission agents at market yard, said the demand will go up in the coming days. Popatlal Ostwal, chairman of Poona Merchants Chamber, said demand for grocery items, grains, spices and other food items has been on rise. “Shops are now open for longer hours. This has provided more time for business. Business can increase by up to 25%.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-for-vegetables-fruits-grain-up-at-wholesale-market/articleshow/85285738.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Kolkata||Families reunite as Gulf flights take off||Kolkata: The resumption of flights between Kolkata and Dubai has come as a huge relief for Indians stranded at home and abroad. While a 60-year-old woman settled in Dubai and unable to visit her mother and brothers for the past year-and-a-half is finally boarding the flight to Kolkata on Thursday, a 41-year-old woman, who is settled in Muscat and got stuck in Kolkata after she had come over to meet her father and complete some banking formalities earlier this year, is also set to take a flight back on August 25. The duo represents the relief of hundreds of others who have been similarly stranded either in India or abroad since April and are finally able to reunite with their families and loved ones. Neetu Rupani, who had settled in Dubai in 1983 but has been visiting Kolkata at least once every year to meet her mother, brothers and other family members, has not been able to travel to the city for the past two years. She was due to visit the city when the pandemic was declared last March and both countries went into lockdown mode. Though the lockdown was later eased, she had to wait to get vaccinated and was about to travel to India when the National Crisis & Emergency Management Authority announced a ban on travel from India to UAE in the fourth week of April. “Life has become so uncertain after the pandemic outbreak that I have become desperate to meet my family. My mother is over 80-year-old. I also wanted to meet my brothers and sisters-in-law. With each passing month, I was getting more desperate. Finally, UAE eased the travel restrictions. I am so glad to be travelling to Kolkata,” said Rupani. She is anxious not to get caught in the third wave while in India and then get stranded here away from her children in Dubai. “Travelling during the pandemic has become such a challenge,” she said. In the past four months, Pallavi Das has been desperately trying to return to Muscat but to no avail. She had come down to Kolkata with her son Devang for a month-and-a-half to visit her father and complete some formalities in the bank when India was put in the red list and travelling out from India was banned by several countries. “My husband Sambit, a doctor, was working in Muscat while I got stranded here. Initially, the situation in India was dire, and hence, the measures were understandable. But when the curbs continued even after the situation improved, it became a bit frustrating. Since there is no direct flight to Oman from here, all I could do is wait,” said Das. The flights resumed last week and Sambit took permission from the government there to fly down to Kolkata. They will fly back to Muscat via Mumbai on August 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/families-reunite-as-gulf-flights-take-off/articleshow/85283516.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Covid ‘kind’ to those who fell severely ill during first wave, says study||LUCKNOW: The novel coronavirus was ‘kind’ to those who got severely ill during the first wave of the pandemic and contracted infection again during the second phase, according to a study of Covid-19 reinfection cases among resident doctors of the King George’s Medical University (KGMU). However, reinfection resulted in profound symptoms among those who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms during their first infection. According to experts, this indicates that antibodies generated in patients who got severely ill during the first wave lasted longer, thus preventing serious illness at the time of reinfection. They added that antibodies formed in asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients during the first infection were not strong enough or did not last long. As a result, such patients developed strong symptoms upon reinfection. The study was commissioned by the KGMU vice-chancellor, Lt Gen Dr Bipin Puri, and conducted by the medicine department of the university under the guidance of medical superintendent Prof D Himanshu. The study was conducted on at least 56 resident doctors who had contracted infection twice. Of the total, 38 resident doctors who were mildly symptomatic with fever, cough and sore throat during the first wave experienced strong symptoms upon reinfection. Profound symptoms are experienced when mild symptoms such as fever, cough and sore throat get aggravated into shortness of breath, fatigue, headache and muscle pain and loss of taste and smell, or one of these, get combined with mild symptoms. At least 18 residents who had profound symptoms during the first infection, 17 developed mild issues during reinfection. One of them got severely ill on both the occasions. The remaining 10 resident doctors who were asymptomatic during the first infection developed mild illness during the second. “Though the severity of the second wave was greater than first, the study shows that those with profound symptoms in the first infection had some extra shield against the virus when they were reinfected,” Prof Himanshu said. “It appears that those with profound symptoms in the first infection developed stronger antibodies in comparison to those who had mild symptoms. However, nothing can be said for sure as more research is required to find out why it happened,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-kind-to-those-who-fell-severely-ill-during-first-wave/articleshow/85287810.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

More than 16.5 lakh people got their first dose at private hospitals. But only about 3.47 lakh have so far opted for a paid second jab. The DHO data showed that private hospitals had a 30% share in total vaccinations during peak demand in June and July. Hospital sites in Pune city vaccinated 12.6 lakh beneficiaries, followed by 3.29 lakh in Pimpri Chinchwad. In Pune rural, the coverage is at 60,674. Turnout is likely to dip further in August, officials said (across the more than 400 private sites). Most beneficiaries seem to be opting for a free second jab. Hospital administrators said they're now being cautious while purchasing new Covid vaccine doses. H K Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, said, “Response to paid vaccination has become poor over the last few weeks. We have not placed any orders for new stock. We'll wait to see if the situation improves." Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, said paid jabs would've worked if there was adequate awareness. “Also, low allocation of the doses, unequal distribution, high cost of the vaccines for private hospitals are some of the other reasons why private sites in the region have been impacted,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-sites-find-few-takers-for-2nd-dose-after-huge-rush-for-first/articleshow/85285771.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Kolkata||Kol bikers’ green drive plan for Digha coast on August 15||Kolkata: A bikers’ group from the city has planned to make a ‘green’ difference this Independence Day. On August 15 morning, the group of nine riders, named Street Hawks, will begin a year-long green drive planting over 500 trees on the Digha-Shankarpur coastline — one of the zones worst hit by cyclone Yaas. The Digha-Sankarpur Development Authority (DSDA) and Digha Hotel Owners’ Association have joined this green ride. “During our road trips to Yaas-affected East Midnapore in the last two months, we have witnessed an unimaginable loss of green cover along the coastline. We have decided to begin this initiative from the Kolkata-Digha-Sankarpur route. Given the response and local cooperation, it wasn’t difficult to chalk out our plan of action for this plantation drive,” said Pinaki Ranjan Das, secretary of Street Hawks. The bikers’ team will reach Digha on Saturday and begin the drive from Jahajbari, along the beach. For the August 15 launch, over 500 saplings of Jhau and Casuarina have been bought by the group so far. Lauding the bikers’ initiative, DDSA senior official Chandan Karmakar said the authority will support the initiative.  Sushanta Patra of the Digha Hotel Owners’ Association said their members will be actively joining the programme as it will help give this area a much-needed facelift post Yaas. “It is heartening to see a bikers’ group embarking on such a unique project,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-bikers-green-drive-plan-for-digha-coast-on-august-15/articleshow/85283596.cms||Sovon Manna
---||Kolkata||UK direct flight to Kolkata on radar, may return by September||KOLKATA: The travel agent community and Air India officials in Kolkata are lobbying hard for the return of the direct flight between Kolkata and London by either this month-end or early next month following the Centre’s decision on a 100% increase in weekly flights between India and the UK from August 16. “We are pushing for the flight that was withdrawn in December-end after servicing the sector for three months,” said Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. Sources in the airline said a fight between Kolkata and Heathrow had been proposed from August and the airline was awaiting the civil aviation ministry’s clearance before making an announcement. AI had introduced the flight last September and initially, operated two flights a week before reducing the frequency to once a week. Just when the flight was becoming stable, it was withdrawn. The last flight had operated on December 22 before the embargo on all flights to the UK kicked in from December 25. But now, the UK is one of the few major countries to have not only resumed full-fledged flight operations but also allowed tourists from India to travel to the country. Soni said a few tourists from Kolkata had travelled to the UK via Delhi and Mumbai without encountering any hurdles. Those who are fully vaccinated with Covishield shots do not require to undergo institutional quarantine for 10 days on arrival there. Apart from the UK, Switzerland, Germany, Spain and France have also opened up their markets for tourists from India. With Emirates also allowing transit passengers, the travel trade community is hoping many, who have not been able to travel internationally for over a year-and-a-half, will grab the opportunity to visit the countries this October during the Durga Puja vacation. Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi, too, felt that a direct flight to UK would act as a confidence booster for travellers. “Let’s hope cases remain in check and travel opens up,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/uk-direct-flight-on-radar-may-return-by-sept/articleshow/85283526.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Jaipur||BJP targets Congress on rising crimes against women||Jaipur: Opposition BJP on Thursday targeted the Ashok Gehlot government over the alleged deteriorating law and order situation and asked why senior Congress leaders were not talking about the “rising” crimes against women in the state.Leader of opposition Gulabchand Kataria claimed that rape cases had increased in the state by 25 per cent in 2021 as compared to last year and a shocking incident of woman being gangraped in front of her husband took place in the state recently.“A woman was gangraped in front of her husband in Barmer and this is not the first such incident in the state,” Kataria said at a press conferenceHe said senior Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, talk about rapes in other states, but when it comes to Rajasthan, none of them is ready to speak up.He also targeted Gandhi for revealing the identity of the family members of the minor girl allegedly raped and killed in Delhi, saying the Congress leader should also look at what is happening in Rajasthan where his party is in power.“The chief minister does not feel appropriate to come out of his residence. Law and order has deteriorated in the state,” Kataria said while hitting out at Gehlot, who also holds the home portfolio.Earlier in the day, BJP state president Satish Poonia attacked the chief minister saying he did not go to his office for one-and-a-half-years and was just conducting virtual meetings.“The CM should come out of his residence.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 11 years on, 18 accused of ragging acquitted as 2 ‘victims’ turn hostile||MUMBAI: Eleven years after 18 physiotherapy students from a medical college attached to KEM Hospital were booked in a criminal case for allegedly ragging 10 juniors by forcing them to perform obscene acts, a magistrate’s court this week acquitted them after two of the three victims who deposed turned hostile in court and did not support the case. “Even though there were 10 victims shown, the victims who have been examined did not support the prosecution case particularly indulgence of the accused or any role attributing to them. Hence, there is no cogent and clinching evidence to substantiate the guilt and indulgence of the accused in the crime,” the court said. “Taking stock of evidence in totality, I am of the opinion that there is no cogent and clear evidence to fasten the criminal liability of ragging, intentional insult by abusing and wrongful restraint on the part of accused to hold them guilty. Prosecution failed to establish the crucial ingredients as well identity of the accused,” the court said. The accused were then aged 19-20 and belonged to different parts of the state. The father of one of the alleged victims, an ATS officer, had complained to the deputy dean in January 2010. While giving their statements to the college authorities, the students had then alleged that some of them were asked to enact having constipation, while some were told to perform an advertisement for women’s undergarments. On January 3, 2010, an anti-ragging committee meeting was conducted, where a conclusion was drawn that the misconduct of the seniors falls in the ambit of ragging. An FIR was lodged at Bhoiwada police station against 18 seniors for committing, participating, abetting or propagating ragging against 10 students. They were booked under the Bombay Prohibition of Ragging Act and sections of the Indian Penal Code. Thirteen witnesses deposed during the trial. Among them were also the three students who later turned hostile, the then deputy dean and the investigating officer. One of the alleged victims, however, told the court that the accused were his seniors. Contradicting the prosecution’s case he said on January 2, 2010, between 5pm and 6pm, his seniors called him to the Naigaon Hostel and his casual interview and introduction was taken. He flatly refused that they had forced him to perform obscene acts. Another alleged victim too gave a similar statement. The ATS officer’s son, though, rec-alled seeing some students being ragged through obscene acts and submitted that he was scared. He said he ran out of the hostel room and called his father. However, referring to his statement, the court said that it appeared random and vague as no names of the victims or perpetrators were given despite his specific knowledge. “The evidence of this witness is very vague and nothing therein to attribute indulgence of any accused or any specific act amounting to ragging,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-11-yrs-on-18-accused-of-ragging-acquitted-as-2-victims-turn-hostile/articleshow/85287822.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: DMK govt ropes in big names, woos industry to achieve target $1 trillion||CHENNAI: Having taken over the reins of the state under the Covid-19 cloud, the DMK government, led by chief minister M K Stalin, did not have the customary time to celebrate. With the need to enforce strict lockdown, it was serious business for it from Day One. “The first thing CM (Stalin) told us was – We will contain the pandemic with all our might. You ensure that the industrial operations are not hampered or affected in any way and also make sure that export units function without hindrance to meet their commitments. By ensuring that, we have straightaway created a positive image for Tamil Nadu not only with industries here, but also with their overseas clients,” state minister for Industries Thangam Thennarasu told TOI. The government has not slowed down since. It has announced the formation of the Chief Minister’s Economic Advisory Council with experts such as Nobel laureate Esther Duflo and former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan. The industry praised the state for the expert bandwidth it was able to draw, and they have since started working closely with the government. That was just the beginning. CM Stalin has set a target for Tamil Nadu to become a $One trillion economy, attract Rs 23 lakh crore of new investments and create jobs for 46 lakh people – all by 2030. Despite fighting the pandemic, the Industries department managed to host an Industrial Conclave in Chennai, where new MoUs were signed for projects to bring in Rs 17,000 crore fresh investments into the state and generate employment to over 50,000 people. To prevent trouble in future, the state announced a 30% capital subsidy for units setting up Covid-critical equipment and a couple of units have already started construction. “This government has opted for continuity in its approach to aggressively woo investors from across the globe. Our CM laid the foundation stones for projects already signed and initiated commercial operations of projects already constructed,” a senior official said. A new Single Window portal, covering 100 digital services of the government, has been launched by CM Stalin. The portal earlier had only 44 services. By the end of this year, another 210 digital services will be offered through this portal. While the state got General Electric to establish a Centre of Excellence (CoE), it is pushing to have about 5-6 more such centres in all emerging technologies. This will help train employees from across sectors to Industry 4.0 standards and make them competitive. “In less than 100 days, we already have a road map ready on which to focus for next 2-3 years - diversification of industries into backward districts, targeting emerging sectors, skill development to be an important component to make industry competitive by strengthening ITIs and polytechnics, establishing and reviving innovation centres to boost start-ups across segments,” the official said. Not just the large industries, the focus has been on the MSMEs too. It has formed an expert committee to advise ways to revive the MSME units, which have been suffering on account of demonetisation, GST and then the Covid pandemic. “We have done away with a few restrictions to open up government supply opportunities to start-ups, released Rs 168 crore capital subsidy to 1,975 MSMEs and extended the time period for renewal of 15 statutory licenses like pollution and fire till December 31,2021,” another official said. “At CII, we have interacted with almost all key industrial departments including elected members and civil servants. They are extremely focused and trying to get the best for the industry. There is a clear agenda with this government to position Tamil Nadu as a pro-industry or industry-friendly state,” S Chandrakumar, chairman, CII Tamil Nadu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dmk-govt-ropes-in-big-names-woos-industry-to-achieve-target-1-trillion/articleshow/85285773.cms||D Govardan

Telangana alleged that AP was diverting water through three projects which it termed them as illegal. It said water was diverted through Muchumarri, a link canal connecting Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanthi Lift Irrigation Scheme at Malyala, with KC Canal and an escape channel from Banakacherla cross regulator to feed the KC Canal ayacut. Telangana irrigation department engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar in his letter to chairman of KRMB, MP Singh, said AP had been utilising more water than the allocated 31.90 tmcft and diverting it to outside the basin. He said it would adversely impact many Telangana irrigation projects like Nagarjuna Sagar and drinking water supply to Hyderabad. He said Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)-I imposed restrictions on utilisation of water in Tungabhadra sub-basin and added Tungabhadra river contributes substantial flows to the mainstream Krishna. The irrigation chief said KC Canal was originally conceived as a navigation canal from Tungabhadra river at Sunkesula anicut and later irrigation component was added. “This is one of the many components of deliberate neglect of Telangana region in the then united AP state. Telangana is challenging the same before KWDT-II requesting to restrain AP not to use more than 10 tmcft for KC Canal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-diverting-water-telangana-to-krmb/articleshow/85287875.cms||Koride Mahesh

While distributing appointment letters to 2,846 newly selected lecturers and assistant teachers of government secondary schools under Mission Rozgar at Lok Bhawan, the CM said, “During your school days, you must have followed the Education Policy of 1986. But from 2022, you will adopt the NEP. So, you must begin preparations in accordance with NEP which is the need of the hour.” Yogi asked the teachers to revive the golden era of government and aided secondary schools. “Several bureaucrats in the state are products of government colleges and not convent educated. But today, these institutions (government inter colleges) are finding it hard to save their identity. Teachers have to come forward to bring back the glory of government inter colleges,” he said. Exhorting teachers, who he called as the building blocks of the society, to work with honesty and dedication, the CM said, “You must take the responsibility of the institution you are posted in. There is a need to build confidence in the new generation, be it students or parents. It's the teachers' call whether to earn students’ respect or get blamed by them for spoiling their lives.” Yogi said teachers must be aware of the education policies of the government. “Many a time students complain that they did not get the scholarships. It is the responsibility of teachers to pass the information related to government schemes to the students,” he said. Reiterating the fair and transparent recruitment process, he said, “Before 2017, every selection process was marred by corruption. The youth were forced to migrate to other states. The entire system of recruitment was rooted in dishonesty and nepotism. Our government has controlled the entire process and made it transparent. In 2021, the unemployment rate of UP has come down to 4.1% because of the transparency in providing employment.” Regarding infrastructure development in the state, Yogi said owing to the hard work of his government UP has become the second largest economy in the country. “Investors are coming forward to make huge investments because they feel UP is now safe. Their land will not be grabbed by the mafia, and if any one dares to do so, they know the outcome,” Yogi said. Expressing satisfaction over the success of one district one product scheme, the CM said these works could have been done earlier too but it was not the intention of the previous governments to provide jobs to youth in the state. Speaking at the event, deputy CM Dinesh Sharma said UP is the first state to implement NEP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-we-weeded-out-graft-nepotism-from-recruitment/articleshow/85287851.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: One hand transplanted on MP man after 13-hour surgery at KEM Hospital||MUMBAI: Ahead of Organ Donation Day on August 13, KEM Hospital created history by becoming the first public centre in the city to perform a hand transplant on Thursday. A marathon surgery lasting 13 hours was carried out by a multidisciplinary team that attached the donor hand to a Madhya Pradesh man in his early 20s. Doctors said the first 24 hours and then the next seven to 10 days are extremely crucial for the recipient. KEM dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said they carried out a single hand transplant as the second hand didn’t appear viable to be transplanted. “Doctors have transplanted his right hand (elbow down). The first 24 hours are crucial as transplant patients may face acute rejection,” said the dean, adding that the transplant was seamless and made possible by a team effort that was shaping for years. KEM doctors had done a practice transplant on a cadaver, apart from several mock runs to perfect the surgery. The transplant is a complicated surgery that can take up to 24 hours (see box). The operation started an hour after noon on Wednesday and went on till 3am. “The first step is to see if the transplanted limb survives. Once that happens, we have to wait for the vessels to stabilise, which means a free flow of blood without clots,” said Dr Vinita Puri, head of plastic surgery and burns at KEM who had got the hand transplant licence for the hospital in 2016. The transplant team consisted of plastic surgeons, orthopaedics, anaesthetists, experts from nephrology and nurses who have been trained. A hand transplant in a private hospital could cost above Rs 20 lakh. This was the second hand transplant in a city hospital. Last August, train accident victim Monica More, who had lost both her hands, became the first recipient at Global Hospital. Deshmukh said recovery after transplant is a long road and takes up to a year. “It takes time to get sensation and regain functionality,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-one-hand-transplanted-on-mp-man-after-13-hour-surgery-at-kem-hosp/articleshow/85287904.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The civic authorities assured them that the project to bring 125 MLD of water from Mullaperiyar dam to Madurai city would not be privatised.The Rs 1295.76crore project on completion would ensure that every household has clean, treated drinking water and a central monitoring system. It would enable the civic body to keep a check on the problems in the water distribution system, like leakages, lack of supply and address it immediately, said corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan.One of the main concerns raised by the participants was about the chances of the water distribution scheme to be privatised. They pointed out how privatisation of the water scheme in Coimbatore corporation ran into trouble and controversy. Muthukrishnan of Thirupalai said the corporation should give it in writing in the detailed project report that it would not be privatised, failing which the civic body would have to face litigations. The corporation commissioner assured them that it would not be privatised though charges for water may differ over time. Madurai corporation would be the implementing authority of the scheme being implemented under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), with financial assistance from Asian Development Bank, he said.While the project is being executed in five packages, Thursday’s public hearing was in regard to its implementation in 57 wards.Former councillor R Vijayarajan said the corporation should not try to meter water distribution, and that Madurai corporation should defer the scheme’s implementation till elections are held and councillors, who would represent the people, are elected by the end of the year. In reply, the commissioner said that putting off implementation may result in funds being diverted for other schemes, and that public views would be taken into consideration as the work progresses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-water-supply-not-to-be-privatised/articleshow/85285863.cms||---

According to water resources department data,10 of the state’s 33 districts are under the deficit rainfall category, while nine are under normal rainfall category and as many under excessive rains category. Five districts have recorded abnormal rains and there is no district under the scant rainfall category, the data shows. “Excessive rainfall in several parts of the state and below-average in some is a matter of concern. Directions have been issued to the district administration for special girdawari (survey) in different districts so that timely assistance can be provided to the affected,” Gehlot tweeted. He said parts of the state receive rain in August also, which may cover the deficit. “The same is expected from the forecasts of the meteorological department this time,” he said. From June 1 to August 12, the state recorded normal rainfall with 8.3 per cent more than the average, according to a report by the water resources department. Kota division comprising Kota, Bundi, Baran and Jhalawar districts has received abnormal rains with 87.2 per cent more than average rains. Many areas in the division faced flood-like situation because of excessive rains which damaged property and crops. Bharatpur division received abnormal rains while normal precipitation was observed in Ajmer, Bikaner, Jaipur and Udaipur divisions. Jodhpur division recorded deficit rains. Districts with deficit rains (-20 per cent to -59 per cent of the long period average) are Banswara, Barmer, Dungarpur, Ganganagar, Jalore, Jodhpur, Pali, Rajsamand, Sirohi and Udaipur.

---||Lucknow||BJP in Uttar Pradesh ready with its grand OBC bouquet||LUCKNOW: Even as both the houses of Parliament passed the OBC reservation bill, BJP in UP has positioned itself to maximise its backward outreach with the help of a recently constituted team of OBC frontal wing functionaries. The team represents a bouquet of subcastes to cover 80% of the total backward block in the state where assembly elections early next year. This team of 26 members not only has representation of socio-economically influential Yadav, Kurmi, Lodh and Jats but also most backward Castes (MBCs) like Nishad, Rajbhar, Kushwaha, Prajapati, Pal and Teli (Sahu). The wing, headed by Narendra Kashyap, a BSP turncoat and a former Rajya Sabha member, includes eight vice-presidents, three state general secretaries and eight state secretaries. Kashyap said the recently constituted OBC frontal wing comprises all essential sub-castes which will help in bringing the backward community even closer to BJP. “The amendment allowing the state to have its own OBC list will further amalgamate the OBC with the ruling party,” he told TOI on Thursday. Kashyap was a BSP’s Rajya Sabha member between 2010 and 2016 before joining the saffron brigade just before 2017 UP assembly elections. According to rough estimates, around 40-45% of the voting population is from OBC group comprising 79 castes. Of this, Yadav accounts for 18-20%, followed by 8% Kurmis. Likewise, Lodh and Hindu Jat together form around 8% of the OBC group. The MBCs, which are relatively socio-economically poor as compared to powerful OBCs, too, have a major share in the backward bracket. For instance, Maurya (essentially inhabiting central UP), Kushwaha (east UP), Saini (in areas having substantial Jat population) and Shakya account for around 12-14% in areas around Yadav pocket borough of Etawah. Similarly, Nishad, Kashyap, Bind, Mallah, Kewat and Kahar form 6-8% of OBC population, while Rajbhar form 4-5% of voting population. The inclusion of Rajbhar and Nishad functionaries in the OBC frontal wing is also seen as BJP’s deft move to cement the two MBC communities even as BJP ally-turned-rebel SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar and NISHAD party president Sanjay Nishad resort to political muscle flexing. BJP has been seeking to quarantine the two demanding leaders by projecting Rajbhar and Nishad leaders from its own rank. UP BJP vice-president and in charge of OBC affairs, Daya Shankar Singh, said the community has benefited a lot under BJP. “The government led by PM Narendra Modi has given constitutional sanction to OBC commission and inducted MPs of the communities as ministers in the Union cabinet,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-ready-with-its-grand-obc-bouquet/articleshow/85287901.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Chennai||Hello civility, a long-lost friend in Tamil Nadu politics||CHENNAI: Sometime in the late 1950s, DMK president and Kancheepuram MLA C N Annadurai invited his political rival, Congress leader and chief minister K Kamaraj to visit a village in his constituency. They had just fought an election, criticising each other. At the village, Anna told the villagers that CM Kamaraj was interested in their welfare, they may air their grievances to him. After some constructive interaction, the two leaders drove back home. Such camaraderie among Dravidian rivals was missing in the past four decades. And now, M K Stalin appears to be keen on bringing it back. His first act of political civility was to include former health minister C Vijaya Baskar in a Covid-19 management panel. At the funeral of AIADMK presidium chairman E Madhusudhanan recently, Stalin sat between his arch-rivals Edappadi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam. At the unveiling of a portrait of M Karunanidhi, the organisers kept a chair on the dais for EPS. Political observers feel Stalin soaked in Kamaraj and Anna’s embracing culture even during his student days, and leaders like Atal Bihari Vajapyee, whose government the DMK supported in 1999, left an impact on Stalin. Some others think his father, M Karunanidhi, despite his bitterness towards J Jayalalithaa (which was mutual), passed on some traits of reconciliation to Stalin. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa refused to see eye to eye, even avoiding assembly sessions when the other was in the house, and got each other arrested on corruption charges. The Karunanidhi-MGR rivalry, however, was confined to politics.When MGR took ill in October 1984, Karunanidhi penned a touching epistle. Prayer means an appeal and he, an atheist, would ‘pray’ for MGR to recover, Karunanidhi wrote. It was final proof that their friendship had survived. “Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) made an impression on Stalin. It was Jayalalithaa who chose to keep Kalaignar as her enemy as it suited her politics,” said DMK MP and spokesman T K S Elangovan. Dravidian historian Rajan Krishnan, who is an associate professor at Ambedkar University, New Delhi, says Stalin understands that his father’s politics was much more than rivalry of the past. He recalled how former Odisha chief minister Biju Patnaik almost got the DMK and the AIADMK to merge in 1979. Karunanidhi then said he should be DMK president, while MGR could continue as chief minister. They sat together and MGR agreed to the proposal. But the following day, MGR pulled out. And there ended what could have been a different political saga. In the years that followed, hate speeches of AIADMK and DMK rivals sowed a new culture. In states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and now Telangana bipolar politics has been getting bitter. With political dialogues shifting to social media, friendships are tottering, wrecked by trolls, disagreements and bitter exchanges. Against this background, Stalin’s inclusive style stands out. But will it last? The DVAC searches against two former ministers have shaken the AIADMK leadership. They say Stalin’s politics of civility is only a façade to unleash vendetta politics. And that’s something only Stalin can disprove.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hello-civility-a-long-lost-friend-in-tn-politics/articleshow/85285892.cms||Jaya Menon

We gave our very best out there. Before going to the Olympics, Revathi was not someone who was well known. But, now I have been receiving wishes from a lot of people,” said Revathi at a felicitation ceremony organized at Lady Doak College (LDC) in Madurai, where she had studied BA Tamil.“This is a wonderful moment for me to be honoured at my alma mater. I was given the opportunity to study free of cost here under the sports quota. During college days, teachers had all supported me and even let me take my exams later if I had to go for tournaments,” she recalled.The sprinter, who had been orphaned at a young age, was brought up in her grandmother, Arammal’s care. With the support of her coach K Kannan, she was able to pursue her passion for sports and go to college. Revathi’s grandmother was also emotional and recalled her granddaughter’s struggles to get where she did. “In our village, we did not get much support at all when Revathi started out running. Many even said she should get married soon. But, Revathi was determined and I also told her we only live for ourselves not how society sees us,” she said.Coach Kannan, who was given Rs 1 lakh by the LDC, asked the organisers to give it to Revathi as she needs it more. “More such support is needed for sports and athletes to flourish. Poverty must not deter sports talent. Even now, I’m training more students like Revathi and I hope they too reach great heights one day,” he said.Ministers P Moorthy and P T R Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, along with district collector S Aneesh Sekhar, LDC principal Dr Christianna Singh and others felicitated the sprinter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/grandma-recalls-sprinters-struggle-to-reach-olympics/articleshow/85285910.cms||---

Spitting in common areas will be strictly banned and action will be initiated against violators. If any student is found with symptoms of Covid, the student has to be referred to the nearest hospital and ambulance facility has to be provided by the institution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/schools-colleges-to-reopenon-sept-1-with-50-capacity/articleshow/85285963.cms||---
---||Mumbai||In Maharashtra, men have got 40L more Covid shots than women||MUMBAI: Fewer women in the state have taken the vaccine against Covid-19 compared to men, amounting to a difference of over 3%. The gender disparity in vaccination could be wider within districts and may be growing with more doses administered, experts said. In Maharashtra, 40% of an estimated 6.5 crore men have taken at least one dose of the vaccine. In comparison, 36.6% women of an estimated population of 5.9 crore have taken at least one shot. In absolute numbers, 40 lakh more vaccine doses have been administered to men. ‘Maharashtra govt must see where few women coming for jabs’Officials have called the gender difference in vaccination statistically insignificant and in line with the state’s male-female ratio. But health experts have called for a district-wise analysis to find pockets where fewer women are getting vaccinated. They also believe fewer women have got the second dose. The state has till date administered 4.79 crore doses, of which 2.59 crore are male beneficiaries and 2.19 crore female. The difference in doses administered is wider in the mega cities and urban districts such as Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, and Nagpur, evidently because higher doses are given in these places. The difference is highest in Mumbai, where 12% more doses have been given to men: 44.99 lakh doses to men and 35.2 lakh to women. In Pune, seven lakh more men have taken doses. In nine of 35 districts, there is a difference of over one lakh doses in vaccine coverage between men and women—ranging 1.1-9.7 lakh. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), said the difference in vaccine coverage between genders did not have a major statistical difference. “It is in proportion to the female population out of the total population. Further, pregnant women were permitted vaccination only recently,” he said, adding that it was nothing to be alarmed of. There are an estimated 50-60 lakh more men (about 8% more) in Maharashtra. Experts are not convinced with the state’s argument. “Even a 4% difference translates into lakhs for a big state like Maharashtra. The state must identify pockets where fewer women are coming to take the vaccine. A gender disparity is seen everywhere in the country and is unlikely that Maharashtra wouldn’t experience it,” said Soumitra Ghosh from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences’ School of Health Systems Studies. Ghosh said a huge share of Maharashtra’s healthcare and frontline workforce, including ASHAs and ANMs, are women. “Even with those numbers taken into consideration, women are falling behind men in vaccination,” he said. “The national vaccine policy was never framed keeping gender in mind.” Pregnant women and lactating mothers were given a green signal for vaccination at least six months after the drive was started. Maharashtra has over 20 lakh pregnant women. Dr Naveen Thacker, a former civil society representative to the Gavi board, the Vaccine Alliance, said that a lot of misinformation around the safety of vaccination during pregnancy and menstruation has kept women away from booths. “The number of women beneficiaries is particularly low in second-dose seekers. There is definitely a need to address the misinformation through awareness campaigns,” he said. Gondia and Bhandara are the only districts where more women have taken the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-must-see-where-few-women-coming-for-jabs/articleshow/85285923.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Surat||Along with Amit’s heart, Sohel got a mom’s love too||SURAT: Not a week passes by without 41-year-old Sohel Vora talking to his “mom” 53-year-old Ukiben Halpati, but for whose supreme generosity, the former would have perished with time. Anand town resident, Vora's heart was pumping 15 to 20 percent and he was on the waiting list since November 2016 after doctors had advised him to get a heart transplant. Meanwhile, Ukiben, mother of 21-year-old Amit and a resident of Khapariya village in Gandevi taluka of Navsari district who was declared brain-dead following a road accident chose to keep her son alive by donating his organs, including his heart to needy people. Amit’s heart was transplanted into Vora in 2017, a gift that not only helped Vora live again, but also fetched him a newfound family in the Halpatis. According to sources, on July 8, 2017, Amit along with his friend Vikram was going to Bilimora town on his bike at 8 pm. Vikram was riding the bike and suddenly a stray dog came in the way and both fell down. Amit suffered severe head injuries and was taken to New Civil Hospital in Surat, but four days later, on July 12, he was declared brain-dead. Amit’s parents were farm labourers who decided to donate his vital organs including heart, kidneys, pancreas, and liver. Vora, who received Amit’s heart through Donate Life shared his feelings with TOI: “I always tell people that I am alive today because of Amit's family who had decided to donate his organs. His heart beats in me. I talk to Amit's mother every week and visit her once every six months. I call Ukiben my mother and I am her son.” Tragically, Amit’s 33-year-old elder brother Ajay died a year ago while Daksha (27), Amit’s sister is married. “My family considers Amit's family as our own and we are part of their lives now,” Vora added. Nilesh Mandlewala. founding member of Donate Life which is instrumental in creating awareness about cadaver donation in South Gujarat, told TOI: “This is a story of how organ donation unites two families who have never met and fosters newer bonds. Interestingly, the entire village gathered to see Sohel when he went to meet Amit's family in Khapariya village!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/along-with-amits-heart-sohel-got-a-moms-love-too/articleshow/85283686.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Now, One lakh in city under health cover||CHANDIGARH: The UT’s proposal to National Health Authority (NHA) to use national food security data (NFSD) to map beneficiaries for Ayushmaan Bharat universal health coverage scheme has been accepted. This would increase the beneficiaries from present 19,000 to one lakh in the city. “We had sent a proposal to NHA to use the NFSD as it is more dynamic. We have been able to map 19k families out of 23k families in the city using the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 data,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT. She added, “With the NFSD data, one lakh families will come into the ambit of the universal coverage scheme. The NHA has accepted this proposal and soon, we will get an official confirmation from them.” Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, also called Modicare, aims at providing publicly funded health insurance cover of up to Rs 500,000 per family per year to about 500 million people, 40% of India’s population. However, as only 19k families were traced, 4k families were cancelled previously. “I had proposed to the Union ministry of health and family welfare to include all the BPL families on the pattern of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. But it was not accepted,” said BJP’s medical cell convener, Prince Bhadula. Ayushman Bharat kicked off in Chandigarh on September 23 in 2019. Apart from the financial risk provided through health insurance, the scheme focuses on prevention of diseases, mainly non- communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension and other lifestyle related conditions. For this, more than 20 health and wellness centre are providing expanded range of services including reproductive child health, mother and child healthcare, eye and ENT (ear-nose-throat), oral healthcare, geriatric care, mental health, emergency services and yoga sessions. Besides this, free screening for common non-communicable disease is also being provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/now-1-lakh-in-city-under-health-cover/articleshow/85283663.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Factional conflict persists in Congress despite peace claims||CHANDIGARH: Amid a clamour among Congress MLAs siding with PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu for a formal meeting of the party legislators, the central leadership could soon face the challenge of avoiding another flash point among the warring factions over changes in organisational structure and proposed cabinet rejig. Sources said a section of MLAs loyal to Sidhu want him to convene a meeting of the MLAs (with a non-legislative agenda), even though it is chief minister Amarinder Singh who is the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader. They want to discuss pending contentious issues such as action in sacrilege cases and have also sought time from Congress president Sonia Gandhi. However, most party MLAs have distanced themselves from reports of a plan to move a resolution against the chief minister. Meanwhile, Sidhu loyalists plan get in touch with the Congress central leadership to pre-empt any unfavourable changes in the cabinet. AICC incharge Harish Rawat is likely to come to Chandigarh to sort out the existing differences next week. “The demand for a meeting of MLAs came up in a meeting at the residence of a cabinet minister. Sidhu asked the MLAs to make a request in writing. Some MLAs wanted to discuss the strategy for the next assembly elections and also the negative perception against the state leadership and give their feedback on various issues. The AICC three-member panel failed to address the grouses of most Punjab MLAs,” said a party leader. Party leaders believe that striking a balance during the constitution of the new PPCC will be another challenge for the leadership. “The district presidents are the most crucial link in the organisational structure and MLAs loyal to both the CM and Sidhu would want a say in the appointments,” said a party leader. After his appointment last month, Sidhu has been focussing on reactivating various organisational wings of PCC, reaching out to party leaders across the state, especially MLAs. “All eyes will also be on how much weightage is given to traditional Congress families, including ex-MLAs, who have been waiting to get back into circulation. So far, the focus has been only on MLAs and which warring side has more on its side,” said a party ex-MLA. While Rawat has already confirmed that the chief minister has told the Congress president about the need to strike a balance in the cabinet with more Balmiki representation, party circles are abuzz with speculations whether Amarinder will try to get rid of some ministers and the high command will give him a free hand. A cabinet reshuffle has been long due and many feel that it has now lost its charm for aspirants with barely a few months left before the next elections. “However, party leaders are apprehensive that the acrimony between Amarinder and Sidhu may not play out in the changes,” said a Congress MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/factional-conflict-persists-in-cong-despite-peace-claims/articleshow/85287927.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Chandigarh||All possible medical help will be given to diarrhoea patients: Sidhu||Mohali: Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, on Thursday, announced that the state government would provide all possible medical help to diarrhoea- affected patients. Till date, two patients have succumbed to the disease and a total of 340 have been taken ill. The health minister said, “We have been scanning pipelines to detect the spot where drinking water and sewerage water mix. The breach has been plugged but still, cases are not being controlled. It seems that there are more such spots where contamination is occurring. The previous government in Zirakpur did not take pains to get pipelines installed properly, becuse of which this epidemic has occurred.” After reports of Cholera outbreak, deputy commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan, accompanied by officials of the health department, water supply and sanitation as well as other departments, visited Ekta Vihar Colony of Zirakpur and CHC Dhakoli, where patients were admitted after the outbreak. During his visit, the deputy commissioner assured that best health care facilities were being provided to area residents and water would be supplied through tankers till the problem of contaminated water was resolved. Elaborating on the steps being taken to prevent further spread of the disease, he said that medical teams have been stationed in the area from the first day of the outbreak. “Our teams have also taken samples of tubewell water to find the source of the outbreak and the district administration asked deputy commissioner, Panchkula to check sources of contamination in their respective areas. MC officials have been directed to ensure distribution of ORS packets and chlorine tablets in every household,” he said. Later, Sidhu visited the community health centre (CHC), Dhakoli and checked on 30 patients admitted there. He asked officials concerned to provide best health care facilities and said that if the situation deteriorated, a dedicated makeshift treatment facility would be established in Baltana. According to the minister, 340 cases have come to light and the district administration is doing everything possible to contain the spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/all-possible-medical-help-will-be-given-to-diarrhoea-patients-sidhu/articleshow/85283708.cms||---

Addressing a press conference here, he said: “The chief minister should first apologise to people of the state for not implementing the promises he made during his two terms and then fight the Huzurabad bypolls.” Prabhakar said the CM was using all means to win the Huzurabad by-election. Making it clear that party leader Eatala Rajender will enter the fray as a BJP candidate, he said Eatala was subjected to several insults during his tenure as a minister in the TRS government. He alleged that the CM did not implement several schemes and promises, including three acres of land to each Dalit household. “He should apologise for not giving jobs to youth and for not honouring the families of Telangana martyrs,” Prabhakar said. He said the CM was giving an MLC post to Padi Kaushik Reddy who opposed formation of a separate Telangana state.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vaccine trial volunteers in limbo, yet to get certificates almost a year after doses||MUMBAI: With vaccine certificates slowly becoming the passport for travel and other mundane activities like entering a mall, vaccine trial volunteers from the city are feeling short-changed. Even as they complete a year of vaccination next month, the government is yet to issue their certificates and they are shown as unvaccinated on CoWin. They are also in a quandary as they don’t know if the vaccines they took are still effective against the new variants and are awaiting guidelines on a possible booster dose. TimesViewAt a time when little was known about the vaccines and not many volunteered to take part in vaccine trials, these volunteers came forward. They are right to now feel upset about the approach of the authorities. The government must step in at once and sort out all their issues so that vaccination certificates are provided to them without any further delay.Study abroad counsellor Karan Gupta volunteered with his parents last September. “Nothing much was known about the virus or the vaccine. Many volunteers were opting out of trials after learning about serious side-effects. Only a few hundred were ready to take the risk,” said Gupta, now disappointed with the delays. The ‘vaccine passport’ is now mandatory for almost everything, including entering a mall or a gym, he added. Around 250 people had volunteered for the Covishield trial at two hospitals — KEM and Nair. Of the total, 75% were administered the vaccine, while the rest were given a placebo. The data of the six-month study was unblinded in March-April this year. The ones who got the vaccines have been waiting for their certificates ever since. With no information from the government, they have been knocking on the doors of the trial sites. A doctor said they have provided the names of the volunteers thrice to the ICMR. “We have been pursuing with the ICMR. We even provided them with the details of vaccinated individuals thrice. Just last week we were told that the certificates will be issued once data from all trial centres are collected. They have assured that these will be made available till August 31,” he said, adding there is no clarity on booster dose. An ICMR official said the ministry of health and family welfare has decided to issue the certificates. But the participants are impatient now. Retired medical teacher Dr Suresh Sundar, 64, said: “We volunteered in good faith to be of help to others in the pandemic. But despite repeated attempts, ICMR, Serum Institute or the government have not yet issued a proper vaccination certificate for the Covishield doses administered to us. The hospital authorities have given us a letter which may or may not be valid for travel.” Another volunteer Meena Mehta, a housewife, 68, is also worried the letter from the hospital will be of no use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vaccine-trial-volunteers-in-limbo-yet-to-get-certs-almost-a-year-after-doses/articleshow/85285979.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: 45-year-old man in Kanpur assaulted in front of daughter for ‘conversion’||KANPUR: A 45-year-old man was paraded through the streets, as his minor daughter accompanied him, assaulted by a mob accusing him of religious conversion in Barra area of Kanpur on Wednesday. He was later handed over to police which said that the allegation of conversion against him appeared to be unfounded. Police have booked 12 persons for rioting on the complaint of the victim, Afsar. Police swung into action after the video clip of the incident showing the man's little daughter crying and trying to cling on to him and begging for mercy from a group of assaulters, went viral on social media on Thursday. The video footage also shows a few men in the mob shouting 'Jai Shri Ram' after assaulting Afsar. Police said that Afsar is a relative of one of the three youths accused of molesting their neighbour's daughter recently. An FIR was also lodged against them at the Barra police station in this regard. The police stated that the girl's family had also made allegations of conversion against Afsar's relative and demanded to add a section pertaining to 'forceful conversion' in the FIR. Later, they had also met a local representative and demanded him to instruct the police to lodge a case against the alleged molester in this regard. Police, however, said, "Investigation with regard to conversion is still continuing and action would be initiated only on the basis of evidence." However, pursuing the same case, a group of local activists on Wednesday evening had assembled at the Ram Gopal Chauraha in Barra area, indulging in religious sloganeering and demanding to book the molester on charges of conversion. Later, on seeing the alleged molester's relative Afsar passing by along with his minor daughter, they dragged him and beat him up mercilessly. The video of the incident was shot by some passers-by, who later made it viral on social media. DCP South, Raveena Tyagi, said that a case of rioting against a local person who runs a marriage band, his son and around 10 unknown people, based on Afsar's complaint had been lodged at Barra police station. She also mentioned that the families of Afsar relative and his neighbour were also involved in a property dispute. "We have seen the video. Based on a complaint by Afsar, we have filed an FIR under relevant sections of the IPC and are in the process of identifying the assaulters. Further investigations are underway," said Tyagi further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-man-assaulted-in-front-of-daughter-for-conversion/articleshow/85287931.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: School fee GR calls for refund to students||Mumbai: The state’s latest GR on fee reduction calls for a refund to students who have paid complete fees. It also asks schools not to debar students from online classes for non-payment of fees. But most players in the education sector say the GR is a mere advisory in the absence of amendments to the governing law and has no legal mandate. Unaided Schools Forum secretary S C Kedia said the government has “obviously not read” the SC’s judgement in the Rajasthan case, which was meant to provide a framework for its decision. “It is clear that the state cannot use such a GR for reduction of fees under the Fee Regulation Act,” he said. The government had come out with a similar GR in May 2020 which was initially stayed by Bombay high court. It was vacated in March 2021, but the court reiterated that parents had to pay the fees. A group of 15 parents, however, filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court challenging the HC order. The apex court cited the Rajasthan schools’ judgement and asked the state to reduce fees by 15%. Kedia, however, said the SC judgement will not be applicable for fees of 2021-22. “We will challenge the GR in high court soon. Such a GR will again create chaos and unrest between parents and management,” he added. The GR was also criticised by the BJP which called it a move initiated by “a government of education barons”. Parents' bodies too said the GR was toothless. Under the rules, any dispute has to be referred to a Divisional Fee Regulatory Committee. “A group of 25% parents are needed to approach the committee. We have been asking for individual parents to be allowed to submit their grievances before the committee,” said Prasad Tulaskar, one of the parents who had approached the SC. He said that only an ordinance can give the state the power to regulate unaided schools fees, “but that will not happen as many of the big schools are owned by politicians.” This is also why the state has delayed financial audits of private schools, alleged parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-school-fee-gr-calls-for-refund-to-students/articleshow/85287973.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Around 130 passengers of an Air India Express flight were not only made to wait for over 12 hours, but their flight was also diverted to Sharjah after Dubai immigration found that the rapid PCR test done in Trichy was not according to their stipulation. Hundreds of passengers and their relatives who had come to send them off spent several hours in waiting due to the lapses in ensuring the appropriate testing arrangement.The passengers were supposed to fly to Dubai on AIE flight IX-611 at 9.25 am on Thursday. As rapid PCR test is mandatory for passengers, those hailing from Thanjavur and Tiruvarur had arrived at the airport as early as 1 am as they were asked to report six hours before departure. “After being told to wait for the rapid test, the airline suddenly informed that the test method conducted at Trichy airport was not recognised by immigration desk at Dubai. Later, we were told that Sharjah airport will accept it,” S Sivanandam, a migrant labourer from Kumbakonam, said. Around 4 pm, the stranded passengers were given boarding passes for the flight which by then stood diverted to Sharjah as IX-613, and asked to undergo the rapid PCR test available. “Children and women suffered a lot to get food but we were not able to reach the AAI officials responsible for the testing fiasco. Even after reaching Sharjah, we should spend an additional sum for the road travel to Dubai. The quarantine process is also different there,” Muhammad Yahaya, a passenger from Ayyampettai told TOI. Outbound services between Trichy and Dubai stand had been suspended since April due to the second wave of Covid-19. As the UAE government relaxed immigration restrictions, employers started insisting that their workers report for work. Since UAE is gradually opening up and there is demand for outbound service from Trichy, passengers said the hiccups should be addressed at the earliest. When contacted, airport director S Dharmaraj said rapid PCR test at the airport was conducted smoothly but he didn’t know why a problem arose. He said he will look into the issue and coordinate with flight carriers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dubai-rejects-covid-test-in-trichy-flight-diverted/articleshow/85285986.cms||Deepak Karthik

Fort police arrested A Sulochana, 29, and her accomplice C Rekha, 33, from Chitoor on charges of fleeing with ornaments worth Rs 10 lakh after diverting the attention of people, particularly women. Gold ornaments weighing 22 sovereigns were recovered from them. Sub-inspector of police Aranganathan said that the two used to travel from their native place to here for their operation and applied various methods of attention diversion as the situation demanded, like putting currency notes on the street. It was on their arrest that the two were found to have been involved in such incidents since December 2020.On Wednesday, Fort police received a complaint from a 55-year-old woman that her 3.5 sovereigns gold ornaments were stolen by two women when she was near Anna statue in Chathiram bus stand area. A special team comprising sub-inspectors Aranganathan and Malliga were quick to fan out and nab the culprits. Police said the women admitted to having committed the offence several times since December when they conned a 50-year-old woman of 4.75 sovereigns ornaments near Chathiram bus stand. A month later on January 26, they made off with five sovereigns of gold ornaments after tricking a 47-year-old woman. They repeated the offence the next day, hoodwinking a 57-year-old woman of 3.75 sovereigns of ornaments. On July 9, the two conned a couple of five sovereigns of gold ornaments. It was in the wake of a series of complaints of two women conning people that city police commissioner A Arun formed a special team under DCP (crime and traffic) R Mutharasu to nab them. The team also arrested S Arumugam, 38, of Puthur on charges of committing burglary and seized 10 sovereigns of gold worth Rs 5 lakh from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/2-ap-women-nabbed-for-snatching-gold-22-sovereigns-recovered/articleshow/85285967.cms||---

Now the facility is available at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) attached to KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College (KAPVGMC), a government tertiary care centre in Trichy.A 47-year-old man from Mannachanallur has become the first organ donor at the hospital after it has been equipped with organ retrieval and transplantation facilities recently.As he was brain dead, the two kidneys and liver were donated by his family members on July 4. While one of the kidneys was transplanted on a 21-year-old man at MGMGH, another one was given to a patient at a private hospital in Trichy. The liver was donated to a patient at a private hospital. “Now, the hospital is equipped with a renal transplant facility. What we need is awareness among people to donate organs of brain dead patients,” said Dr R Yeganathan of MGMGH.Classifying the donors as natural death donor, live donor and brain dead donor, city-based cardiologist Dr Senthilkumar Nallusamy, who had set a record for making a 51-minute speech about organ donation in October 2017, said according to the existing laws in the country, a brain dead patient can save more than 10 patients, while two other categories have limitations. “Awareness on brain dead patients donating organs is very low as of now. Organ donation is a noble act, which should be done voluntarily and not by any compulsion,” he said.Dr Senthilkumar suggested the interested people to register themselves as an organ donor in Tamil Nadu Organ Donor Sharing (TNOS) registry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mgmgh-can-retrieve-transplant-organs-now/articleshow/85285982.cms||Gokul Rajendran

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Noida medical device park gets final shape||LUCKNOW: As UP elections draw closer, Yogi Adityanath government is expediting various schemes and development works to bring them on the ground as early as possible. The latest project on the government’s list is UP’s first medical device park for which 350 acre land has been identified by the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA). The park is estimated to draw an investment of whopping Rs 5,250 crore and is likely to provide jobs to over 20,000 people, once it gets operational. The park is touted to be UP’s first and north India’s biggest. “The medical device park, which will have an incubation centre on a five-acre land, will prove to be a boon for startups. For the incubation centre, YEIDA has signed an MoU with IIT-Kanpur,” a government spokesperson said. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has already written to the Central government to sanction one such park either in Noida or Lucknow. In the letter, the CM said that a medical park in Noida or Lucknow would be feasible in every way. Pitching for Noida, the CM said the upcoming Jewar International Airport would give direct connectivity to the medical device park. The CM requested the Centre to either sanction bulk drugs or medical device parks to UP. The reply from the central government is still awaited, sources said. Though Indian medicine industry ranks third in the world, the country depends on other nations for raw material for several medicines. For some medicines, dependency is from 80-100%. Ever since the coronavirus pandemic hit the country, there has been a natural shortfall of raw material. It was after this that Niti Aayog, Union health ministry and other departments concerned decided to make India ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) in this field and give impetus to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ dream. “YEIDA has allocated 350 acre land in Sector 28, Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida). The medical device park will come up in two phases,” an official said. Meanwhile, MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said, “The park is not an election stunt as out of the MoUs worth Rs 4.25 lakh crore already signed during the Investor Summit, projects worth around Rs 2 lakh crore are already seen on the ground. Based on this achievement, no one should have any doubt.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/noida-medical-device-park-gets-final-shape/articleshow/85287959.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

The court also directed the government to beef up the security of judicial officers posted in Dhanbad. A division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad while hearing the petition initiated suo motu ordered the CBI to ensure speedy investigation of the case and furnish a status report of the investigation done in a sealed cover. The bench observed that the high court will closely monitor the case till its investigation is concluded by the agency. The judges also said that they do not want to pressure the investigating teams, but are keen that investigation is done in a professional manner to charge the accused persons who killed Dhanbad additional district judge Uttam Anand. Addressing advocate general Rajiv Ranjan, the court said that the government ought to take steps for protecting judicial officers better. Ranjan assured the bench that the government is committed to protect the judicial officers and appropriate steps are being taken in this regard. Judge Uttam Anand was walking near the Randhir Verma Chowk, a posh area in Dhanbad on July 28 at 5am when he was hit by an autorickshaw with a passenger sitting in the front along with the driver. The CCTV footage shows a motorcyclist is going behind the autorickshaw who saw the injured judge fall on the ground. He lay on the road unattended and was subsequently rushed to the hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. The high court immediately swung into action and treated a letter sent by the Dhanbad district judge as a writ petition. The letter informed about the incident and how Anand was killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-directs-cbi-to-speed-up-probe-into-judge-murder-case/articleshow/85285852.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Elderly parents of CMO staff murdered in Palamu||Daltonganj: The elderly parents of an official, who is posted at the chief minister’s office in Ranchi, were killed at their house here late on Wednesday night. The deceased were identified as Rajeshwar Ram (75), an ex-Army man and his wife Parmilla Devi (70). The couple had two sons and one daughter, all married. Their youngest son, Arvind Kumar, is secretary to the principal secretary to the chief minister and lives in Ranchi. Their elder son Arun Kumar, lives 3km away at Shahpur under the Chainpur police station. SP (Palamu) Chandan Kumar Sinha said an investigation has started to find out the criminals and the motive of the murder. He said the unidentified assailants used a sharp-edged weapon to kill them. “The ex-Army man had multiple injuries on his body than his wife. His chest was punctured,” he said, adding that the killers must have been known to the victims. Police said Rajeshwar’s body was found in a pool of blood and the chair he was reportedly sitting in before he was killed was upside down. “The elderly woman was in a pool of blood in the kitchen,” Sinha said. The couple lived alone in their two-story house and was planning to get the upper floor renovated for which a bamboo scaffolding was constructed. The SP said the motive behind the murder is yet to be ascertained but ruled out theft as the intention though the almirah was found broken and open. “The way the couple was killed seemed like revenge and animosity,” Sinha said, adding that the criminals seemed to be professional killers. A team of forensic experts and a sniffer dog from Ranchi were pressed into service on Thursday. A lone CCTV camera installed in the area is being scanned, said police. Police said Arvind had arranged a guard to secure his ageing parents. The guard, however, was not aware of the incident and Arvind found his parents dead when he entered their room. They also said three teacups were found and they are trying to find out if the deceased had entertained any guests. Former minister K N Tripathy visited the house of the deceased and condoled their family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/elderly-parents-of-cmo-staff-murdered-in-palamu/articleshow/85284783.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Dine-in is out, takeaways the new trend in city||Ranchi: Over a month after the unlocking of restaurants and bars in the state, many in these sectors are quickly springing back to normal but the concept of eating out has undergone a paradigm shift in the city. The trend of takeaways — either in person or through food aggregators — has become the preferred mode rather than dine-ins, the owners of most eateries said. Kunwar Bhatia, the owner of the popular Kaveri restaurant, which has several chains, maintained that compared to last year, they have recovered to around 80% of the business since the unlock in June-end. “But more than dine-ins, there has been a massive surge in takeaways since we reopened. In comparison to the last year, there has been more than 50% increase in packed food items. The good thing for us is that our business has managed to recover by 70%- 80% now,” he said. Similarly, Ranjan Kumar, proprietor of another popular multi-cuisine restaurant in Kanke, said, “Takeaways are the new trend in the post lockdown period. For example, out of the 100 sales we make, 40%-50% currently are takeaways. In terms of the overall business, it is near normal now,” he said. Even though Covid-19 cases have decreased substantially in the state, including in Ranchi, restaurant owners said they aren’t taking any chances in ensuring Covid appropriate behaviour at their joints. “Congested seating arrangements is no more the focus as everyone has realised that safety is important for the sustainability of the business. Hence, customers would always find ample distance between the tables at our restaurants. We also conduct regular sanitization of the seating area and kitchens to maintain a high standard of hygiene,” Bhatia said. The manager of Kanha restaurant in Morabadi said unlike the first wave, people have also become highly cautious which makes their job easier to maintain Covid appropriate behaviour at their place. “Earlier, one would have to tell repeatedly to people to put on masks and sanitise their hands before entering, which at times made the customers angry. That is no more the case now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dine-in-is-out-takeaways-the-new-trend-in-city/articleshow/85285946.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Fearing for his life, Ranjan has sought security from the DC. Ram, however, has denied the allegations and said he did not thrash Ranjan. In his letter to the DC, Ranjan said, “On Wednesday, Ram met me in my office to enquire about why I didn’t issue a land receipt for a gair mazruwa plot of land in his relative Prahlad Rajak’s name. I told him that Rajak didn’t submit any request in the circle office. This angered Ram, who thrashed me and injured my ears and chest. He even threatened to implicate me under the SC/ST act and under those sections of the IPC which are used against extremists. I am fearing for my life and want security from the administration as I am visiting areas under my jurisdiction alone.” Ram refuted the charges and said, “I had met him in his office but he later, left. There wasn’t any incident of misbehaviour or thrashing. Moreover, following our meeting, I was in Itkhori block with a team from the public accounts committee of the state assembly. I am not aware what happened to him after our meeting.” Chatra sub-divisional police officer Mumtaz Ansari, who came to know about the incident through social media, said, “If the complaint comes to us, we will probe the matter as per the DC’s guidelines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/chatra-revenue-si-points-assault-finger-at-dsp-urges-dc-for-security/articleshow/85286011.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He stole 23 pairs of jeans, 20 packets of processed cheese, 12kg almonds, 14 formal trousers, a bag, 32 packets of cardamom, 20 packets of cashew nuts, seven sports shoes, 10 undergarment packs, four men’s shirts, three packets of walnuts and two ice cream packs. And yet, cops say that he had broken in only to steal money! The ‘free run’ at Bansal Mall in Gotri happened last month, but mall management filed a complaint at Gotri police station only on Wednesday night. The police said that they have CCTV images of the burglar who spent a lot of time in the mall before decamping with ill-gotten gains worth Rs 52,000. According to the police, the thief entered the mall on July 17 night by breaking the window pane of the washroom. He then broke the glass door of the first floor and went around looking for the cash counter. He found it, broke it but it yielded in zilch. And so, he decided to compensate all the trouble he took, his style. “The mall management learnt about the missing products the next day. But they filed a complaint on Thursday after their monthly audit. We have got CCTV footage of the burglary. The accused was alone but we are trying to ascertain if he had an accomplice,” said S V Chaudhary, Gotri police inspector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ice-cream-burglars-free-run-at-city-mall/articleshow/85283836.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Data shows only 23% of total population vaccinated in state||Ranchi: With increase in awareness, drop in vaccine hesitancy and streamlining of vaccine supply, around 60% of the eligible population in the state has received at least the first dose. But despite the feat, the percentage of vaccinated population is as low as 22.9. According to the projections of the National Commission on Population (NCP), Jharkhand is estimated to have a population of 3.74 crore out of which those eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine (above the age of 18 years) is 2.47 crore which is 66% of the population. Out of the eligible category 60.2% people corresponding to 85,69,939 people have got at least their first dose (around 19 lakh among them getting both doses). Experts believe that since vaccines for all age groups are not yet available, it was necessary to achieve a close to cent per cent vaccination target for effective protection against the virus. “We all know that the virus chain can be broken when more than 70% of the population has antibodies against the virus and given the fact that around 33% of population is ineligible for the vaccine, we must target cent per cent vaccination for the remaining population,” said a senior doctor in the state public health unwilling to be quoted. “It is premature to state anything because vaccines for the younger population are likely to be introduced,” he added. On an average, 60,000-80,000 doses of vaccines are being administered all over the state daily. As on Thursday, the government has stocks of 4,14,500 doses of both Covishield and Covaxin, enough to run the drive at a regular pace for the next five days. Apart from regular supply, awareness among people has also helped the state pep up its drive in urban and rural areas. The villages in Jharkhand have taken help of hakua (villager appointed to make announcements) in spreading awareness. Ward member of Gunia village under Ghaghra block of Gumla district, Sudarshan Gope, said they have been collecting the eligible villagers by making announcements through the hakua. “We invite the vaccinators and press the hakua into service to make announcements to collect them at anganwadi centres,” he said, clarifying that in the farming season, no one wants to waste their days work by sitting at the anganwadi centres waiting for the vaccinators, so the method was devised. In Senha block of Lohardaga district, Karamchand Oraon, a village headman, has been spreading awareness by making rounds on his bicycle. “I use the video messages that I receive on my phone to convince the villagers but I am sure they will turn up once the paddy sowing is complete,” he said, explaining the reason for the low turnouts at the vaccine centres in his village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/data-shows-only-23-of-total-population-vaccinated-in-state/articleshow/85284888.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Steel City cops nab 64 people, seize huge amt of drugs during 6-month-long drive||Jamshedpur: The Steel City police have nabbed 64 persons and seized over 400gm of brown sugar and more than 63kg of marijuana during its six-month-long drive against drug trafficking from January to June. SSP M Tamil Vanan has said most of the arrests were made from Jugsalai, Sitaramdera and Mango police station areas, though arrests and seizures have also been reported in Bistupur, Burmamines, Kadma, Sonari and Bagbera police station areas. He added, “Intelligence gathering and patrolling across several police station areas was expedited following the initial seizures and this helped in strengthening the vigilance system and thereby, led to the arrests.” Vanan further said that they have filed cases under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The cops were taken aback upon seeing the number of women who were arrested for being involved in the brown sugar racket. Of all the women arrested till now, nine have already been forwarded to jail. Police don’t rule out the fact that smugglers use women for drug peddling to hoodwink the cops by assuming that police will not suspect the women. Asked about the reason behind the high occurrence of drug trafficking in the city, a police inspector preferring anonymity said, “The city’s proximity to towns like Adityapur, Chandil, Chaibasa and Ghatshila give an easy access to the smugglers here which is the main reason why cases of drugs peddling have gone up.” Vanan assured that with continuous improvisation of the beat policing and intelligence gathering system, the problem of drug trafficking will be addressed more effectively in the coming days. Meanwhile, a rehabilitation centre here named Crisis Intervention Centre (CIC), also known said that number of youngsters becoming drug addicts has gone up amid the pandemic. “Over the past year, on an average, six addicts, including both alcohol and drug addicts, have visited our centre daily for counselling,” CIC coordinator Kanchan Kumar said. He said out of the 20 addicts presently admitted at the centre, 12 are in the age group of 18 to 30. “Some of the addicts also indulged in petty crime to arrange funds for the drugs,” Kanchan added. Dr Mahesh Hembram, who has a specialisation in alcohol de-addiction and drug de-addiction, said mental stress caused by various kinds of losses, be it financial or personal, during Covid is also one of the factors pushing up the consumption of contraband substances in the city. "Covid-linked stress has contributed marginally in driving youngsters towards addiction,” he said. He added that every month, on an average, 30 persons suffering from drug addiction come to him for help. Dr Hembram said drugs were prevalent in the city in the past as well but with the police becoming proactive in its crackdown on drug smuggling now, the number of arrests have gone up. Besides the police action, a dedicated de-addiction hospital is required to deal with the addicts and awareness and counselling sessions at school and colleges will nip the problem in its bud, Dr Hembram said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/steel-city-cops-nab-64-people-seize-huge-amt-of-drugs-during-6-month-long-drive/articleshow/85285904.cms||B Sridhar

The buyer, Baby Devi (42), a childless woman, was also arrested. The girl child was traced and recovered from Bengaluru. The six-year-old girl belonged to a poor family and was begging on the streets at Booty More in Ranchi city on July 17 when Gudia and the minor girl kidnapped her. The duo took the child on an autorickshaw to Badgai where they bought clothes for her from a shop. They handed over the child to Baby Devi saying the girl is an orphan and lives with her maternal grandmother. They advised Baby Devi to take her to Bengaluru. Baby Devi was from Bihar and had a hotel business in Bengaluru. She had built a house in Kishunpur area near Booty More of Ranchi, where she was staying for the past several months due to the lockdown. During her stay, Gudia and the minor girl came to know that she is childless and offered to provide her with a child for Rs 40,000. Meanwhile, the mother of the six-year-old girl, Balo Devi, filed a missing person’s complaint with the sadar police station. The officer officer-in-charge of the station, Inspector Venkatesh Kumar, started an investigation into the case and examined the CCTV camera footage of the Booty More area and found the two women taking away the child. He also located the autorickshaw and its driver and the shop where the girl’s clothes were bought from the footage. Later, the shopkeeper provided the addresses of the duo to the police. Police arrested Gudia and subsequently coordinated with the Bengaluru police to recover the girl from Baby Devi’s residence located at an area under the Vyalikaval police station area late on Tuesday night. A police team brought the girl child to Ranchi on Thursday. Venkatesh said, “We have registered a case for kidnapping and human trafficking against the accused persons in connection with the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2-arrested-for-selling-6-year-old-girl-in-ranchi/articleshow/85284756.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||India||Merit must come first in selection of judges, says Justice Nariman||NEW DELHI: On the last day in his seven “gruelling and difficult years” of Supreme Court judgeship, Justice R F Nariman on Thursday said merit must predominate all other considerations in selection of judges for the highest court as the national and the litigating public has a right to a certain quality of justice from the final court. At a crowded farewell ceremony and after soaking in generous plaudits from lawyers to the CJI, Justice Nariman said, “I also believe that nobody has any legitimate expectation to come to this court, nobody. I believe there is a legitimate expectation in the people of India and the litigating public to get a certain quality of justice from this final court. For that, it is very clear that merit must predominate subject to other factors. But merit always comes first.” He agreed with SCBA president Vikas Singh and said, "It is time more direct appointees are elevated to the bench. I will exhort those direct appointees never to say no. It is their solemn duty, having reaped so much from the profession, to give back." He described how he was not given the option to refuse by then CJI R M Lodha.' Justice Nariman’s resolute insistence on giving priority to the elevation of two chief justices ahead of others in the zone of consideration had contributed largely to the stalling of the selection of persons for appointment as SC judges for almost two years by the five-judge collegium, resulting in the apex court functioning with 30% vacancy. Read AlsoJustice Rohinton Fali Nariman exit may give collegium space to discuss Supreme Court judge picksNEW DELHI: Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, the second most senior Supreme Court judge, retired on Thursday marking the exit of a brilliant legal mind from the judiciary’s highest echelon, which is palpably stuttering with 10 vacancies that could largely be attributed to his firm stand on theSingh said Nariman did a great pecuniary sacrifice by accepting judgeship, as his one good day’s earning as a lawyer would equal the salaried income of Nariman the judge in seven years. Nariman said, "These seven years have been the most gruelling and difficult years of my life. I can tell you it is no cakewalk. When I was a lawyer, I had no concept of what it is to be a judge. Now having been on both sides, the judge side is much much more difficult. You have to read and work much more. In fact, in the second week of my judgeship, Mukul Rohatgi appeared before me. Mukul, as usual, had his 20 or 25 briefs daily. And I said 'Mr Rohatgi, today I have beaten you hollow. Against your 20-25 briefs, I have 65'." Nariman said, "I can’t say that I have enjoyed every minute of being a judge. It was very hard work, but I certainly enjoyed writing judgments. At the end of it all it worked out well." CJI N V Ramana too talked about the gruelling life of a judge before heaping wholesome praise on Justice Nariman. He said, "With Justice Nariman’s retirement, I feel like I am losing one of the lions that guarded the judicial institution. Our loss will be a huge gain elsewhere. I am sure that gain will continue to be for the larger public good." On a judge’s life, the CJI said the public has a misconception "that judges stay in big bungalows, work only 10 to 4(pm) and enjoy their holidays". He said the reality is quite afar. "I would like to highlight a few things that are not known to the public at large. The first relates to the number of sacrifices one must make when one decides to become a judge. The most obvious sacrifice is monetary, particularly when you are Justice Nariman with a roaring practice. One must be moved by a spirit of public duty to take such a decision." "The second aspect relates to the reduced role in society one must accept when becoming a judge. I have already made my views clear on this issue. I am not one of those who believe that judges must completely seclude themselves, as I think that it is important to stay in touch with society and the profession even as a judge. However, the undeniable fact is that our engagement with society undergoes a drastic change once we take up judgeship," he said. "The third point I would like to flag relates to the amount of work we put in as judges, day in and day out… It is not easy to prepare for more than 100 cases every week, listen to novel arguments, do independent research, and author judgments, while also dealing with the various administrative duties of a judge, particularly of a senior judge. We either burn the midnight oil or wake up before sunrise, or sometimes even both, to fulfil our judicial duties. We continue to work even during court holidays, do research and author pending judgments," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/merit-must-come-first-in-selection-of-judges-says-justice-nariman/articleshow/85290131.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Two more offences of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy were registered against Chintan alias Chetan Patel at JP Road and Waghodiya police stations based on complaints lodged by the victims. Sohil Hussain Sindhi, a resident of Dabhoi; Liaquat Sindhi and Imtiyaz Sindha, both residents of Tandalja; and Vishwarajsinh Vaghela, from Ahmedabad, were promised of a job in ONGC by Patel last year. The accused had told them he has influence as his father is a commissioner in the income tax department in Delhi while his elder brother is a managing director in ONGC. He had told the four youth that he will help them get a good job in the public sector company with a good pay package, but they will have to shell out Rs 5 lakh each for it. The four victims got lured by Patel’s offer and gave him Rs 20 lakh cash. In September last year, Patel gave them fake joining letters for the post of public relations officers in ONGC with monthly salary of Rs 60,000. Police said that the letter even mentioned November 27, 2020 as the joining date. But when they got the letters verified with ONGC office in Ahmedabad, they learnt that the letters were fake. The victims told police that they contacted Patel on learning the truth, but he stopped answering their calls and refused to return their money. In March, Patel launched a residential project on Waghodiya Road and installed a banner on the project site inviting interested buyers to contact him. Rakesh Patel and his four friends showed interest in buying houses and paid token amounts of Rs 50,000 each. But Patel did not initiate construction and did not give a proper response to the buyers. Police said that Patel had even taken over Rs 2.5 lakh from another Waghodiya resident Darshan Punjabi by promising him a visa for the United Kingdom. But this promise also turned out to be false as Patel did not return Punjabi’s passport nor his money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bjp-worker-who-duped-kin-cheated-10-others-of-rs-25-lakh/articleshow/85283844.cms||---
---||India||After GSLV launch failed, space minister says ‘mission can be rescheduled’; slams Jairam for saying 'Isro should be made a scientific enterprise’||NEW DELHI: After Isro’s GSLV-F10 rocket on Thursday failed to inject the new-series earth observation satellite EOS-03 (Gisat-1) into the geo orbit, Union space minister Jitendra Singh on Thursday said the mission can be rescheduled again. The launch setback, however, turned political when Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said, “Isro should now be made a scientific enterprise”, which invited severe criticism from the space minister. Five minutes after the lift-off, the GSLV rocket malfunctioned, leading to the failure of the mission. Reacting to the setback, Jitendra Singh tweeted: “Spoke to Chairman ISRO, Dr K Sivan and discussed in detail. The first two stages went off fine, only after that there was a difficulty in cryogenic upper stage ignition. The mission can be re-scheduled some time again.” Rescheduling the mission, however, won’t be easy and immediate as Isro will need several months to develop the new-series geo satellite and build the GSLV rocket from scratch for the launch. Soon after the mission failure, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh tweeted: “Isro has the resilience to bounce back. And it will. However, it should be allowed to function as a scientific and technological enterprise as put in place by Vikram Sarabhai and Satish Dhawan. There is far too much political grandstanding on it now.” Hitting back at the Congress leader, the space minister said: “Jairam ji, please dont forget, most of Space related pitfalls, including mysterious midnight death of Vikram Sarabhai, happened during Congress regime. Going by the same analogy, had Congress refrained from political interference, Sarabhai could have contributed valuably for many more years.” EOS-03 geo imaging satellite was an important mission for Isro as it had strategic and civilian importance. Had the launch been successful, the 2,268-kg satellite would have boosted the country’s border defences as it had the “ability to imaging the whole country 4-5 times daily”. EOS-03 was also intended to provide vital information for application in different sectors, including agriculture, forestry, water bodies as well as for disaster warning, cyclone monitoring, cloudburst or thunderstorm monitoring. A total of 18 GSLVs (Mk I, II and III), including Thursday’s launch, have been flown till now. Of them, 12 were successful and six were failures (four total failures and two partial). Owing to its unpredictable performance, Isro officials had, therefore, dubbed the GSLV rocket a “naughty boy”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-gslv-launch-failed-space-minister-says-mission-can-be-rescheduled-slams-jairam-for-saying-isro-should-be-made-a-scientific-enterprise/articleshow/85290267.cms||Surendra Singh

The shots are being offered by a handful of the hospitals and most of slots are booked for the next few days. Over 3,000 shots of the Sputnik V have been administered this week in Pune. Murali Rao, director, Columbia Asia hospital, said, “The first and second shot vials of the Sputnik V are unlike Covishield and Covaxin. So, we had ordered around 6,000 first doses and 4,000 second doses. The first doses are now over, as we have vaccinated these beneficiaries. Now, only the second doses of the vaccine are left,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sputnik-v-gets-steady-response/articleshow/85285813.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||India||GSLV suffers glitch, fails to deliver geo satellite||BENGALURU: Isro, early on Thursday suffered twin setbacks as the GSLV-F10 that took off from the second launch pad at Sriharikota developed an anomaly in the cryogenic upper stage (CUS) and failed to deliver Geo Imaging Satellite (Gisat-1) to the intended orbit. The failure of the mission not only makes unavailable the much anticipated Gisat-1 — officially named EOS-03 — that could have also aided military operations, but also raises concerns of the reliability of the CUS of GSLV-MkII. Isro has been hoping to use this class of rockets more frequently for commercial launches. The GSLV-F10 took off at 5.43am as scheduled and the core stage burn-out happened as planned, propelling the rocket in its intended path. Second stage ignition happened some two minutes into the launch and payload fairing was confirmed by the mission control a little after four minutes of the launch, as planned. Tense moments then followed soon after the second stage shut off. While the mission control was heard announcing the command for CUS ignition, there was no confirmation about it and telemetry screens began showing a deviation in the path of the third stage. “GSLV-F10 launch took place today at 5.43am as scheduled. Performance of the first and second stages was normal. However, CUS ignition did not happen due to a technical anomaly. The mission couldn't be accomplished as intended,” Isro said in a statement, minutes after chairman K Sivan announced the same at Sriharikota. Since the CUS didn’t ignite, the third stage along with the payload didn’t have the required velocity to remain in space. One source said: “It impacted the Andaman sea a few minutes later.” The CUS was at an altitude of around 140km when the anomaly occurred. FAC analysisIsro will now form a failure analysis committee (FAC) to analyse the data. Sivan and multiple other scientists TOI spoke with, including S Somnath, director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, said Isro would need at least 24 hours to elaborate on the anomaly. “...The third stage should have ignited and performed, and since that did not function properly, we’ve lost the satellite. We are waiting for data to know the exact reason,” Sivan told TOI. This was the space agency’s third attempt at launching the satellite. The first launch was scheduled for March 5, 2020, but scrubbed minutes before the 26-hour countdown was to begin on March 4, 2020. And then, Isro again planned to launch earlier this year (2021), but it didn’t happen owing to a voltage issue that scientists described as a “minor power problem”. One scientist in the know had said “the satellite has some voltage fluctuation issue”, while multiple scientists had denied any problem with the launch vehicle. Designed to provide near real-time images of large “areas of region of interest” at frequent intervals, the satellite also held the potential of aiding the country’s armed forces to plan operations. The 2,268kg satellite was expected to boost India’s abilities by providing near real-time observation of the sub-continent, under cloud-free conditions, at frequent intervals. “It will provide spectral signatures for agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, disaster warning, cloud properties, snow, glaciers and oceanography,’’ Isro had said earlier. ‘No concern for Chandrayaan, Gaganyaan’While Isro will now have to take a relook at the CUS, a critical stage of the heavy-lifter GSLV-Mk2 class of rockets which it was hoping to make more mainstream, Thursday’s failure will not have any effect on the Chandrayaan-3 and Gaganyaan programmes as those missions will use the GSLV-MkIII. “The GSLV-Mk3 uses a completely different CUS compared to this one (Mk2). It is too early to say what went wrong with today’s mission, but it will certainly have no impact on the manned and moon missions,” Somnath explained. Although both GSLV-MK1 and MK2 are from the same family of launch vehicles, their CUS compositions are different. While the Mk2, used in Thursday’s launch is powered by the CE-7.5 engine, which was India's first cryogenic engine, the Mk3, whose CUS is called C25, is powered by the CE-20 engine, India's largest cryogenic engine. “Also, they work on different thermo dynamics and have different gas cycles,” one person familiar with the projects added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gslv-suffers-glitch-fails-to-deliver-geo-satellite/articleshow/85290327.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Goa||Goa: Drinking water safety not part of study, clarifies NIO||PANAJI: A day after a report by the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) titled ‘Clean Drinking Water: A Pipe Dream?’ assessing Goa’s tap water was released to the media, NIO clarified that it was an academic study whose results never stated that the water is unsafe and unfit for drinking. The institute also stated that the study only showed the presence of microplastics in tap water, and did not in any way make any assessment of the quality of drinking water, and that microplastics have been identified in the tap water in other states, too. “On behalf of NIO, I would like to clarify that the finding of microplastics in tap water was an academic study, which only shows the presence of microplastics in tap water. However the results never state the tap water is unsafe and unfit for drinking,” NIO project investigator, Mahua Saha said. Saha also said that based on this limited body of evidence, firm conclusions on the risk associated with ingestion of microplastic particles through drinking water cannot be determined as yet. There is no data to suggest health concerns associated with exposure to microplastics through drinking water, even according to WHO reports, she said. The testing was undertaken as part of a research study (consultancy project from Toxic Link) on the presence of microplastics in various mediums, and “findings do not make any assessment on the quality of drinking water”, NIO said. “Currently there are no national and international standards of microplastics for drinking water throughout the world (WHO report) and mere presence of microplastics does not in any way make the water unfit for drinking,” Saha said. There have been previous studies that reported presence of microplastics in Delhi’s tap water, NIO said, adding that another scientific study conducted on bottled water also showed presence of microplastics in packaged drinking water. The bottled water samples were collected from Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai. This report, too, was covered by both national and international media. “All the reports are part of a larger scientific study and data on presence of microplastics in various mediums. These currently have no implication on standards or assessment on quality of drinking water. We have just reported the preliminary study based on a one-time sample collection,” Saha said. NIO said that in drinking-water, an understanding of the occurrence and fate of microplastics is needed throughout the water supply chain, pre- and post-treatment and in sub-optimal conditions to determine the proportion of and types of microplastic particles coming from the freshwater environment, abstraction, treatment systems, distribution systems and bottling and to better characterise effectiveness of water treatment. “The significance of exposure to microplastics in drinking-water also needs to consider relative exposure from other sources such as food and air. It is difficult with available information to make a robust quantitative estimate on the relative contribution from different sources. A better understanding of occurrence in these environmental compartments, including quality of these studies, will be useful in articulating relative exposure through drinking-water compared to other sources,” NIO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/drinking-water-safety-not-part-of-study-nio/articleshow/85285139.cms||---

---||Goa||PWD raises doubts on report’s veracity||Panaji: Public Works Department (PWD) on Thursday questioned the authenticity of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) report on the presence of microplastics in Goa’s tap water. PWD, which looks after the operation and maintenance of drinking water supply in the state, said that the water supplied by them is safe and fit for human consumption and that there should not be any fear and anxiety in the minds of the people in this regard. Reacting to the study — ‘Clean Drinking Water: A Pipe Dream?’ — jointly carried out by NIO and Delhi-based advocacy group Toxics Link, PWD said, “When we look at the presence of microplastics in water, as per the information available on the internet, it is revealed that microplastics are found in tap water across the world.” A study has shown that 82% of the samples surveyed in New Delhi are contaminated with microplastics smaller than five millimetre in size, PWD said. Hence, the authenticity of this team led by NIO’s Mahua Saha needs to be looked upon and the team has to inform why the testing was not carried out in other states and also for bottled water as also their future plans, it added. “The potential threat of microplastics cannot be ignored, but the study has failed to indicate the action/remedy that one has to take to eliminate the absence of microplastics,” PWD said. PWD said that they test water quality samples as per CPHEEO manual and IS 10500:2012. “Now when we look at WHO standards, IS standards, CPHEEO manual or any standard or manuals, the water quality check for microplastics is not mentioned and in the absence of this there is no standards or procedures to conduct the tests and probably this test may not be conducted by any government,” PWD said. The department said that it carries out detailed analysis every day and only after the drinking water conforms to the prescribed limits is it supplied. Testing is also carried out at strategic locations and at consumer points on a regular basis, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pwd-raises-doubts-on-reports-veracity/articleshow/85285241.cms||---

Even the completed portions are having constant defects, incurring further costs as well as endangering the lives of Goans,” convenor, AAP Rahul Mhambre said, adding that the sudden hurry to close an arm of the bridge is only to make “temporary cosmetic repairs so any major mishaps are avoided before the 2022 election”. The bridge was inaugurated in a hurry for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections when portions of the bridge were still incomplete, AAP stated. “Crores of public money have already been spent on consultancy, studies, reports, tests, etc most of which was done by BJP’s pet vendors who functioned as the conduits of corruption. Sawant can spend as much moremoney as he wants, but the fact remains that the bridge was built on a foundation of corruption,” Mhambre said, calling the chief minister’s assurance to rope in IIT Chennai to study defects, an “eye wash”. AAP also highlighted the hazardous conditions and traffic chaos that “the incomplete bridge and faulty design has created at the KTC circle in Panaji”. The bridges, roads and infrastructure built on borrowed money are crumbling even before proper completion, Mhambre said, adding that they were “low-quality, high-cost”. AAP was reacting to the government’s announcement that the Atal Setu arm from the Merces circle would be closed for vehicular traffic for 100 days till November 20 to carry out road repairs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bridge-closure-exposes-devpt-claims-aap/articleshow/85285336.cms||---

The rescue operation at Vagator involved five jetski and more than 15 lifesavers. Drishti said, soon after the boat capsized, two fishermen, who had jumped into the waters, went missing and the jetskis had to be plugged into action to find them. The remaining eight were rescued by the lifesavers. They were then moved to Vagator for first aid, Dristi said. “It was a team effort. Lifesaver Yashwant Kurle first noticed the fishermen jumping off and the boat that was sinking. The quick response by Amit Mahale, Gauresh Mote and Sachin Naik of Vagator tower on jetskis as first responders, saved the first lot before more Jetski arrived,” Drishti stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/10-fishermen-rescued-off-chapora-coast/articleshow/85285409.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This is set to change in the next few months, as the civic body has launched a drive to identify and beautify these spaces. The space under flyovers is either used for dumping construction debris or as illegal parking space for street hawkers. This is set to change in the next few months, as the civic body has launched a drive to identify and beautify these spaces. The first three flyovers in the pipeline are the Gandhi Mandapam flyover, G K Moopanar flyover and Pantheon Road flyover. Under the chief minsiter’s Singara Chennai project, the civic body is teaming up with Chennai metro rail and the state highways department to beautify these idle spaces with water fountains, flowering plants, art work and seating arrangements. A joint inspection was also held on Thursday when the civic body finalized the Koyambedu junction for the next renovation project along with the CMRL. The work at Kathipara flyover is nearing completion. Gagandeep Singh Bedi, corporation commissioner, said they review the beautification work every 15 days, and recently decided to redesign spaces under flyovers. The corporation alone won't be executing these projects, as metro rail, highways and other departments will also be involved in the process. Four stretches maintained by CMRL— Koyambedu to Alandur, Tondiarpet to Wimco Nagar, Saidapet to Airport and Alandur to St Thomas Mount will be revamped. Fourteen flyover spaces by state highways department, including Vysarpadi flyover, are also on the revamp list. In total, there are 35 flyovers and about 150 bridges that will be revamped. The civic body has already set up vertical gardens at the IIT-M flyover, but they now plan to add a small garden, water fountains and seating arrangements. It will be a place where people can hang out. These will be undertaken using CSR funds and some work will be taken up under capital expenditure, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/space-below-3-flyovers-in-chennai-to-be-turned-into-leisure-places-for-the-public/articleshow/85290399.cms||Komal Gautham

Twitter took the action after some users reported that Kamat had shared Rahul Gandhi’s tweet about the nine-year-old girl who was allegedly raped and murdered in Delhi. Kamat blamed BJP for his account being suspended. The Margao MLA said that if demanding justice for dalits and the bahujan samaj is a crime, then he would do it again. “It is unfortunate that on the death anniversary of late Bhausaheb Bandodkar, my Twitter account is locked,” said Kamat. Kamat retweeted Rahul Gandhi’s post which had a picture of the Congress MP meeting family members of the nine-year-old dalit girl who was allegedly sexually assaulted and murdered. On August 7, Rahul Gandhi’s account was temporarily suspended. Soon after, accounts of other Congress officials such as Randeep Surjewala, Ajay Maken, Sushmita Dev and Manickam Tagore were also temporarily suspended because they violated Twitter’s rules. The micro-blogging site said, “Twitter rules are enforced judiciously and impartially for everyone on our service. We have taken proactive action on several hundred tweets that posted an image that violated our rules and may continue to do so in line with our range of enforcement options.” Kamat paid his respects to Goa’s first chief minister Bhausaheb Bandodkar and said that it is the duty of every citizen to fight for the rights of the bahujan samaj and dalits. Accusing BJP of suppressing the voice of the people, he said, “If demanding justice for them is a crime under the insensitive BJP government, I will do it again and again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/twitter-suspends-kamats-account-mla-blames-bjp/articleshow/85285494.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Maharashtra government on Wednesday carried out a second round of unlocking, allowing the malls to stay open till 10pm and allowing entry to only the fully immunised visitors. Malls in Pune were, however, allowed to remain open till 8pm. Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, chief operating officer, Amanora Mall, said, “Under normal circumstances, the extension of the deadline would have been a boost for business, as the 8-10 pm window is the peak time for customer inflow. But the footfall is at an all-time low due to the regulation of allowing entry to only the fully vaccinated visitors.” He added, “For any mall to open, we have to deploy manpower at the toilets, entrance and exit gates, parking slots and on the floor, and for switching on and off the air conditioning systems and lights. The malls have to incur 100% expenditure to generate barely 8% revenue at this point. Though we were shut for several months, we had to pay monthly bills of Rs50-60 lakh. The government has not provided any rebates on taxes or bills.” Shopping mall trade bodies also flagged the fully vaccinated rider for patrons. “Only a small percentage of people has been fully vaccinated yet, and most of them are above 60. Most people in the 18-44 age group, who visit malls with friends and families, have not been fully vaccinated yet,” said Mukesh Kumar, chairman of the Shopping Centre Association of India. He said the state could consider allowing people inoculated with their first dose or not vaccinated yet having a negative RT-PCR report not older than a specified time period visit malls. A representative from a mall said, “Most of the retailers’ employees are in their 20s and have not yet received their second shot. As a result, many retailers are understaffed. The fully vaccinated rider is setback.” (Inputs by Piyush Bhusari)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/malls-seek-repeal-of-fully-vaccinated-rider-for-entry/articleshow/85285708.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Chief minister M K Stalin is likely to inaugurate the parks at Kotturpuram and Nolambur this month. The first such park was inaugurated in December 2018 at Santhome by the Greater Chennai Corporation. It not just won them a state government award but was also a big hit among disabled children and elderly for its exclusive play features. In fact the park has brought the entire community together, apart from earning accolades from local residents too. These two new parks boast of disabled-friendly play equipment such as merry-go round-on-wheelchair, sensory areas for the blind and deaf such as stepping stones, wind chimes, touch and feel grafitti, game area and tactile markings. The parks also have herb garden, outdoor gym, table games, a badminton court and a multiplay area. Santhome park has a basketball court for the disabled. Sitting behind the design table, Kavitha Selvaraj, the architect of City-Works, which designed the parks, said, “The idea is to cater to all senses and to make it inclusive with at least one feature for all kinds of disabilities. We have also made these parks more environmentally sustainable with more green spaces and porous land,” said Kavitha Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said they were happy to add these parks to the city’s landscape. “Our plan is to add one inclusive play equipment in every park, to make all of them accessible to the disabled. We are yet to get completion reports for these parks. They will be inaugurated soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/two-disabled-friendly-parks-to-be-added-to-chennais-landscape/articleshow/85290411.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Goa||Goa: HC asks Siridao-Pale sarpanch to cease office||PANAJI: After making a prima facie observation that, “democratic process has been subverted” in the Siridao-Pale panchayat by the government authorities to enable the sarpanch to continue even after he lost majority, the high court of Bombay at Goa in an interim order directed that the sarpanch should cease to continue in his post. “…and any attempt on the part of Respondent no. 2 (Jagdish Gauns) to act as sarpanch of this panchayat will have to be dealt with seriously by the director of panchayat or the additional director of panchayat,” the court held. “… the deputy sarpanch ie Petitioner no. 4 will be entitled to exercise the powers to perform the duties of the sarpanch until a sarpanch is duly elected,” the court held. The “extent to which the matters have gone, to enable” the sarpanch to cling to power are at least, prima facie, a “sad reflection of how democracy is subverted at the grass-root level of Panchayats,” Justice Mahesh Sonak stated. The court found the incident “extremely disturbing” where the democratic process was subverted. The panchayat comprises seven members and, on July 16, four of them constituting a majority applied under Section 51 of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act for convening a special meeting to consider a motion of no-confidence against the sarpanch for misappropriation of funds, not taking members in confidence, abuse of powers and encouraging illegal construction. At the meeting specially convened at the verandah of the panchayat office because the panchayat office was mysteriously locked on that day of the motion, the four expressed want of confidence against the sarpanch. The police present at the site declined to open the lock of the panchayat office. “The additional director has then found fault with the motion because the minutes were recorded in a notebook and not in the minutes’ book. There is nothing illegal or irregular in the recording of minutes in a notebook having regard to the circumstances in which the same were recorded,” the court stated, adding that the petitioners even pleaded that the panchayat office was locked and the minute books and stamps inside the panchayat office. “To insist that despite this the minutes should have been recorded in the official minutes’ book, is again an example of clear perversity,” the court added. “The additional director should have ordered an immediate inquiry as to how the panchayat office was locked on the crucial date when the special meeting to consider the motion of no-confidence was to be held and taken up the matter by himself with the higher authorities as to the role of the police in not allowing elected representatives to enter into the panchayat office and to hold a special meeting for considering the motion of no-confidence,” the court held. Instead, the Additional Director proceeded to find fault with the non-record of minutes in the official minute book and thereby sought to restore him to the position of sarpanch, when it is apparent that the he has lost the support of the majority, the court stated. The petitioners were represented by Adv Carlos Alvares Ferreira with Adv D D Zaveri and Adv Arjun Naik representing the other group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-asks-siridao-pale-sarpanch-to-cease-office/articleshow/85285743.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Will withdraw bhumiputra bill if it’s faulty: BJP||Quepem: BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade on Thursday said the government would withdraw the Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill if people think it is faulty and not in their interest. “The bill was moved in good intention. Now, some people are opposing it, but if they don’t want it, chief minister will withdraw it after taking all MLAs and ministers into confidence. The bill has not been sent to the governor for his approval,” said Tanavade at a press conference Thursday evening. Tanavade briefed the media after addressing the booth-in-charge meeting at Quepem on Thursday in the presence of deputy chief minister and Quepem MLA, Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar. Responding to the public outcry against the bill, Chief minister Pramod Sawant had said that suggestions from the citizens would be incorporated in the bill and that the nomenclature - Bhumiputra would be deleted from it. Stating that it was being done to respect people’s sentiments, Sawant said that the new name of the bill would be reintroduced in the winter session of the Goa legislative assembly within the next two months. Tanavade stated that BJP will win the Quepem seat for the first time in 2022 elections, as BJP will garner Kavlekar’s Congress votes. About a ticket to Kavlekar’s wife Savitri from Sanguem constituency where she is campaigning, Tanavade said the party will decide. Justifying the government decision, Sawant had said that more than 1.5 lakh houses would be benefited through this bill, adding that the bill has been brought in the interest of Goans, and dismissed apprehensions that it would only help migrants.

The sharpest fall was reported from Chennai and Coimbatore became the district with highest number of cases after an increase in new cases. On Friday, Chennai reported 217 new cases against 243 it logged on Thursday, while cases in Coimbatore rose from 229 to 240 during the same time period. Thanjavur reported the sharpest rise from 77 cases to 102 cases. Barring Chennai and Coimbatore active cases were fewer than 2000 in all districts, although nearly 90% of beds in both these districts are vacant. “We have asked all districts to increase surveillance and testing. While there was a quick fall in cases between May and July, new cases in TN has remained almost stagnant at between 1,900 and 1800 since July 19,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “This is because of small clusters we see periodically across all districts. In most cases, health workers have found violations in pandemic protocols,” he said. Of the 33 deaths, there were six in Coimbatore, five in Salem, four in Tiruppur, three in Kanyakumari, and two each in Chennai, Thiruvarur and Pudukottai. Meanwhile, TN received 7.6 lakh doses of Covishield and 1.3 lakh of Covaxin on Thursday, when most vaccine centres were complaining of low stock. Over the last three days the number of vaccinations has been coming down. On Thursday, for the first time in August, the number of vaccinations went below 1 lakh to 92334, after reporting 1.07 lakh on Wednesday and 1.5 lakh on Tuesday. “The vaccines we received today have been dispatched to districts,” said director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam. Active cases cross 900 in Pondy againThe active Covid-19 cases crossed 900-mark yet again in Puducherry. The territory reported 109 fresh cases even as 59 patients recovered in the last 24 hours taking the active cases to 914 on Thursday. A 61-year old woman from Puducherry and an 86-year-old man from Mahe died of the infection taking the death toll to 1,803. So far, 7.5 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-reports-1942-new-covid-cases-33-deaths/articleshow/85290434.cms||---

The markets regulator has also impounded “ill-gotten gains” of nearly Rs 24 crore from these entities. Sebi’s internal surveillance system had shown unusual price movement in the Zee stock in August last year. After an investigation, Sebi found that Bijal Shah, a top executive at Zee, had passed on information about the media company’s forthcoming results to Gopal Ritolia, a director at UBS India, and Jatin Chawla, an ex-director at Credit Suisse and currently director at First Voyagers Advisors. Based on this unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI), Ritolia and Chawla bought large chunks of Zee shares ahead of the announcement of its quarterly and annual results. These trades were done in the accounts of their respective mothers, the Sebi report said. Chawla passed on the UPSI to Amit Bhanwarlal Jajoo, the authorised person (AP) of Edelweiss Securities, who gave it to Manish Kumar Jajoo, his cousin who also worked with the same broking house. Amit and Manish too bought large chunks of the Zee stock before the company’s results. They used the trading accounts of seven family members. The Sebi investigation, which included scanning social media, call data records and bank statements, found that all the nine trading accounts were used for insider trading. These nine had started building their positions from August 11, 2020, just after Zee disclosed to the bourses that its board will be considering its results few days later on August 18. “Further, all the said entities had significant concentration in (Zee) scrip only around the announcement as compared to the earlier periods. All the masterminds had used the trading accounts of their family members in order to avoid regulatory detection,” the Sebi order noted. The investigation also found that Ritolia and Chawla, through the trading accounts of their respective mothers, had taken significant positions in Zee prior to the announcements of other price-sensitive information, which include earlier financial results and the launch of the cinema-to home service, ZEE Plex. Ritolia and Chawla were batchmates at IIM-Lucknow. Shah, Ritolia and Chawla knew each other for over 15 years, having worked together at IIFL Securities and other brokerages in the past, the order said. Sebi found the repetitive nature of trading activity around the significant announcements by Zee to be highly suspicious and, therefore, passed an interim order debarring the entities from accessing the capital markets and also impounded the ill-gotten gains, the regulator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zee-insider-trading-sebi-bars-15-entities/articleshow/85290439.cms||---

Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) operates buses along a dozen important routes from Velachery to other areas in the city like Ambattur (D70), Perambur (29N) and Thiruporur (568B). But the bus terminus is able to accommodate only four buses at a time. Therefore, passengers are forced to wait for buses under extreme heat or rain. Some of them wait under treesa few yards away, and run when the buses reach the terminus. There are sign boards showing list of buses which are expected to arrive or depart from the terminus. The public address system too is defunct most of the times, complain regular MTC bus commuters. Senior citizens and students, who arrive at the terminus, also don't have shelters while they wait in long queues to get concessional or free passes renewed. In the opposite side (towards Tambaram), the bus stand has been completely dismantled. S Kumara Raja from the Federation of Velachery Welfare Association said that the ideal location to shift the bus terminus would be the Mass Rapid Transit System premises (located diagonally opposite to the existing terminus location) so that people getting down from the local train can easily board buses to their respective areas or vice-versa. If the discussion between the Union and state governments is not fetching any results, MTC should start looking at other possibilities. There is a 1.75-acre vacant plot, which belongs to Dhandeeswarar temple, on Taramani Road. Right now, private omni buses are using this facility. MTC can pay or take this land for lease to construct a terminus, he added. S Vignesh of Madipakkam said even the approach roads towards the terminus are lying battered for years and traffic congestion worsens every day during peak hours. An MTC official in response said the highways department, which is constructing the flyover, has promised to finish it by December end and only then a decision can be taken whether to develop the terminus at the existing location or to shifting to a new location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-velachery-bus-terminus-in-bad-shape/articleshow/85290469.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court seeks affidavit on honour killings||HYDERABAD: The state police have informed the high court that there have been four honour killings and three cases of assaults on those who entered into inter-caste wedlock in the last four years in Telangana. Additional director general of police (legal) Rajiv Ratan filed an affidavit on behalf of the DGP in the HC to this effect. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a PIL filed by social activist U Sambasiva Rao seeking a thorough probe into 36 honour killings that took place in the state. The DGP’s earlier memo, however, has several printing errors and as a result of one such error, the memo itself was seen to be conveying a message that there were 50 khap panchayats noticed by police in Telangana. Startled by the revelation about the existence of khap panchayats in Telangana also, the bench asked the DGP as to why his affidavit was silent on the followup or tracking of khap panchayats. In fact, the circular was asking police to take action against khap panchayat elders if they come across any such meetings of caste elders asking people to follow unlawful conditions. The bench sought a detailed affidavit it and posted the case to September 29. Petitioner Sambasiva Rao had filed his plea in 2019 but he died in July 2020 due to Covid-19. The bench, in its earlier hearing, sought an affidavit from the DGP on the steps taken to contain the menace of honour killings. After perusing the affidavit, the bench expressed its dissatisfaction and sought a more detailed affidavit explaining specific problems arising on account of khap panchayats, etc, and the steps taken to contain them. Khap panchayats, which are prevalent in states like Haryana and Punjab, are known in AP and Telangana as ‘meetings of caste elders’ that impose unlawful conditions on ‘violators. Some of these punishments include expelling the violators and their families from the villages, asking people to boycott the families of the violators, who cross the caste lines to marry a person of their choice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-high-court-seeks-affidavit-on-honour-killings/articleshow/85290470.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Nivruti Parsekar, executive engineer of the water division said a problem with earthing had damaged an electrical transformer at a power substation at Opa. “The transformer was leaking after its earthing had developed a problem and we had to replace it entirely,” Parsekar said. Since the transformer was giving out electric shocks, three water treatment plants including 8, 12 and 55 MLD had to shut down. This has led to water supply to the Ponda, Cumbharjua and parts of Priol and Marcaim constituencies being shut, Parsekar said, adding that they had an extra transformer at Opa which they have used.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/power-snag-at-opa-hits-water-supply-to-ponda-cumbharjua/articleshow/85285941.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Stating that the dengue chart has seen a rapid increase in figures, Umraskar said, “Of the 20-25 cases reported daily at the OPD, at least 8-12 are hospitalised.” Male patients are more then female patients, he added. At present, there are 33 dengue patients admitted and taking treatment at the Chicalim hospital. The cases were initially coming from New Vaddem and Sada and now are mostly from MES College area in Zuarinagar, Bogmalo and Dabolim. The Chicalim sub-district hospital is seeking cooperation of stakeholders to combat the situation. Dr Umraskar said, “People have to be very cautious when it comes to breeding grounds of dengue mosquitoes. Fresh water stored in barrels could also have the larvae. The water storing containers have to be washed with soap every week. Also people should check their surroundings, terraces and abandoned places for collection of water and get places near their residential areas cleaned.” To bring about awareness and to contain the spread of dengue, city councillor Shami Salkar and the health officials visited potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes and took measures for their containment. Salkar said that as safety of our people is of utmost importance, we on our part have been doing regular fogging in the city from time to time and making sure our surroundings are kept clean as much as possible. She further said that he has requested the Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) and the health officials to step up the measures to stop the spread of vector borne diseases. She also requested the MLA Dabolim with whose efforts the Chicalim hospital has become a reality to upgrade that facility into a full-fledged hospital with a minimum capacity of 100 beds so that the entire Mormugao taluka stands to benefit||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chicalim-health-centre-sees-20-25-dengue-cases-daily/articleshow/85285974.cms||Ruvina Khan
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: ‘Touched by Navjot Singh Sidhu’s gesture, but not after political positions’, says Former IPS officer Mohammad Mustafa||CHANDIGARH: Former IPS officer Mohammad Mustafa, who has decided to turn down Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s offer to appoint him as one of the four advisers, said he will continue to work for the rise of the Congress party in Punjab but without any positions. “I am touched by his gesture but am not after any political positions. I will still be working with Sidhu closely. I am working for the revival of Congress in Punjab, but behind the scenes. I am supporting Congress because of Rahul Gandhi and my wife owes her political entry to Sonia Gandhi and Ambika Sonia. We will contribute to the party till the time Rahul is there at the helm of affairs,” Mustafa told TOI. Sidhu had visited Mustafa’s house after taking over as the PPCC chief last month. Before that, he wanted him to take up a key role in the PPCC. “He wanted me to be his number 2 in the PPCC and recommended my name to the party leadership. I messaged him that I cannot accept the position… Now, the announcement to appoint me as his adviser came all of a sudden. I called him up to convey that I am touched but please excuse me. But I am glad that someone thought of me in 4.5 years,” he said. Meanwhile, on his relations with chief minister Amarinder Singh, the former cop said the last time he spoke to him was just before the election results were announced in March, 2017. “Before that, I was in regular touch with him. I still hold me in high esteem. Kuch toh majburian rahi hongi, yun koi bewafa nahi hota (there must have been some compulsions for the betrayal),” he said. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday had appointed four advisers to himself, including Fatehgarh Sahib Congress MP Amar Singh and former DGP Mohammad Mustafa. The two other advisers are Pyare Lal Garg, former registrar of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Faridkot, and political analyst Malwinder Singh Mali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/touched-by-sidhus-gesture-but-not-after-political-positions/articleshow/85287955.cms||---

He told the court at the last hearing that only debates and discussions on the subject are ongoing. Chief minister Pramod Sawant last month stated that the process of declaring wild boars as vermin had been initiated. “I have directed the forest department to expedite the process. People are facing problems due to wild boars,” Sawant had said. Following this, Surendra Gajanan Samant, a retired bank personnel from Margao, had challenged the decision by the state government to consider wild boar as vermin, stating that it is unconstitutional and that the animal must be protected. Despite the state government’s assurance in the court, he told the division bench at the last hearing that the message has already been declared and people are already thanking the chief minister for declaring wild boar as vermin. “On query to the petitioner as to whether he had approached the decision making authorities, the reply is in negative. The petition appears to be premature and, thus, is being disposed of, leaving it open for the petitioner to make a proper approach as and when occasion therefore arises,” stated the division bench comprising Justices Sunil Deshmukh and Mahesh Sonak. The high court had issued notice to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the state and conservator of forests in the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wild-boar-as-vermin-hc-dismisses-plea/articleshow/85286060.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Yechury: BJP main enemy but no alliance with TMC||Kolkata: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury welcomed the coming together of 14 opposition parties against the Centre and wanted to maximize this platform against BJP. But he ruled out any alliance or electoral adjustments with Trinamool Congress in West Bengal or Tripura, citing concrete “contradictions at the ground level”. Yechury didn’t see this as double standards. “We fought against Congress in Kerala in the assembly elections but have come together with Congress in Parliament. I and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee have been signatories to joint resolutions against BJP at least thrice since 2016. In 2004, the Left had 61 MPs from Bengal, Kerala and Tripura defeating Congress. But they all gave outside support to the Congress-led government at the Centre to keep BJP at bay,” he said. Yechury cited resolutions of the 21st and 22nd Party Congress to argue that BJP had always been CPM’s prime target though large sections of Left activists at Bengal’s grassroots went with BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “BJP has always been our main enemy. Yet we supported the Janata Party government, with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L K Advani as Union ministers, to put an end to the Emergency in 1977. Politics is not black and white,” the CPM leader said. Yechury clarified that CPM would continue to fight BJP as it had been doing in Kerala, Tripura and Bengal, and added the party would strive to hold a national virtual meeting on August 20 where more opposition parties other than the 14 could join the anti-BJP platform. He didn’t endorse the “Bijemool” approach in Bengal that had put BJP and Trinamool on the same platter. “Even the CPM West Bengal state committee didn’t endorse that. But that was a slogan that emerged in the run-up to assembly polls. The situation this time is different when parliamentary democracy, the Constitution and the country’s democratic secular fabric are at stake,” the CPM leader said. Yechury said CPM had taken “seriously” its devastating assembly poll show. The party, he added, had started working on creating a more “youthful CPM” by bringing down the average age of committee members. The CPM leader was in no mood to make light of Trinamool’s attacks on Red volunteers in Bengal or lie low against Trinamool’s “anti-people” policies. “Trinamool is attacking our cadres at the grassroots. How can we join hands with them? In a situation where BJP and Trinamool are in an electoral fight, we will campaign against BJP but can’t support Trinamool,” he said. Yechury was also non-committal on a joint CPM and Trinamool opposition in Tripura. “Our comrades in Tripura have been fighting BJP for the last three years. Trinamool has put up a fight recently. Let’s wait for things to come because many BJP ministers in Tripura had switched over from Trinamool,” he said. According to Yechury, the Sanyukta Morcha, with Congress and Indian Secular Front, floated in Bengal ahead of the 2021 assembly polls was not a permanent alliance. “It was an electoral adjustment specific to Bengal assembly polls.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/yechury-bjp-main-enemy-but-no-alliance-with-tmc/articleshow/85312690.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Suvendu barb at state scheme||Kolkata: Bengal BJP leaders came down heavily on the state government’s Lakshmir Bhandar scheme, saying it left out a majority of women. “There are 1.6 crore families in Bengal. The number of women in these families is more than 5 crore. The state scheme aims at covering only 1.6 crore women while Swasthya Sathi scheme covers 5 crore women members,” leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari said. “The CM,” he continued, “had announced basic income support for women before elections. This was not just pocket money. We had announced that BJP, if voted to power, will give Rs 3,000 a month support to women. Lakshmir Bhandar proposes Rs 500 support for women in general category and Rs 1,000 for those in SC/ST category. Women above 60 won’t get benefit under the scheme.” Adhikari complained that the CM had done a U-turn from the promise she made before elections and likened it to her “role reversal” over purchase of Covid vaccines from the market and giving these free to people. A look at Trinamool Congress’ manifesto for the 2021 assembly polls shows the party didn’t promise Lakshmir Bhandar for all women. “A new scheme to ensure monthly basic income support to female heads of 1.6 crore households of Bengal will be undertaken. The scheme will give monthly Rs 500 to families of general category and Rs 1,000 to families of SC/ST,” the manifesto stated. The Bengal women & child development and social welfare department later issued some eligibility guidelines, stating that all women residents aged between 25 and 60 — except those with permanent jobs in the private and government sectors — would be eligible to apply for the scheme. It was stated that women in general category having one tax-paying member in the family, or having 2 hectares land, would not be eligible. Adhikari feared that ASHA and ICDS workers or those holding job cards would be left out. “We are not against direct benefit transfers. Our Prime Minister is running 380 such DBT schemes covering 30 crore people. The question is that the state government has to borrow more from the market to run the scheme when the state’s debt burden has gone up to Rs 4,54,000 crore. We would have been happy if the government had revved up resources to fund such schemes. Else, the scheme would meet the fate of dim-bhat (rice-egg) project,” he said. On Thursday, Bengal BJP Morcha supporters courted arrest across the state – from Bhabani Bhavan and Shimla Street in Kolkata to Howrah, Bankura, Haldia, Bongaon, Baruipur, Chinsurah and West Midnapore. More than 45 party workers, including Morcha president Agnimitra Paul, were arrested in Kolkata while protesting against the Bagnan gang rape. “There is no democracy in Bengal,” Paul said. From August 17 to 19, junior Union ministers Subhas Sarkar, Nisith Pramanik, John Barla and Shantanu Thakur will lead Sahid Samman Yatras across the state, maintaining Covid protocol, to reach out to post-poll violence victim families, said Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya.
