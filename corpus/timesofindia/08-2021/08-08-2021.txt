---||World||Huge infrastructure bill backed by Biden passes key hurdle||WASHINGTON: A huge infrastructure bill deemed historic by US President Joe Biden passed a key procedural hurdle on Saturday, with enough Republican senators joining Democrats to make its final passage in the upper chamber appear nearly certain. The $1.2 trillion bill, designed to fund much-needed upgrades to US roads, highways, bridges and high-speed internet, drew the support of 18 Republican senators and 49 Democrats- a rare instance of bipartisanship in deeply divided Washington. That Republican support- with the party's Senate leader Mitch McConnell among the 18 in favor- will end floor debate on the bill, a procedural step that required 60 votes. With only 51 votes required for final Senate passage, the vote Saturday greatly improves the bill's chances, although fierce wrangling over amendments is continuing. The final vote is expected by early next week. The legislation- months in the making- calls for $550 billion in new federal spending on the nation's aging infrastructure, including spending to slow the effects of climate change. The total $1.2 trillion price tag -- equal to the 2020 GDP of Spain -- includes some funds previously approved but not yet spent. Biden, a 36-year veteran of Senate maneuvering, has followed the bill's progress closely, and White House officials said he would not hesitate to phone wavering senators if needed. Making a last-minute plea for passage, Biden tweeted Saturday that the bill represented a "historic, once-in-a-generation investment in our nation's infrastructure." "We can't afford not to do it," he added. Biden also dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris, another former senator, to Capitol Hill Saturday to shore up support for the legislation. If the Senate approves the plan, it will move to the House of Representatives, where passage is not guaranteed. Democrats hold a narrow majority there, and the party's centrist and liberal wings have butted heads over the content of the bill. Final passage by both houses would represent a major victory for the Democratic president, who has been betting his political legacy on economic recovery and the fight against the ravages of Covid-19. Biden's Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, issued a statement Saturday calling the bill "a disgrace." Trump, who was unable to bring an infrastructure bill to passage during his four-year term, added that it would be "very hard" for him to "endorse anyone foolish enough to vote in favor of this deal." His position could make a final vote more problematic for Republicans looking ahead to the 2022 midterm elections. But Republicans also know that the spending in the bill is very popular among voters, according to polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/huge-infrastructure-bill-backed-by-biden-passes-key-hurdle/articleshow/85138865.cms||---

Instead, learn from them and make better choices||To help readers cope with their anxieties in these stressful times, TOI has launched Talk it Out, a series under which our panel of expert counsellors will answer your mental health queries. This week’s advice comes from yea, psychologist Madhu SuriI am a 46-year-old woman born in a family that highly valued education. Unfortunately, I did my MBA from an average college. During my career, I was meek and afraid of seniors. I was never considered for an important role. Now, I don’t have a job and am not able to get one despite trying hard. Upskilling is expensive and time-consuming. I think it is better to invest in my children rather than myself as I do not see any value in doing it at this age. I regret my decisions all the time when I see others who were not so privileged having succeeded. How do I get over this feeling?— AnonymousDespite what has happened, by writing yourself off and not giving yourself what you need, you could carry the history of regrets into the future. Changing one’s narrative about oneself to that of being worthy and deserving the best is a starting point. The positive aspect of regrets is not repeating the choices we made in the past and making different choices now. We can be proactive and foresighted. It is only in hindsight we get a perspective on what we could have done differently. Age is not a barrier, but self-limiting thoughts are. Even your writing in for help is a sign of resilience and a voice in you is saying, “I want to do it.” Your children would also be better with a mother who is starting to stand up tall, moving positively, and emits drive, determination and success. Remember that success lies in not giving up on yourself or on life. My brother adopted a 10-year-old girl. Unfortunately, she lost both adoptive parents in the second Covid wave. My sister and I are both senior citizens. The baby is now with her maternal uncle. The problem is he says he cannot take responsibility for her future. As my wife and I are above sixty, she doesn’t have much energy. We are in a state of confusion. Will her biological parents accept her? How can we help her?— AnonymousThe child’s ongoing suffering makes the decision critical. I suggest a professional psychological evaluation of her mental state and consulting a lawyer about the legal implications of her present situation and going back to the biological parents. It is paramount that she has caregivers for the long haul. The traumatic experience of being given up for adoption, losing both parents to Covid and being handed over to a reluctant uncle, is just too much for anyone, especially a child. You haven’t mentioned the circumstances under which the biological parents handed her for adoption. If lack of resources was the only reason and why they may not want to take her back, then maybe handing her back to them along with a fund for her long-term education, sustenance, career, etc, can help so that she has an emotionally and economically healthy future. Please check the government’s measures for the care of children who have lost parents to Covid. I am 50. At times, old memories make me feel helpless. I have seen many ups and downs in life but have managed to succeed. But considering my age, I have a feeling that there is no time left. I enjoy good health. How can I have a better mindset? — AnonymousAt some points in our lives we tend to feel uncertain about the future and our ability to face it. Existential questions come up and chronological numbers of our age make us feel less optimistic. Focus on the happier memories, enjoy and relive them. Do not regret that they are over because memories are an eternal nourishment. Consider that you have managed fine despite the ups and downs — a positive indicator of your capability to deal with what comes your way. It is more helpful to visualise that the best starts at 50. Usually, we are freer from responsibilities or striving to earn, save and provide. Stay connected with family and friends. Be an active supporter or an asset in other people’s lives. It’s energising to share your resources and experience. Pursue your interests and hobbies. Always be eager to learn. Invest in insurance as this also brings a sense of security. Remember the adage, “What matters is not to add years to your life but life to your years!” I was a topper in my last academic year but this year due to a transfer, I am unable to concentrate on studies which is affecting me so much that other activities are also getting disturbed and I am very disappointed. Please suggest how I get back to my earlier life. — AnonymousAny change of environment, whether it’s a change of location, schools, college, office, department, home etc, can be very unsettling. Adjusting to any relocation can throw up a curve ball of challenges. The academic decline that you are experiencing further enhances the distress, which can severely impact one’s overall sense of being. Before things plunge further, let’s bring a sense of control to areas where you can actually exert control: not the environment nor the context but your thoughts, feelings and actions. Acknowledge the disappointment and the challenges that have ensued. But after that, your actions could be that of taking charge and deciding the next step, which is to go all out on getting back to focused studies. This action of taking charge of your goal will automatically make the disappointment and helplessness fade away. This proactive action will help in breaking the circuit of feelings dictating your future. The feeling of helplessness will get translated into hope & possibilities. If you are still unable to get out of this non-productive low loop, do seek professional help from a therapist.I am 73 and the father of two well-settled boys. My problem is that my wife has developed negativity since a long time and never thinks positively. I always believe that anything can happen in life with a positive attitude. Her negative approach disturbs me. Please tell me how to instill some positivity in her. — AnonymousIt’s quite a challenge living with a negative person and it can get quite irksome and frustrating for both partners. I think the first suggestion would be to actually believe in what you have stated in your letter: “I always believe that anything can happen in life with a positive attitude.” So stay with that belief relentlessly. Try and tune in to the possible reasons why she is in a negative frame of mind. Encourage her to be with people who make her happy and do the things that she enjoys. Praise her when she says something positive. Remark how it lights up her face, how the atmosphere changes and how you love her for it, etc. What your spouse says is perhaps her way of being and may have nothing to do with what you are, what you do or what you say. The attitude is possibly because of her life experiences. Be wary of caving in and stay with your positivity. If both partners are functioning at a low energy level emotionally, it only makes the distress worse. Take time out to recharge yourself by doing things that you enjoy, meeting people who bring out the best in you to keep that fire of cheer burning. Feeling good about yourself will help you protect the relationship from getting frayed. Don’t make it your mission or responsibility to change her personality. Some people are the way they are, and you can’t fix them. Don’t blame her or judge her. That will not make any difference in getting a positive response. Go easy on the constant attempt to joke around, to be wearing a cloak of good cheer relentlessly in the hope of getting a different outcome from your spouse. It can be irksome for her and more stressful for you. It will be worthwhile to get a professional psychological evaluation done. This could be helpful to rule out depression and treatment, if required. I am a confused but confident person. I belong to a poor family and am the eldest daughter with various responsibilities. I have completed my BBA and want to crack government exams to give my family a good life. But my mother has fourth stage lung cancer that has shaken our life and the lack of money has made us depressed. I need to earn in order to feed my family as my father is pushing me to get a government job soon. But I also have big dreams for myself. I want to pursue a master’s course to open greater avenues for my career. How can I organise my life to achieve my career goals and parents’ dream? It has become difficult to concentrate on studies nowadays as I also have to take care of my mother’s diet and medicines too. — AnonymousYou have a lot of responsibility and stress. You have mentioned that you are the eldest daughter which means there are siblings and your father too. Your mother’s diet and medication can be taken care of with their help. Discussing this with your father and other adult siblings and dividing the caretaker responsibilities will definitely bring in some relief so that you can invest in your future. Trying to shoulder all the responsibilities related to your mother’s illness will not help anybody in the long run. You will probably burnout sooner than later. To earn more, you need to crack the exams, for which you need to study, for which you need time and mind space. The first step p is to divide home and mother’s responsibilities so that you get some time off to study. A government job will get you earning faster rather than doing a two-year master’s course. Getting the job sooner than later will ease the financial stress on the family and once there is stability, nothing can stop you from doing an online or distance post-graduation in the subject of your choice. 4 tips to cope with regret1. Self-reflect on how you can learn from past mistakes with compassion, and think of strategies to help you gradually change your patterns 2. Feel and acknowledge the regret instead of denying it 3. Move on. Celebrate that you can now map a better blueprint for your life with hindsight 4.

However, there is uncertainty over starting of supplies as issues around indemnity against legal liabilities in case of severe adverse events are yet to be resolved. "As of now, the government is not inclined to give indemnity to foreign manufacturers. We have our own manufacturers and vaccines, there is no reason why we should be arm-twisted," a senior official told TOI. The government hopes that ongoing talks with foreign vax manufacturers will lead to fruitful resolution. J&J trails Pfizer and Moderna in the US and may be keen to enter India market. The government expects supplies to start from around September if talks go through with the company, the official said. The initial supplies could be 3-5 crore doses a month. It is unclear whether J&J has reached an agreement with the government over legal concerns though. J&J will supply the vaccine through a pact with Indian vaccine maker Biological E. The US firm said it is too early to indicate a timeline for supplies. "While we look forward to meeting our delivery commitments, it is premature for us to speculate on the timing of our vaccine deliveries," J&J said in a statement. "At this time, the company is only negotiating with government bodies and supranational organizations (e.g., European Commission, African Union, Gavi/COVAX) at a central level for vaccine procurement or purchase. We are not working with or through third parties for vaccine access during the current emergency pandemic period," it said. Currently, no individuals or private companies are authorised to offer, advertise, distribute or sell the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine on behalf of J&J, either directly or indirectly, the company said. Sources said Biological E can start local manufacturing and supply of J&J’s vaccine in India only if the American firm agrees to follow the legal compensation norms of the country. Considering that J&J is only third to Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines in America, India may come across as a lucrative market with Biological E as a local partner. The fact that India too is looking at ramping up its vaccination coverage may also make it more viable for J&J. There is an in-principle visibility of around 5 crore doses per month given by the company, official sources said. If supplies from Moderna or J&J start, it will be in addition to the 135 crore doses projected to be supplied by government between August and December. The government expects Zydus Cadila’s Zy-CoV-D and Biological E’s Corbevax to be approved soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/johnson-johnsons-single-dose-covid-vax-gets-emergency-use-nod/articleshow/85141988.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||India to get advanced ‘eye in the sky’ ahead of I-Day with Gisat-1 launch on Aug 12||NEW DELHI: Just three days ahead of the Independence Day, India will finally launch its most advanced geo-imaging satellite (Gisat-1), which will allow better monitoring of the subcontinent, including its borders with Pakistan and China, by imaging the country 4-5 times a day. The satellite will be launched on August 12 at 5.43am from Sriharikota. The pandemic delayed the launch of the new-series geo-satellite, which has civilian and strategic importance, several times since last year. Isro’s GSLV-F10 rocket will finally put the 2,268-kg Gisat-1, codenamed EOS-3, into the geo-orbit. This will be India’s first launch of a primary satellite this year. On February 28, Isro had launched 18 small satellites, including some desi satellites, along with primary satellite Amazonia-1 of Brazil. Once placed 36,000 km above earth in the geostationary orbit after space manoeuvres, the advanced ‘eye in the sky’ can constantly monitor areas of interest (the satellite will move in sync with the rotation of the Earth and hence would look stationary) and will give real-time information about a large area unlike other remote sensing satellites placed in lower orbits that come to a spot only at regular intervals. EOS-3 will also enable quick monitoring of natural disasters, episodic and short-term events. Minister of state for department of space Jitendra Singh, in a response to a question in Rajya Sabha recently, had said that EOS-03 is capable of imaging the whole country 4-5 times daily. The satellite, which is capable of near real-time monitoring of floods and cyclones, will also enable monitoring of water bodies, crops, vegetation conditions and forest cover changes, he said. The satellite will have payload imaging sensors of six-band multispectral visible and near infra-red with 42-metre resolution, 158 bands hyper-spectral visible and near infra-red with 318-metre resolution and 256 bands hyper-spectral short wave infra-red with 191-metre resolution. A 4-metre diameter ogive-shaped payload fairing (heat shield) has been used in the rocket for the first time, an Isro statement said. The satellite was earlier scheduled for launch on March 28 this year but a “minor issue” forced its postponement. The launch was later expected in April and then in May but Covid-triggered restrictions in states where Isro centres are located delayed it again. After the Gisat-1 launch, the other satellite to go up will be EOS-4 or Risat-1A, which is a radar imaging satellite with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that can take pictures during day and night and can also see through clouds. The satellite weighing over 1,800 kg will be launched by a PSLV in September. The satellite will play a strategic role in the country's defence with its capability to operate in day, night and all weather conditions. The first developmental flight of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) or mini-PSLV is also scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year from Sriharikota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-to-get-advanced-eye-in-the-sky-ahead-of-i-day-with-gisat-1-launch-on-aug-12/articleshow/85142272.cms||Surendra Singh

"You have made the nation proud as the Olympics was coming to an end ... you have given the best possible finish for the country," PM Modi told Chopra over phone. He said the success at the Tokyo games was due to the hard work and self belief. Chopra thanked the PM for his encouragement. In 2019, when Chopra was recovering from an injury, Modi had wished him well and said he would soon be back in the field. "History has been scripted in Tokyo! What Neeraj Chopra has achieved today will be remembered forever. The young Neeraj has done exceptionally well. He played with remarkable passion and showed unparalleled grit.

He performed like a true soldier at the Olympics. It is indeed a historic and proud moment for the entire country, including the Indian Armed Forces! Many congratulations to him!" In 2019, when election results were out, and Modi became PM again, Chopra had congratulated the PM. "My heartiest congratulations to our Prime Minister Narendra Modi sir on this historic win. May our country achieve new heights under your leadership," Chopra had tweeted. While thanking the javelin thrower, the PM had once again inquired about his injury and wished him a fast recovery. Home minister Amit Shah was equally elated and said, "Proud and historic moment! Every Indian is proud of the honour you have brought to the country with your hard work and dedication. The whole of India is delighted with this extraordinary achievement of yours." Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said Chopra has finally given the golden moment to India for which everybody was waiting. "His gold medal in the javelin throw reflects the capability of our youth who make the impossible possible through Sankalp Se Siddhi," he said. BJP president J P Nadda said 1.3 billion people are going to cherish this glorious moment for a long time. The PM invited Chopra to August 15 Independence Day celebrations. The Indian Olympic contingent will be special invitees at Red Fort, followed by a dinner hosted by the PM at his residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/history-scripted-pm-leads-nation-in-hailing-golden-boy-chopra/articleshow/85142438.cms||---

A decision in this regard was taken at the meeting of the state cabinet on Friday and Rs 50 crore was released for the revolving funds under the Bihar Motor Vehicle Accident Assistance Scheme. The seized vehicle shall not be released until compensation is received. An amendment has been made in this regard in the Bihar Motor Vehicle Rules, 1992 and the Bihar Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Tribunal Rules, 1961. It will be implemented in the state from September 15. Transport department secretary Sanjay Kumar Agrawal said the decision was taken by the state government in light of the Supreme Court’s order to make rules for payment of compensation to the road accident victims and their kin in case of death. He said after the decision of the Claims Tribunal, if the vehicle owner does not deposit the compensation amount within 30 days to the victim or the victim’s family, the district officers will be authorized to acquire and auction the vehicle. “In case the amount received from the auction of the vehicle is less, the rest amount will be given from the state’s revolving fund,” Agarwal said, adding in case of death in a road accident, the victim’s family will get Rs 5 lakh as compensation, while in case of injury, a provision of Rs 50,000 has been made for the victim. According to transport secretary, around 5,000 people die annually in Bihar in road accidents while the number of people injured in road accidents is much higher. Currently, the state disaster management department provides compensation to the victim’s family in case of more than one death. Under the new provision, the transport department will give relief money even in case of single death and injury in road accidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-tightens-noose-around-owners-of-uninsured-vehicles/articleshow/85135203.cms||Faryal Rumi

JD(U) is the BJP ally in Bihar as well as at the Centre. “We are in the NDA. We will ask the NDA leadership if they want to make us a partner in the assembly elections in UP and some other states going to the polls early next year. If they are not ready to make us a partner in the upcoming assembly polls, we will go solo on our own strength,” Singh said while addressing party workers at an event organized to welcome back former minister Sri Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha in the JD(U). Kushwaha, a four-time former MLA, was earlier with the JD(U). But he was expelled from the party after contesting the last assembly election on the LJP ticket from his traditional Jagdishpur seat in Bhojpur district. Lalan said Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has a dream of making the JD(U) a ‘national party’. “To get the status of a national party, JD(U) requires the ‘state party’ tag in at least four states. Currently, JD(U) is recognized as the ‘state party’ in two states — Bihar and Arunachal Pradesh,” he said. Citing the example of the remarkable performance of JD(U) in the assembly polls in Arunachal Pradesh, Lalan said the party had contested 15 assembly seats and won seven to emerge as the second largest party in the northeastern state. However, it may be mentioned here that six of the seven JD(U) MLAs in Arunachal Pradesh had later joined the BJP. Earlier, senior JD(U) leader K C Tyagi had also said his party would contest 200 seats in Uttar Pradesh, if there is no alliance with the BJP. The JD(U) had withdrawn from the contest ahead of the 2017 UP polls as the party was then preparing to return to the NDA fold in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-wants-to-be-bjp-ally-in-up-polls-or-ready-to-go-solo/articleshow/85136101.cms||---

With the addition of 6,061 cases on Saturday, the weekly tally of the state went to 41,774 cases, which is nearly 32% lower than the 61,489 cases detected in the first seven days of July. However, there was no change in fatalities: 1,053 deaths were reported in the first week of July and 1,054 at the same time in August. Nagpur district added just one new case, lower than the tribal-dominated Gadchiroli district which added 7 cases.  The daily caseload in Mumbai continued to fluctuate between 250 and 350, with 332 cases registered on Saturday. In the first week of August, the city’s tally stood at 2,203, which is half of the 4,086 cases detected in the first week of July. The weekly toll too has been 53, which is much lower than 122 deaths reported in the first week of July. A BMC official said daily deaths in Mumbai have been less than 1% of the total cases on most days during the second wave, which began in the last week of February and continues so far. In the first week of August, daily deaths have been 10 or less, with five deaths registered on Saturday. Earlier in the week, on August 3, only three were registered. The active cases in the state dropped to 71,050 cases, of which 4,836 are still under treatment in Mumbai. The situation in many districts like Satara, Sangli and Ahmednagar is concerning as the cases are almost double the detections in Mumbai, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-detections-in-city-in-aug-50-lower-than-in-july-1st-wk/articleshow/85139354.cms||---

The CM tweeted that he closely watched the difficulties faced by the weavers’ community during his 3,648-km long padayatra before the 2019 general elections and had listened to the woes of every weaver who met him during the walkathon. The result, he said, was the Netanna Nestham scheme, through which the government is paying Rs 24,000 per year to every weaver’s family as financial assistance. The chief minister further pledged his support to the entire community and said his government would help them in all possible ways. Meanwhile, National Handloom Day was celebrated at the Andhra Pradesh State Handloom Weavers Cooperative Society (Apco) office, where industries minister Mekapati Gowtham Reddy and government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy greeted the weavers. The minister said the government was trying to create a brand for handlooms to breathe a new life into hundreds of weavers’ families. Emphasising on the need to protect the sector, he appealed to people to encourage handloom clothes, stating the government was trying for tie-up with international brands in the garments sector. He further said that the government is trying to increase sales in the handloom garments sector to financially strengthen Apco. Apco, meanwhile, has decided to offer fine variety handloom clothes at production cost. Many varieties of AP’s handlooms including Uppada, Venkatagiri, Mangalagiri will be available at no-loss-no-profit price band during the period. Apco chairman Chillapalli Naga Venkata Mohan Rao said the discount will end on August 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-will-stand-by-weavers-at-all-times-says-andhra-pradesh-cm-ys-jagan-mohan-reddy/articleshow/85136729.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Aditi Ashok loses Olympics medal but wins many hearts||KOLKATA: A decade ago, when Aditi Ashok was only 13, she had impressed the city’s veteran golfers with her temperament. It is the same temperament the world got to view as Aditi competed with the world’s top golfers for three days before missing an Olympic medal by a whisker. “Aditi was mature beyond her years even when she was a teenager. A bad shot is all it takes to ruffle a golfer. But nothing appeared to unsettle her and she went about her game with calm and poise. For the past three days, too, it is her fantastic temperament that was on display. Even when she lost, she did not flinch and went about the formalities just as she would have had she won,” said former two-time national champion Vandana Agarwal. Ashok had won the Eastern India Tolly Ladies & Girls’ Amateur Golf Championship championship in 2011. In 2014, she overcame a bizarre day which saw her score as many as four double-bogeys to win the event again. Agarwal won her first national title in 1997, a year before Ashok was born. Indrajit Bhalotia, who was India no.1 in 2000 when Ashok was only two and has seen her development as a golfer over the years, said unlike the other Indian athletes who may have lost their nerve or choked at the finish, Ashok lost out simply because she missed a vital putt in 72 holes. “Driving off the tee is not Ashok’s biggest strength. But in the Olympics, her drives were even weaker because she is just recovering from Covid. She was, therefore, always 40 yards behind the leaders. It was her consistently excellent putting that ensured she was in second position for almost the entire duration of the tournament. It is the missed putt on the 17th hole that edged her out of the top-three spots,” said Bhalotia.

With the main temple of the goddess closed due to Covid-related restrictions, these sub-temples were allegedly used by a section of the priest community for performing pooja and other different rituals and customs allegedly involving many devotees. Tuljapur tehsildar Saudagar Tandale on Saturday said the temple of Annapurna Devi, Tol-Bhairav and Matangi Devi situated in the premises of Tuljabhavani temple have been sealed till further notice. “Despite a warning from the district administration, a section of priest community was operating these three sub-temples by arranging daily visits of a large number of devotees. While religious places are still not allowed to open in Maharashtra due to Covid-related fears, such large gatherings at the shrines concerned called for official action,” he said. Government authorities said only daily pooja and other essential customs and rituals will be performed at these sub-temples without involving any devotees. “The seal put on these shrines will be opened in the presence of staff of the district administration for performing daily religious activities,” Tandale said, adding that the district administration was also contemplating registering offences against the priests involved in the illegal opening of shrines in question. Revered by devotees from across the state, Tuljabhavani temple at Tuljapur witnessed daily footfall of nearly seven lakh devotees during the festival period of Navratri during pre-Covid times. Earlier in January , the Osmanabad district administration had invoked action against 24 priests associated with the Tuljapur temple located around 260 km from Aurangabad city for entering into the sanctum sanctorum of the shrine during a period other than the allotted shifts during the Covid-19 pandemic. Of these, eight priests were banned from carrying out temple services for next three months whereas 16 were served show-cause notices. With a daily positivity rate of 4.5%, Osmanabad district on Friday reported 99 fresh cases of Covid-19, including six from Tuljapur taluka. The district has around 918 active cases of Covid-19, which is a second-highest number after Beed district (1,846).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sub-temples-at-tuljabhavani-temple-sealed-for-flouting-covid-norms/articleshow/85133389.cms||Prasad Joshi

Bahadurpur police station SHO Sanovar Khan said the deceased, Shruti Kumari (21), had got married to Amit Kaushal of Rampur Road on June 20 this year. “She was found hanging from the ceiling fan with a scarf inside her bedroom,” he said. He said Amit and his family earn rents from shops and tenants in the house. Khan said Shruti’s family alleged that Amit, his elder brother Raj Kaushal and his wife, father-in-law and mother-in-law had hanged her after killing. “They also alleged that she had been tortured for dowry since marriage,” he said. The SHO said Amit has been detained and probably will be arrested. “His other family members are evading arrest. Raids are on to nab them,” he said. Shruti’s father Arun Mahto alleged that she used to inform him about her torture at the hands of Amit and his family members for dowry. “I had talked to her last night. In the morning, we were informed that she had committed suicide,” he said. Mahto said when they reached there, they found the bedroom door locked from outside. “Her anklets and toe rings were scattered in the room. Amit’s family threatened us that his elder brother is a police sub-inspector and no one can harm them,” he alleged. Khan said it was yet not clear if Raj was in police or not. “An FIR for dowry death is being registered against Amit, Raj and other in-laws of Shruti,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/newlywed-woman-killed-for-dowry/articleshow/85136605.cms||Debashish Karmakar

According to police, a missing complaint of 10-year-old Dinesh (name changed) from Gokuldham society in Pandesara was filed by his parents on August 6. During questioning cops found the statements of the boy’s father to be inconsistent. So, they started his cross questioning which revealed that their son was with his wife’s friend. The boy’s mother had asked her friend to keep the boy for some time as they were going to lodge a complaint of kidnapping. “Initially, the boy’s father did not name his brother as a suspect but claimed that his son was kidnapped. But when police asked if he had a rivalry with anyone, he named his brother,” said a police officer. The boy’s father had told police that his brother could get Dinesh kidnapped over their dispute over ownership of a plot of land. After confessing that he and his wife have fabricated the kidnapping story, the boy’s father told police that did this to frame his brother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/man-fabricate-sons-abduction-to-frame-brother/articleshow/85135988.cms||---

Addressing the officials via videoconferencing during a review meeting, Chauhan said, “It is the duty of all the university and administrative officials to see that the examinations are held smoothly in a fair manner throughout the state. To maintain law and order, adequate police force along with magistrates should be deployed at all the centres and Covid protocols followed by everyone.” At the outset, principal secretary to the governor, Robert L Chongthu, pointed out that Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU) had been entrusted with the task of conducting the entrance test this year. “The test will be held from 11am to 1pm on August 13 at 276 centres in 11 cities. There are 159 centres for girls and 117 for boys,” he added. Patna has the maximum number (70) of centres, followed by Muzaffarpur (32). The number of centres in other cities include Ara (21), Bhagalpur (24), Chhapra (9), Darbhanga (29), Gaya (18), Hajipur (11), Madhepura (21), Munger (13), and Purnia (28).

---||Rajkot||Cops at Jamnagar hosp, NCH restricts intake||Rajkot/Surat/Vadodara: The impasse continued between the striking resident doctors of government hospitals and the state government till late on Saturday even as police was called in at Jamnagar’s GG Hospital as a precaution ‘to maintain law and order’. While Jamangar doctors claimed that the electricity and water connection to their hostels were cut by the authorities, doctors at the Surat’s New Civil Hospital (NCH) said that admissions to the hospital has been restricted to only critical patients due to shortage of staff. The doctors are on strike for the last four days over the demand for the 1:2 bond period was for the Covid duty. The government’s stand is that as the cases have reduced steadily from mid-May, the duty period of doctors cannot be termed as double for the calculation of bond period. About 400 junior resident doctors in Jamnagar and 350 in Rajkot civil hospital have joined the strike. Gaurav Khaidya, a junior doctor at Jamnagar’s G G Hospital said, “How did the police enter the college premises without the dean's permission? The college authority has issued our transfer orders and asked us to vacate the hostel. They also cut the water connection and electricity last night.” However, a senior cop said that the police was deployed was at G G Hospital as there was a function to inaugurate an oxygen plant there where a number of VIP guests were present. “Hence to maintain law and order the cops have been deployed. They will leave as soon as the function is over,” the senior cop said. Ravi Kothari, doctor at Rajkot civil hospital said “We are agitating against our transfers.” The state government had on Friday issued transfer orders for junior doctors and asked them to vacate the hostel rooms. Resident doctors at state-run SSG Hospital in Vadodara continued their strike even as efforts made to resolve the deadlock failed miserably on Saturday as well. Although based on the state government’s directive, dean of Medical College, Baroda Dr Tanuja Javadekar had issued notices on Friday evening asking the junior residents to vacate the hostel premises, the junior doctors remained firm that they will not leave the hostel premises. Till Saturday evening, no force was used to get the hostel premises vacated. Meanwhile, three officials including medical superintendent of SSG Hospital professor Ranjan Aiyer, dean of Medical College, Baroda Javadekar and dean of Faculty of Medicine Dr Hemant Mathur met health commissioner Jai Prakash Shivahare along with representatives of other medical colleges of the state. “The commissioner is insisting that we influence and convince the resident doctors to wind up the strike. He insisted that any negotiations will take place only after the strike is withdrawn,” said an official who was part of the meeting. Earlier in the day, the agitating doctors and interns took out a massive rally to press for their demands. The state-run hospital is facing extreme shortage of manpower even as workforce from PHCs and CHCs has been roped in. “We have made alternative arrangements but no additional workforce can compensate for the 450 residents,” Aiyer admitted. In Surat, about 400 resident doctors at NCH continued their strike till their demands are not met. “We have asked for medical officers from the health department. A few tutors and non-clinical assistant professors have been assigned the duties to handle patients,” said an official of NCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cops-at-jamnagar-hosp-nch-restricts-intake/articleshow/85136115.cms||---

Sahani, who is also animal husbandry and fisheries resources minister in Bihar, was denied entry to Varanasi to participate in the statue installation function of Phoolan Devi on July 25. Miffed, he had lambasted Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. VIP’s national spokesperson Dev Jyoti said around 50,000 statues and idols of Phoolan Devi will be sent to Uttar Pradesh from Bihar to be installed in the houses of the workers of the party in the run up to the assembly polls in that state. “The workers will install the statues in their respective houses for worship,” he said. In addition, around 5 lakh lockets with images of the departed leader will be distributed among the workers, especially women activists. “The idea is to revive the memory of late Phoolan Devi’s struggles and her fight against the tormentors,” the Jyoti said. The VIP has also decided to send special representatives from Bihar to the 165 assembly constituencies in Uttar Pradesh where the party is set to field its candidates in the assembly election to be held next year. During the opening of the party office at Lucknow last month, Sahani had said the VIP would fight for the rights of the suppressed communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vip-intends-to-install-phoolans-idols-at-50k-workers-houses-in-up/articleshow/85136478.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||2 PMCH buildings demolished to pave way for expansion||PATNA: Two old buildings of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) – prisoner ward and orphan ward – were demolished on Saturday. Demolition of another building housing the department of skin is also underway. The demolition work currently undergoing at PMCH is part of the mega expansion plan for making this largest government hospital-cum-medical college in the state as a world-class institution. PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said the prisoner ward had already been shifted to the central emergency building. “The cottage has been vacated and demolition work is likely to begin by the end of this month,” he added. The renovation work will be carried out in phases. As per the approved plan, the project to develop the hospital from the existing 2,000 to 5,500 beds with state-of-the-art facilities would entail an expenditure of Rs 5,540 crore. “Another important structure slated for demolition is GNM School. There is a proposal to shift the GNM School to outside the campus for facilitating the demolition work. All the new structures will be G+7 buildings,” Dr Thakur said. On an average, 3,000 people, including patients and health workers, visit the hospital per day. The number is likely to increase manifold after expansion of the hospital in about five years. To solve the problem of traffic congestion, the state government has planned construct of an elevated road from Gandhi Maidan to NIT Mor on Ashok Rajpath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-pmch-buildings-demolished-to-pave-way-for-expansion/articleshow/85135605.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Ganga above red mark in Patna||PATNA: Thanks to heavy rainfall in the basins of Chambal and Ken Betwa rivers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan in the last three days, the water level of river Ganga has been rising along its downstream from Prayagraj in UP to Kahalgaon in Bihar, water resources department (WRD) sources said. Sources said it takes 100-110 hours for the Ganga water to reach Gandhi Ghat at Patna from Prayagraj in UP. In the last 24 hours, the water level rose by 1.30 metres at Prayagraj and by 1.50 metres at Varanasi. The Ganga water reaches Buxar from Varanasi in 30-35 hours, while it also takes the same number of hours to reach Gandhi Ghat at Patna from Buxar. Since the Ganga takes water from Chambal and Ken Betwa rivers, the water level of the Ganga is expected to continue its rising trend over the next couple of days in Bihar. In the last three days, the basins of Chambal and Ken Betwa rivers recorded 300mm of heavy rainfall at some places, Bihar WRD sources said. At present, the intensity of rainfall in the basins of the two rivers has reduced. Nonetheless, the river Ganga might overflow its banks all along its downstream and accentuate the flood situation not only in the diara areas, but also in the lower localities of such towns as Patna, Munger, Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon in Bihar in the next couple of days. Even though water level in the Ganga is 12cm below the danger level at Buxar, it is 33cm above the danger level at Digha, 23cm at Gandhi Ghat, 9cm at Hathidah, 35cm above the danger level at Munger and 44cm at Kahalgaon. Incidentally, the water levels of both the north and south Bihar rivers, which carry water into the Ganga, have fallen. There is no forecast of heavy rainfall in the basins of north Bihar rivers either in Bihar or in Nepal till August 10. Accordingly, the rising trend in the Ganga might not take extraordinarily alarming form, sources said. The water level of Punpun at Sripalpur and at Kinjar in Jehanabad district has been falling fast, even as the river is still flowing above the danger mark. The water discharge through Sone is also very low. The falling trend in the two rivers is owing to the fact that their basins in the Jharkhand region have not received any rainfall. Similarly, the water discharge through the Birpur barrage across Kosi, as well as through Valmiki Nagar barrage across Gandak, has also been reduced. On the other hand, the smaller rivers like Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamla, Mahananda and others have also been flowing below the danger level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ganga-above-red-mark-in-patna/articleshow/85136413.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: English overtakes other mediums from 2001 to 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM: In the 2001-02 academic year, English medium students contributed only about 18% to the total enrolment of class X students in undivided Andhra Pradesh. Telugu medium students formed nearly 80% of the total batch, while students belonging to other mediums such as Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, etc. accounted for the remaining 2%. After two decades, in 2021, nearly 65% of the outgoing SSC batch studied in English medium in Andhra Pradesh, while Telugu medium was limited to only some 33%. The gradually growing preference for English medium education in Andhra Pradesh can be gauged from the fact that the English medium students comprised about 47% of the total batch size in 2014-15—the midpoint between 2001 and 2021. According to observers, a perceived advantage of English medium schooling lies in finding employment. Growing educational aspirations of parents coupled with emergence of affordable private schools have also paved the way for this trend. Before 2000, private English medium schools were mostly limited to district headquarters, municipalities and towns. Cashing in on the demand for English medium education, several corporate school chains have expanded their branches to almost every mandal headquarters, attracting children from nearby villages. A professor in education and vice-chancellor, Dr BR Ambedkar University, Prof N Venkata Rao said proficiency in the English language has become essential to finding employment, as right from MNCs to local companies, are preferring English medium students. “All professional courses like engineering, medicine and master’s programmes are taught in English. With parents preferring English medium education for their wards, the number of private schools has also increased in the last two decades. The Andhra Pradesh government’s decision to introduce English medium in all government schools is a right step and appreciable. It would serve the larger public interest as English medium education would be offered at free of cost in these schools without any burden to parents,” said Prof Venkata Rao. RTE Forum southern states steering committee member Narava Prakasa Rao said there has been a clear shift in the preference of medium in the last two decades. “The majority of the parents are now preferring English medium schooling for their wards irrespective of their financial status,” said Prakasa Rao. However, several people are demanding the government continue at least primary education in mother tongue, claiming that it would improve the comprehension levels of students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/english-overtakes-other-mediums-from-01-to-21/articleshow/85136641.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Participating as chief guest at National Handloom Day celebrations at Ponduru village on Saturday, the minister said the Centre is giving top priority to handloom products through the establishment of exclusive mega handloom clusters across the country. Handloom marketing went up to Rs 18,000 crore in 2020-21 against Rs 9,000 crore in 2014-15. Though Ponduru Khadi is internationally recognised, it has not fetched a remunerative price to weavers due to various reasons. The government is contemplating establishing a handloom cluster at Ponduru on the lines of Mangalagiri in Guntur to enhance the product’s brand value, she added. Sitharaman directed Nabard officials to extend loans to khadi artisans. Adding that Ponduru khadi needs a helping hand, she said she would try to extend more loans to facilitate the adoption of new technologies in weaving. The minister also inspected the weaving process and interacted with artisans at Andhra Fine Khadi Labour Development Association and inspected the khadi distillation system.

The difference between Guha and millions of other new fans who were doing the same thing around that time in Kolkata lies in the fact that while the rest of the city were pinning their hopes for an Olympic medal, Guha actually wanted to be in Gurjit’s shoes and hoped to flick it same way, one Olympic down the line. While both the Indian men and women’s team left a mark world Olympics this year winning a bronze medal each, 5,000km away in Kolkata, TOI visited neighbourhoods in the city that remain principal catchment areas for hockey players where kids and teenagers still prefer to dribble and scoop the ball with a stick rather than with legs as in football and bats as in cricket. “When she flicked the ball in the nets, it seemed I had an adrenaline rush. I couldn’t help but grab my stick and shadow practice it over the next few minutes. This team has made us dream big and I wish I will be there at that stage one day and make my nation proud,” said Guha, who has been training for four years now at Behala Jagrihi club. From a sport that was played across the state and had representation in independent India’s first team, hockey has over the years lost its glamour and have reduced to pockets. In Kolkata, Behala Chowrasta, Bhowanipore and Entally are three such pockets apart from Howrah, Baruipur, Rishra and Chandernagore on the city fringes. With hockey regaining its lost place over the last couple of weeks and real hockey stars like Rani Rampal, Vandana Katariya, Simranjeet Singh and P R Sreejesh emerging out of the shadows of Bollywood’s bright lights of ‘Chak De India’, young trainees, trainers and sports lovers opine this is the perfect opportunity to bring the focus back to the game. “My friends used to taunt me for wasting time in hockey while they practised other popular sports. But after the recent heroics of our hockey team, these friends were the first to congratulate me,” said 12-year-old Ankit Shaw, who plays at the Entally Hockey Academy. However, pointing at a worn out 6ftx10ft office and the hockey pitch under ankle-deep water, Subir Pan, the joint secretary of the academy, said unless the basic facilities get better, such short boosts won’t have any long-term effect on the game. Veteran hockey coach and official Gopal Ghosh said the recent feat at Tokyo will be a confidence booster for the current as well as upcoming generation of hockey players as well as sports lovers in general. “I am an ardent cricket fan. But perhaps for the first time, I was watching India’s hockey matches over India’s feisty show on the first day of the test match in England. The glamour and glitz associated with cricket has drifted us a long way from other games. We needed this jolt to be shaken into reality,” said Soumya Mukherjee, a techie. The spirited show is even inspiring some of the players like Puja Shaw (25) on the verge of retirement to take a last dash at the game. “I started the game at the age of 14 and have represented Bengal at the national stage. But I didn’t get much from the game and have taken up a job at a private firm. But after the gutsy show by some of my national team mates, I feel like giving one last go at professional hockey again,” said Shaw.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stellar-olympics-show-scoops-hockey-back-into-limelight-rekindles-hope-among-youngsters/articleshow/85137191.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The former mayor, Shivraj Paswan, was shot dead near Santoshi Chowk in Katihar town on July 29. Altogether 12 people, including Neeraj Paswan, a BJP MLA’s nephew, Srikant Srivastava alias Tuntun, former councillor of Katihar’s ward number 16 and his two sons Sunny Srivastava and Goldy Srivastava were made named accused in the FIR registered with Town police station in connection with the murder. Shivraj had won election from ward number 16 for two consecutive times. His short tenure as mayor had ended on June 26 this year as elections could not be held on time due to Covid pandemic. Katihar sadar SDPO Amarkant Jha said four accused – Srikant, Sunny, Ankit Chauhan and Abhishek Mahto – are still evading arrest. Jha said Neeraj was arrested from Falka police station area on Thursday night. “He was sent to jail on Friday after production in a local court,” he said, adding two more accused, including Goldy, were arrested from Korha police station area. He said eight named accused and four others who were not named in the FIR have so far been arrested in connection with the case. Jha said interrogations revealed that Shivraj had thrashed Abhishek’s father Prakash Mahto near his residence around a fortnight back along with some of his supporters. “Abhishek had come to the rescue of his father. His friend Goldy had also joined him. Goldy was also thrashed by the ex-mayor and his supporters,” he said. The SDPO added a conspiracy was hatched to kill Shivraj after the incident. “Interrogations also revealed that it was Sunny and Ankit who had opened fire on the former mayor from a close range,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ex-mayor-murder-case-4-accused-still-at-large/articleshow/85136532.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: English, maths marks critical in Covid-year admission||KOLKATA: Several colleges and universities in the city have decided to focus on the marks in two particular subjects irrespective of the course a candidate has applied for to raise the bar and create some sort of a filter process in the absence of admission tests and personal interviews to evaluate the aptitude of applicants. To make the minimum eligibility criteria in humanities competitive, colleges are giving additional weightage to English. For science stream, additional weightage is being given to mathematics. Some colleges are considering marks in these two subjects even for admission in subjects like Hindi, Bengali, statistics and economics. The two main reasons for giving more weightage to these subjects are to identify more deserving students from thousands of applications and also because Board examinations were cancelled and students were evaluated on the basis of marks in Class X boards and Class XI annual examinations. At Presidency University, marks in mathematics will form a key component in calculation of academic score (to prepare a general merit list) in subjects like geography, chemistry, economics, statistics, physics and life sciences. Similarly, marks in English will be factored in while calculating the academic score in history, performing arts, philosophy, political science and sociology. “This is also a strategy to neutralise the high scores in Board exams, the calculation of which has not been very scientific,” said a department head at Presidency. At St Xavier’s College, the eligibility criteria to make it to the merit list is 75% of English and aggregate and 25% of the individual subjects to take up political science, sociology and mass communication. At Bethune College, the minimum eligibility criteria in political science, history and psychology is 60% in English. Candidates applying in Bengali and Hindi, too, need 50% and 45% in English, respectively. To apply for economics and statistics, a candidate needs 65% in maths and 50% in English. “This will help us in identifying the more deserving candidates for the subject,” said an official. At Lady Brabourne, an applicant needs a certain percentage (varies from subject to subject) in English as an additional requirement, barring Bengali. At Scottish Church, too, English and maths will form an important component.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/eng-maths-marks-critical-in-cov-yr-admission/articleshow/85137155.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The inaugural function will be held via videoconferencing in which more than 300 earth scientists associated with different organizations will participate. PU vice-chancellor G K Chaudhary, who released a logo of the platinum jubilee celebrations on Saturday, will inaugurate the function at 12pm on Sunday. Geology department head Atul Aditya Pandey said the logo had been designed by Ahmedabad-based Anant National University’s faculty member Amitabh Pandey and College of Arts and Crafts student Ravi Raj. “During the yearlong celebrations, a number of workshops, seminars and guest lectures by eminent geoscientists will be organised,” he added. The geology department was established in 1946 with the endowment of a chair called the J N Tata Professor of Geology and subsequent appointment of Dr L A N Iyer, an eminent geologist, as its head of the department. After the enactment of the Patna University Act 1951, the postgraduate department of geology was established in its own building on the Patna Science College campus. During the last 75 years of its journey, the department has made significant strides in the field of earth science education in the country. It has carved a niche for itself by producing a galaxy of brilliant earth scientists, who have contributed significantly not only in the growth of the national economy, but also in the development of organizations like the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Geological Survey of India, Central Ground Water Board, Atomic Energy Commission, Department of Mines and Geology, and Coal India Limited. The department has set up a very purposeful geological museum-cum-auditorium with the funds donated by an alumnus and teacher of the department, Dr Ranjan Prasad Yadav. There are 1,500 minerals on exhibit in the museum. “The department is also planning to develop a geological field museum in this jubilee year,” said Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-geology-dept-vc-to-inaugurate-platinum-jubilee-celebrations-today/articleshow/85135479.cms||B K Mishra

The highest flood level 73.90 mt had been recorded on September 9, 1978. Threat of further rise in water level and crossing the danger mark continued as the river had been maintaining trend of rising in upstream from Phaphamau, Prayagraj and Mirzapur, where it was flowing near warning level of 76.72 mt. The river was flowing above danger mark of 63.10 mt in Ghazipur and above two mt of danger mark of 57.61 mt in Ballia.

Official said that over 200-300 families have been affected by marooning of their localities including Saraimohana, Puranapul, Pulkohna, Sidhvaghat, Teenpulva and Nakkhighabut but most of these families have taken shelter at upper floors. Only few families have left their homes for safe places so far. DM said that five shelter homes with community kitchen facility have been made operational and dry ration is being distributed to those, who have taken shelter along roads and other areas. A total of 16 boats have been introduced for relief operations in the urban belts, he said adding, in rural areas three boats have been engaged for relief works at Darahra and adjoining villages near Ghazipur border and sharp vigil is kept on Dhab, where two villages were affected due to increased water level.

This was informed by TTD specified authority chairman and executive officer (EO) Dr KS Jawahar Reddy, on Saturday. Addressing the pilgrim callers during the monthly ‘Dial your EO’ programme at the TTD administrative building here, Jawahar Reddy said the temple administration was forced to impose curbs on inflow of pilgrims due to the pressing situation. “We are forced to issue only limited darshan tokens. However, the TTD has increased the special entry darshan tickets quota to 8,000 tickets a day from 5,000 ,” the EO said.  “Pilgrims can register complaints at 9989078111 and before their departure from Tirumala, their grievances will be resolved,” Jawahar Reddy added.

---||Vadodara||Vadodara inching towards 100% first dose coverage||VADODARA: The city seems to have raced ahead of others when it comes to Covid-19 vaccination. Nearly 12 lakh persons in the city have taken at least one dose of the vaccine. Despite hiccups, the vaccination drive in the city has continued steadily. According to Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) data, 11,89,500 persons have taken the first dose so far while 4,31,629 persons have taken the second shot of the vaccine. In the absence of any other concrete data, the civic body considers the number of voters in the city as a rough estimate of the number of persons that have to be vaccinated. In the latest civic elections for VMC, 14,46,212 voters were registered in the city. If one considers this figure, over 82% of adults in the city have been vaccinated. Officials, however, said that the number of persons who have been vaccinated with the first dose has crossed 90%. “The target population data has been worked out by the state government and by that figure, we have crossed 90% vaccination,” said VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel. Sources said that some discrepancy in data will remain in the absence of the exact figure of adults in the city. Another reason is that many from outside the city have been vaccinated here. At the same time, many from the city took vaccines outside. “When there was a rush for vaccination in the city, many went to public health centres in nearby villages and even districts. At the same time, many from the rural areas may have taken vaccines in the city when the 18-44 years age group vaccination began here and not in rural areas,” said an official. The coverage of second dose in the city presently stands at nearly 30% of the total population. The percentage of persons taking the second dose is gradually increasing with a rise in the total number of jabs given every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-inching-towards-100-first-dose-coverage/articleshow/85135608.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Fall in area under cotton cultivation, Covid deal double blow to weavers||VISAKHAPATNAM: With a decline in the area under cotton cultivation in Ponduru, dependence on cotton from other areas and finally, the pandemic, the rich tradition of Ponduru khadi is staring at a bleak future, reports Nalla Babu. Renowned for its long, unbroken tradition of making fine khadi, the village made its mark during the freedom movement when khadi spun here became the favourite handmade garment of Mahatma Gandhi. Till a decade ago, over 500 weavers were engaged in the business. This number has since dwindled to over 100. Speaking to STOI, joint director, agriculture, Srikakulam, K Sridhar said the area under cotton cultivation in and around Ponduru and other parts of the district stood at over 10,000 hectares a decade ago. “Now the area is only 3,500 hectares as many cotton growers have migrated to other crops due to poor rainfall,” he added. Growers in Ponduru prefer the indigenous hill cotton or Kondapatti to hybrid cotton. The production of fine Ponduru khadi is no less than an art involving a long sequence of meticulous processes performed by hand. But, even if a whole family were to devote its entire time to making khadi garments, it cannot earn more than Rs 300 a day. “Covid-19 has hit our trade hard as sale came down by 50%. The annual turnover came down to around Rs 2.5 crore from around Rs 4 crore,” said G K Prasad, president, Khadi Society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/fall-in-area-under-cotton-cultivation-covid-deal-double-blow-to-weavers/articleshow/85136597.cms||Nalla.Babu

She proved her majority during a meeting at Patna Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) Bankipore circle office on Saturday. Five ward councillors voted against and two in favour of the no-confidence motion brought against her. Though 30 ward councillors were present during the floor test, only seven voted through secret ballots. The remaining 23 councillors did not vote but expressed their support to Sahu. The opposition needed at least 37 votes -- more than 50% of the total strength of the PMC board (75) -- in favour of the motion to remove Sahu. The meeting lasted less than an hour during which the mayor refuted all the allegations levelled against her, including favouritism, inefficiency and outsourcing the projects to private firms. It was followed by the voting, which has been carried out under the supervision of deputed magistrate and observer. Section 144 of the CrPC was imposed in the Bankipore circle office and voting was held amid tight security. The floor test meeting was chaired by ward 67 councillor Manoj Kumar alias Munna Jaiswal, who is also the member of empowered standing committee of the civic body. It was coordinated by the municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma. After retaining her seat, Sahu told this newspaper that it was because of sincerity towards work that she was lucky for the third time. “I will work for the all-round development of the city without any discrimination, like I have been doing for the last four years. Some councillors tried to manipulate to overthrow me but their malevolent intent was unsuccessful. They knew the results. That is why they failed to show up during the floor test,” she said. She added: “As less than eight months are left for the election of new mayor, our focus will be on the development and progress of the city. I am glad that my regime will stay for five years.” On August 3, 29 ward councillors had moved a no-confidence motion against Sahu, barely a few days after deputy mayor Meera Devi lost her chair. Ward councillor Vinay Kumar Pappu alleged that the floor test was self-sponsored by the mayor. “I want to know why all those who brought this no- trust motion did not participate in the voting process. I was shocked that only two votes were in favour of the motion. The answer is very simple because it was pre-planned by the mayor. She bought all the councillors through intimidation and money. If she has any morality left, she should resign from her post,” he told this newspaper. Earlier in 2019, Sahu had survived by two votes and in 2020 also by two votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-mayor-wins-trust-vote-hands-down/articleshow/85135329.cms||Faryal Rumi

Addressing the media, Guntur Urban SP Arif Hafeez said that while Venkat Reddy was arrested in Ongole on Friday, the main accused Krishna was caught near Vijayawada railway track on Saturday. The SP said interrogations revealed that both had murdered a peanut seller after he witnessed them trying to steal some copper wire prior to the rape, and dumped his body in the Krishna. Later that night, the duo noticed the couple at Seethanagaram ghat and approached them. They then threatened them with a blade and thrashed the girl’s fiance and used his clothes to tie them up before raping the woman. Hafeez said six teams were deployed to trace the accused. On Saturday, Krishna was seen walking on top of the railway bridge towards Tadepalli from Vijayawada and arrested. Cops said they also arrested another accused, Sheikh Habib, who assisted the duo after the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/main-accused-in-tadepalli-rape-case-nabbed/articleshow/85136931.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

But due to technological advances, the Covid-19 vaccine became available within a year, said Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami, delivering the keynote address at the valedictory of the two-day WTO ministerial conference, organised by Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University (DSNLU) on Saturday. “Covid-19 vaccine would be available to all countries only if the manufacturing companies liberalised their patent rights. But they are not ready to do so. The rich countries could spend more money to get the vaccine, while poor countries are facing a lot of problems to avail the doses. Under these circumstances, India and South Africa proposed the temporary waiver of patent rights for the benefit of all. The vaccine patent should be revoked in public interest. The rich countries opposed the patent revocation, despite the fact that the WTO agreement itself could terminate a patent in an emergency,” said Goswami, who is also the chancellor of DSNLU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cj-bats-for-covid-19-vaccine-patent-revocation/articleshow/85136840.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Parents upset as private schools in Vijayawada flout fee norms||VIJAYAWADA: Despite the government ordering reduction of school fees by 30 per cent, many corporate schools in the city have increased the same up to 50 per cent for the academic year 2021-22. Ahead of the proposed reopening of schools on August 16, many private schools in the city have insisted on payment of 50 per cent of fee on the day of reopening, putting parents in a fix. Primary schools remained closed throughout the academic year 2020-21 due to covid-19 pandemic. Only high schools functioned between November 2020 to February 2021 before the second wave struck in March 2021. Schools were permitted to conduct classes in online mode and strict orders were passed to reduce the existing fee by 30 per cent. Many schools downsized the teaching staff and conducted online classes. But the situation has changed with the beginning of new academic year. Schools started online classes from July 1 and started insisting parents to pay the revised fee. “No classes were conducted for my class 4 daughter who is studying in a corporate school during 2020-21. But still we paid the fees. The school management started online classes this academic year and insisted us to pay around 45 per cent more fees than normal. They are also threatening that they will cut online access if we fail to pay 50 per cent of fees by August 15,” said K Nagaraju, an accountant from the city. Many schools are collecting up to RS 15,000 in the name of textbooks and bridge course books ignoring the guidelines of the education department. K Ravi Kumar, inspector of schools, Vijayawada, said they are moving to take stern action against schools which are collecting high fees. “State government had set certain limits on fees as per the suggestions of the reforms committee. We are strictly enforcing them. But still a few schools have raised complaints with us about the fee. Similarly only text book and work books are permitted and bridge course syllabuses are against the guidelines and parents can raise a complaint with us if schools insist them to buy books at high cost,” Ravi Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/parents-upset-as-pvt-schools-flout-fee-norms/articleshow/85136807.cms||Venu Lanka

The government had in the past one month shot off half-a-dozen letters on coordination committee meetings and Rayalaseema lift irrigation scheme (RLIS). Special chief secretary, irrigation, Rajat Kumar, in the letter, said the Telangana government had objected to the illegal drawal of water through Pothireddypadu head regulator (PHR) by AP to its unapproved ayacut outside the Krishna basin. “As per the interstate agreement of 1976-77 and the Planning Commission clearance in 1981, AP is entitled to draw 15 tmcft of water for the Chennai water supply scheme and 19 tmc ft for Srisailam right bank canal (SRBC) through Pothireddypadu from July to October every year.

The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) on Saturday approved the new tax regime in a special council meeting. However, the property tax based on the market value of residential buildings has been reduced from the earlier proposed 0.15% to 0.12%. Earlier in the morning, police took several leaders into custody as opposition parties staged separate protests against the revised tax structure outside the civic body office, demanding the mayor to make a council resolution to postpone the property tax hike by two years in view of the financial woes being faced by people due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the council, where the ruling YSRC enjoys a clear majority, passed the agenda item on the new tax system. Interestingly, some TDP corporators also spoke in support of the tax hike. Announcing the council’s approval for the new tax structure, mayor G Hari Venkata Kumari said they would request the state government to reduce the quantum of tax hike on the lines of how it happened in Vijayawada and Guntur. A property tax of 0.12% on the market value of residential buildings, 0.3% on non-residential/commercial buildings, and 0.5% on vacant lands will be collected under the new system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-council-nod-for-new-tax-regime/articleshow/85136770.cms||---

The 25X25cm tumour covered a large area of the outer head region too. The tumour exerted a lot of pressure on the girl’s head and caused agonising pain. She was admitted to the AIIMS-P three weeks ago in a severe anaemic condition with 4% haemoglobin and underwent blood transfusion before surgery. She was put on medication and brought to the operation theatre on Friday morning. The head of the department of neurosurgery, Dr Vikas Chandra Jha, who led the surgical team, told this reporter on Saturday that the patient was stable and recovering fast. Earlier, a 13-year-old boy and a 65-year-old woman were operated on and their tumours removed using a robotic arm at the AIIMS-P.

Former mukhiya Shashinath Jha (58) was shot dead under the same Musrigharari police station area on Friday. Darbhanga range IG Ajitabh Kumar said four criminals on bikes reached the bank and looted Rs16.76 lakh from the iron vault and cash counter after taking the staff and hostage at gunpoint and fled within five minutes. The bank branch is located inside a lane. “Surprisingly, the branch manager didn’t press the alarm button to alert everyone. There was no armed guard deployed at the branch for security,” he said. The IG, who reached the spot, said police have some clues and the case will be cracked soon. Samastipur SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon had already taken up the investigation after reaching the bank. The IG said a police patrolling vehicle had reached the bank hardly 15 minutes prior to the bank loot. “The patrolling team was nearby. Had the branch manager pressed the alarm button, it would have reached there in no time. It seems the manager panicked though he was sitting inside his chamber and near the alarm button,” he said. Musrigharari police station SHO Sanjay Kumar Singh said the criminals entered the bank while posing as customers and forced a bank staff to open the iron vault from which at least Rs10 lakh was looted. “Rest of the amount was looted from the cash counters. There were seven bank employees and two customers inside the branch at that time,” SHO said. He said all the nine persons were locked inside a room before the criminals fled.

Many shops in the malls came up with lucrative offers and seasonal discounts to attract a large number of customers. Amit Ranjan, the manager of a mall on Fraser Road, told this newspaper, “With a view to managing the crowd and maintaining social distancing inside the mall, we had to ask a few customers to wait outside. The response has been overwhelming since morning.” Ratan Singh, the general manager of another mall in Patliputra Colony, urged the government to allow malls to open on all days, instead of just three. “All our employees and security personnel have been vaccinated and the premises are sanitised thoroughly,” he claimed and added that around 7,700 people visited the mall on Day 1. Echoing similar views, Pankaj Kumar, the employee of a mall near Boring Canal Road, said the customers’ response was great as “several outlets have come up with discounts and offers”. Meanwhile, Patnaites, especially youngsters, were excited to revisit their favourite malls after a long time. Shristi Suman, a resident of Ashiana Colony, bought dresses, bags and glasses because “everything was available at a reasonable price”. Rahul Kumar Gupta, a resident of S P Verma Road, said, “I went to a mall to buy clothes for a wedding ceremony I will attend later this week. I also bought a gift for the couple.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/malls-reopen-attract-customers/articleshow/85135549.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Bihar: Drive against filaria in 22 districts from Sept 20||PATNA: A mass drug administration (MDA) drive will be carried out in 22 districts from September 20 to eradicate filaria, health minister Mangal Pandey said on Saturday. People will be given anti-filarial drugs to prevent the transmission of the disease. Pandey said children below two years, pregnant women and people suffering from serious diseases will not be given the drug. Districts where MDA programme will be rolled out are Araria, Banka, Begusarai, Bhagalpur, Buxar, East Champaran, West Champaran, Gopalganj, Jehanabad, Jamui, Kaimur, Katihar, Khagaria, Madhepura, Munger, Muzaffarpur, Patna, Saharsa, Saran, Sitamarhi, Siwan and Supaul. He said Filariasis comes under the list of serious diseases at world level and India is among the most affected countries. In India, Bihar has the highest endemicity. “Work related to awareness is being done. A task force will be constituted to make the programme successful,” Pandey said. Cases of people avoiding drug administration and lack of awareness have been reported in case of filaria from across the country. According to a report published in Medical Journal Armed Forces of India, a single dose mass administration annually in combination with other techniques has already eliminated lymphatic filariasis from Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Solomon Islands and markedly reduced the transmission in China. Urging people to take the drug, Pandey said many people suffering from filaria do not show any symptoms in the beginning. Hence, everyone should take the drug for prevention of the disease. He also asked people to ensure the prevention of mosquito breeding in their homes or neighbourhood and use mosquito nets and keep their surroundings clean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/drive-against-filaria-in-22-districts-from-sept-20/articleshow/85136668.cms||Sheezan Nezami

KCR will visit Shalapalli village which falls under Huzurabad assembly constituency to launch the Dalita Bandhu programme. In fact, the CM was supposed to launch the programme in Huzurabad as a pilot project before he sprang a surprise by announcing its launch in his adopted village of Vasalamarri in Yadadri district a few days ago. The CM’s move came in the wake of reports that the Election Commission was likely to announce the poll schedule for Huzurabad. Dalit families will be given Rs 10 lakh each as part of the programme. Karimnagar additional collector Garima Agarwal told STOI that all arrangements were being made for the CM’s visit. Shalapalli village in Huzurabad mandal was selected for the CM’s meeting as it was from here that KCR had launched the Rythu Bandhu programme, officials said. Ministers — Gangula Kamalakar and Koppula Eshwar — held a meeting with officials at Karimnagar district collectorate on Saturday and asked RTC officials to organise buses to bring beneficiaries to the village. Collector RV Karnan, who already held a meeting with officials of various departments on August 6, took stock of arrangements being made for the August 16 meeting.  Apart from other arrangements for the CM’s visit, a specific instruction was given to officials that any food item that would be served to KCR on that day should first be examined by a gazetted food inspector with the knowledge of the police commissioner.

The village has several houses built illegally either on government or comunidade land and are awaiting regularisation, some for nearly 20 years. Sarpanch Ranjit Usgaonkar said they are unable to do repairs and renovations. The panchayat has decided to take signatures of all panch members on a representation to chief minister Pramod Sawant and MLA Glenn Ticlo extending their support to the bill. Usgaonkar said the opposition has been opposing the bill without a cause. “We are thankful to the chief minister and our MLA for bringing the bill,” he said. Former sarpanch Savio Martins said the opposition should give suggestions instead of merely opposing it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sons-of-soil-will-gain-from-bill-bastora-panchayat/articleshow/85139357.cms||---

With the latest approval, KIIFB has given financial sanction to 912 projects worth Rs 64, 344.64 crore, state finance minister K N Balagopal said. The KIIFB executive committee had earlier approved another set of seven projects worth Rs 144.23 crore. The board and executive committee meetings together have thus cleared a total of 17 projects worth Rs 1, 076.62 crore. The projects that have been given financial sanction by the board include a 10-bed isolation wards in 140 hospitals across Kerala in view of the pandemic situation in the state. Four projects proposed by fisheries sector include renovation of 26 fish markets. Renovation of three markets under local self government department in Aluva and Nedumangad municipalities, modernization of an abattoir at Kaloor, a rehabilitation package which is part of the cleaning work on the west-coast canal in Thiruvananthapuram under costal shipping and inland navigation department and renovation of the damaged sea wall along the Chellanam coast and setting up of groynes for coastal protection are among the other projects that received the board’s clearance. Rs 2,100cr for funding green projects: The board meeting also gave a go ahead for borrowing Rs 2,100 crore from domestic and international markets to promote non-conventional energy projects it had undertaken as part of infrastructure development initiatives. As part of the move, KIIFB would raise Rs 1,000 crore from the domestic market through the sale of green bonds and another Rs 1,100 crore loan from International Financial Corporation. The repayment term for this loan is 10 years. The agency is required to obtain regulatory approval from the central agencies and other institutions concerned. By way of loans from various banks, development financial institutions and bonds, the agency has borrowed Rs 9,104.81 crore so far out of the total sanctioned amount of Rs 10,167.34 crore It received Rs 8848.91 crore from the motor vehicle tax and petroleum cess from the state government. KIIFB is expected to receive around Rs 1,299 crore more from these sources during the 2021-22 fiscal. The funds thus sourced would be used exclusively for a string of green initiatives taken up the board. The 42nd board meeting of KIIFB was the first one to be attended by Balagopal who replaced T M Thomas Isaac as the state finance minister in the second term of Pinarayi Vijayan government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kiifb-oks-10-projects-worth-rs-933cr/articleshow/85137505.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Local police stations will be liable for neighbourhood pond fill-up: Firhad Hakim||KOLKATA: Minister and Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators’ chairman Firhad Hakim on Saturday fixed the responsibility of protecting ponds in neighbourhoods with the local police station and warned that if they failed to act, he would ask the police commissioner to take disciplinary action against the officer in charge of the police station. While fill-up of ponds and waterbodies was rampant between 1995 and 2010, the few waterbodies that still remain in areas like Garden Reach, Behala, Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt and off EM Bypass continue to be under constant threat. Sections of the East Kolkata Wetlands that are in KMC jurisdiction have also seen widespread fill-up and encroachment. Calling on OCs to protect waterbodies and act tough against land sharks, Hakim said OC would be held liable if any waterbody in their jurisdiction was filled up. “The police officers have a definite role to play to stop the filling of a pond. If they fail to act on time, we will hold them responsible for such an illegal act. I have asked the municipal commissioner to lodge complaints against inaction on part of a particular OC in preventing pond filling,” Hakim told reporters. While conducting the weekend citizens interactive session ‘Talk to KMC’, Hakim on Saturday received a call from Nadial in Garden Reach. The caller informed him about filling of a large pond in the neighbourhood. Hakim assured the resident that necessary action will be taken against the culprits. Environmentalists welcomed the civic move saying that it would boost their morale in fighting against pond filling. Arjan Basu Roy an environmentalist felt this step would go a long way in ensuring that police would at least keep a vigil over city’s ponds and cooperate with them in preventing rampant filling of ponds. However, Basu Roy laid stress on formulating a comprehensive policy for better management of the city’s ponds and waterbodies. “It is heartening that police will need to act tough against pond filling after a warning from the city’s civic guardian. At the same time, we need to take collective efforts to ensure that ponds are maintained in a better way,” he said. Somendra Mohun Ghosh, another environmentalist who along with his team has launched a movement against filling of ponds in Jadavpur-Golf Green belt said efforts were on to prevent a pond behind actor Soumitra Chatterjee’s house in Golf Green. “The actor himself had protested against the filling of a pond behind his house. The work of filling was stopped for some months. After his death, a racket has become active again. We also need to protect and maintain several other ponds in large areas such as Azadgarh, Bijoyggarh, Jadavpur, Santoshpur, Baghajatin and in Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/local-police-stations-will-be-liable-for-neighbourhood-pond-fill-up-firhad/articleshow/85137502.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||West Bengal to revamp Bagjola and Kestopur canals||KOLKATA: The state irrigation department is planning major overhaul of Bagjola and Kestopur canals, the two main drainage outlet canals which flushes off excess rainwater from Bidhannagar, New Town and South Dum Dum civic body areas. The plan includes overall revival of Bagjola canal and proper maintenance of Kestopur canal. The state irrigation department has firmed up a roadmap to desilt and dredge Kestopur and Bagjola canals. Irrigation minister Soumen Mahapatra will convene a meeting with his department officials on coming Wednesday. The minister said, “When I was in charge of the irrigation department, the canals were not as clogged as they are now. Dredging and cleaning used to be done on a regular basis. But then someone else (Suvendu Adhikari) took over. Anyway, now that I am back, helming this department, we will try and mend the situation.” Irrigation officials said a thorough desilt and dredging plan for lower Bagjola canal has been chalked out and will be taken up after the monsoon.“Kestopur canal will also require proper maintenance work, including clearance of silt,” said an official. Bagjola canal,which stretches almost 38 km, carries water all along BT Road before entering VIP Road and Rajarhat. It is the main drainage outlet canal for South Dum Dum, New Town and Bidhannagar civic body areas. Kestopur canal connects with Bagjola canal at Rajarhat. The canal is overflowing during heavy rains and failing to flush out excess rainwater due to its reduced capacity — triggered by silt accumulation. This is resulting in severe waterlogging during heavy downpour in areas of Bidhannagar, Rajarhat, South Dum Dum municipality and NKDA area of New Town. Salt Lake resident and former bureaucrat Bikram Sarkar said, “Irrigation is such an important department. It should function throughout the year. Crores are spent by the department as per the budgetary allocations. Unfortunately, the results are not visible.” “Bagjola canal needs to be fully revived. We have discussed the matter with irrigation department and steps will be taken,” said South Dum Dum municipality board of administrators chairperson Panchu Gopal Roy. BMC board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty said, “We have been holding meetings on this. The canal needs to be properly dredged which could be done after the monsoon.” Already, Hidco has come up with a blueprint to clean accumulated silt of Bagjola canal flowing on the New Town side. “We will refer our report to the housing department,” said Hidco MD Debashis Sen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-to-revamp-bagjola-and-kestopur-canals/articleshow/85137533.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kochi||IMD sounds alert for heavy rains from August 10 in Kerala||KOCHI: India Meteorological Department (IMD) has sounded a heavy rainfall alert for Kerala from August 10 this year. The southwest monsoon has been active for the last couple of days triggering memories of the past three years’ extremely heavy rains from August 6-12. From 2018-2020, the period has been seeing intense rainfall and cloudburst-like events leading to heavy landslides, mud-slips and road cave-ins in hilly regions. If the period from August 1-19, in 2018 was all about the once-in-a-century extreme rain (with an excess rainfall of up to 164%), then in 2019, between August 1and 12, several landslides occurred, including the ones at Puthumala and Kavalapara. The horror repeated next year when on August 6 a landslide hit Pettimudy, which had been receiving very heavy rainfall from August 1 onwards. “One should look at these events as part of climate change and global warming. The monsoon season is for four months and there have been years when we have had heavy rainfall in August. The anomaly is that these events are recurring every year during the same period for the last three years. In this season, we have noted only a typical monsoon behaviour in the last couple of days,” said S Abhilash, director of ST-Radar centre, Cochin University. He said there have been changes in cloud patterns leading to intense and sudden very heavy rainfall events when 5cm rainfall occurs for two hours in a region.“So, one single cloudburst event any time during the season can affect the present calm,” he added. According to the IMD data, last year, Kerala received more than 20cm of extremely heavy rainfall from August 6-12. In 2018, from August 1-19, the excess rainfall was at 164%. Meanwhile, IMD has issued an orange alert for Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Idukki for August 11. Heavy rainfall alert has been issued for south and central districts for the next two days. The district administrations are on full alert for waterlogging and landslide events in hilly regions. Indian National Centre For Ocean Information Services has issued high wave warnings in the range of 2.5-3.3m till Sunday night along the Kerala coast between Vizhinjam to Kasaragod. Fishermen have been advised not to venture into these sea areas during the period mentioned till August 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/imd-sounds-alert-for-heavy-rains-from-aug-10/articleshow/85137543.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: JP Nadda rolls out poll blueprint with ‘Vidhan Sabha’ in charges||LUCKNOW: BJP on Saturday directed its grassroots functionaries to reach out to local seers and religious teachers to bring their followers closer to the party in a key strategy move to amplify party’s influence on voters in the run-up to assembly polls. The decision was taken at a meeting of BJP national president JP Nadda with the 403 ‘Vidhan Sabha Prabharis’ (assembly constituencies’ in charges) in Lucknow. Sources privy to the meeting, which was kept off media glare, said, reaching out to religious teachers will help the party to indirectly augment its poll campaign. The strategy was discussed in the presence of BJP national general secretary (organisation), BL Santhosh. BJP vice-president and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal were also present. The party is also learnt to have decided to reshuffle ‘prabharis’, a move that comes amid plans to keep its cadre on toes even as a pugnacious opposition ups the ante to arrest BJP’s chances of returning to office after 2022 polls. Sources said, the assembly in-charges were likely to be allocated new jurisdictions by August 10. Essentially local-rung party functionaries, the assembly in-charges have also been tasked to launch a campaign on the robust law and order situation in UP and the crackdown of Yogi Adityanath government on land sharks. The move is aimed to focus on the bulldozing of illegal properties of mafia dons. The BJP brass is also learnt to have deliberated on the role of ‘panna pramukhs’ and how they can be roped in to firm up the party’s electoral strategy. Sources said, the state leadership wants panna pramukhs to begin connecting with at least 60 voters by visiting their homes personally. UP BJP chief Swantantra Dev Singh said, “A sammelan of panna pramukhs would be held around September 25 to coincide with the birth anniversary of party ideologue, Deendayal Upadhyay. Also, senior party functionaries were asked to ensure that problems faced by local party workers are taken up and promptly addressed. The state leadership was told not to cold-shoulder workers, who are crucial to driving the party’s poll campaign. The state leadership was also advised to keep a close eye on local political equations and factor it before rolling out the poll machinery at the booth level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nadda-rolls-out-poll-blueprint-with-vidhan-sabha-in-charges/articleshow/85141376.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Goa||After AAP exit, Elvis ready to be inducted into Cong||Margao: Over seven months after he quit AAP after being disenchanted with the party affairs, former bureaucrat Elvis Gomes is finally set to embrace Congress on Sunday. He will be inducted into the party fold at a function to be held at the Congress headquarters in Panaji. Speaking to TOI, Gomes, who also held talks with Congress president Rahul Gandhi, said that he was convinced about the party leadership’s seriousness in “cleansing” the party. “Whatever misgivings I earlier had about Congress got cleared after holding talks with Congress leadership,” Gomes said. “They have also made a public statement that the 10 defectors who hopped over to the BJP will not be taken back. So there’s hope that the party is serious about its new clean-up effort. I will play a role in that effort.” Gomes, who quit AAP in December 2020, had announced that he would contest the 2022 assembly elections from Cuncolim, but had since been silent over his choice with regards to the party ticket he would contest on.  He had resigned from his post as the AAP’s state convenor and also from the party’s primary membership alleging that it was being controlled by a ‘high command culture’ from Delhi and that the party had compromised on its core principles. He had contested the 2017 assembly polls from Cuncolim as the AAP candidate and was projected as the party’s chief ministerial candidate. Gomes, on an earlier occasion had told TOI: “The core ideology of Congress right from Independence hasn’t changed. However, the influx of some undesired elements into the party over the years inflicted some damage unto it. Now they need to do the cleansing. Once the cleansing is done, there will be a change. That’s my perspective.” With Gomes joining Congress, sources said that the development will result into turmoil within the Congress camp in Cuncolim. Incumbent Cuncolim MLA Clafacio Dias who had contested as a Congress candidate in the 2017 polls, had trounced Joaquim Alemao who had contested as an independent. He was among the 10 turncoat MLAs from Congress who switched over to BJP in July 2019. Joaquim’s son Yuri had made known his intention of contesting from Cuncolim as a Congress candidate. After a brief rendezvous with Goa Forward Party (GFP), Yuri had switched over to Congress eyeing the Congress ticket for the 2022 polls. The AAP camp in Cuncolim is however unfazed. “Gomes’s entry into the Congress will not make any difference to AAP,” the camp said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-aap-exit-elvis-ready-to-be-inducted-into-cong/articleshow/85139468.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In this context, government has taken a decision to give priority to the government departments and autonomous bodies for allotment of land and buildings,” director of education Bhushan Savaikar said. The allotment will be done on a case to case basis with the approval of the government, the director said. “It is enjoined upon all heads of government departments and autonomous bodies to bring the content to the notice of the sub-ordinate offices under your jurisdiction and furnish your requirements to this directorate within 15 days of receipt of this circular,” Savaikar said. Of the 84 shut school buildings, 13 are in Ponda taluka, 12 are located each in Bicholim, Pernem and Quepem talukas, 10 are in Sattari taluka, eight in Sanguem, six each in Dharbandora and Canacona talukas, and four in Bardez taluka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/84-unused-schools-on-offer-as-rented-premises-to-govt-offices/articleshow/85139432.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata airport scouts for sites in terminal for biometric boarding launch||KOLKATA: The city airport officials along with airline representatives are chalking out exact sites where registration and self check-in kiosks as well as automated gates and registration will be installed for the rollout of the biometric boarding system (BBS) that is also known as DigiYatra. The system, once commissioned, will allow paperless and seamless travel experience. “The consignments of BBS equipment have arrived at Kolkata airport. We are now working with airlines to determine the exact position where the kiosks and terminals will be placed so that they facilitate passenger flow in the terminal and do not cause any hindrance. Drills are being carried out to check the most convenient positioning of the kiosks and terminals,” Kolkata airport director C Pattabhi said. In the domestic terminal, registration kiosks will be installed in all three gates — 1, 2 and 3. In addition, terminals will be set up at the entrance where flyers will undergo facial scan post registration. Next, there will be self check-in kiosks. There will also be dedicated gates at the security hold area and boarding point for DigiYatra passengers. DigiYatra equipment will also be installed in the domestic-to-domestic and international-to-domestic transfer to enable seamless travel through the airport. “Initially, IndiGo and Air India passengers will participate in the trials. Gradually, passengers of other airlines will be taken on board,” an official said. Officials said once the trails that are underway at Varanasi airport are completed, it would take 45 days for Kolkata to also roll out the facility that is expected to considerably ease travel and reduce contact points. In phase one of the rollout, two registration kiosks, eight self check-in kiosks, two entry gates, four security and transfer gates and three self-boarding gates are to be installed. In the second phase, another 12 registration kiosks, 15 self check-in kiosks, three entry gates, three security and transfer gates, and 13 self-boarding gates will be installed. “One of the challenges during initial rollout will be masks. They will have to be taken off for the sensor to detect face contours. Hence, there has to be social distancing,” an official said. To do a check with mask on would require an iris scan that is not part of the software. Trials were initially planned in July but delays happened due to Covid situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airport-scouts-for-sites-in-terminal-for-biometric-boarding-launch/articleshow/85137573.cms||Subhro Niyogi

This will entitle the families of those four people to receive financial compensations and other benefits announced earlier for the victims of that tragedy, the minister said in Thrissur on Saturday. The bodies of 66 people who were killed in the tragedy were recovered and their kin were declared eligible for compensation. The bodies of four people had not been recovered so far and their families could not receive any compensation. The minister said the compensations have already been disbursed to the families of 46 people who were killed in the tragedy, and whose bodies were recovered. Compensations will be disbursed to the families of 16 more people, whose bodies have been recovered, within a week or two, Rajan said. Disbursement of the compensations for the families of two persons who lost their lives in the tragedy was getting delayed because of the delays in the issuing of gazette notifications regarding their deaths, the minister said, adding that steps would be taken to overcome this. Rajan said two others whose bodies were recovered after the tragedy hailed from Tamil Nadu. The government is waiting for their families to produce their legal ‘heirship’ certificates and other supporting documents, for providing them the compensations, he said. The minister also said surprise inspections were carried out in 27 RDOs across the state on Friday following reports of malpractices in processing the applications for land conversion. The raids were coordinated by the district collectors. All the applications for land conversions in those offices were scanned and digitized. The objective was to block the possibilities of manipulating the applications, Rajan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/4-missing-persons-to-be-declared-dead/articleshow/85137565.cms||---

When they take entry into the party, they should not be welcomed like heroes. Congress members from the locality should have been told,” Sardinha said at a press conference held at the party’s South Goa district office in Margao. Replying to a query, Sardinha placed the blame for the incident squarely on Goa Pradesh Congress president Girish Chodankar. “Girish should know how to run the party. We want people to come but don’t make them heroes. Come into the party, but please don’t come with the hope of getting a ticket,” he said. Sardinha, who has been in the contention for the party president’s post, said that Congress should be led by a “senior and experienced person.” “We need seniors for the president’s post because they are experienced,” he said. He also said that new entrants to the party shouldn’t be rewarded with party tickets. “If they are given tickets, loyal Congress members will get demoralised,” Sardinha said. Earlier, while voicing his opposition to the Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill 2021, Sardinha demanded that all encroachments and illegal construction on private lands be demolished by the government. He suggested that the government introduce housing schemes for the homeless, preference for which, he said, should be given to Goans. “There are hundreds of cases under the tenancy Act and mundcarial Act pending before revenue courts. Complete them and also start housing programmes,” he said. As regards the Major Ports Bill, Sardinha demanded that the chief minister have a meeting with the prime minister and ports minister, along with representatives of other parties, to discuss the Bill and voice the state’s concerns over the legislation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/need-experienced-hand-to-run-cong-says-sardinha/articleshow/85139482.cms||---

We are being asked to withdraw our strike which has been called for long-pending and genuine demands,” said Dr Akash Desai, president of Junior Doctors Association at Vadodara. Earlier in the day, the agitating doctors and interns took out a massive rally to press for their demands. The state-run hospital is facing extreme shortage of manpower even as workforce from PHCs and CHCs has been roped in. “We have made alternative arrangements but no additional workforce can compensate for the 450 residents,” said Dr Ranjan Aiyer, medical superintendent of SSG Hospital. About 400 doctors at GG Hospital in Jamnagar and 350 doctors at PDU Hospital in Rajkot are on strike. In Rajkot, police personnel were called in at the medical college premises to prevent any possible flare-up. “How did the police enter the college premises without the dean’s permission? The college authority has issued transfer orders and asked us to vacate the hostel. They also cut the water connection and electricity last night,” said Dr Gaurav Khadiya. About 48 doctors have been given notice to vacate hostel. The students said that their demand for stint at the college itself is due to the fact that they have not been able to learn ropes of their respective fields in 2020 due to the Covid duty. About 400 doctors at new Civil Hospital (NCH) in Surat are part of the strike. “Resident doctors are firm on their demands and we will continue our strike till our demands are not met. We are protesting changes in the recent rules related to compulsory work post study by the government,” said Dr Jignesh Gengadiya, president Junior Doctors’ Association, NCH, Surat. Several patients were shifted to SMC-run SMIMER Hospital due to the strike, said authorities. “We have asked for medical officers from the health department. A few tutors and non-clinical assistant professors have been assigned the duties to handle patients,” said an official of NCH. In the current situation NCH cannot admit patients to its maximum capacity and only most critical patients are being admitted. Non-critical patients are being sent to SMIMER for treatment.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Showers cut off after shower of petals’||AHMEDABAD: The atmosphere was charged at the hostel area of Civil Hospital with hundreds of doctors awaiting results of the talks between deans and medical superintendents of government-run hospitals and senior health department officials. “The talks have yielded no results as the deans and medical superintendents were asked instead to influence and convince us to wind up the strike,” said a Junior Doctors Association (JDA) member who did not wish to be named. “The health commissioner told them that the negotiations would take place only after the strike is withdrawn. It’s unfortunate – last year in April-May, we were showered with petals, and now the state government wants to snuff the movement out by turning showers of our hostels off.” Over 3,000 JDA members across the state tried to garner support from all possible corners – even Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tweeted on Saturday, ‘Gujarat Govt extended junior docs’ post-grad period by 3 months to fight Covid, promising that 1 month of duty would be considered 2 months of service. It broke its promise & tried to intimidate protesting docs. Shocked and disappointed: this is no way to treat our Covid heroes!’ Notices are issued to the doctors to vacate the hostels, but there was no pressure from the authorities, said doctors, who continue to live on the hostel premises. The doctors insisted that all their demands are not to pressurize government, but to ask for the dues. “How is demanding 1:2 bond period not valid when the scheme was discontinued abruptly? While it’s true that there are not many Covid cases, but one must also take into consideration services of the second wave,” said a doctor. “We want to be at our alma mater as none of the super specialty courses could be conducted in full. When would we get basic knowledge? Right on the field?” Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani on Saturday reiterated the state government’s stand and said that the demands by the doctors are unreasonable. “I request them to get back to duty,” said the CM. A senior government official present in the meeting on Saturday told TOI that the health department put forth health HR issues in rural areas. “The doctors don’t want to go out of cities – then who would run the hospitals, CHCs and PHCs with all its infrastructure lying idle? There is shortage of at least 900 doctors today,” said an official. “Those who have worked for Covid are surely getting 1:2 bond period,” said an official. “The bond period is anyways reduced from 3 years to 1 year now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/showers-cut-off-after-shower-of-petals/articleshow/85139555.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Assistant coach of Indian men’s hockey team has old connect with Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: At a time when the entire nation is all praises for the Indian men’s hockey team which grabbed the bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics after a gap of 41 years, residents of Sangam city have a more personal reason to celebrate. The assistant coach of the Indian team, Piyush Dubey, has a long and strong association with the city. Piyush did his masters in economics from Allahabad University. After completing NIS diploma from Patiala, he coached the students of Kendriya Vidyalaya, AFS Manauri, besides working as a guest lecturer in the physical education education department of AU. Indian men’s hockey team as Tokyo OlympicsPiyush spoke to TOI over phone from Tokyo, and shared a number of moments which shaped his capabilities, including the one which he would always cherish. “I was quite young when I started working at KV Manauri as a guest coach for training the hockey team of the school in 2004. Hearing that a new coach has come, around 130 students, both boys and girls, assembled in the field, and I had to face the challenge of selecting the final team. Although my first salary was merely around Rs 2,800, the experience of teaching the basics and the exposure to work independently was far more valuable than monetary gains,” said Piyush. He then coached AU’s hockey team, and later on, joined KV Manauri again when the then principal Shalini Dikshit selected him to coach the team. The school’s team won the nationals in 2004 and 2011. During this period, Piyush completed BPEd and MPEd degrees from Barkatullah University, Bhopal. In 2014, Piyush got selected in the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and his first posting was in Sonipat (Haryana). Piyush was also among the selected trainers who were sent by the government of India to the University of Birmingham in England in 2016. There, he studied sports science and coaching. More than 75 of his trainees have so far shown their mettle at the international or national level. The Indian team which won the Junior World Cup in 2016 included three of his trainees—Sumit, Manpreet and Vikas Dahiya. Sumit is also part of the Indian hockey team which won the bronze medal in the Tokyo Olympics this year. Piyush is associated with the Indian team since 2019. Piyush’s family is originally from Mathura. His father Kunwar Garvendra Singh Dubey was a wrestler. He got the title ‘Singh’ only because of his wrestling. He was also known as ‘Brij Kesari’ for many years. “My elder brother Shravan was also fond of wrestling, and I used to go to the akhara at Jhunsi with him. On the way, there was a small ground where the famous coach Prem Shankar Shukla used to teach hockey to the children. One day, he handed over the stick to me and asked to try playing the game. He was impressed to see my dribbling at an early age and asked me to concentrate on playing hockey only,” Piyush told TOI over phone. When asked about the government’s decision to name Khel Ratna award after the hockey legend Dhyanchand, Piyush said, “There could be nothing better than making this as the highest award of the country in the field of sports.” He also shared his experiences about the mood of the team after losing the semis, and how the phone call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi inspired the team. “After the PM’s call, the team was encouraged and confident enough to bag the Olympic medal after 41 years,” he said. Principal of KV Manuari, Shalini Dikshit, while congratulating Piyush and the entire hockey team said, “The determination and commitment Piyush used to show while coaching the students of our school still inspires the teachers and players. The win of the Indian team will surly ignite the fire in the players of our school and other KVs who whould then proceed to play for the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/asst-coach-of-indian-mens-hockey-team-at-oly-has-a-strong-relationship-with-sangam-city/articleshow/85140686.cms||---

The Kolkata police headquarters have set aside about Rs 1.4 crore for this purpose and called a tender for the same. The tenders are likely to be finalized by the beginning of next month. “We have ordered a hundred portable ones, while another hundred will be fixed. We want to be ready as the city is set to witness a flurry of political and government activities once the Covid threat eases. It will also be useful for VVIP events, especially in the run up to a spate of elections spread over the next three years,” said a police source. “There is always the scope of human error especially when hundreds of people converge at the same spot. These portable ones can be set up quickly and are more reliable,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/200-door-frame-metal-detectors-for-i-day-security/articleshow/85137605.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

On the orders of police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun, the Harbansh Mohal police on late Friday night filed a case under the relevant sections of IPC against five people, including the director of the institute Vishal Vishnu and his wife Nikita. A group of students of the institute which is located at the Mall Road area of the city, on Thursday met police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun and lodged a complaint accusing its owners and others of charging Rs 50,000-Rs one lakh from them on the pretext of giving them admission in various aviation courses and also promising to arrange placement in airlines.

The institute had also assured jobs to the students, he said. “Our parents deposited the fees by taking loans from banks and other people. The institute did not conduct any course after June 2019.

The CBI team till the time of filing this report was engaged in the investigation at the company's headquarters located at Krishnapuram in Kanpur Nagar and Malwan in Fatehpur. The company, which belongs to Mata Prasad Agarwal, started in 1993, had decided to double its business in technical textiles from Rs 1,000 crores in 2010. The company, however, could not be able to return the amount taken from the stock market and bank till date. Shri Lakshmi Cotsyn is the largest company in the city in terms of the amount to be defaulted. Apart from bulletproof jackets, the company also used to manufacture many defence products. "It also manufactures blast-proof clothes for army vehicles. In 2005-06, the company ventured into the production of denim fabric. For this, a loan of about Rs 85 crore was taken from banks. To achieve success, units were also set up in Roorkee and Haryana. In 2006 the company doubled its production capacity. In 2010, it took a loan of Rs 693 crore from the Central Bank of India for the production of technical textiles. After this, the company prepared an investment of Rs 200 crore from the equity market and the company prepared its investment plan of Rs 100 crore," sources informd TOI. Shri Lakshmi Cotsyn is headquartered in Krishnapuram of Kanpur Nagar and its plants are located in Fatehpur, Haryana, Noida and Uttarakhand. Sources added that talks were going on with two foreign companies for the acquisition of Shri Lakshmi Cotsyn, which was declared a defaulter three years ago, but after their refusal, the well-known company of Maharashtra, Welspun took interest, but it did not work either. Besides Agarwal, the CBI has also named Pawan Kumar Agarwal, joint managing director and guarantor, Sharda Agarwal, director and guarantor and Devesh Narain Gupta, deputy managing director as accused in the FIR registered on the complaint of Central Bank of India, sources said.

---||Allahabad||State govt withdraws furtherenquiry against Dr Kafeel||Prayagraj: The Uttar Pradesh (UP) government on Friday informed the Allahabad high court that the disciplinary authority’s order dated February 24, 2020, whereby further enquiry was directed against Dr Kafeel Ahmad Khan, a suspended paediatrician of BRD Medical College of Gorakhpur, has been withdrawn. Dr Kafeel was suspended from service on August 22, 2017, following the death of about 60 infants in the BRD Medical College hospital due to lack of oxygen. During the court proceedings, additional advocate general Manish Goyal, representing the state government, informed the court on Friday that the said order (dated February 24, 2020) has been withdrawn subject to liberty being reserved for the respondents — the state authorities concerned — to proceed in the matter afresh and in light of what was noted by this court in its order of July 29, 2021. The AAG further submitted that all endeavour shall be made to conclude the disciplinary proceedings within a period of three months. Taking the statement of AAG on record, Justice Yashwant Varma said, “That only leaves the court to consider the justification for continuing the suspension of the petitioner, which was made pursuant to an order passed on August 22, 2017 by the state government.” Having made the submission, the AAG requested the court to enable him to obtain requisite instructions in this respect. Hence, the court directed to list this petition on August 10, 2021 for the next hearing. In the present writ petition, by which Dr Kafeel has challenged his suspension and further enquiry, he has disclosed that initially the proceedings were drawn against nine persons. “Seven out of those who were suspended along with the petitioner have since been reinstated pending conclusion of disciplinary proceedings,” Dr Kafeel added. In the present writ petition, the petitioner Dr Kafeel has challenged an order of suspension dated August 22, 2017. An additional challenge has also been made to an order of February 24, 2020 passed by the disciplinary authority, which has while accepting the report submitted by the enquiry officer in part, dissented with the findings returned by the enquiry officer in respect of two charges and directed a further enquiry to be conducted. Earlier, the enquiry officer had submitted his report on April 15, 2019. Thereafter, the disciplinary authority chose to pass the order for further enquiry on February 24, 2020, almost after 11 months which is also under challenge. In its order dated July 29, 2021, the court while taking note of this, had observed, “The delay in taking further action on the part of the disciplinary authority is not explained. The respondents are also obliged to justify the continuance of the order of suspension which has continued for more than four years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/state-govt-withdraws-furtherenquiry-against-dr-kafeel/articleshow/85139000.cms||---
---||Kochi||Co-op bank fraud: ED registers case in connection with Kerala's Karuvannur bank||KOCHI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) in connection with the Karuvannur bank fraud case against the six accused under various sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The agency registered the case after a preliminary enquiry into the incident based on the police FIR. The report has been filed against six office bearers of the governing body of the bank in Thrissur, who have been named as accused in the police case as well. Police had booked the six accused in connection with the case, including secretary of the bank T R Sunilkumar, manager Biju Kareem, accountant C K Jilse, commission agent Bejoy, Kiran and Reji Anilkumar. All the accused in the case have connections with CPM. Sources said ED registered the case after finding it was appropriate to invoke PMLA by considering the sections invoked by the police as a predicate offence. The agency would soon start issuing summons to the accused persons for a detailed interrogation. Sources said ED officials have already visited the bank and collected details. ED has also collected primary evidence and prepared a list of witnesses. The bank, according to preliminary estimates, had incurred a loss of over Rs 100 crore in the scam. As per official estimates, the fund involved in the manipulation can go well over Rs 300 crore. Sources said even as the Thrissur district comes under the ED’s Kozhikode unit, the probe will be conducted under the direct supervision of ED joint director in Kochi. The fraud had rocked the state especially due to the delay in arresting the accused by the police even as the accused sought anticipatory bail. Opposition parties had alleged the CPM links of the accused to be the reason for the delay in their arrest. The case involves fund misappropriation by sanctioning loans pledging documents of individuals without their consent. It has also been revealed that several loans worth crores were taken under the name of various people and transferred to the account of one among the accused. Bank staffers, including the secretary, were earlier suspended after a police case was registered against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/co-op-bank-fraud-ed-registers-case/articleshow/85137590.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC dismisses Raj Kundra’s plea challenging legality of arrest||MUMBAI: Finding no substance in their contention that they could not have deleted chats from cell phones in the presence of 22 policemen present for a search, the Bombay high court on Saturday dismissed two petitions, one filed by Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra and the other by co-accused Ryan Thorpe, challenging the legality of their arrests and remand. Police had arrested Kundra and Thorpe on July 19 in a February 2021 case of alleged “production and streaming of pornographic content” via two apps. Justice Ajay Gadkari said their arrest and remand orders by the Esplanade court additional chief metropolitan magistrate S B Bhajipale were lawful. The HC said police had recorded satisfaction that arrest was necessitated and the magistrate had perused the case diary and expressed his satisfaction that custodial interrogation was needed. The magistrate’s order may not be elaborate, to the duo’s expectation, but the HC said it meets with the legal mandate. The duo said mandatory provisions regarding arrest were flouted by police, and since arrest was “illegal,” the magistrate could not have remanded them in police or judicial custody. Public prosecutor Aruna Pai said the duo started deleting chats when a police team landed at Kundra’s office on July 19 to search the premises, hence destroying evidence, some of which, she said, was retrieved later. “Other data is being retrieved,” she said. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda with advocate Hitesh Jain, appearing for Kundra, had questioned the police claim, saying neither was the deletion aspect mentioned in a panchanama nor in the first two remand applications. Besides, why would the police issue them a Section 41 A (1) notice “after” any such act of causing disappearance of evidence, they said. For Thorpe, counsel Abhinav Chandrachud and Subhash Jadhav argued police were required to give reasons for arrest, and they also refuted allegations of destruction of evidence on the day of arrest. Ponda argued there was a violation of mandatory provisions under the criminal law regarding arrest and a two weeks’ notice as directed by Supreme Court in 2014. He had argued that since the crime attracted up to 7 years’ imprisonment, under Section 41A (1) a notice to seek Kundra’s appearance and explanation was mandated since an arrest leads to loss of reputation and anxiety. The prosecution denied any such violation. It said such notice was issued to both and while Thorpe accepted it, Kundra had refused. The police affidavit said the two started deleting WhatsApp group and chats and to prevent them from further destruction of evidence, they were taken to the police station and arrested later that night. The HC said it is clear that when arrested, their phones were with them. The HC said an affidavit on oath “has its own significance.” Kundra’s refusal to accept notice “clearly implies” he did not want to participate and cooperate in the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-dismisses-kundras-plea-challenging-legality-of-arrest/articleshow/85139539.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Allahabad||Ganga, Yamuna inching towards danger mark||Prayagraj: With the water level in both Ganga and Yamuna is fast approaching the danger mark (84.73 metres), the flood situation is getting grimmer in the Sangam city and adjoining rural areas. District administration is on high alert and people living in low-laying areas of the city are shifting to safer places. Those who are not willing to leave their homes have shifted to the upper floors of their houses as the water has flooded several localities. The water level of Ganga, as recorded at 4 pm on Saturday in Phaphamau, was 84.03 metres, and in Chhatnag, it was 83.30 metres. Likewise, water level Yamuna, as recorded at the same time in Naini, was 83.88 metres. The two rivers continue to increase at all three points at a pace of around 10-11cm (since the last four hours). As per the irrigation department, it may touch the danger level by Sunday (August 8) noon. Flood water has entered into several localities such as Ganga Nagar, Nevada, Ashok Nagar, Beli Gaon, parts of Rajapur, Salori, Bada and Chota Baghara, Badra, Sanauti, Daraganj and Nagvasuki. With continuous rise of Yamuna, flood water has reached Baradari along the banks of the river at Baluaghat. Locals fear that if flood water increases further, it would flood the entire Baluaghat locality. Locals had faced similar conditions in 2019, but the flood water had receded after reaching the danger level. Several students, who reside in rented accommodations and had recently returned from their villages after the decrease in Covid cases, have evacuated the rooms and have started returning to their native places. “We are afraid that if the flood water, as been warned by the authorities, increases further, the flood water could enter our locality through the drain,” said Abbas Ali, a resident of Dariyabad. Sadaiapur, Karelabagh, Kareli, Ghausnagar and areas near Sasur Khederi river are on high alert. However, people complained that they were not duly alerted by the administration, and are afraid of flood entering their localities overnight. As several localities are flooded, several flood relief camps are being set up by the administration to provide adequate facilities to the affected people. However, those residing in these camps are complaining of unhygienic conditions and inadequate amenities. Meanwhile, the administration and NDRF are helping locals as well as keeping a strict vigil on the water level. “We are keeping a close watch on the water level, and are prepared to help the locals as and when required,” said executive engineer of irrigation department, Brijesh Kumar Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ganga-yamuna-inching-towards-danger-mark/articleshow/85140639.cms||---

Pillai, the former state president of BJP, disclosed this during his speech while inaugurating the condolence meeting titled ‘Smrithy Sukrutham’ to pay tribute to late Catholicos Baselios Marthoma Paulose II. Continuing on the topic, Pillai said that officers should maintain a broad outlook. He also said that his office had received an official letter, and it was written that it was inappropriate to take part in the meeting in Devalokam. “Usually, it is the governor’s office that replies to such letters. But in this case, I myself dictated the reply letter which was sent,” he said, adding that the reply he gave was that he will take part in the meeting at the church headquarters. Later speaking to TOI, Pillai said that he does not want to make a controversy out of it, and the governor’s office has no complaints about the incident. When contacted, Kottayam district police chief D Shilpa said that she had only informed the governor’s office that the area where the meeting was scheduled falls in a micro-containment zone.  “When the region was removed from the containment zone and restrictions were lifted on Thursday evening by the district collector, I had informed that also to the governor’s office,” said Shilpa. “As the SP of the district, it is my duty to keep the office of the VVIP informed, and I have done my duty. We had also got a reply from his office that they will be following the Covid protocol,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/controversy-erupts-after-goa-guv-asked-not-to-participate-in-kerala-church-event/articleshow/85139519.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Long closure dents Rajpath Club’s income by 38%||AHMEDABAD: Longer periods of closure coupled with slowdown in the events industry doesn’t just reflect in the balance sheets of hotels and banquets across Ahmedabad but also that of clubs. Ahmedabad-based Rajpath Club reported 38% reduction in its total income in the pandemic year i.e. 2020-21.According to the club’s annual report, the club’s income stood at Rs 21.8 crore in 2020-21, against Rs 35.23 crore in 2019-20. Rampant restrictions on holding events, cap imposed on the number of persons allowed at social gatherings, weddings,dampened sentiments causing fewer events to take place. This was a significant source of income for the clubs, which dried up significantly due to the pandemic and related restrictions. “Amid several restrictions imposed on events due to the pandemic, barely a few events and weddings were organised at the club. The income through venue rentals at the club and decorators, dried up,”said Mishal Patel, honourary secretary, Rajpath Club. Sources confirmed that income from events and weddings comes to at least Rs 2 crore for the club. Rajpath Club currently has some 14,000 members. Club management members also attributed the decline in income top ending dues as well as reduced footfalls of members. “Income pours in as members utilize various facilities and amenities at the club. However, with rampant restrictions on disallowing certain services, timing restrictions and even apprehensions among members, the overall utilization of various amenities remained low,” Patel added. Meanwhile, sources also said that pending dues from members are yet to be cleared which also impacted the club’s income. While the income reduced, the club’s expenditures too reduced due to the long-period closure. The annual report states that the total expenditure of Rajpath Club declined from Rs 29.1 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 19.45 crore in 2020-21 – down 33%. Not a single form submitted for upcoming polls in club  Ahmedabad: Even as the deadline for submitting nominations for candidature at the upcoming polls of Rajpath Club ends on August 10, not a single form has been submitted as yet. The club located at SG Highway, is set to go to polls from August 21 to 23. According to sources in the club management, this year, the club’s polls will be held via online voting. “So far we have not received a single form for nomination. If nobody submits a nomination, then there will obviously be no elections. It’s still three more days to the submission deadline and we will see what works best,” said a senior member of Rajpath Club management. The annual general meeting of the club will be held on August 26 through video conferencing, when the results of the elections will be announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/long-closure-dents-rajpath-clubs-income-by-38/articleshow/85139689.cms||Niyati Parikh

Currently its pumps can send water only up to the 12th floor of a building, after which another pump is placed in case the fire is on a higher floor. The pump with a 10,000 litres capacity tank can send up 300 litres of water per minute. But officials said looking at new challenges facing the fire brigade, they are looking at new ways to tackle complicated fires. A senior fire brigade official said that they are inspecting the vehicle which they have got customized. A proposal to purchase it was passed by the civic standing committee around six months back. The pump for the new vehicle is being imported from France, while the equipment will be customized in the state. “While we expect highrises to have their own fire-fighting mechanisms, in case the mechanism is not functional when needed, the fire brigade needs to have such high-pressure pumps which can send up water during a blaze to the maximum height,” said the official, adding that the pump can be used even to spray water in case of a blaze in a slum pocket. Officials said currently pumps which can send up water up to 12 storeys high can make fires in higher floors very complicated operation, as another pump is required. The tallest ladder is 90 metres high and was commissioned in August 2015. It can reach up to 30 storeys of a highrise and was procured from a Finish company at a cost of Rs 16 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fire-brigade-to-soon-get-rs-2-2cr-vehicle-with-50-storey-pump/articleshow/85139622.cms||Richa Pinto

The trouble started after the local police raided the house of Hannan Hossain, an accused in a 2019 case, who had refused to surrender when the police went to his house to arrest him with a court order. The constable, who happens to be Hossain’s nephew, allegedly dropped his lungi after being chased by the local cops and ran naked, asking villagers to video record how a policeman was being harassed. “Hossain was accused in a 2019 case lodged at the Jibantala police station. Police went there to arrest him after he refused to respond to several court summons,” said Baruipur police superintendent Vaibhav Tiwari. Four police personnel led by sub-inspector Somnath Das raided Hossain’s house at Benebou. Hossain fled from the house as police reached there. As police kept searching for him, villagers, mostly women, attacked them. They were led by a police constable Saraf Ali, who is attached with Ashok Nagar police station. SI Somnath Das and constable Sunu Pandey were badly injured. A reinforcement reached the spot and arrested four persons, including Hossain, Ali and a woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/villagers-constable-attack-cops/articleshow/85137636.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala State Electricity Board prepares SOP for dam desilting work||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Close on the heels of the state irrigation department starting desilting work of Mangalam dam in Palakkad, Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) too has decided to carry out desilting of reservoirs manned by the board. As part of the move, KSEB has readied a standard operating procedure (SOP) to be followed by the board for carrying out desilting work. More than the proceedings from the sale of sand and sediment being scooped out from the bed of the reservoir, desilting would help reservoirs regain their original storage capacity. According to sources close to the developments in the board, KSEB would soon start desilting work in small and medium size dams. KSEB has prepared the SOP based on the one stitched together by the irrigation department some time ago. However, the board customized it with additions and omissions relevant to the board. KSEB would seek technical assistance for desilting work from various state and central government agencies as well as IIT Palakkad and NIT Kozhikode. According to the SPO, based on the volume of sediments to be removed from the dams, duration of desilting work would take 36 to 48 months. Instead of the dam safety authority as in the case of dams under the irrigation department, the desilting work in reservoirs under KSEB would be monitored by the board itself. In the light of the experience that irrigation department has come across from the Mangalam dam desilting work, KSEB has dumped one of the conditions incorporated in the irrigation department’s SOP that no stalking/processing of desilted materials shall be allowed in the reservoir/project area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kseb-prepares-sop-for-dam-desilting-work/articleshow/85137618.cms||B S Anilkumar

The yatra will culminate in Agra on October 10 after traversing through 11 districts of western Uttar Pradesh of Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Aligarh, Mathura, Bulandshahr, Meerut, among others, where RLD has a strong presence. Its six-point demands aim at raking up issues like Hathras gangrape and April 2 violence. Routed completely in Lok Sabha polls of 2014 and 2019 and last assembly polls in 2017, RLD, rejuvenated after clinching victory in the recently held heavily contested zila panchayat president post of Baghpat, now looks forward to recovering the lost ground in next year’s election. RLD national president Jayant Chaudhary said, "Life has become difficult for Dalits in the state. If they raise any issue pertaining to their persecution, false cases are slapped against them. There are several cases like Hathras gangrape, but there is no one to raise their issues. We are going to take up these issues now." Speaking to TOI, Sunil Rohta, state spokesperson for RLD, said, "We are going to stay in one district for at least two days and visit around 5-6 villages. Our entire focus will be Dalits and their oppression. If need be we have plans to also conduct follow-up of cases with police stations where Dalits have been booked. Even now, three years after the April 2 violence there are several Dalits languishing in jails. This is gross injustice meted out to them. We will take up their cases." During the 2018 ‘Bharat bandh’ called due to dilution of scheduled caste and scheduled tribes protection act, nine persons had died when the stir turned violent, particularly in MP, UP and Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/with-an-eye-on-dalit-vote-rld-begins-its-nyay-yatra/articleshow/85135783.cms||Sandeep Rai

NCP condemned the introduction of the Bill and said that the government’s promise to regularise unauthorised structures is a move to create a land bank ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. “There are so many cases under the Mundkar Act which are pending. The government cannot resolve them, so what is the need to introduce the Goa Bhumiputra Adikarni Bill, 2021, which will only increase litigation and cases,” said NCP state president Jose Philip D’Souza. D’Souza said that the government should first resolve the mundkar cases. “We are against this bill and condemn this step by the government. When mundkar cases are pending, why has the government got another headache on the people again,” said D’Souza. He said that removing the word ‘Bhumiputra’ from the bill will not change the intention behind the legislation. “BJP government has a habit of taking all the major decisions at night. The Goa government is not ready to give assistance to Goans who have come down from working abroad but is concerned about outsiders settling in Goa for vote bank politics,” the NCP chief said. He said that the promise to regularise illegal structures and create government jobs in the state ahead of the elections is akin to dangling a carrot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ncp-labels-bhumiputra-bill-as-election-ploy/articleshow/85139597.cms||---

Panch member Remy Fernandes, a fisherman himself, told TOI that the canoe was returning to shore when the wave hit the boat. The outboard motor failed after water gushed into the boat. The fishermen on board jumped into the sea and swam to safety. Other fishermen and the public present at the beach immediately secured the canoe with a rope and held on to it until some others managed to hold on to it. Fernandes said that sea was rough due to high tide and hence manoeuvring the canoes is a little tricky. Another fisherman said they have to risk their lives to earn a living and venture into the sea to catch ‘solar prawns’. Fernandes said that this is not a stray incident as two to three similar cases have been reported along the Mormugao coastal belt. Meanwhile, fishermen netted a sizeable quantity of prawns on Saturday, attracting a large number of public to the beach. Fish traders were also spotted at the beach cajoling fishermen to sell their catch to them. One fisherman instead told the trader that local buyers are a priority. Fishermen were selling 16 medium sized mackerels for Rs 200 and a good quantity of prawns between Rs 200 to Rs 500, and a full basket for Rs 2,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/close-call-for-six-benaulim-fishermen/articleshow/85139631.cms||---

He also laid the foundation stones for some projects in the state. He said all the ongoing projects, worth Rs 5,300 crore, testified to Gujarat’s developmental push even during the pandemic. Through a video link, Shah addressed the attendees of an event held in Gandhinagar to mark the completion of Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani’s five years in office. It is being celebrated as ‘Vikas Divas’. “The inauguration of projects worth Rs 3,322 crore on Saturday and the launch of many projects over the past ten days show that even during the pandemic, Gujarat ensured that development never stopped,” said Shah. The Union home minister said that projects of about Rs 900 crore announced on Saturday were being implemented in his Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency. He said that the country did not let the pace of development slow down during the pandemic that had affected the entire world. “When the wheels of development came to a halt across the world, in India the pace of development continued under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Shah said. “We fought strongly against coronavirus and even won the fight, and at the same time, carried on with developmental works.” Shah praised the leadership of Rupani and deputy chief minister Nitin Patel for ensuring that after Modi became Prime Minister (for the first time in 2014), development in Gujarat continued uninterrupted. Rupani and Patel had been sworn in as chief minister and deputy chief minister on August 7, 2016. They assumed office once more in December 2017 after the BJP won again in the assembly elections. Shah referred to the inauguration of two overbridges connecting Gandhinagar to Ahmedabad, and a water pipeline. He said he was gratified that the works were taken up in his Lok Sabha constituency. The projects inaugurated on Saturday included the work on laying a pipeline at the cost of Rs 1,162 crore under the Sujalam-Sufalam Jal Abhiyan scheme. To ensure water supply through tap connections to every household of Gujarat, work has been undertaken at 1,632 villages of 23 districts at the cost of over Rs 400 crore. “This is not a celebration of the completion of five years of government responsibilities. It is our duty to bring these works of public service to the masses,” CM Rupani said in his address. Nitin Gadkari, the Union minister of road transport and highways, virtually dedicated to the nation a 3.75km four-lane elevated corridor in Deesa town of Banaskantha, jointly with Shah and Rupani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corona-didnt-halt-development-in-gujarat-shah/articleshow/85139679.cms||---

Born three-and-half-months ahead of full term and weighing just 720 grams, the baby girl was detected with Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) with subsequent complications, including heart and kidney dysfunction. The two-month-old girl returned home on Friday weighing 1.5 kilo, on oral feed, minus the tubes and other probes. “The baby had breathing distress and was put on respiratory support and intra venous nutrition from Day 1. On Day 5, an echocardiography revealed a connection between the two main tubes coming out of the heart, medically named PDA. Generally, the tubes close by themselves in the first few days of birth, but in premature babies, spontaneous closure is minimal,” said Sumita Saha, neonatologist at Fortis Hospitals, Anandapur. Saha and her team tried to close the tube through medication, but failed. That is when Fortis team roped in doctors from Narayana Superspecialty Hospital (NSH) Howrah. The baby was shifted to the Howrah unit on ventilation on June 30 where paediatric cardiologists Dhritabrata Das of Fortis and Amitabha Chattopadhyay of NSH closed the PDA using a device called Piccolo instead of an open surgery. The baby suffered lung collapse and was put on high ventilator and medication for falling blood pressure. She was brought back to Fortis for post-operative care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/two-hosps-join-hands-to-save-premature-baby/articleshow/85137690.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

He donned the uniform and began “checking” passengers on board the Punjab-bound Howrah-Amritsar Punjab Mail train and pocketing the fine. But his stint as TTE was short-lived. When the train pulled into Bijnor's Najibabad station, he was arrested. The uniform belonged to TTE Jaswant Singh, who had immediately filed a report after detecting his loss. The stolen challan book and other documents were seized from Govind Singh, a resident of Shahjahanpur. Investigations revealed that he loves to impersonate government officials and dupe people. Najibabad's GRP station in charge Sarvez Khan said, “The fake TTE was extorting money from passengers travelling without ticket on the pretext of checking. We arrested him following a tip-off. He has confessed to stealing the hand bag and extorting money from passengers.” A case was registered against Govind under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 170 (personating a public servant) and 380 (theft in building or vessel) at the GRP station based on a complaint lodged by TTE Jaswant Singh, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-steals-uniform-plays-tte-arrested/articleshow/85135813.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Kolkata||Fuel tanker strike called off after morning pain at filling stations||KOLKATA: The strike called by fuel tankers at Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Mourigram depot, was withdrawn on Saturday afternoon following the decision of IOC to put on hold the new transportation rates after reports kept pouring in that a number of filling stations in south Bengal were running dry. However, the withdrawal was preceded by a frantic spree of panic buying at the fuel stations. Almost all the petrol pumps saw long queues of cars, two-wheelers and cabs. Maria Arshad, who lives near Theatre Road, said, “We are already hassled by the record price rise, now tanker strike spells doom for us. I did not take a chance and came here to refill my car,” said Arshad at the petrol pump on JL Nehru Road. An IOC spokesperson confirmed that the strike was withdrawn but did not divulge the details of the deal struck with the fuel transporters. Earlier, IOC tried to bridge the demand-supply gap by supplying fuel from Budge Budge, Halida and Durgapur depots. “A lot of stations in Howrah, Hooghly and northern suburbs went dry because of the supply constraints,” said Snehasish Bhowmik, vice president, West Bengal Petroleum Dealers’ Association. Ajit Das, general secretary of West Bengal Tankers Association claimed that hundreds of fuel pumps in south Bengal, including Kolkata, ran dry due to the strike in protest against reduction in fuel transportation rates and termination of services of nearly 70 tankers from the list of 196 which transport fuel from the depot to retail outlets. “IOC extended the existing rates so that more negotiations can take place and normal supply can be maintained,” said Das. After Friday’s negotiation failed, IOC was planning to rush fuel from its Haldia and other depots to meet demand in Kolkata, South 24 Parganas, Nadia, Howrah, Hooghly and North 24 Parganas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fuel-tanker-strike-called-off-after-morning-pain-at-filling-stations/articleshow/85137786.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

In the past few days, more than 300 bikers have been slapped with a fine of Rs 10,000 each for using modified silencers in two districts alone. According to section 190(2) of the amended Motor Vehicle Act, which came into effect from October 2021, causing air and noise pollution can now attract a fine of up to ₹10,000 instead of ₹1,000 earlier under the old Act (1988).Besides Muzaffarnagar, the checks are being conducted in Shamli, Saharanpur, Bijnor, Meerut, Ghaziabad districts among others. Earlier, the two-judge HC Bench in its order had observed that noise pollution had particularly increased because of the new generation of sports bikes. The owners modify their motorcycles by removing mufflers. Due to this, the motorcycle can be heard from hundreds of meters away, the Bench add In Muzaffarnagar, police have engaged two-wheeler showroom sales executives-cum-engineers to verify if modified silencers are being used as policemen have often got into spats with bikers, who deny using any modified devices. Abhishek Yadav, senior superintendent of police, Muzaffarnagar, said, “During checking, if someone denies installing a modified device, but one is found, a company expert is called to examine the machine. It is only after the expert’s opinion that action is taken.” In Muzaffarnagar, 45 bikers have been fined so far. Ramanand Kushwaha, SP, traffic, Ghaziabad, said, “We have imposed a fine on 264 bikers over the past three days and also conducted a meeting with the bike showroom owners, advising them to make customers understand not to make any modifications after purchasing the bikes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/drive-against-noise-pollution-bikers-using-modified-silencers-in-vehicle-fined-rs-10k-each-in-up/articleshow/85135844.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Registrations for management & architecture CETs shrink||PUNE: Not just engineering, even registration for common entrance tests (CETs) for admission to hotel management, architecture and MBA courses has dipped in the state this year compared with 2020. Fewer employment avenues despite high fees for these courses is the main reason for the declining numbers, say education experts. However, just like engineering courses where the response was higher for computer and IT-related branches, that for MCA CET increased by around 2,000 registrations too. Anita Moodliar, principal, Maharashtra State Institute of Hotel Management and Catering, said the pandemic has affected admissions as well as placements. “To add to the woes, closing down of restaurants was also making parents wary about the course. Last year, due to the lockdown, even students who were given offer letters were asked not to join or were kept on hold. This year, though, with everything opening up, the placement scenario is looking up, at least by 20% compared with last year when it was almost reduced to zero. We are also getting enquiries from parents about various courses. Secondly, TV shows about food and passion for opening their own restaurant or cafe also encourages students to take up the course.” Parag Kalkar, dean, faculty of commerce and management at Savitribai Phule Pune University, said students are unsure about what to do and many are also opting for gap years and are taking up online certificate courses in the meantime. “The annual fee for the MBA course runs into lakhs of rupees. Why would a student want to pay so much money for some online classes? Secondly, the pandemic has affected the market. Almost all households have been affected by the pandemic due to salary cuts and loss of jobs. So, parents also don’t want to spend too much on a course that may not give an equal return on investment. Therefore, students are considering taking a gap year and seeing how the scenario will transform in the next year, thereby reducing the registration or even admissions,” said Kalkar. S S Mantha, former chairman of All India Council for Technical Education, said said primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of employment are down, which also affects students. “Brick-and-mortar investments are giving way to investments in IT infrastructure. Institutions are not willing to make the transition. A lack of interest results in a deficit of quality.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-registrations-for-mgmt-architecture-cets-shrink/articleshow/85139778.cms||Ardhra Nair

Pankaj’s family in response to the PCO call from the district jail on Thursday assured him that the money would be sent. He has been in jail since July 25 for an “attempt to murder”. Dismissing Pankaj’s allegations, jail authorities claimed he had placed a demand of Rs 15,000 for “personal expenses”. An alleged case of death for failure to pay “protection money” was reported from Tihar Jail recently. Gangster Ankit Gujjar, accused in the 2014 murder of Vijay Dahiya, a BJP member, was found dead inside the prison on August 4. On July 24, a dispute broke out between two groups over harvesting of a field in village Jheel ka Pura under Saiyan police station of Agra district. The two groups opened fire at each other. Later, an FIR was registered against a dozen men. On July 25, eight accused were arrested and sent to jail. Two of them, Pankaj and Deendayal, are presently lodged in the district jail. On Thursday afternoon, Pankaj called up his family members from the PCO in the district jail and sought the money allegedly for protection inside the prison. Superintendent of Agra district jail, PD Salonia, said, “The prisoner had called his family from the PCO in district jail. The prisoner claimed that he required money for his personal requirements. He wanted to purchase foodstuff, toiletries etc from the jail canteen. He has denied having been beaten in jail. No complaint has been received from the family of the prisoner. However, we are investigating the entire matter. Deputy jailor and the jail staff have been asked to provide a written response to the allegations. Suitable action will be taken on the basis of the investigation.” On June 29, a 25-year-old undertrial allegedly ended life by handing himself in Agra district jail. The jail administration had claimed that the gangrape accused had hanged himself with a stole (dupatta) from a locked gate on the jail premises. However, his family members had claimed that his body had several injury marks and alleged that he was murdered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/prisoner-calls-from-jail-asks-kin-to-send-rs-15k-as-protection-money-says-being-beaten-in-prison/articleshow/85135877.cms||---

Excerpts from the documentary, ‘Tiger of the Snows’, where Norgay spoke about his struggles and success, will be screened to commemorate Doordarshan Kendra Kolkata’s 47th foundation day on August 9. This apart, the officials have also retrieved the recordings of Amala Shankar’s dance drama, ‘Samanya Kshati’, and a conversation between actor Rabi Ghosh and director Hrishikesh Mukherjee. Assistant director (programmes) of Kolkata Doordarshan Kendra Arunava Roy said these tapes were recovered during the pandemic when live programmes were fewer. “ We realized these tapes had been misplaced. Fortunately, we located and digitized them. It was additional director general of east zone Sudhangsu Ranjan’s idea to use excerpts from those for the foundation day celebration,” he added. The Norgay document was directed by Biswanath Das, who was then the programme executive for the production of sports events at Doordarshan Kendra Kolkata. Later, he served as its director from 2000 to 2002. This programme was part of a series of biographical documentaries on sport stars, titled ‘Zoom-In’. Das had gone to Darjeeling to shoot the Norgay documentary in the early ’80s. “I directed the interviewer to ask Tenzing questions while being hidden behind the camera. I wanted Tenzing to speak directly to the lens to give it a feel of a first-person account. Doordarshan’s archival section should have taken more care in preserving these rare programmes. I am happy this documentary has been found,” said Das. Amala Shankar’s ‘Samanya Kshati’ is an equally rare gem. Her elder grandson, Ratul, said Jawaharlal Nehru had asked Uday Shankar to choreograph a dance drama for Tagore’s centenary in 1961. “My dida had revived this production during Uday Utsav, organized by Robi dadu (Pt Ravi Shankar). This was later recorded in the mid ’80s for Doordarshan. Robi dadu scored the music. Ustad Alla Rakha, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma performed for the score. I didn’t know the tape was missing but it’s great it’s found,” he said. Excerpts from these programmes, along with clips from old shows, ‘Kothay O Sure’, ‘Nababarsher Baithak’, ‘Chhuti Chhuti’, ‘Close Up’ and ‘Mahalaya’, will be telecast on Monday as part of a special feature, ‘Naba Naba Rupe’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doordarshan-to-beam-lost-found-tapes-of-norgay-amala-shankar-on-foundation-day/articleshow/85137834.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Mohd Waris, a student of BA history, said this government is known to change the name of cities and places with political motives but this time, they have done a fabulous job by rechristening the sport award in the name of the hockey hero. Former student leader Aamir Mintoe said, “It's a proud moment for all AMU students and residents of Aligarh.” He suggested that names of all politicians should be removed from sports institutions and they should be rechristened after great Indian sportsmen.

---||Mumbai||02CM- Malabar Hill Tree Top Walk Danto||Mumbai: The BMC last week floated tenders for constructing a treetop walkway at Malabar Hill that will offer unhindered views of the Arabian Sea and a walk over the green cover of the hills. The project, called the ‘Malabar Hill Forest Trail’, is expected to take around six months to complete and will cost around Rs 12 crore. Activists have, however, raised a flag over the possible damage to the green cover due to the project. The plan cleared by the BMC for the elevated walkway is similar to Singapore’s treetop walks. Mumbai has several skywalks, but the elevated treetop walks for pedestrians at Malabar Hill will be the first-of-its-kind in the city. “The length of the walkway will be 705 metres and it will be 1.5 metres above ground level. The deck will be 2.4 metres wide and there will be a seating arrangement at every 150 metres. There will also be a glass bottom viewing deck. The main structure will be made of steel, while the deck will be wooden and there will be some civil works too,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (Projects). BMC officials said there will be decorative lighting and CCTV cameras all along the walkway, and there are plans to rope in tree experts and arrange for guided walks for students. Officials said the portion over the Storm Water Drain (SWD) outfall will become the viewing deck. The elevated treetop walk can be accessed from the existing Siri Road that connects Marine Drive to Malabar Hill. Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray has held meetings with senior BMC officials regarding the project. “The Siri Road area is visited by thousands of morning walkers and tourists. We have planned the construction in a way so that not a single tree is damaged. People will be able to walk through the greens and enjoy stunning views of the Marine Drive. This will benefit locals and tourists alike. We are also converting the SWD outfall at Walkeshwar-Girgaon Chowpatty intersection into a viewing deck,” Aaditya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/02cm-malabar-hill-tree-top-walk-danto/articleshow/85139868.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Overflowing drains resulted in water entering houses and shops. People sought help from the civic body but no action was taken. But all this has changed now as chief minister Yogi Adityanath and BJP national president JP Nadda are scheduled to visit Agra city on Sunday. Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) is working on a war footing to prevent CM’s convoy from getting stuck anywhere due to waterlogging or rain. Besides cleaning of drains, 10 motors have been placed at different locations to pump out water from roads. A super sucker machine has been deployed on the airport road to empty sewer tanks. As per the scheduled programme, Yogi will be landing at Kheria air base at 10:45 am. He will travel around 13 km from the airport to Hotel Amar Vilas. The Agra Municipal Corporation has made arrangements to ensure that there is no waterlogging to hamper the CM’s convoy if it rains at five major spots on the route. Civic body officials on Saturday inspected the route to be taken by the CM to ensure smooth movement of the CM’s convoy. A civic body official said, “As there is possibility of rainfall on Sunday, special arrangements have been made on the VIP route. 10 pumping machines have been placed on the route to control water. Besides, a super sucker machine has been deployed. All the nonfunctional street lights have been repaired. The PWD is filling up the potholes. Encroachments have been removed from the VIP route.” CM Yogi and Nadda will be in Agra on Sunday to hold a meeting with MPs, MLAs and party officer-bearers. CM will also chair a meeting with district administration officials, senior doctors and Covid warriors to discuss strategy to be adopted for the third wave of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amc-pulls-out-all-stops-to-ensure-rain-waterlogging-do-not-hamper-cms-convoy/articleshow/85135991.cms||Deepak Lavania

The party’s office bearers claimed that the state government handled Covid situation well and managed everything on time. The work done by the UP government in Covid management had been appreciated by the prime minister earlier. However, the opposition has been accusing the BJP-led government of mismanagement during the second wave of pandemic when a large number of people, including teachers who were on election duties, succumbed to the disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/nadda-to-hold-meetings-with-office-bearers-mlas-covid-warriors-ahead-of-2022-polls/articleshow/85136020.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Nagpur||How Amravati Sailed The Covid Delta Wave||Amravati district was where Delta cases first emerged in the country, triggering the devastating second wave. Strengthening of the healthcare system, exemplary dedication of the medical and paramedical staff and selfless service by the administration in the hour of crisis brought the challenging situation under controlBhaurao ji Bhadaji Punase, aged 94, and Indubai, his wife, aged 89, were admitted to the district Covid hospital in Amravati. Both of them swirled between life and death but to everyone’s surprise, aaji and aajoba were discharged healthy from the hospital after 20 days. Another case of young Nikita, aged 22, who got infected with Covid in her late pregnancy, is noteworthy. She delivered a healthy baby girl through C-section despite the anxieties and uncertainties about the treatment. There are many such positive stories of optimism and commitment of the public sector personnel that showed the resilience and spirit of the employees who were a part of daily fight against the pandemic but these stories remained untold. I, being the head of the district disaster management team, have been closely observing and managing the situation on the ground for the last one year and have a positive side to offer.PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR RESILIENCEOn March 22, 2020, the nationwide lockdown was imposed to contain the spread of Covid. Our health and administrative staff were not at all prepared or oriented to tackle the virological disaster of this magnitude. There were many unanswered questions in the minds of medical staff — what is the behaviour of the virus, how to control it, how to treat it?The first case in the district was reported in April 2020. Though the medical staff were all in panic and fear due to the risk associated, it was only the government hospital that took the lead to care for the affected patients. Despite there being an order by the government, initially, no private hospital showed any interest in the treatment of Covid patients. Even today, considering the cost involved in the treatment, a majority of the population still depends upon the government health facility for its treatment. PERCEPTION OF THE IVORY TOWER ADMINISTRATIONFor most people, the perception is that ‘the civil servant is not reachable’. Once the lockdown was announced in March, to facilitate and ease the hardship of the people who were stuck at different places, the government shared district magistrates’ contact details — personal, official and landline. I personally attended 400 calls every day from people across the district, attending to their problems. My daughter once drew a family picture where I was shown holding a phone on my one ear and doing work from the other. The scenes of people moving to their hometown on foot and private buses caught the eye of many. But believe it or not, it was only a fraction of the population. It was due to the Herculean and planned efforts of the grassroot administrative staff that enabled more than 24,000 people to reach their home safely and timely. This untiring and coordinated efforts made by the administration was hailed by the migrants themselves, chants of ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ and ‘thank you, sahib’ while boarding the train gave goosebumps to onlookers. INVOLVEMENT OF CIVIC SOCIETY The appeal made by the administration to the Good Samaritans evoked the best response. Around 21 organized groups and a large number of self-motivated individuals came forward, providing more than 15 lakh food packets to the neediest with support from the administration. Rather than going for a coercive measure for starting or converting a medical facility for Covid treatment, counselling and facilitation of the doctors was done. An innovative trend of doctors taking up marriage halls and hotels and converting them into the hospital came up. The number of beds in the district almost doubled with 50 percent coming up in the private sector which mobilized the untapped and unutilized resources in the hour of the unprecedented natural calamity.THE DELTA VARIANTThe lull after the first wave gave breathing time to the administration for preparation, unlike what has been portrayed as complacency. Amravati district was the first to witness the storm post the first wave and caught the eye of national and international health professionals during the surge that started in February 2021. Amravati district had seen a peak of 7,713 in September 2020 and in May 2021, there was a four-fold increase in the number of cases (27,000). Though the exact number of deaths increased from 142 to 300, the CFR decreased from 2.2 to 1.4. While the oxygen beds were increased two-fold to 1,189, the number of ICU beds were trebled from 280 to 750 and total ventilator supported beds were doubled from 180 to 400. Health care facilities at tehsil level were strengthened with 20 bedded oxygen supported beds made available at every tehsil. At every sub district hospital, a dedicated ICU and ventilator-supported bed were provided. The move reflected swift movement and decision-making to keep pace with the increasing severity of Covid and preparation of the health infrastructure in record time.Besides this, the ‘Oxygen team’ was formed at the state and district level. On May 12, the dean of medical college made a panic call late at night, informing that oxygen was running out of stock which could endanger the lives of 30 patients which was handled in a record two hours by the team and averted a tragedy. A more scary incident happened on May 25 when the main oxygen generation plant, on which depended the supply of the entire Amaravati district, broke down. I called upon the nearby districts and the state oxygen team which helped in immediate movement of oxygen to ensure a smooth supply.When we talk about unpreparedness, the economist in me ponders upon these questions: Are we a resource surplus country? Do we have the luxury to plan and forecast and provide our resources for a situation which may or may not occur? Our competing demands for various needs with the given budget does it give us enough liberty? The containment of the second wave, despite the origin of the Delta variant from the district, the strengthening of the health care system, the exemplary dedication of the medical and paramedical staff, the selfless and responsive service put in the hour of crises by the administration team made me wonder whether the government system has failed or was it just overburdened?.(Nawal is ex-collector of Amravati district and now deputy secretary)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/how-amravati-sailed-the-covid-delta-wave/articleshow/85134415.cms||---

At a meeting held on July 29, it was decided to begin work to build a multidisciplinary art centre for national and international cultural activities on a three-bigha plot in Mukundapur that was given to the foundation by the state government on lease. The demise of poet Shankha Ghosh, who was the chairman of the foundation, has also necessitated a reconstitution of its board. While artist Jogen Chowdhury is the new chairman of the foundation, author Prabal Kumar Basu and anthropologist Shyamal Chakrabarty will function as vice-chairmen. Mathematician Mihir Chakraborty will be the general secretary. Former principal of the Government College Of Art And Crafts Dipali Bhattacharya, now a managing trustee, said KIFLAC was formed in 2003. Author Sunil Gangopadhyay was its first chairman with poet Shankha Ghosh and painter Ganesh Haloi as vice-chairmen. While Jogen Choudhury was the managing trustee, Basu was the settlor and secretary of the trust. “We wanted to build an apolitical platform which would encourage freedom of expression,” she said. For various reasons, the construction work of the building didn’t begin for almost 18 years. The plans for the centre were revived again in end-July. “It took some time to get the land and the Planning Commission’s approval for funding,” Basu said. According to Bhattacharya, some 250 paintings and sculptures donated by all major Indian artists including KG Subramanian and Paresh Maity are there with the trust. “Once we have a centre, I would want to give all these away for preservation. We are getting in touch with families of authors in mind for preservation of manuscripts,” Basu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-to-get-art-foundation-work-to-start-by-year-end/articleshow/85137895.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Cops are also searching for the absconding cop’s mother and sister who allegedly was part of the conspiracy. The complainant, a 38-year-old woman and mother of two children, has alleged that the accused Mohammed Ejaz Sheikh had lured her into an affair after sending her a friend request on Facebook in June last year. He had introduced himself as Anil Parmar. The woman told the police that she learnt about Sheikh’s real identity only when they met at a hotel in Sayajigunj and he furnished his identity card. At the hotel, Sheikh allegedly raped her but promised to change his religion before marrying her. Later, the accused even visited the woman at her home. Sheikh also informed the woman’s husband, who was in Dubai, about their relationship, so that he would divorce her. He also then took her to meet his family at Salabatpura area in Surat. The woman further alleged that initially Sheikh’s mother and sister, Sumaiya, were cordial with her. However, after some days, they started applying pressure on her to give up her religion and accept their practices. As they kept mounting pressure, the woman left Sheikh and came back to Vadodara and approached police to register a complaint against Sheikh and his family. Based on the woman’s complaint, an offence of rape, assault and criminal intimidation was registered at city police station on August 5, said inspector P B Vania of City police. Sheikh has been part of SRP since 2013 and is currently posted with SRP group 17 in Jamnagar.

Surendrangar police arrested five of them on Saturday. The police came to know on July 28 that a temple, a protected monument by the state archaeology department, was being excavated illegally and the shrine’s Shiv Linga and statue of Nandi were destroyed. This temple is believed to be 1,100-years-old. However, cops found the task of finding out the accused to be challenging owing to the isolated location of the place as well as lack of eye witness nearby or CCTVs. Cops used human intelligence by activating their network of sources and managed to detain Ramesh Pipaliya, Gordhan Zapadiya, Raju Koladra, Dalsukh Makwana and Mehul Magvaniya from Chotila town. The accused revealed that another accused, Ajit Panchala, dreamt about some hidden treasure beneath the temple and accordingly, 10 of them reached the temple on foot. One of the accused, Jaga Raval, who was carrying some electronic equipment, got excited after it started buzzing near the Shiv Linga. They started to dig at the spot for nearly four hours but found only big stones and no hidden riches. They continued this exercise for four nights but after finding nothing, dropped the project. Cops are hunting for the five other accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/10-treasure-hunters-quest-ends-in-arrests/articleshow/85136151.cms||---

While the number of passengers was 70,747 in June, it touched 1,42,050 in July. Officials claimed that with lockdown easing, domestic tourists have also added to this number, which previously was not the case. According to officials, in the first quarter of the year, the footfall had touched approximately 9,000 passengers which decreased owing to the Covid situation and essentially travellers were those who were probably residents of the state though the situation is changing gradually. In April, the total number of passengers recorded at the airport was 1,66,878 which dipped to 48,304 in May but increased to 70,047 passengers in June. Elaborating further, an airport official added, “Previously people were not travelling by air due to restrictions. But now, vaccinated passengers do not need that because of which they are able to travel comfortably. As tourist places have also opened up for the public, more passengers are coming and going from Jaipur.” At present, there are 36 domestic flights of Air India, Indigo, Spice Jet, Air Asia and Go First, which arrive at the airport, while international flights of four airlines arrive. For departure, there are 35 domestic flights of the same airlines and four international. All these flights operate on multiple days. The city airport has been undergoing various development projects and apart from more departure and arrival halls, luggage conveyor belts were also added. Moreover, the parking situation was bettered with segregation of space for passengers who were boarding and arriving. However from October, the Adani Group will take over the operations of the Jaipur Airport and the observation for the same will start from August 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/footfall-doubles-at-jaipur-airport-in-one-month/articleshow/85137922.cms||---

Though Udaipur has slightly less active cases, it has attracted the attention of chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who told secretary health Siddharth Mahajan on Saturday that despite Udaipur not being as populated as Jaipur, they have almost equal number of active case. Mahajan said not only Udaipur, but entire Udaipur division is important in the fight against Covid as people continuously migrate from Maharashtra and Gujarat and enter from south of Rajasthan. “Cases reported recently in Banswara were from other states. We are closely monitoring the situation in Udaipur division as the second wave had also emerged from there,” said Mahajan. Jaipur has 67 active cases and Udaipur’s active cases are 60, while the state’s active cases are currently 237. In August, no Covid death has been reported, while 147 persons have tested positive for the virus in the past seven days. In July, 33 persons died of Covid out of which 15 deaths happened in Udaipur.

LPAI comes under the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) Sources said the delegation, led by LPAI director Raman Kumar Sharma, was scheduled to visit the ICP on Saturday for an inspection and discuss technical modalities for the possible opening of the cooridor which connects to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan. When contacted, Sharma said, “There was no scheduled meeting with regards to the opening of the Kartapur corridor, but it was a routine visit that was postponed due to our other commitments.” The corridor has been closed since March 16, 2020 to prevent the spread of Covid-19. “The meeting was to be held among officials of various departments, including Border Security Force, customs, and police and civil administration of Gurdaspur; it has not been cancelled, but postponed. On Friday night, we received a mail with regards to the postponement,” said a senior government fucntionary privy to the arrangements of the meeting, but who did not wish to be named. Sources said there had not been any official word with regards to the opening of the Indian side of the corridor so far. As Sikh bodies Akal Takht, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee had been making appeals to the Indian government to open the corridor, the Centre might decide to open the corridor for a few days, if not permanently, said sources. However, the reason could be political, added the sources. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart, Imran Khan, had respectively inaugurated their corresponding side of the corridor on November 9, 2019. On March 16, 2020, both countries temporarily suspended the daylong piligrimage in the wake of Covid-19 and also suspended the registration for Kartarpur Sahib pilgrimage. On October 2, 2020, Pakistan government announced to unilaterally open the pilgrimage, but India did not reciprocate to the gesture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/talk-of-dera-baba-nanak-meeting-raises-hope-for-corridor-opening/articleshow/85137958.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The mega Covid-19 vaccination camp was inaugurated by state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami at Dehradun-based Sant Nirankari Bhawan. State health minister Dhan Singh Rawat and other senior officials of the department were also present during the event. “More than 65.95 lakh people have been administered vaccine doses in the state till date. On Saturday, we vaccinated around 1.75 lakh people till 5 pm. However, the mega vaccination drive continued in the evening as well and according to our estimates, 1.80 lakh people were vaccinated on the day. We aim to cover people in the remotest corner of the state under the vaccination drive,” said Dr Kuldeep Martolia, state immunisation nodal officer, health and family welfare department, Uttarakhand.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan keeps eye on R-naught in other states amid fear of third wave||JAIPUR: Rajasthan is not among the eight states having more than one R factor (reproduction factor), health department officials claimed. In the Covid review meeting headed by chief minister Ashok Gehlot, officials pointed out that Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Karnataka, Puducherry and Kerala are the eight states where the R-naught is above 1. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said the committee of ministers constituted for presenting recommendation on opening of schools should study Covid situation in other states and on the basis of their experience on opening of schools, should take a decision. Experts at the meeting pointed out that if R-naught was increasing in other states, it means that people in the state are also not safe as movement of infected people could become a problem. Dr Raja Babu Panwar, vice chancellor, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences said, “In our state, the R-naught is 0.5, but the all India average is 1.03.” He said that R-naught is calculated on the basis of new cases, deaths, increase in hospitalisation, increase in active cases and recovery rate of a given area at a particular time.Till now, R- factor in our state is good, but all India’s average R-factor is not encouraging. Since, there is no restriction from people from other states to enter Rajasthan, we cannot say we are completely safe. “Recently, Kerala’s 21 nursing students entered Tamil Nadu and they all were Delta positive,” said Panwar. The state is keeping an eye on the R-factor of the other states and decisions taken by different states for opening of the schools. Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College said, “R-factor plays an important role in Covid spread, it indicates infectivity of the virus. If it is 0.6, then it is under control and if it goes up, then there is a risk of spread of the virus. In our country, there are eight states where the R-factor is increasing.” Dr Bhandari said in Jaipur the R-factor is 0.58, but people need to remain careful and they should continue to follow Covid appropriate behaviour. While Raksha Bandhan is approaching, experts appealed to people to remain careful. Dr Virendra Singh said, “We see highest number of movement of people during Raksha Bandhan as brother go to meet sisters or sisters go to visit brothers. If the schools need to be open, we should at least till Raksha Bandhan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-keeps-eye-on-r-naught-in-other-states-amid-fear-of-third-wave/articleshow/85137959.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan gets doses daily in August, but in small numbers||JAIPUR: It seems that the Centre has changed its strategy of supplying Covid-19 vaccine doses as it has been supplying vaccines daily in August but in small quantity which are within 3.5 lakh doses. The daily supply in small quantity of doses has made the job of distribution of vaccines tedious in the state. The health department has to call teams from districts to come and collect vaccine doses from Jaipur and Udaipur on a daily basis. Due to this, the supply is made up to the community health centre level daily. The state has received 2.1 lakh doses on August 1, 1.8 lakh doses on August 2, 3.3 lakh doses on August 3, 52,000 doses on August 4, 2.89 lakh doses on August 5 and 3.26 lakh doses on August 6. “So far current availability is concerned, we can supply 25,000 doses to bigger districts and 8,000-15,000 to smaller districts daily. We have a capacity of providing 15 lakh doses in the state,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health) in Covid-19 review meeting headed by chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday. However, he pointed out that Rajasthan had received more doses than allocated by the Centre for July. In July, the allocation of doses was 48,90,170, but the state government had received 77,04,200 doses. Besides, in August, the Centre has made allocation of 53,07,780 doses and out of those13,94,140 have already been received in first six days of the months, which are 26.2% of the doses allocated for August. According to the schedule send by the Centre for supplying of the vaccines to the state for August, the first supply of the doses was scheduled on August 7. But, the Centre has sent the doses in small quantities daily in the first six days of the month. Since the state government is receiving vaccines in smaller quantities, the officials are unable to inform the people, if they will be able to vaccinate the people next day, which is another problem which the officials are facing due to supply of doses in smaller quantities. Besides, issue has also been raised by Gehlot of low turnout at private hospitals vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-gets-doses-daily-in-aug-but-in-small-numbers/articleshow/85137969.cms||---

They also “served an ultimatum” that if their demand was not met by September 1, they would hold a ‘pardafaash’ (expose) rally in the assembly constituency from where state BSP president Jasbir Singh Garhi would contest. It was first major public meeting of dissenting BSP workers on this scale. Earlier, not only the meetings were small but also the tone was softer. On Saturday, while the speakers did not blame BSP supremo Mayawati for the “wrong distribution” of seats, they also did not spare state president. Several women workers of the party also participated in the event. Apart from several other old and prominent workers of the area, former state secretary Tirath Rajpura, former Jalandhar (rural) district president Amritsapal Bhonsle, former district co-ordinator Ram Saroop Saroye and former zone in-charge Lal Chand Aujla addressed the meeting. All of them were relieved from their posts recently, after the workers meeting was announced. It was announced that BSP workers were determined to contest on elephant symbol from Phillaur, “which was best seat of the party in Punjab” and would oppose those who betrayed the mission of party founder Kanshi Ram and joined other parties. They criticized BSP state president Garhi for asking party workers to support a betrayer from Phillaur – a reference to sitting SAD MLA Baldev Singh Khaira who was earlier BSP candidate in 2012 but lost and later he joined Akali Dal and became MLA in 2017. They also said that state president and state leadership were getting desperate to get those candidates elected from Banga and Adampur seats also who earlier “betrayed” BSP. Like Phillaur, sitting MLAs of Akali Dal from Adampur and Banga were also with BSP earlier and contested elections as its candidates. They said that leaving other strong seats like Sham Chorasi, Garhshankar, Chabbewal and Nakodar to Akali Dal also reflected that party supremo Mayawati was not given correct report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dissenting-bsp-workers-hold-rally-at-phillaur-serve-ultimatum-to-party/articleshow/85138009.cms||IP Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three men held for drunken call about bombs at four places||MUMBAI: An anonymous call on the Mumbai Police’s ‘100’ helpline announcing bombs had been planted at four locations including Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan’s residence sent investigators into a tizzy on Friday, sparking off a massive six hour search. It turned out that three inebriated men had made the calls “for fun.” The crime branch tracked them down to Kalyan within 24 hours and handed them to the Azad Maidan police station where a case has been registered. At 8.53 pm on Friday, a man dialled the ‘100’ helpline and said that bombs had been planted at CSMT, Byculla, Dadar and Bachhan’s residence at Juhu. When the cops called him back later for more details, the caller said “he had told them whatever he knew and he shouldn’t be disturbed any further.” Times ViewThe repercussions are serious when the entire police machinery is activated and sent on a wild goose chase. A strong message must be sent to these miscreants and they should be made to face the full force of the law.Messages were immediately flashed to all 93 police stations in Mumbai, besides the Government Railway Police (GRP) as a railway station had also been mentioned. “We couldn’t have taken a chance as CSMT is a heritage building and has earlier been targeted during the 26/11 attacks,” said a senior GRP officer. Massive checks were carried out from 9pm to 3am by teams of GRP, Railway Protection Force, Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad and five canine squads. Nothing untoward was found and the call was declared a hoax early on Saturday. Meanwhile, the call was tracked down to Kalyan. Crime branch sleuths picked up Raju Kangne, 32, Ramesh Shirsath, 28, who are Dombivali residents, and Ganesh Shelke, 30. All three men are drivers. They admitted to getting drunk for ‘Gatari’ festivities and making the calls for fun and to check the police’s preparedness. ‘Gatari’ festivities are marked with consumption of non-vegetarian food and liquor just before the beginning of the Hindu month of Shravan. The accused will be produced before a magistrate court on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-men-held-for-drunken-call-about-bombs-at-four-places/articleshow/85140003.cms||---

The gang replicated documents of the Indian Army to secure visas for its clients from foreign countries. The STF is preparing a case report and sharing information with national security agencies. The gang used to charge between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 8 lakh per person for making fake documents and sending them to foreign countries like Afghanistan, Iraq and UAE posing as ex-servicemen by fake placement agencies placed mainly in security agencies and shipping companies. One of the accused, Raghuveer Singh, who was a civil defence staff was the alleged mastermind for readying the fake documents. These documents are exclusive to ex-servicemen of the armed forces for establishing their identity after leaving the service. During the investigation, eight individuals working as facilitators were held. They had reportedly come to India from Afghanistan via Nepal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fake-army-documents-racket-busted-network-spread-to-foreign-countries/articleshow/85136143.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The two patients — an eight-year-old boy from the district’s Kanwali village and a 45-year-old man from Vijay Colony — are undergoing treatment at city-based Synergy Hospital. According to Dr Manoj Upreti, chief medical officer, Dehradun, the state capital didn’t report any case of dengue last year. “Our frontline workers were already fogging the sensitive areas of the city. Now, we are collecting samples of the people living in the localities of these two patients. We have doubled our sanitisation efforts,” said Dr Upreti. So far, the larvae of dengue mosquitoes have been found in 8,293 houses in Dehradun by the health department’s frontline team among the 1.31 lakh surveyed houses. District malaria officer, Subhash Joshi, told TOI, “An elderly in Dehradun had caught dengue infection around 10 days ago. He has now recuperated fully. Meanwhile, a suspected dengue case of another 45-year-old has also come up from Dehradun’s Harbhajwala area.

Police used force to disperse the protesters and forcibly took them away from the spot where Manpreet was to lay the foundation stone for civil works. The protesters claimed that the detained people included family members of contractual employees, including a schoolgirl. In the melee, the turbans of many protesters were tossed. Like Patiala, contractual employees have been holding protests in Bathinda for long, especially when Manpreet reaches the assembly constituency. Contractual employees said they had been holding protests for long for regularisation of jobs, but the state government had not been listening to them. Protester Gurpreet Kaur, who had brought her school-going daughter with her, said, “My husband and many others have been working at very low salaries. We accompanied the male members of our families to make our voice heard to the the finance min ister, but to no avail. He will face the consequences in the upcoming assembly elections.” Many of the protesters included employees who had been working at Bathinda thermal plant, but were transferred after it shut down.s||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/police-use-force-to-disperse-contractual-staff-protesting-against-manpreet/articleshow/85138047.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad police fortress work set to drag further||HYDERABAD: The massive multi-purpose Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project, Mission Bhagiratha and several other lift irrigation and mega infrastructure projects have been successfully completed in the last six to seven years by the state government. However, the Hyderabad police commissionerate-cum-integrated command and control centre on Road No 12, Banjara Hills, remains a non-starter. Though the foundation stone was laid in November 2015, the project continues to be a work in progress even as its cost has escalated to Rs 585 crore from Rs 350 crore in 2016. Roads and buildings department officials attribute the delay to introduction of several components to the three-tower project. Also, one of the main reasons for missing out on the deadline of the project is the alleged delay in release of financial payments due to contractor Shapoorji Pallonji by the government. It was in late 2016, the government had set a deadline of 20 months to complete the project. Senior officials said the additional cost escalation of Rs 235 crore was not to be blamed for delay in executing the project. “The primary reason for escalation is due to introduction of several new components to the project by Telangana police in addition to the original plan. Some of them are inclusion of two basements, change in different specifications and others,” senior R&B officials told STOI. “Most of the aspects at the time of planning and awarding of tender were tentative. As a result, we realised the actual cost only during its execution. The cost of the construction material in the last few years going up is an additional factor but not the primary reason for escalation in the project cost,” an official said. For the glass and solar panels, huge amount was spent. Sources said the cost had gone up following additional expenditure on parking space, interiors, networking centre and other utility services. It is learnt that out of the nearly Rs 450 crore worth works which were taken up, the government had paid Rs 350 crore to the contractor one-and-a-half years ago. The remaining Rs 100 crore payment has been delayed by the government due to fund crunch owing to the pandemic and lockdowns. Sources said labour shortage had also slowed down the project. Apart from a 20-storeyed tower, it has two 15-storeyed towers. “This is a unique project. The cabinet some time ago had approved the revised estimate of Rs 585 crore. There are some procedures which have to be completed like sanctioning the revised estimates and entering into a supplementary agreement with the contractor. The delay in release of funds is due to routine procedural issues,” a top R&B officer told STOI. Officials are confident that once funds are released by the government as per schedule, the project can be completed in next four months. Once Shapoorji Pallonji completes the physical component of the massive structure, L&T will take over to install security systems as per the requirements of Telangana police to set up an advanced data centre and command and control centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/police-fortress-work-set-to-drag-further/articleshow/85138056.cms||Srinath Vudali

The recent chargesheet filed by a SIT of Punjab Police in a Zira court against the company owners and officials has paved way for this investigation. TOI has reported on Friday that a special CBI court in Delhi had ordered Punjab prison authorities to shift Pearls Group CMD Nirmal Singh Bhangoo to Tihar jail in Delhi from upscale Mohali hospital. Bhangoo had spent more than three years, out of last four, in the hospital claiming some sickness or other. Over five crore investors in different states were cheated through ponzi schemes. When contacted On Saturday, ED officials in Jalandhar were tightlipped about the case, but sources in the agency claimed that the nod had been given by the “higher ups” to start action. Source also revealed that as already a money laundering case had been registered against the Pearls Group by ED Delhi, the new probe to be initiated by ED Jalandhar office would primarily focus on the sale of properties amassed by the company by investors money, despite the ban imposed by the Supreme Court. In the ongoing ED case against Bhangoo, a chargesheet has already been filed and the agency had attached several properties belonging to the group in India and abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ed-to-probe-sale-of-pearls-group-assets-despite-sc-ban/articleshow/85138089.cms||Mohit Behl

Total 228 students received offers of more than Rs 20 lakh per annum, an increase of 22.5 per cent over 2019-20 placement season. “Since the pandemic, we were slightly scared about the placements. Surprisingly, we had more number of companies coming over for placements, giving us more options to select from. Our placement unit did a tremendous job in hosting so many companies at once,” said Yatharth Batra, 25, who was recently placed at Western Digital as validation engineer for a package of Rs 22 lakh. The infrastructure sector, which underwent a rough patch due to manpower and supply chain disruption, was sceptical in hiring due to uncertain business scenarios. However, infrastructure heavyweights such as Ramboll, L&T Limited, WSP, Arup, Stantec, Atkins and Vestas hired students for structural and transportation engineer roles from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus. This year, consulting and product management roles were in demand among engineering students with several prominent companies such as Bain Capability Network, Ernst & Young, Indus Insights, Dalberg, Flipkart and Deloitte offering product and IT consulting roles. “For the upcoming year of placement 2021-22, BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus looks forward to a repeat of the bullish hiring season with yet another scintillating performance,” said Biju Rajan, senior manager, placement, BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/despite-covid-19-pandemic-bits-pilani-placements-record-50-jump-in-recruiters/articleshow/85138077.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||South Central Railway directed to pay over Rs 17 lakh to passenger for theft during journey||HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum here directed South Central Railway (SCR) to pay Rs 14 lakh for stolen goods, refund Rs 3 lakh and pay Rs 50, 000 to a consumer who was robbed while travelling in a reserved coach in a train. The SCR was held responsible as it failed to prevent the entry of unauthorised persons into the coach and permitted them to stand at the door of the coach. Sheetal Kulkarni, the complainant, submitted that she along with her mother-in-law and other family members travelled from Hyderabad to Bengaluru by train No. 17603 Kachiguda – Yeshwanthpura (KCG-YPR) Express in a reserved compartment on August 11, 2017, to attend the engagement function of her sister-in-law in Bengaluru. After reaching their destination, upon opening their suitcase, the complainant said she noticed that gold and silver jewellery including engagement rings, all weighing about 530 grams approximately, and other silk clothes purchased for the function, and an amount of Rs 3 lakh were missing from the suitcase. She said that on keen observation, they noticed that the suitcase was very tactfully cut from the bottom and jewellery and cash were stolen. The complainant said that she and her family members went to Rural Railway Police Station, Yeshwanthpura, Bengaluru and lodged a complaint suspecting that the theft might have been committed by three persons who entered the coach unauthorisedly and were standing near the door when the complainant and her family members were hurriedly getting down with their luggage of about 10 bags. Sheetal said that she followed up with police to know the status of the case, but received no response. She claimed that as their belongings were stolen from the running train and a reserved compartment, it occurred due to the negligence of the SCR as it failed to take necessary steps for protecting the belongings of the passengers, especially when the complainant had paid extra service charges for the reservation. The complainant said that she waited for a considerable period of time with the hope that the railway police will trace the culprits and hand over her stolen property, but in vain. Left with no option, she filed the complaint for redressal. The general manager of SCR, in his written version, submitted that the SCR is not liable as the complaint filed by the complainant is for loss of jewellery kept in a suitcase that was in her personal custody. It was further contended that the forum has no jurisdiction and that the complaint is not maintainable under Consumer Protection Act, 1986. During the trial, the bench noticed that the opposite party has neither enquired into allegations made by the complainant nor filed the records of the officials, who were deputed for duty on that day, or the statements of the coach attendants, TTE and travellers’ chart. “The opposite parties neither denied that unauthorised persons entered into the coach and might have committed theft nor tried to prove that they are very much vigilant and have taken all such preventive measures to safeguard the interest of the person and property of the passengers while travelling in reservation coaches,” the bench said. The complainant said that she waited for a considerable period of time with the hope that the railway police will trace the culprits and hand over her stolen property, but in vain.

DOs are officers at the rank of assistant inspectors or second inspectors, who hold the charge of the police station in the absence of the police station in charge. Usually, the DOs are given a charge during night shifts. Gupta said, “Each step is being taken to ensure the citizens not only feel safe but also there is a serious check on the criminal elements.” Crime branch officials said the mandatory use of masks and helmets are working in favour of the chain snatchers. Despite all these challenges, there has been some success in detecting chain snatching cases, including the one detected on Friday and those detected by the crime branch in recent weeks. A senior police officer said Gupta recently citing the reports he has received, expressed his anger over many DOs falling asleep during the morning hours. In addition to this, chain snatchers also strike at the time when there is a change of shift between staffers on night duty and morning duty. To ensure all the routes are covered without a fail, the DOs have been asked to report to the control room about their patrolling route and identified spots after every few minutes. The directives have been issued ahead of the Shravan month, starting Monday, during which a large number of people walk to temples to offer their prayer. Most of the chain snatching cases reported in the city have been committed during the morning and evening, targeting women heading temples or on a morning walk. In addition to this, the good morning squads of the city police have been asked to remain extra vigilant and keep a track of suspicious elements on two-wheelers without number plates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/aurangabad-cp-to-duty-officers-be-on-4-hour-patrol/articleshow/85134628.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||World||Deterioration of Afghanistan security a serious matter: Jaishankar||NEW DELHI: As the Taliban-Afghan battles intensify in Afghanistan, foreign minister S. Jaishankar said today the “rapid deterioration of the security situation” was a “serious matter”. After meeting Qatari special envoy Mutlaq bin Majed Al-Qahtani Saturday, Jaishankar tweeted, ‘A peaceful and stable Afghanistan requires that the rights and interests of all sections of society are promoted and protected.” Al-Qahtani, a special envoy of the foreign minister of Qatar for counter-terrorism is on a visit to India ostensibly to discuss the latest developments in Afghanistan. His visit comes a few days before a scheduled meeting of the Russia-led ‘Extended Troika’ grouping to discuss Afghanistan’s future. Jaishankar” said he “shared the Indian perspective on recent developments in Afghanistan. Also the concerns of the region that I heard during recent interactions.” Unusually, Al Qahtani met joint secretary, JP Singh, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and the external affairs minister, which is generally beyond normal practice. India chaired a special UNSC meeting on Afghanistan on Friday, where the Afghan envoy to the United Nations Ghulam M Isaczai, declared, “Taliban continue to enjoy a safe haven in and supply and logistics line extended to their war machine from Pakistan." He added, "graphic reports and videos of Taliban fighters congregating close to the Durand Line to enter Afghanistan, fund-raising events, transfer of dead bodies for mass burial, and treatment of injured Taliban in Pakistani hospitals are emerging and are widely available." The Afghan envoy said it is "not only a naked violation of the 1988 UN Security Council Sanctions Regime but also leads to further erosion of trust and confidence towards establishing a collaborative relationship with Pakistan to end the war in our country." Thanking the UNSC for the special meeting, Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar on Saturday also called for a “special session” on Afghanistan to discuss Taliban atrocities. Taking forward Isaczai’s contention, Rahmatullah Nabil, former head of Afghanistan’s security service, NDS tweeted on Saturday, “… despite differences between the Sunni religious extremist group of Jaish-ul-Adl (who are fighting against Iran) and the Afghan Taliban, the Pakistani ISI has sent about 600 Jaish-ul-Adl militants from Dalbandin, Noshki, Mashkeel and Panjgur of Balochistan, to Nimroz, Herat and Farah provinces of AFG with all military equipment, in order to help the Afghan Taliban in fighting.” This comes on a day when reports said Taliban had taken Zaranj town in Nimroz province.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/deterioration-of-afghanistan-security-a-serious-matter-jaishankar/articleshow/85142838.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||Hyderabad||HC notices to collector, RDO & tahsildar in contempt case||Hyderabad: Noting that a district civil court would not dare to issue an injunction order against an order of the high court, Justice MS Ramachandra Rao of Telangana high court said that it will be contempt of court if the lower court passes such an order. The judge was hearing a contempt case filed by M Narasaiah of Shanta Sriram Constructions Private Ltd against revenue authorities charging them with failure to implement an earlier order of the court that directed delivery of possession of 40 acres of land in Lothukunta village in Malkajgiri mandal to vendors of Narasaiah who gave the land for development to him. KS Murthy, counsel for the builder, said the government did not implement the order of the court nor did it pay the penalty. Justice Rao issued notices in the contempt case to district collector Swetha Mohanty, RDO D Vasantha Kumari and Tirumalagiri tahsildar and sought replies from them by August 27. Condemning the tricks adopted by the revenue authorities who eclipsed Lothukunta from the records of Malkajgiri mandal so as to deny the owners the right over the land, the judge had earlier directed the authorities to hand over possession of land. “If the state government still insists that it has claims over the title of this same land, then the option available to it is the civil court,” the judge had said. He also imposed Rs 1 lakh as penalty and directed the authorities not to disturb the owners till the government secures its title from the civil court. The government preferred an appeal against this order. A bench led by Chief Justice Hima Kohli did not interfere in the single judge’s order and asked the state to go to a civil court. It, however, suspended the order of the single judge for four weeks. That period is over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-notices-to-collector-rdo-tahsildar-in-contempt-case/articleshow/85138142.cms||---

Ocugen, which inked a deal for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of Covaxin in Canada in June this year after bagging US rights in December 2020, had initiated rolling submission of Covaxin data to Health Canada through affiliate Vaccigen in mid-June. He said the regulatory submission filed under Canada’s interim order was transitioned into a new drug submission for Covid-19 “in such a short order, especially when urgency is increasing in Canada”. Pointing out that Covaxin was the first vaccine to evaluate efficacy against the Delta variant in a controlled setting, he said: “Majority of the symptomatic cases identified in aggregate in Covaxin and control arms in phase-3 clinical trial were Covid-19 variants...majority were identified as Delta variant B.1.617.2. Data showed Covaxin achieving a 65.2% efficacy rate against Delta variant.” “Data from Covid cases demonstrated low viral load...in vaccinated individuals compared to placebo group, showing potential for less transmission of the disease by individuals who received Covaxin...these data on Delta are very suggestive that Covaxin is a valuable tool in our fight against this virus now, especially with this variant now dominating this fourth wave we are experiencing,” he said. Musunuri said as Covaxin trains the immune system to attack the whole Covid-19 variants based on multi-antigens, including the spike in nucleocapsid proteins, it has the potential to be effective against multiple variants and reduce the possibility of mutant virus escape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-under-active-review-of-health-canada/articleshow/85138124.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Seven-month-old Yash (name changed) was born at a public hospital in December 2020. His mother was referred there from another nursing home, where she had developed complications. The baby was immediately moved to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after birth. Shortly after his mother recovered, she and her husband disappeared. The hospital contacted Juhu police, who tracked down the couple under the supervision of senior inspector Shashikant Mane. “The mother claimed she was upset over not being allowed to see her baby. Doctors explained that given the baby’s condition and the pandemic, they were not encouraging visits to the NICU,” said an officer. At the cops’ request, the mother was dressed in a kit and allowed to meet the baby but few days later, the parents vanished again. This time, they vacated their rented home and destroyed their phone so that investigators would not be able to look into their call records. Despite a vague address, police found the couple’s rented home only to find it locked. The landlord, who opened the house with a spare key, knew nothing of the couple’s departure. Yash continued to stay in NICU for quite sometime. His only visitors at the hospital were cops who developed a bond with him. When ready for discharge, Child Welfare Committee (CWC) directed that an orphanage take him in. “It was an emotional moment packing his tiny clothes, putting together the paperwork and arranging for a vehicle to take him to his new home. He is adorable,” said an officer. Police, led by sub-inspector Poonam Mirgane, continued to look for his parents. Last week, they sent a final report to CWC on the case, paving the way for his adoption. “We have been fielding inquiries from colleagues and their families keen to adopt the baby. CWC will interview them and take a decision,” said an officer. The seven-month-old boy was born at a public hospital in December 2020.

In a presser held at the BJP headquarters on Saturday, Singh said that infighting in Congress is hampering the delivery of the ruling government which in any case is lethal for citizens. Singh presided over the first statewide Panna Pramukh meeting at the BJP headquarters. Taking a dig at CM Ashok Gehlot, Singh said that the CM is sitting on cabinet expansion and other important decisions which have led to slow progress of the state. “If a new cabinet can take oath in Karnataka, why a cabinet expansion has been delayed in the state. It is ironic that Congress state presidents of other states – Karnataka’s D K Shivkumar and Haryana’s Kumari Selja, have been heading towards the state to convince Gehlot of resolving the issue,” said Singh. Referring to the statements of Congress MLAs, Singh said that they have forgotten about the welfare of the local people in the state. “Gehlot has not been able to placate his own MLAs, how can he run the state,” said Singh, who alleged that announcement of the Panchayati Raj elections in the state is yet again a strategy by the Gehlot to deviate people’s attention from the internal fight and from his misgovernance. Replying to a question on the angry reaction from farmers against BJP leaders, Singh said, “I don’t see any angry reaction from the farmers. I have been travelling across the state and have not come across any farmer opposing the three farm bills.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-infighting-in-party-claims-bjp-raj-in-charge-arun-singh/articleshow/85140090.cms||---

On BEST Day, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray flagged of 12m air-conditioned e-buses. There are 198 e-buses in operations, and with the addition of 24, the fleet is now 222. These buses can carry 35 passengers and 24 standees. Wheelchair access for the physically challenged, ITMS, based on GPS technology, panic buttons, air suspension and other state-of-the-art facilities will make it easier for the bus driver to operate without clutches and gears. It will also help reduce noise and air pollution. BEST announced that 140 more such environment-friendly buses will be introduced by the month-end mainly on office routes in south Mumbai. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, who was present at the event, tweeted, ‘We launched the next batch of fully electric buses, taking our fleet to 270 electric buses. BEST has set a target of 1,800 buses (45% of current fleet) to be electric by mid-2023. The buses are sound and emission free.” He said, “Starting this week, the island city will have only electric BEST buses and many in the suburbs will be electric too.” While praising BEST for environment protection, Uddhav said BEST employees provided public transport to the public during Covid. He also inaugurated the redeveloped Mahim depot in the presence of mayor Kishori Pednekar, and said, “This depot building will be of great convenience to staff and provide relief to passengers.” He said work was on to provided a single mobility ticketing system for BEST buses and local trains. Around Rs 94 crore was transferred to around 1,005 retired BEST employees’ bank accounts.

---||Dehradun||Villagers of Devalsari upset at concretisation of area due to development of eco-park by forest dept||Dehradun/Mussoorie: The ongoing construction work for the development of an eco-park, inside a reserve forest at Devalsari in Tehri Garhwal, has disturbed the biodiversity of the area, claim local villagers. They point out that not only has the eco-park contributed to concretisation of the forest,multiple statues of wildlife, including animals that are not even found in the area, have been put up by the forest department near the park. Besides, the villagers say that the department has felled several trees for facilitating the park. “This area has a unique flora and fauna composition and even a minor concrete intervention will hit the biodiversity adversely,” said Arun Gour, founder of Devalsari Paryavaran Sarakshan Samiti, a body formed by villagers for protection of the area’s environment. Devalsari is known for its pristine Deodar forests and biodiversity and is hailed as a paradise for butterfly watchers. In January this year, Devalsari was identified among a few Biodiversity Heritage Sites of Uttarakhand and the villagers were promised that on May 22, the International Day of Biological Diversity, it will be declared a Biodiversity Heritage Site. But nothing has happened on that front, villagers alleged. “They have even felled a 200-year-old Eucalyptus tree which was the habitat of a critically-endangered flying squirrel which is found here, without the consent of villagers who have rights on these forests,” Gour said, adding that he will sit on an indefinite protest along with other villagers if the government fails to stop this project. When queried on the issue, Kahkshan Naseem, the divisional forest officer of Mussoorie, told TOI, “The eco-park is fenced using a chain link fencing as it was over-grazed by the livestock. Thus, we have secured it to maintain its natural beauty. Also, the small patch of around 2 hectares has everything eco-friendly, anyone can come and see it for themselves.” On the endangered flying squirrels, Naseem said, “Oak and deodar trees are natural habitats of these flying squirrels as they survive on acorns and nuts. Eucalyptus trees on the other hand release a pungent smell and squirrels don’t rest on them.” The forest authorities also added that they plan to connect Devalsari with other trekking routes that can take the tourists to picturesque villages like Nagthat, Pantwari and others.

---||Ahmedabad||Seafood exporters set to shake off China’s chains, enter new markets||With China beginning to choke Indian seafood exports by suspending supply from a multitude of Indian marine export companies, frozen seafood exporters from Gujarat have now started scouting for greener pastures. The local firms are exploring ways to add value to marine products to crack newer markets, and overcome the Chinese debacle. Chinese authorities have been suspending seafood exporting companies from India for certain periods after they allegedly found dead coronavirus cells on package exteriors of seafood shipped from the country. China’s claim, however, has been termed ‘baseless’ by local frozen seafood exporters. China buys 50% of marine products exported from Gujarat. As the stalemate over exports to China is unlikely to be resolved in near future, frozen seafood exporters from the state, mainly from the coastal region of Veraval, have made up their mind to cast their export net wider and cover more countries. They have also agreed to produce and export more value-added products such as ready to cook seafood. China is considered an easier market, as local firms export plain seafood items after just cleaning them without any value addition. On the other hand, Chinese processors add value to imported products and re-export them to other international markets, including Europe and America. In a recently held meeting, Veraval-based exporters decided to penetrate markets where China re-exports Indian seafood after value addition. Apart from this, they are also looking at countries such as Singapore, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Japan and Thailand, where there is a great demand for value-added marine products. There are very few exporters in Veraval who are making value-added marine products for the European and US markets. There are around 100 exporters in Veraval, but most of them primarily export to China. "Currently, plain or raw seafood items shipped to China cost us around Rs 25-30 per kg. The cost goes up to Rs 60-80 if we add value to those products. However, the buyer would buy at higher cost if we offer value-added products," said Naresh Vanik, one of the few exporters of value-added seafood products in Veraval. "The Chinese processors know everything about our business, so they don’t allow us to earn more profit. However, we can book more profits if we go for value-addition," he added. In the market of value-added seafood, China is India’s biggest competitor. The other prominent competitors include Thailand and Vietnam. "We can explore new markets by doing value-addition. But 35% of our catch is ribbon and croaker fish and there is no alternate market other than China for these products. In other countries, these products fetch 50% of what China pays us," said Jagdish Fofandi, president, Seafood Exporters Association of India (SEAI). "However, there is a scope for value-addition to the remaining 60-65% of our catch," he added. Stating that the government has set a 30% higher target for marine exports this fiscal, he said, "Government intervention is needed to resolve the China issue and get our funds released so that we can achieve the export target set by the government of India." Troubled watersChina has clamped stricter restrictions on Indian seafood consignments and therefore a container takes months to get through. Around 1,000 containers of Indian exporters are stuck at different ports in China waiting to get cleared, suggest estimates by SEAI. Chinese importers, according to agreements they sign with exporters, make payments only when container reach them. The containers used to reach importers within 20 days in pre-Covid times. However, the period has prolonged to 50-60 days due to restrictions after the outbreak of the pandemic disturbing the payment cycle. Industry players estimate that Veraval-based exporters’ payments worth about Rs 100 crore are currently stuck with Chinese buyers. The seafood exports from Gujarat to China has reduced 60%. Rejection of a container costs about $25,000 to the exporter. At present, 70 Indian exporting companies, including 20 from Veraval, are facing suspension by China.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/seafood-exporters-set-to-shake-off-chinas-chains-enter-new-markets/articleshow/85140159.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

A 30-year-old man has been arrested on the charges of abetting suicide and also booked under sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The suspect was produced before the court on Saturday and remanded in police custody for three days. The incident caused some tension in Patoda. Initially, there were reports that the girl had been raped and hanged. An officer privy to the probe said that the victim and the suspect are from different communities and this caused further friction. The body was rushed to Ambajogai-based government rural medical college and hospital, where an in-camera autopsy was performed. The autopsy report revealed that the minor was neither murdered nor raped. Patoda police station’s assistant inspector Mahesh Andhale told TOI, “The minor girl’s family had been to another village to attend a wedding on Friday morning. When the family returned home, they found her hanging.” Based on the deceased girl’s mother’s statement, the suspect has been booked under section 305 of the IPC and has also been slapped with Pocso ACt. Police said the suspect is an umemployed engineer, and is unmarried. A few days back, there was a friction between the suspect as well as deceased’s family.

However, police rejected the claims made by Meghwal. This is the second attack on him in the past 10 days. He was assaulted by a group of farmers who tore his clothes on July 30 while he was on the way to address a protest against the state government in Ganganagar. Meghwal has claimed that his convoy of 15 vehicles, en route from Pillibanga to Goluwala, was intercepted by a group of people riding bikes. “Over 30 persons started raising slogans and started hitting our vehicles with bamboos and farm tools. I immediately informed police which dispersed the crowd,” said Meghwal. The incident happened at 12.30 pm. Meghwal tweeted, “Our convoy was stopped and attacked with batons. Party workers sustained injuries, we have left the spot with police. You keep patience we will soon reach Sri Ganganagar. Why you are attacking us, we are your brothers.” “I am filing the FIR in the case against some identified persons while many were not known to me,” said Meghwal, who accused police of not acting on the FIR in the earlier case. He ruled out that farmers were behind the attack and blamed the communist party workers behind both the attacks. Reacting to the incident, SP Hanumangarh Priti Jain said preliminary investigation revealed that the vehicle was neither broken nor the convoy was attacked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-sc-morcha-chief-meghwal-alleges-attack-on-convoy-police-deny/articleshow/85140118.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Give booster dose? Experts say first vaccinate majority||NEW DELHI: A majority of India’s population is yet to receive both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. However, a debate has started already on whether those who received both doses need a booster dose. Vaccine manufacturers claim a booster dose may be needed for two reasons: to provide prolonged immunity and to fight off the mutant variants of the novel coronavirus. Countries like France, Germany and Israel, where a significant population have received both doses of the vaccine, are considering a third dose as are the US and UK. Public health experts in India, however, say there is no need to follow suit. Dr S K Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, told TOI that many healthcare workers and other vaccine recipients approach him complaining that their antibody count is low even after full vaccination. “We tell them that antibody response is just one of the markers of the protection offered by vaccination,” said Sarin. “There are other factors at play too.” Dr Sarin did add, however, that it would be prudent to start multiple trials at least to assess whether a third, or a booster dose, can help increase the antibody levels. Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, said there wasn’t enough data at the moment to support the requirement for a third or booster dose. “By now we know that vaccines cannot prevent transmission of the infection. They protect against severe disease and mortality. Two doses of all vaccines available currently are sufficient to achieve that,” he explained. The World Health Organization has also called for a halt to booster doses until at least the end of September to enable at least 10% of the global population to be vaccinated. “So far, more than four billion vaccine doses have been administered across the world. More than 80% have gone to high- and upper-middle income countries, even though they account for less than half of the world’s population,” pointed out Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. It was more important to immunise as many people as possible rather than focus on the issue of a booster dose, felt K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India. “We do not know if a booster dose is needed or what it will achieve. But we know for sure that even a single dose offers significant protection to people against severe infection and death due to Covid. Therefore, we must focus on that,” Reddy asserted. Havin started vaccinating people in January, India had, until Friday, administered approximately 50 crore doses across the country. In Delhi, 1.05 crore doses had been administered. Independent epidemiologist Chandrakant Lahariya noted that the second wave of the pandemic in India between April and May was caused mainly due to the Delta variant which has now spread to various parts of the world. “Any decision on vaccination should depend on two key criteria: scientific rationale and operative feasibility. The necessity of a third dose doesn’t fulfil any of them,” said Lahariya. “There is neither enough scientific data to support the necessity of an additional dose nor do we have enough vaccines available to experiment with the idea.” Lahariya also observed that many population clusters in India had already been exposed to the coronavirus. “Antibody responses developed through natural infection last for at least nine months. We should prioritise vaccinating everyone for extra protection to those who are already exposed and those who aren’t instead of focusing on the need for a third dose,” he said.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Private schools claim non-payment of fees for 2020-21 violates Supreme Court order||JAIPUR: The private schools in the state called the non-payment of academic session 2020-21 fees by parents on or before August 5, a violation of the Supreme Court order. The Supreme Court on May 3 passed a ruling that parents must deposit 85% of the actual fees of the session 2019-20 in a maximum of six instalments by August 5. Many schools have contended that less than 50% of the parents have deposited complete fees while others have deposited less than one quarter. Almost every school in the state has been sending notices to the parents demanding fees to pay at the earliest. Some have taken a casual approach by just reminding the parents while many have threatened to stop online classes of their wards. Rahul Sharma, a father of a class VII student Utkarsh Sharma of Maheshwari Public School (Tilak Nagar) was shocked after his son was removed from the online classes on Saturday. “The school told me that my son was removed since I had failed to deposit the fourth quarter fees. I tried to explain that due to heavy losses due to pandemic I failed to deposit the fees, but they refused to allow him till I paid the fees,” said Sharma. TOI called up MPS principal Archana Sharma for her response, but to no avail. Confirming that it’s a statewide phenomenon, Sanyukth Abhivavak Sangh, president Abhishek Jain, told TOI those parents who have not paid the fees have not violated the Supreme Court ruling. “Schools have been suspending classes of students who have not paid the fees. They are demanding the remaining fees, but have forgotten that the court has clearly told them that they have to fix the fees according to the Rajasthan Fees Act 2016. They have to upload the names of the 10-member fees committee. To the best of my knowledge, very few schools have followed the due procedure,” said Jain. The Supreme Court decided the amount and schedule of payment of fee for the academic session 2020-21 by its judgment dated May 3, 2021. “The amount so payable by the concerned students be paid in six equal monthly instalments before 05.08.2021 as noted in our order dated 08.02.2021,” reads the order. Private schools say that almost all middle income and low-income level schools have not received the fees by over 50% of the parents leaving them in a fix to meet basic expenses. Damodar Goyal, president of the Society for Unaided Private Schools of Rajasthan, said that Supreme Court nowhere in the order has even observed that the parents have a privilege to not pay the fee of 2020-21. “Schools have the right to take action against defaulters. Schools have not debarred anyone from online/offline teaching,” said Goyal. Taking a soft stand, some schools have extended the last date of fee deposition. Vikramaditya, chairperson of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidyalaya, said that parents are like our family. “Our school understands the problems a section of parents are facing and it becomes our duty to help as much we can,” said the chairperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pvt-schools-claim-non-payment-of-fees-for-2020-21-violates-sc-order/articleshow/85140132.cms||---

Rakesh Kumar Nagar had plugged his headphones into his mobile phone which was charging. The explosion threw Nagar off his chair and he fell on the ground unconscious before he was taken to a nearby private hospital. Dr L N Rundla said Nagar was unconscious when he was brought to the hospital.  “He probably died of cardiac arrest, which is very common in such cases,” Rundla said, adding that the victim had wounds on his ears due to the explosion. The family of the deceased did not file any report with the local police, due to which a post-mortem could not be done. However, a police official from the local area, who had gone to the same hospital to attend some work, told TOI on the condition of anonymity that it appears the earphone was connected to the mobile phone which was charging. “There is confusion as to how earphones suddenly exploded. He was alone in the room when the incident took place so no one could corroborate it. His phone was probably plugged either into an electric outlet, or the earphones may have been directly connected with a computer,” the official said, adding that Nagar’s father was also present in the hospital on Thursday. The deceased was preparing for competitive exams and was recently married. He was preparing for government recruitment tests through online learning courses and spent most of his studying in a small room located on his family’s farm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/youth-dies-in-earphone-explosion/articleshow/85140213.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi University wants students to plant tree, report its growth every 6 months||NEW DELHI: In the 2021-22 academic session in Delhi University, each student will be required to plant at least one tree. After planting them, the students will also have to submit a six-monthly report on the growth and status of the sapling. It will form part of the internal assessment on environmental studies for undergraduate students and constitute part of the first semester course for master’s degree and PhD programmes. The new Centre for Himalayan Studies had moved this proposal, describing it as “academic social responsibility”. The university accepted it and vice-chancellor P C Joshi announced the mandatory initiative on Saturday. Joshi said, “Every year, DU admits lakhs of students from different parts of the country and they will be our climate warriors. We need to confront the environmental, social and economic challenges to check future problems. Planting millions of suitable trees and creating a natural ecosystem is one of the best ways to achieve this.” Explaining the reason behind the proposal, professor Dinabandhu Sahoo, director of the centre, said, “We are facing a major biosphere crisis and there are only 28 trees per person in India while the global average is 422 per person. Canada has 8,953 trees per person and China 130. Over the years, the government and private sectors have launched and implemented various plantation schemes, but these are not adequate.” Educational institutions in USA, Europe and Japan also have been undertaking mass plantations, making DU believe that it can be replicated in India too. This initiative will be scientifically done and monitored. Students will be required to submit GPS data along with pictures of the plantation site. The university is also considering geo-tagging of the trees. The focus of the plantation will be native species, with the Centre for Himalayan Studies advising and guiding colleges about the tree plantation. Students can plant trees in their own localities too. In their absence, the responsibility of taking care of the saplings has to be borne by the parents/family and the community. Apart from this project, the university also announced that it would be building a facilitation centre at Bhatti Kalan Gaon in Fatehpur Beri. It will have the administrative offices of the university there to help students avoid having to travel long distances to the North or South campus for official work. DU owns a 40-bigha plot in Bhatti Kalan provided by the district administration with the approval of the lieutenant governor for establishing a new college there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-wants-students-to-plant-tree-report-its-growth-every-6-months/articleshow/85140192.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||Delhi: They shone at JEE Main despite Covid chaos||NEW DELHI: There was uncertainty about whether the exams would be held. There was also a preoccupation with remaining safe from Covid yetstaying mentally positive. These added pandemic burdens did not stop Ruchir Bansal and Pravar Kataria from scoring 100 percentiles in the Joint Entrance Examination Main. In the results announced by National Testing Agency on Friday, they were among the 17 aspirants who hit the 100 percentile. For Kataria, it was a second experience at getting a 100 percentile. In the February JEE Main, he had obtained the same score. But the 100 this time was still a surprise. “I knew that I had worked hard and been consistent with my preparation. But there are so many students who take this exam. Getting a 100 percentile leaves me with a sense of achievement,” said Kataria, who is now confident about sitting for JEE Advanced, the examination for entry into the coveted IITs. Belonging to the family of doctors, Kataria passed Class XII with 93.2% from Pragati Public School in Dwarka. He shared, “It was extremely frustrating not knowing when the exams would take place. It was actually unsettling. I wasn’t happy with the cancellation of the Class XII exam because I had prepared well for it, but it was a sensible decision in view of Covid.” Bansal found respite from his studying in music and jogging in the local park with his friends. The teen, who got 98.2% in the CBSE Class XII assessment, added, “It was a very stressful time. If we were going to school or coaching, apart from all the learning we also got opportunities to release our pent-up energies. But being at home stressed all of us all the more,” said the youngster. Bansal was a student at Sanskriti School in Chanakyapuri. His father is an IRS officer and his mother, a housewife. If he takes up engineering, he will be the second in his family to do so. “My elder brother graduated from IIT Delhi in 2020. He had an all India ranking of 3 in the JEE Main. So, he was an inspiration of sorts for me and helped me figure out my choices,” revealed Bansal. The elder sibling is now headed for Stanford University in the US to pursue his master’s degree in science.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/they-shone-at-jee-main-despite-covid-chaos/articleshow/85140202.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||Waste plants fail, NEERI steps in to clean Yamuna||NEW DELHI: After common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) failed to comply with the prescribed standards for around two years, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has proposed short-term and long-term plans for improving the performance of CETPs. The central monitoring committee (CMC), which is monitoring the progress of the Yamuna-related projects, has said in a report that the short-term plan is removal of large amounts of sludge, while the long-term plan is upgradation of CETPs. Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) issued directions for closure to 1,065 water polluting industries in the 17 industrial areas connected to 13 CETPs last month. DPCC in July had given directions to all the 13 CETPs for ensuring compliance to the norms or they would be closed down. The monitoring panel in its report said, “Special Commissioner (Industries), Delhi informed that there is no plan for closure of CETPs and NEERI has been engaged for improvement of performance of CETPs. Short-term plan is for removal of large amounts of deposited sludge. The Treatment, Storage and Disposal facility (TSDF) site for hazardous waste is going to start soon and all sludge will be moved to TSDF site and performance of CETPs will improve. Long-term plan is for upgradation of CETPs. Recently, NEERI has given options for upgradation of three CETPs, which is under examination. Accordingly, instructions will be given to all CETP societies for upgradation of CETPs at the earliest.” It was also suggested that DPCC has to notify the outlet parameters for industries that are permissible as per inlet norms for CETP. Further, as some of the effluents are being discharged into the storm water drains, therefore, on a pilot basis, it was proposed to treat wastewater in a drain from Wazirabad in the CETP. “However, NOC from DJB is awaited in this regard. ED (Tech), National Mission for Clean Ganga stated that NEERI has taken too much time in technical appraisal for upgradation of CETPs. Director General, NMCG highlighted that since the beginning of monitoring by CMC in January 2020, same status has been reported with regard to upgradation of the CETPs. Industries have to follow the norms. Unless the closing down of the member industrial units of the CETPs takes place, no improvement of CETP performance is possible. It was suggested that NEERI should complete the study in a time-bound manner,” said the report. According to DPCC, monthly analysis reports show 12 CETPs have not been meeting prescribed water quality standards in terms of biochemical dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, chloride and sulphide for around two years. According to the monthly progress report filed by the environment department, 33,690 industrial units situated in 17 industrial units are connected to these CETPs. Thirteen CETPs are operational in Delhi with a total capacity of treating effluent of 212.3 MLD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/waste-plants-fail-neeri-steps-in-to-clean-yamuna/articleshow/85140228.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The federation leaders called the draft of recruitment rules draconian and raised slogans braving the rains. Around 60 members of the ITEF joined the demonstration and raised slogans against the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). “The CBDT has published draconian draft recruitment rules in various cadres of the IT department without considering the proposal and suggestions submitted by the ITEF. The authority ignored the discussions and decisions of various meetings held for finalization of rules,” said a statement issued by the federation. “In the new rules the tax assistant (TA) and senior TA and office superintendent (OS) quota has been reduced to 25% from 100% earlier. From senior TA or OS to inspector quota has been reduced to 25% from 66.66%,” states the press release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/federation-protests-new-i-t-job-rules/articleshow/85135949.cms||---

Today her son is four-years-old and has no memories of his father. But Heera can’t afford to be too perturbed by it. For her the bigger worry is not just when but also if at all her husband would be released by the Pakistan government. Heera, who is from a village of Kodinar taluka in Somnath district, isn’t the only one suffering such fate. Many women from the entire coastal area of Saurashtra — Gir Somnath, Porbandar, Junagadh, Devbhumi Dwarka, Jamnagar districts — have the same heart-breaking tales to tell. According to the National Fishworkers Forum, as many as 558 Indian fishermen are lodged in Pakistan’s Malir jail in Karachi and 90% of them are from Gujarat coast. Leaders of the fishermen community along with a few family members of Indian prisoners in Pakistani jail addressed media persons in Rajkot on Saturday. They urged both governments to release fishermen on the independence day of both the countries that fall this month. According to the forum, out of the 558 prisoners held by Pakistan, the nationality of 295 has been confirmed by India but 263 are still waiting for the process. Jatin Desai a Mumbai-based peace activist who is fighting for release of the civilian prisoners form both the countries said that most of the Indian fishermen have been languishing in Pakistan jails for more than three years. “Using the latest technology it won’t take more than a day for Indian consulate to establish the nationality of fishermen lodged in Pakistani jail. Also, we are pursuing both the countries to adopt a no arrest policy in case fishermen cross the border unknowingly,” Desai said. In 2007 India and Pakistan both had formed a joint judicial committee on prisoners but it has been lying defunct since 2013. As per a 2008 agreement, both countries had decided to provide consulate access to all civilian prisoners within three months of detention. But that agreement too remains only on paper. “The families of the arrested fishermen suffer a lot. In absence of a source of income the education of their children takes a hit. The family doesn’t know when their near and dear one will be back and the uncertainty causes mental health issues too,” Desai added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/distraught-families-plead-with-india-pakistan-to-free-fishermen-on-i-day/articleshow/85136181.cms||---

Cops said the boys unintentionally came in front of the convoy. When CM came to review the construction of secretariat, his convoy came on to NTR Marg.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Abduction bid linchpin held||AHMEDABAD: Prashant Kamble, a Pune native said to be the prime accused in a bid to abduct an infant in an interstate racket, was apprehended in West Bengal by the local agencies, said sources. A team of Chandkheda police investigating the case left on Saturday afternoon to get custody of the accused. On Thursday, Chandkheda police, with the support of their counterparts in Jalpaiguri, West Bengal, unravelled the plot to send an 11-month-old girl to Pune for adoption to a willing couple. The couple was unaware that the child was about to get abducted from her parents. The cops, however, foiled the bid when it came to light that Bindu Sharma, the nanny who was hired to look after the girl by a couple based in Chandkheda, had sent her photograph to Kamble. Kamble, who has been identified by Bindu as the person who was to pay her and her husband for the girl, was out of bounds once the plot came to light. West Bengal police had also joined in the search. G V Chaudhari, the sub-inspector of Chandkheda police and the investigating officer of the case, said on Saturday that they have left to get Kamble’s custody. “His questioning will help us tie many loose ends in the narrative and also ascertain the roles played by different persons in the racket,” she said. Cops had said earlier that Kamble had helped Bindu forge adoption papers identifying her as the birth mother and had found a Bengali couple in Pune who were keen on adopting a baby. Bindu approached the couple and told them she was forced to give up the baby for adoption as she could no longer take care of the child due to her impoverished condition. The couple bought her story, initiated the paperwork and even made a monetary transaction to adopt the baby. However, they grew suspicious when Bindu could not give the baby’s birth date or other details that a mother would have on her fingertips. Based on the documents she had submitted, they called police in West Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abduction-bid-linchpin-held/articleshow/85138323.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Emergency works on hold as Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation delays payments||HYDERABAD: Several residential colonies across Greater Hyderabad might have to live with damaged roads and open manholes for a longer time. This, with contractors now threatening to stall even emergency works if the civic body fails to release bills pending since January. Emergency civic works of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) include construction of drains and repairs to existing ones, desilting and covering open drains, etc. These may be impacted in the coming days if the works are not resumed. “A huge pit has been dug up to take up box drain works, which could provide a permanent solution to the sewage problems that haunts us during the monsoon. This pit has been dug up right in front of our house. If the contractors stop the work at this point, we are afraid that even one spell of rain can lead to massive waterlogging in the area,” said Adbul Rahman, a resident of Mirjalguda in Secunderabad. The situation persists despite GHMC Contractors’ Association giving a representation to the commissioner to release the payment. Sharing pictures of open manholes, drainage pits in Charminar and Malkajgiri and commissioner office road, where works have been stalled, B T Srinivasan, general secretary, United Federation of Resident Welfare Associations, Greater Hyderabad said, “GHMC must ensure that the emergency civic works are not stopped under any circumstances. The residents are already suffering a great deal and facing serious threats due to open manholes and drains in several areas. The city cannot afford such delays in civic works, especially during the monsoon when most of these areas are prone to inundation.” GHMC Contractors’ Association decided to intensify their protest after the civic body failed to give them an assurance to release at least part of their dues so that they could complete the ongoing emergency works in several areas. “There are almost 2,000 contractors from 30 GHMC circles who are demanding release of pending dues. Almost 90% of the work has been put on hold. We request officials to at least give release orders for the pending bills of February and March so that we can continue the emergency works and resume the remaining works,” said R Hanumanth Sagar, general secretary, GHMC Contractors’ Association. “We request MAUD minister KT Rama Rao to intervene and give us an assurance or at least give us an appointment to discuss our issues,” the general secretary told TOI. However, when contacted, GHMC additional commissioner (Finance and IT) D Jaya Raj Kennedy refused to comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/emergency-works-on-hold-as-ghmc-delays-payments/articleshow/85139466.cms||Moulika.KV

The testimony appears to be reliable and trustworthy,” the court said. Special public prosecutor Jyoti Sawant cited the deposition of nine witnesses to seek the conviction of the accused Moti Razak (33) and Pintu Sav (34). Among the witnesses was bogus customer planted by the cops. A raid was conducted at Kamathipura brothel in 2015 and the accused arrested. As the age of the girls could not be proved, the court dropped the POCSO Act charges. The court has also directed to ensure that the premises where the brothel was run is closed. The court further directed the District Legal Aid Services Authority to provide necessary assistance to the women for availing Victim Compensation as per the Government Scheme, if they are yet to receive it.  “No compensation can be adequate nor can it be of any respite for the victim but as the court is duty bound to provide compensation, which may help in rehabilitation. The reputation that is snuffed out cannot be recompensed but then monetary compensation will at least provide some solace,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-men-get-seven-yr-ri-for-trafficking-young-women/articleshow/85140278.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Mumbai||Will launch a caller tune on danger of spitting: BMC to Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The city’s civic administration will launch a caller tune to tackle the menace of spitting in public places and has collected over Rs 38 lakh in fines till August 2, it informed the Bombay high court in an affidavit. In it affidavit, the BMC annexed posters and its public notices in English, Marathi and Hindi, saying people will have to fork out Rs 1,200 for spitting in public places and any failure to do so would make the defaulter liable to do at least one hour of community service. The August 5 reply by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in an anti-spitting public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Armin Wandrewala, listed a slew of steps it has taken, including on suggesstions that she made. Spitting is prohibited as it is one of the reasons attributed to the spread of Covid-19, said the BMC, and the affidavit says regarding its increase of fine from Rs 200 to Rs 1,200, the “file is put up before the chief account officer (revenue) for scrutiny.” The caller tune and television messages will spread awareness against the dangers of spitting and persuade people not to spit. There are 52 nuisance detectors and 30 marshalls per ward, across the city. The BMC said a mobile van to spread awareness in slums and crowded places, a helpline number 1916 to receive complaints of public spitting from citizens, and a ‘do not spit’ drive, posters on public toilets and walls, complaint boxes, instructions to the BEST undertaking that runs the public buses and various taxi unions to ensure no people spit are some of the steps to show its sincere efforts to sensitize people. On July 7, a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni had directed the BMC to create awareness against the perils of spitting in public through the audio-visual medium. The bench asked the government and police authorities to apprise their personnel on the need to implement civic discipline, so that it would deter the general public. The matter is to be heard next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-launch-a-caller-tune-on-danger-of-spitting-bmc-to-bombay-hc/articleshow/85140291.cms||Swati Deshpande

Two FIRs were registered after Vij’s visit. In the complaint picked up by the home minister during the surprise inspection of counterfeit notes at the police station, police registered a case under Section 489-A, (Counterfeiting currency notes or bank notes) and 489-B (Using as genuine, forged or counterfeit currency-notes or bank-notes) of the IPC at Sector-5 police station. In June 2021, deputy circle head of the bank alleged that some unknown person had deposited one note of Rs 100 and one note of Rs 200, which were later identified as counterfeit notes but no action was taken on the complaint. The police station also took action on another complaint which was pending with the Sector 5 police station. A complaint was given to the cops by Swaraj Chauhan, branch manager in Federal Bank, Sector-11. He said that one Manoj, a resident of Khark Mangoli, approached the bank and took a loan on gold of Rs 3.45 lakh on November 16, 2020. Bank officials said at the time of processing of the loan, acid/stone test was done and it appeared to be genuine. Accordingly, the loan was sanctioned and disbursed in the account of the accused, who withdrew it. Bank officials alleged that after a few months, the loan account became overdue and as per the process, branch officials contacted the accused for renewal. The accused visited the branch and asked for renewal of the gold loan with enhancement of loan amount on it. He was told that since his loan account was overdue, he would have to deposit the full amount first, after which he could take the loan. When the accused failed to deposit the gold loan amount, the manager called the goldsmith to check the amount of gold deposited in his name. While checking, the goldsmith found that the gold jewellery was fake and spurious. A police complaint was filed.

The incident reportedly took place on Saturday morning, when the inspector was driving his car. The loading rickshaw driver ended up causing minor scratches to the officer’s car. Enraged, the officer, who was in uniform, tried to stop the loading rickshaw, but in vain. The video depicts the officer allegedly abusing the driver and later slapping him for not agreeing to come to the police station. When contacted, the inspector said, “I was rushing to the police station, as I had to take the accused to the court. This driver tried overtaking my car from the wrong side and caused scratches on the left side. I should not have used abusive language and I regret my behaviour.” Taking cognizance of the incident, deputy commissioner of police (zone-II) Deepak Girhe reached out to the police station chiefs under his jurisdiction and asked them to ensure that the police personnel ensure decent public behaviour. Girhe told TOI, “Whatever has happened is unfortunate and dents police’s image in the eyes of the public.

Desai had taken Sweety’s body to Atali near Dahej, about 121km from their residence in Karjan near Vadodara, after her murder on June 4 to dispose of the body. The spot was chosen because Desai’s friend Kiritsinh Jadeja owned a roadside eatery there and the adjoining plot was abandoned. Desai used chemicals and burnt her body as Jadeja kept vigil. “The bones have been found from the spot, directly connecting Desai to the crime scene and Sweety’s murder,” said an investigator. “The first batch of bones sent to the Directorate of Forensic Sciences did not yield any results as the bones were badly charred due to very high temperature.” The investigator went on to say: “However, we are hopeful that the second batch sent recently will get some results.” Meanwhile, a batch of bones have been sent to forensic experts at the BJ Medical College to ascertain their structure and physiology. Sources aware of the developments said that the experts may be able to determine whether the bones found from the spot are of an adult woman matching Sweety’s description.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sweety-patel-murder-forensic-focus-on-bones/articleshow/85138399.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Dalit village assistant forced to prostrate, inquiry ordered||COIMBATORE: Immediately after a video of a man forcing a dalit village assistant to prostrate before him started doing rounds on WhatsApp on Saturday morning, district collector G S Sameeran formed a committee to probe the incident and directed police to register a case. The video shows 56-year-old Muthusamy, assistant to Odderpalayam village administrative officer Kalaiselvi, prostrating before 38-year-old K Gopalsamy, a resident of Gobirasipuram near Pogalur, at the village office on Friday. An official source said Gopalsamy had visited the office of the village administrative officer (VAO) on Friday to check some land documents. “Gopalsamy entered into a heated argument with the VAO when she asked him to produce valid documents to check the property details. He abused the village assistant by using his caste name when Muthusamy intervened and asked him to calm down. Muthusamy then slapped Gopalsamy, who forced the former to prostrate before him.” An onlooker, who recorded the incident using mobile phone camera, circulated the video on WhatsApp. On Friday night, Gopalsamy had lodged a complaint with the Annur police, seeking action against the VAO and her assistant, who slapped him. In his complaint, Gopalsamy said he had gone to the VAO office to inquire about a patta transfer. “Gopalsamy said his father’s property was transferred to the latter’s elder brother without his knowledge. It was when he questioned the VAO about this that Muthusamy slapped him,” a police officer said quoting the complaint. On Saturday, district revenue officer Leela Alex, who heads the inquiry committee that was formed by the collector, held an inquiry with Muthusamy, Kalaiselvi and Gopalsamy at Annur taluk office and submitted a detailed report to Sameeran. Superintendent of police S Selvanagarathinam also conducted an inquiry with the trio at Annur police station. The interrogation lasted for nearly two hours. The collector is expected to take further action based on the inquiry report. Members of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam and the Democratic Youth Federation of India had staged a protest at Annur on Friday, demanding the collector to take action against Gopalsamy for discriminating against the village assistant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dalit-village-assistant-forced-to-prostrate-inquiry-ordered/articleshow/85138419.cms||---

The women said they had stopped being partners in 2018 and were partners and directors “for namesake’’ and cannot be implicated in a cheating FIR registered in March 2021. Offering them no relief, Justice Bharati Dangre on August 6 said, “All that glitters is not gold—is what those who invested over Rs 5 crore with a prominent Pune jeweller, on an assurance of high returns, have perceived.” Not agreeing with submissions of their counsel, Justice Dangre said the private partnership firm of Jewellers fell within the ambit of financial establishment and hence MPID (Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in financial establishments) Act was applicable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-rejects-pre-arrest-bail-of-three-in-rs-rs-5cr-cheating-case/articleshow/85140342.cms||---

After the creation of Salem division, the MP said, the two routes were handed over to Palakkad division.Shanmugasundaram has attached a letter from the Pollachi Train Passengers’ Welfare Association along with his letter to the minister.B Mohan Raj, secretary, Pollachi Train Passengers’ Welfare Association, said, “Not a single express train was operated on Podanur-Kinathukadavu-Pollachi route for the past four years, despite spending crores of rupees on broad gauge conversion of Podanur-Pollachi-Dindigul section.” Presently, Madurai division begins 1km east of Pollachi junction towards Palani. Pollachi-Kinathukadavu route falls under Palakkad division and the Salem division begins a few kilometres after Kinathukadavu towards Podanur-Coimbatore. In short, the 22km stretch of railway line comes under the jurisdiction of three railway divisions.“This causes a lot of administrative issues in operating additional trains or restoring meter gauge trains on Podanur-Pollachi-Palani-Madurai section,” Mohan Raj said.The association, in its letter, said lack of digital display of train departure and arrival details, digital train coach position indicators, CCTV cameras and maintenance of RO water plants on platforms, toilets and platform floors would tell the sorry state of Pollachi railway section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/reallocate-pollachi-rail-section-to-madurai-division-mp/articleshow/85138426.cms||---

The district administration took steps to close the kilns after the high court ordered them to stop operation in March. When the kiln owners approached the HC seeking stay, the court deemed the units to be illegal, which led to the closure of the units.Coimbatore north revenue divisional officer Ravichandran, who led the team on behalf of the collector, said that inspection will be carried out for the next two days, after which the committee will send a report.The units operated for several years without any permission, said S Ganesh, an activist. “Falling in the Western Ghats, this is an ecologically-sensitive zone that has an elephant corridor. But officials in the revenue and mines departments allowed illegal operations after colluding with brick kiln owners, which led to exploitation of minerals worth crores of rupees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ngt-panel-assessing-damage-caused-by-brick-kiln-industry/articleshow/85138420.cms||---

Members of Pendu Sangharsh Committee, Chandigarh, Naujawan Bharat Sabha, Punjab Students Union (Lalkaar), Naujawan Kisan Ekta, Samuh Gurdwara Sangathan Chandigarh, Punjabi Lekhak Sabha, Numberdar Union of Chandigarh, Tarksheel Society and ‘Matka Chowk Team,’ which has been organising daily protests at the Sector 10 Rose Garden roundabout, also participated in the agitation, on the call given by manch president Sukhjit Singh Sukha Hallomajra and general secretary Devi Dayal Sharma. Speakers at the protest said Punjabi had been the official language of Chandigarh up to November 1, 1966, but it was changed after trifurcation of Punjab. Protesters described the government's move to make English the city's official language, as a conspiracy. A manch spokesperson said they were not against any other language and believed in a person learning as many languages as possible, but this could not be done at the cost of relegating the mother tongue to the backburner. The spokesperson said no one in Chandigarh identified English as their mother tongue, but it was still being used in offices and for official purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/protest-held-to-press-demand-to-identify-punjabi-as-uts-official-language/articleshow/85136601.cms||---

On Friday morning, residents of Dwarka, as well as heads of several villages in Delhi, had gathered — which was described as a mahapanchayat — near the burial chowk, violating Covid protocol. Many attendees were allegedly not wearing a mask either. The pradhans of many villages who attended the meeting said they would not allow the Haj house to come up “at any cost”. Earlier, in a letter, the RWA president of All Dwarka Residents Federation had written to the lieutenant governor that the action would disturb “brotherhood, harmony and peace” in the area and also cause communal problems. “Delhi government is trying to build its vote bank. If they want to build something, then they should construct a school, hospital or park instead of catering to just one community. There are already three existing Haj houses and there is no need to waste the taxpayers’ money like this,” said Ram Kumar Solanki, pradhan of Palam Village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/haj-house-protest-fir-for-violation-of-covid-norms/articleshow/85138477.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Lion land gets least funds for habitat||AHMEDABAD: As the Gujarat government did not submit proposals for wildlife habitat development in time, the Asiatic lions’ only abode ended up among the states getting the least amount of funds from the Centre. Gujarat is home not only to the lion but also to diverse wildlife populations including wild ass, sloth bear, and blackbuck. The data tabled in the parliament suggests that Gujarat received a meagre allocation of Rs 1.24 crore from the Union government for developing wildlife habitats in 2020-21, down 94% against Rs 22.32 crore in 2018-19. In fact, in 2019-20, the allocation for wildlife development in Gujarat was zero. According to sources in the state forest department, Gujarat had not asked for funds for wildlife habitat development. “If the state moves a proposal for wildlife habitat improvement and development, it is usually approved,” said a source in the state government. “A major requirement for funds for habitat improvement is for the Asiatic lions in Gir. However, amid the translocation controversy, proposals are not being moved.” The source added: “A major portion of the funds for wildlife conservation is allocated to Project Tiger and Project Elephant.” In the state budget for 2018-19, an outlay of Rs 100 crore was proposed for the conservation of Asiatic lions in Gujarat. “In the same year, the state had moved a proposal for ungulates and corridor improvement across wildlife habitats and got a higher allocation from the Centre,” said a top forest department official. “This was mainly for the sloth bear sanctuary. A couple of proposals were moved for Project Lion in the Saurashtra region.” The Gir wildlife sanctuary is the world’s only habitat of Asiatic lions whereas the sealine desert at the Rann of Kutch is the only habitat for wild asses in Gujarat. Five states and Union territories in India did not receive any allocation including Andhra Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Assam, Goa, Puducherry, and Delhi in 2020-21. Other places which received lower allocations include Chandigarh (Rs 25.16 lakh), Haryana (Rs 18.22 lakh), Chhattisgarh (Rs 1.04 crore), Jammu & Kashmir (Rs 80.63 lakh) and Telangana (Rs 36.59 lakh).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lion-land-gets-least-funds-for-habitat/articleshow/85138498.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Mumbai||Land allotted to refugee from Pakistan is her private property: Court||MUMBAI: A district court recently ruled that a piece of land allotted to a woman in Ulhasnagar years after she migrated from West Pakistan to India as a refugee following the 1947 partition was her private property. The court dismissed an appeal by the Postal Department, Thane, which claimed that the property was part of a site reserved for it in a 1974 development plan. The woman, Savitribai Motwani, now deceased, had first moved the lower court in 1996 after she received notices in the 1980s and feared losing the property. The trial court ruled in her favour in 2006, following which an appeal was filed against the order before the district court. Motwani died in 1997, leaving her daughter, Rekha Chhablani, as her legal heir. The court pointed out that the state through the administrator, Ulhasnagar Township and the managing officer and assistant administrator, Camp No 3, Ulhasnagar Township, had issued conveyance deeds in favour of Motwani after she had paid the reserve price. “Thus, the suit property had come out from the compensation pool property and thus it becomes a private property,” the court said. The court also held that mere reservation of the property for the Post and Telegraph department in the development plan was not enough to disallow the woman from claiming that it is her private property, particularly when a witness admitted that the department did not have a title to the property. “ .. that defendant No 3 (the Senior Supdt of Posts, Thane) has not produced on record documentary evidence only because either it is not in their favour or it is not available with them. Thus, defendant No 3 miserably failed to prove that the property was allotted in their favour and since then they are in peaceful possession of the same,” the court observed. Motwani’s plea had said that she was a displaced person within the ambit of the Displaced Persons (Compensation And Rehabilitation) Act. It was submitted that as per the government’s directions displaced persons from West Pakistan were accomodated in the Military Camp, Ulhasnagar. The property was known as compensation pool property and Motwani had occupied it prior to 1963. It was further submitted that there was an agreement between the Union government and Association of Displaced Persons for regularization of possession for displaced persons. It was contended that the occupation would be regularised for those who were in possession prior to May 1965. The plea contended that once the occupants paid the reserve price to the government, it became the “private property of the occupants”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/land-allotted-to-refugee-from-pak-is-her-pvt-property-court/articleshow/85140367.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The decision comes following requests from the sanitation workers, an official said, adding that at one or two sites such a facility has already been created. EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Agarwal said, during his visit to Pandav Nagar on Friday, the women workers shared the issue with him. “They said due to no provision for public washrooms or resting areas in residential colonies, including regularised and unauthorised, they face major problems. Considering they work for long hours and can’t go all the way to use public or community toilets always, we took note of their demand,” he said. At Pandav Nagar, the civic body identified a site in a park after inspection. “The workers also informed that they had no place to sit during lunch, except when there is a provision for a park in the colony. They added that people raise objections when they sit on their stairs for lunch or rest due to several reasons, which is why we have decided to develop such spaces in each of the 64 wards and asked the department to identify spaces,” the mayor added. At Pandav Nagar, work will start as soon as the budget is allocated. A similar site is already operational outside a primary school in Ghonda, where facilities for washrooms and resting have been provided for the staff, said the mayor. “The primary responsibility of the corporation is to ensure cleanliness in the area, but that will be possible only when we care for our staff. We are also stressing on constructing washrooms for men workers,” added the mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/toilets-in-parks-for-women-safai-workers/articleshow/85138518.cms||Vibha Sharma

The need of the hour is to unite and contribute our bit to mitigate the impact of the global crisis,” he said while addressing students at the Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, Parbhani, around 190km from here.Koshyari said the youth should constantly be encouraged to undertake creative projects. “The onus lies on the universities to instil confidence among the youth. Universities should extract the maximum potential from the youth for the cause of nation-building,” he added.Stating that agriculture has received due priority in Indian culture for ages, the governor said the field has many career and employment-generation opportunities that many youngsters of the country were unaware of.“Agriculture and allied fields will carry more opportunities that could make our youths self-reliant. The agricultural universities and teachers will have to play a major role in achieving this,” he said.Koshyari paid visits to different facilities and projects at the agricultural university — including the bamboo mission, national agricultural higher education project, and the library — with the university authorities and Parbhani district collector Anchal Goyal among others.The governor, who was on his last leg of the Marathwada tour, which has evoked sharp reactions from the MVA government, was scheduled to leave for Mumbai from Nanded airport on Saturday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/collective-efforts-needed-to-fight-climate-change-koshyari/articleshow/85134965.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Tribunal awards Rs 52 lakh to kin of biker killed by truck||MUMBAI: A Motor Accident Claims Tribunal recently awarded a compensation of Rs 52 lakh to the family of a 39-year-old small-time businessman who died after a truck rammed into his bike when he was on his way to Shirdi in 2016. While income-tax returns revealed the monthly income of the victim, Vilas Tamhane, was Rs 28,355, the tribunal factored earnings of Rs 20,833. The tribunal said that since the shop where he sold prescription glasses and lenses was rented, his income would reduce once his lease would have come to an end in three years and he was forced to move to another place. “Due to the the change in location of the business, deceased might have to also lose his goodwill and it would affect his earning capacity. Therefore, taking into consideration the up-down in the business, I am of the view that the reasonable income of the deceased can be considered at Rs 2.50 lakh (annually),” the tribunal said. The family frim Thane pegged his further monthly earnings at Rs 40,000 and sought a compensation of Rs 90 lakh. However, the tribunal calculated it to be only Rs 29,166, adding 40% future income loss as prescribed in an earlier order. The claim was submitted by Vilas’s wife, Jayashri Tamhane (29), two minor children and senior citizen parents in December 2016 against Lal Mohammed, truck owner and New India Assurance Co Ltd. The compensation will be divided between all five family members. The family submitted that Vilas and his friend Satish Hatnolkar had gone to Shirdi on November 9, 2016. While Vilas was the pillion rider, Hatnolkar was riding the bike. Around 9.30am when they were on the Shirdi-Shinganapur Highway, the truck came from behind in high and excessive speed and rammed into them. Vilas and his friend fell on the road. Vilas had sustained severe injuries on his head, stomach and limbs. He was rushed to the local hospital, where he was declared dead. The postmortem revealed that the stomach injury was fatal. While the insurance company denied the claims, the truck owner did not respond to summons. “After investigation, police have also found that an accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the truck by its driver, therefore the evidence adduced by the claimants on this point appears to be sufficient to conclude that applicants have discharged the burden that lies upon them to prove that an accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the truck by its driver,” the tribunal said. The tribunal said that the insurance company failed to examine the truck driver without any plausible explanation. “Undisputedly, driver of the truck has not challenged the prosecution. Therefore, I have no hesitation to hold that respondent (insurance company) failed to dislodge the burden that shifts upon them,” the tribunal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tribunal-awards-rs-52-lakh-to-kin-of-biker-killed-by-truck/articleshow/85140400.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Hyderabad||Fee woes: 1 lakh students’ no-show hits Telangana schools||HYDERABAD: About one lakh students from across 300 private budget schools of Hyderabad have been ‘missing’ from online classes over the last 12 months. Attributing this to the parents’ failure to pay fees, school managements on Saturday said that this data — collated by the Telangana State Recognised School Managements Association (TRSMA) — is indicative of two trends: Rise in number of dropouts and higher enrolment in free government schools. Of the 2,041 private recognised schools in Hyderabad, close to 1,800 are budget schools that charge an annual fee of up to Rs 35,000. The average strength of these schools — located in areas such as Mehdipatnam, Marredpally, Kukatpally — is between 250 and 500. Hit by the pandemic in March, 2020 these schools, like all others, were forced to transition to online classes. A year later, 300 of them are staring at closure with majority of their students ‘missing’ in action. “In many schools, the strength has dropped from 600 in 2019-20 to less than 300 in 2021-22 as many families with meagre or no income have not been able to pay fees or buy gadgets required to attend online classes. Multiple calls to parents have yielded no response. We are now wondering if we should consider these students as dropouts and shutdown our schools,” said S Madhusudan, advisor of TRSMA. He stressed the possibility of many students, from this no-show list, shifting to government schools without even seeking a transfer certificate. Incidentally, teachers from government schools admit to more students from private schools turning up in their institutions over the last one year. “We have observed an up to 20% rise in enrollment from private to government schools. This is largely owing to the inability to pay fees,” said Chava Ravi, general secretary of Telangana State United Teachers Federation. He was, however, quick to add: “Enrollment in government schools seems like a temporary arrangement for many parents until physical classes resume (when they wouldn’t need gadgets, etc.).” These dwindling numbers coupled with admissions in pre-primary and primary sections dropping to almost zero, has left school managements concerned about their survival. Given the dire situation of private budget schools, TRSMA is now collating more consolidated data on drop in enrollments across budget schools, learning outcomes among students etc., while urging the state government to reopen schools for physical classes. “Many parents are of the view that if there are no physical classes, there is no need to pay any fee and that their children will be automatically promoted to the next class. In such a situation, it becomes extremely difficult for budget schools to stay afloat,” said Uma Maheshwara Rao, correspondent of a private budget school. When TOI contacted R Rohini, district education officer, Hyderabad, for a comment, she said that they have received two or three closure applications from schools. “The TRSMA representatives reached out to me citing poor attendance for online classes. However, we are yet to independently verify their claims. We will extend help if schools seek closure citing genuine reasons,” said Rohini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fee-woes-1l-students-no-show-hits-t-schools/articleshow/85140392.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Ahmedabad||NREGA workers unpaid for 2 months: MLA Jignesh Mevani||AHMEDABAD: It’s mandated that payments under the employment guarantee Act, MGNREGA, be made within 15 days of the completion of work as per muster roll. But the Union government is yet to release payments for thousands of workers in Gujarat worth Rs 212.3 crore, some even pending for almost up to two months, alleged Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani. The data from the MGNREGA website compiled by the legislator suggests that tribal districts were the worst-hit after the pandemic. Dahod district depicted a pendency of Rs 46 crore, Panchmahal Rs 15.7 crore, while Mahisagar, Aravalli, Tapi, Chhota Udepur and Narmada showed pendency between Rs 10 crore and Rs 14 crore. It is worth pointing out that a worker is paid Rs 229 for a day’s work under this scheme. TOI is in possession of a letter from Banaskantha District Rural Development Agency, which has pleaded with the state. “We have not been able to make payments to our workers since May 30. We have payments pending to the tune of Rs 7.88 crore,” claims the letter. Mevani alleged, “This is a cruel joke on tribals who have been the worst-hit economically during pandemic months. Any delay in payments will force poor tribals to approach private money lenders and this will push them into a debt cycle. Already, the tribal community faces issues of malnourishment and lack of access to healthcare. This is very demoralising.” Citing the example of Banaskantha district, he said, “We had raised the issue of dues with the Banaskantha District Rural Development Agency. Following repeated requests, the officials confessed that the workers have not been paid their dues since May 30. But they were helpless as the Centre has not released any grant,” Mevani said. A letter was shot off to the state government only on August 4. Commissioner and secretary (rural development) Sonal Mishra said, “Gujarat is very prompt in raising demand for payments, but there are rare occasions when the process takes some time. Payments are released as per categories — SC, ST etc — and this is a systematic process. The present issue is being pursued at all levels and will be resolved very soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nrega-workers-unpaid-for-2-months-mevani/articleshow/85138540.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘Fight for NH-7 wildlife mitigation structures will be visible nationally’||Nagpur-based wildlife conservationist Milind Pariwakam, whose role has been instrumental in an over a decade-long campaign by multiple civil society organizations to get mitigation measures for tigers and other wildlife on the NH-44 (earlier NH-7), which passes through the vital Kanha-Pench corridor. The wildlife mitigation structures could be achieved after a long court battle. With more wildlife seen on NH-44, issues related to animal underpasses are emerging. The stretch on the MP side also has the world’s longest 1400-metre underpass. TOI talks to the wildlife biologist who works for the NGO Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT) and is also a member of the Srushti Paryavaran Mandal and the IUCN’s Connectivity Conservation Specialist Group and Transport Working Group. Excerpts... Q. Underpasses for wild animals were opened for traffic in 2018. When did you start the campaign to save the Kanha-Pench corridor? A. Proposals for expansion of the road were submitted way back in 2006-07. Even then, the forest officials in Madhya Pradesh were concerned about the negative impact of the road passing through the Kurai-Rukhad area of the corridor. There was a lot of pressure to go ahead with the highway expansion. Then working with the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), we filed a case with the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court in 2008. And within a year, the CEC submitted its recommendations suggesting an alternative alignment via Chhindwara after consulting experts, including those from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII). Q. Why wasn’t an alternative explored after the CEC said that no mitigation measures can compensate the ecological cost on NH-7? A. This is the problem with wildlife conservation today. Facts are changed based on pressure. The same WII, which in 2008-09 had given written submissions to the CEC in favour of the alternative alignment, did a U-turn in 2012. What was a highly fragmented corridor and needed urgent restoration inputs, was suddenly described as a corridor offering ‘excellent’ connectivity without any scientific evidence whatsoever. This scientific reversal somersault was essential to discredit the alternative alignment theory of the CEC. Q. What was the issue that made you move the high court? A: The Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court had passed orders in favour of tree felling along a section of the NH-44 in Maharashtra. This would have imposed a fait accompli and had to be challenged immediately. There were attempts to completely bypass the NBWL approval process and build the highway without any mitigation measures for wildlife. This also ignored the earlier recommendations of the CEC in 2008. Most of the major conservation organizations and individuals had given up on this battle as a lost cause. I had already challenged certain dilutions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and actively assisted the lawyers for NGO Srushti and other civil society organizations with multiple court cases in the NGT, CEC, Supreme Court and high court. Q. Why are mitigation steps in MP were not challenged? A. There was a concerted effort to bypass established legal procedures and avoid mitigation measures altogether in the section of the road passing through Maharashtra. Legal cases filed in the NGT ensured that the NBWL was not bypassed and the NHAI first conceded to build 750-metre underpasses on the Maharashtra side in the NGT. When the MP proposal was finally approved, there were mitigation measures already incorporated and the approval of the NBWL was also taken. Therefore, there were lesser grounds to challenge the same. Further, legal challenges are expensive and time-consuming and I was already stretched financially as an individual. Q.WII had suggested 37 wildlife structures in MP. Was the 1,400-metre underpass in the picture? A. In 2012, the WII report on mitigation structures suggested the said underpass of 2,000 metres, which was later whittled down to 800 metres in the revised 2015 report. Post the NBWL approval, in a meeting at the NTCA, I pushed for an increase from 800 metres and wanted the best section (Rukhad to Dudhia Tal) completely elevated. Finally, a 1,200-metre structure was decided upon. An additional 200-metre increase in the dimensions was decided by the field director of Pench Tiger Reserve, MP. I also pushed for the inclusion of noise barriers on the MP side as these would make mitigation measures more effective. All of these are over and above the NBWL recommendations. Q. But noise barriers are turning counter-productive? A. This is the first of its kind in the country. While they help funnel animals towards the underpasses and also prevent improper meat waste from being disposed under the various culverts and underpasses, some examples of wild animals getting trapped on the carriageway are being reported. The cause of these incidents needs to be looked at in detail and some modifications to the terminal end of the barriers and the height may be required if such incidents occur frequently. Q. If MP got the world’s longest mitigation structure and noise barriers, why Maharashtra couldn’t get the same despite the landscape being contiguous? A: Since 2004-06, forest officials in MP have consistently insisted on protecting the corridor in their area of the landscape and have been vocal in demanding mitigation measures. They supported the demands for mitigation measures for wildlife in various meetings. Conversely, officers in Maharashtra mostly remained silent in 2015. Only Sarjan Bhagat, the then PCCF (wildlife), put his foot down against political pressure. Many others helped us behind the scenes and did not want to be named. Bureaucratic apathy here is such that the 50-metre mitigation structure near Chorbahuli remains perennially flooded with water since the last three years. The moral of the story is that if you don’t ask for what you want, you won’t get it. Q. With animals still getting hit, do existing structures act as a safe passage? A. We cannot completely eliminate wildlife-vehicle collisions. However, we can always minimize it significantly. The science of road ecology offers a range of solutions not limited to animal underpasses. WCT’s field studies using camera trapping data show a wide range of animal species using the underpasses, including the gaur, which is the largest species in this part of the landscape. Animals may also demonstrate learning over a period of time. Scientifically designed solutions will be more effective and in case the problems persist over time, retrofitting of structures needs to be undertaken. Q. Even if wildlife structures are constructed, should such big linear projects be undertaken in such high-density corridor areas? A. There is no doubt that we need to keep some areas sacrosanct. Areas with a high density of animals such as protected areas should be a strict no-no for linear infrastructure development. The infrastructure can always be designed to bypass areas that are critical for wildlife. Q. Why did you decide to persist with the campaign and legal challenges? A. I got involved with this way back in 2008 as I wanted to do something to preserve the connectivity for wildlife offered by the Kanha-Pench corridor. In 2015, when the NHAI still refused to build anything more than 50-metre bridges, it quickly became a strategic issue and thus imperative to mount a legal challenge. This development would now set a precedent and it was vital that it sets the right example. The results of this are now seen nationally with multiple examples of animal underpasses are now a part of the road expansion process. Q. Union minister Nitin Gadkari says development activities on NHs passing through PAs are avoided to minimize the impact of highways on the wildlife habitat. Do you agree? A. Over the last few years, the attitude of the ministry of road transport (MoRTH) has certainly undergone a change. From an obstinate refusal to implement any wildlife mitigation measures on NH-7 in 2015, their own notifications now specify bypassing protected areas. However, implementation of these good intentions is lacking on a systematic basis and loopholes remain and the environmental protection laws have been effectively diluted. Take the example of the Satpura-Melghat corridor where trees were felled on the Betul-Bhopal highway without any mitigation measures. It is practically a repeat of the NH-7 story. So the minister should ask his officials why they have failed to incorporate safeguards for wild animals?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fight-for-nh-7-wildlife-mitigation-structures-will-be-visible-nationally/articleshow/85136724.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

But, unlike most kids of his age, this 16-year-old Telugu student living in Muscat runs an initiative that provides interest-free loans to women from poor backgrounds in developing countries. The initiative has so far helped change lives of over 1,000 poor women in 77 countries. Taking a cue from the Grameen Bank established by Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus in Bangladesh, young Sasankar raised about 10,000 Omani Riyal (Rs 19.8 lakh) through his classmates and their parents to finance the poor women living by running petty businesses. All his loans are interest-free with a recovery rate of 98.75%. Most of the women beneficiaries are farmers, weavers, petty traders and artisans. Sasankar has tied up with Kiva, a non-profit organisation based in San Francisco that does the background check and recommends beneficiaries. Once the beneficiary is identified, Sasankar extends assistance through Kiva. The micro-finance platform, Sustaining Women in Financial Turmoil (SWIFT), was set up in September 2020. Since then, Sasankar has assisted women in India, Albania, the Philippines, Ecuador and Kyrgyzstan among other countries. He told TOI that rather than donating money, he believed in extending interest-free loans to recycle the money and create an impact across the world. Sasankar, who hails from Nellore in Andhra Pradesh, said he first came to know about interest-free microfinancing during his internship with the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. He then chose to start something similar in Oman. “I asked for donations from 19 of my friends pursuing 8th to 10th grade from ABA Oman International School and founded SWIFT. Instead of spending the fund in charity, I decided to extend interest-free loans to women and perpetuate the benefit of one-time donation,” he said. “Since we have rolled out the loans, our repayment rate has been very high. Plus, they can withdraw their funds at any time,” Sasankar added. The repayment rate doesn’t come as a surprise as Kiva itself, which had given loans to the tune of 1.61 billion US dollars, also holds a repayment rate of 96.3% amongst four million borrowers. He credits his work to his parents and his teacher Aneesh Kumar Chellappannair, who guided the young lot. When asked why he specifically focused on ‘women in financial turmoil’, he explained, “I was shocked when I found that the unemployment rate amongst women in Oman alone is 12% which is more than the world average of 8%. I believe microfinancing can play a significant role in this direction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/nri-teens-loans-bail-out-1k-women-globally/articleshow/85140425.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The crime rate of Nagpur city has come down significantly during the current regime of MVA-led state government, as compared to the past government,” he said, while addressing a press conference at Police Gymkhana on Saturday. During her visit to the city on Friday, Wagh had said reports of gang rape of a girl and a suicide following alleged physical assault by city police clearly show that the crime situation in the city is grim. Regarding Raut’s suicide, the district guardian minister said that he was a habitual fake caller and an alcoholic. As for the gang rape, he said that the survivor was mentally challenged and that normally, such patients are unable to realize their exploitation, thus becoming prone to such crimes. “Even in the recent murder of a youth, his friends were the killers. In all these cases, one cannot tag the city as the crime capital,” said Raut. The minister said the crime detection rate of the city has increased by almost 5%. “In seven months of this calendar year, the city police recorded 70% detection, while previously it was 65%,” he said. He, however, admitted that behavioural changes are needed among the beat patrolling staff and directives have been given to the police commissioner Amitesh Kumar to ensure that they (cops) behave politely. “Nagpur city can become crime-free if there is good coordination between citizens and cops,” the minister pointed out. To a query, Raut admitted that despite transfers, cops are reluctant to join their postings in Nagpur city police. As a result, many important posts like joint commissioner of police, 11 assistant commissioners of police and several posts of police sub-inspectors were lying vacant for more than a year. He claimed that all posts would be filled within a fortnight. On preparations for the projected third wave of coronavirus, the district guardian minister said that the city needs to be well-prepared for the coming three months as festival season too will start soon. "The third wave has already hit Nashik with the detection of patients infected with the Delta plus variant. The virus may hit the city too, anytime. Even though the district has achieved zero death rate with single-digit Covid-19 cases, we need to be careful,” he said. Raut, however, refused to comment on why restaurants and hotels were not being allowed to do business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-police-doing-good-job-dist-guardian-minister/articleshow/85136728.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Pune||Comply with SoPs strictly if schools reopen, say experts||Pune: Experts have said that the state education minister Varsha Gaikwad’s statement about the possible reopening of schools in the state in a phased manner from August 17 is a move in the right direction. While schools in Covid-free villages have already been functioning for students from Std VIII to XII since mid-July, teachers also feel that strict measures need to be followed while reopening educational institutions in urban areas, as there are more opportunities for the virus to spread in crowded spaces than in sparsely populated areas. Gaikwad on Friday had said that the state will decide on reopening schools in a phased manner from August 17. “Already schools are functioning for Std VIII to XII students in Covid-19 free villages. In the second phase, we are thinking of allowing Std V to VIII to be reopened in rural areas, where Covid-19 cases have been low or where restrictions imposed by the local administration have been relaxed. Similarly, in cities, we are thinking of reopening schools physically for Std VIII to XII, in areas where cases are low, or the administration has relaxed restrictions. The situation will be constantly reviewed, and a committee would be formed under the local administration to decide about reopening schools in each area,” said Gaikwad. Nandkumar Kakirde, director of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan that runs two schools in the city with over 1,500 students in each, said the teaching community wanted schools to reopen as online education is not as effective, despite their best effort. “We want schools to open because the learning outcomes are not achieved during online sessions. While in school, we will obviously ensure social distancing and other precautions are adhered. However, the same cannot be said about transport. I think transport of students to and from the school without overcrowding will be a tough problem to crack in cities,” he said. Mrinalini Bhosale, principal of Vikhe Patil Memorial School, said that even if the government allows reopening, it may not be easy to get parental consent to send their children to school. “Parents are apprehensive about sending their kids to school or crowded places. At the beginning of the term, when we were discussing these matters, the parents’ opinion was that unless and until children are vaccinated, they do not want to send them to school. I think parents of older children may still agree to sending them for practicals. Plus, with internal assessments becoming important, even examinations can be held at school in an offline manner. Hence, I think blended education is the way forward, at least for some time,” said Bhosale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/comply-with-sops-strictly-if-schools-reopen-say-experts/articleshow/85138583.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Delhi||Rod falls from 20th floor, pierces man’s skull; removed after 4-hr op||Ghaziabad: A 24-year-old man, whose skull was impaled by an iron rod that fell from the 20th floor of an under-construction building on July 31, has a “90% chance” of survival after doctors managed to remove the rod during a four-hour-long surgery at a private hospital. There is, however, damage to the right lobe of the construction worker’s brain where the rod went right through the cranium, and the left side of his body is paralysed. He was brought to Flores Hospital by co-workers at the construction site. The rod that did the damage was a long one, the kind used in scaffoldings. The worker, whose name is being withheld following a request from the hospital to maintain the patient’s confidentiality, is from Jharkhand. On July 31, he was working at the construction site in Pratap Vihar when the rod came off the shuttering when it was being dismantled. As other workers shouted at him to move away, the labourer looked up. By the time he could react, the rod – which workers who brought him to the hospital claimed was 20 feet – it had struck him and speared through the skull. Dr Abhinav Gupta, the neurosurgeon who conducted the surgery on July 31 with a team of seven doctors, said the patient would need a few more operations. One of those will be to restore the skull bone. “ I had to open half the skull to separate the iron rod from the bone. The toughest part was to remove the iron rod from the brain without doing any further damage to it. The skull bone has now been kept under the skin in the abdominal wall to keep it viable. We are monitoring the patient closely and the outcome looks positive,” Dr Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rod-falls-from-20th-floor-pierces-mans-skull-removed-after-4-hr-op/articleshow/85138589.cms||Abhijay Jha

The division bench appointed a lawyer to represent him. After much persuasion by the HC bench last month, Darshan Parmar did not agree to continue with his case and asserted that he was fed up with the long pendency saying he did not want a lawyer from the legal aid service. His lawyer had stopped appearing in the case for the last few hearings. However, the judges decided not to heed the convict’s irrational demand for dismissal of his case, which includes other convicts too, and appointed advocate Hardik H Dave to represent Parmar. Parmar is serving his sentence at Sabarmati Central Jail in connection with a case of rioting and causing hurt to people along with two other convicts.

---||Aurangabad||Marathwada: 91% rain deficiency in Aug||Aurangabad: Marathwada has registered an average of less than 4mm rainfall in August so far, leading to around 91% rainfall deficiency in the third month of the monsoon. With the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting no major revival of the monsoon in Aurangabad and some other parts of the region in at least the next four days, the shortfall of rain is likely to increase further. As per the official data, the region comprising eight districts received surplus of 145.5% (466 mm) rainfall in the first two months of the current rainy season since June 1. The absence of rainfall activity began in the second half of the fourth week of July and the lean has continued since.Parbhani district has the highest of around 98% rainfall deficiency in August, followed by Beed (96%), Latur (95%), Osmanabad (94%), Jalna (92%), Hingoli (89%), Nanded (87%) and Aurangabad (86%). The region, as a whole, has received 470 mm rainfall so far since June 1, which still accounts for surplus rainfall of 129% due to a good run of monsoon in June and July. Marathwada, which has received 69 % of the season’s rainfall (June to September), had reported 121% normal rain during the corresponding period last year, show official data. As per the Met office, Aurangabad and many other parts of Marathwada would only witness generally cloudy skie with chances of light rain or drizzle.Shriniwas Aundhkar, director of city-based APJ Abdul Kalam Astro Space and Science Centre, on Saturday said revival of the monsoon may take place over parts of Marathwada after August 15. “The monsoon had its lingering journey over the central parts of India during the second half of July, which affected the subsequent weather conditions. Depression is developing over the Bay of Bengal, which could again produce conducive conditions for the monsoon in the region,” he said.The dry phase of the monsoon could pose problems for the farming community. The agricultural department authorities have already advised irrigation measures to deal with possible stress to the kharif crops and gear up for the pest control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marathwada-91-rain-deficiency-in-aug/articleshow/85135043.cms||---
---||Pune||Students seek mark sheet with their absolute scores||Pune: A few students from Symbiosis Statistical Institute (SSI) have sought mark sheets based on absolute marks obtained by them in all the exams, along with the relative grading mark sheet, as it can reduce problems faced by them when applying for higher education or jobs. Relative grading of students is a practice in many universities. Vidya Yerawdekar, pro-chancellor of Symbiosis International University said the university follows a relative grading system and the formula for conversion of grades into percentages is available on the mark sheet itself.“The university has also been giving conversions when students request. However, there is only one student from this institute who has been seeking percentage calculation based on absolute marks which is not permitted by the university. We follow the relative grading system as mandated by the UGC,” she added. TOI talked to six students of the MSc in Applied Statistics (2019-2021) and one student of the first batch (2018-19). They all said they needed the absolute marks obtained for the sake of transparency. “The relative grading system works well when the number of students in a batch is high. In our class, there are just 40 students. So, if there is an exam of 200 marks and the topper scores 200, s/he gets an O (outstanding) grade, if I score the second-highest marks of 199, I will get an A+ grade, the fourth-highest marks, of 197 will get B+ grade, and the person who gets the lowest score, even if it is 193, will get P or the passing grade only.,” a student, who was denied a job opportunity because he had low-grade points, said. Another student said despite clearing the entrance and interview for a higher education institute, he was denied admission because he had low-grade points. “If my absolute marks were converted to grade points, then I would have easily scored above 6.5,”another student said.Bhushan Patwardhan, former vice-chairman of the University Grants Commission, said, “If a university follows a credit system with approved grading pattern, then marks won’t come into the picture. There is nothing like marks, only grades. Earlier, teachers used to give first marks and convert them into grades. Now, in many universities, this doesn’t happen and they only give grades. Pupils cannot insist on getting marks. The university can refuse it.”Activist Ajit Abhyankar said that the college should release the absolute marks of the students for the sake of transparency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/students-seek-mark-sheet-with-their-absolute-scores/articleshow/85138590.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Metro footfall crosses 2 lakh mark in 3 weeks||KOLKATA: Metro on Friday breached the 2 lakh mark in ridership for the first time after the services resumed on July 16, following the second Covid break. The last time the North-South corridor, the city’s lifeline, attained this milestone during the pandemic was on January 24, when the number services running was 240. The carrier clocked 2,02,624 footfalls on Friday, with 220 services, within 22 days of resuming runs. “The weekday rush is going up fast. At this rate, we will have to add more trains to maintain social distancing,” said an official. With bus services in the city yet to normalize, Metro has become the main mode of commute. The state allowed Metro to operate only for five days a week, with 50 % commuters. “It’s also the cheapest. As fuel prices have hit the roof and taxis, normal and app-cabs have turned way too expensive,” said Ayan Sanyal, an executive who uses the entire 32km of the North-South line, from Dakshineswar to Kavi Subhas stations. The Bally resident said, “I pay Rs 25 only to cover the distance in just over an hour. With local train services being suspended, I had a harrowing time reaching office in Karunamoyee beyond Tollygunge when Metro was off for 61 days. I faced similar pain for 176 days during the nationwide lockdown last year.” When Metro had resumed services after last year’s lockdown on September 14, 2020, ridership was only around 20,000. But after the second wave, traffic was high from the very beginning of resumption, prompting the authorities to add more trains—192 to 220 services—extend hours. Ridership jumped from 1.2 lakh to 1.7 lakh in the first seven days. During the past one week, it was 1,81,801 on Wednesday, 1,93,174 on Thursday and crossed the 2 lakh mark on Friday.

The second wave of Covid in Maharashtra was more serious than the first, and the construction sector went through a difficult period during the lockdown due to the rules laid down by the state government,” said Anil Pharande, president, Credai, Pune Metro. “Large players have been able to provide additional facilities and retain a segment of the migrant workers, but smaller developers are still struggling. Also, the supply chain of construction materials remains badly impacted. This affects completion timelines,” said Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock. “This will help in reducing the possibility of litigations in future regarding missed deadlines,” said Vineet Goyal, managing director, Kohinoor Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rera-extension-order-brings-relief-to-realtors/articleshow/85138608.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

As reported by TOI, the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) was in the city inspecting station and different on-going works. According to a press release issued by MahaMetro, CMRS has permitted the agency to run trains on Sitabuldi and Kasturchand Park section and has also certified the Zero Mile Freedom Park and Kasturchand Park stations. “The commissioner and his team had conducted an inspection between August 3 and 5 and had expressed satisfaction over the passenger amenities and safety arrangements of the two stations,” the release stated. According to officials, trains are already running between Khapri to Sitabuldi metro stations on Orange Line and on Aqua Line between Sitabuldi and Lokmanya Nagar. “Now, citizens can enjoy better connectivity. The two stations are located in the historical part of the city having iconic structures like Sitabuldi Fort, Vidhan Bhavan, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), etc. They are close to Civil Lines, which has large number of government, semi-government and private offices and Sadar, which is one of top commercial areas of the city,” added officials. The Zero Mile Freedom Park Station will be a 20-floored building having four levels of parking. There will be 13 commercial floors above the station. The Kasturchand Park station has all modern amenities. In another good news for the city, MahaMetro is converting about 40,000 square feet area surrounding Zero Mile station into a public park named ‘Freedom Park’ to commemorate the 75th year of country’s independence. The park will comprise of a history wall, war trophy — T55 battle tank, amphitheatre, Nagpur metro’s information centre, stepped plaza, arches of glory, seating plaza and plaza entrance areas. As per officials, the park is in completion stages. “The T-55 tank has been given by Ministry of Defence to MahaMetro as a war trophy to symbolize the valour of the Indian Army in various wars. The T-55 tanks were introduced by Russia in the years following the Second World War,” said officials. While the history wall will display the events related to freedom struggle from the first war of independence until the achievement of freedom in 1947 associated with Nagpur, the amphitheater will have cultural activities related to history of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/metro-to-soon-ply-between-sitabuldi-kasturchand-park-via-zero-mile-freedom-park-station/articleshow/85136759.cms||Manka Behl

---||Delhi||Staying safe: From Rs 25 crore, Covid fines in Delhi jump Rs 11 crore in a month||NEW DELHI: Delhi government collected Rs 36.2 crore in July as fine from people for violating Covid rules on masks and social distancing. In June, the collection was Rs 25.2 crore and in May, Rs 15.1 crore. The number of bookings has significantly increased going up from 85,000 in May to 1.6 lakh in June and 2.1 lakh in July. These figures, presented at Friday's Delhi Disaster Management Authority meeting to review the pandemic situation, indicate a more robust crackdown on violation of Covid norms after economic activities were permitted. With the crowds in markets and people out in the streets growing, the focus is now on enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour. For this purpose, 159 enforcement teams with 129 vehicles have been deployed in the 11 districts. In May, 1,803 FIRs were lodged against transgressors. This rose to 4,148 in June and 6,424 in July. “The district authorities have been asked not to tolerate violations because they pose a risk to the health and life of others,” said a government source. Delhi permitted various economic activities in a phased manner after reviewing the impact of the lockdown on the Covid management exercise. The unlock began from May 31, the government permitting manufacturing units and construction activities in the first phase, before allowing markets, malls, restaurants, gyms, yoga institutes and commercial activities. Before the relaxation of the lockdown, the focus was on containing infection because of which markets and public places were closed down. But after that, with an increasing number of people leaving their home for work or shopping, attention has shifted to enforcing Covid-appropriate behaviour. In a meeting to review Covid situation on Wednesday, there was concern at the fairly widespread violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour in Delhi Metro and other public transport. Delhi Police and DMRC were advised to ensure that the protective protocols were strictly enforced. The enforcement thrust is important because a large number of people are yet to be vaccinated in the city. Delhi government’s health department estimates that at the present pace of vaccine supply, the capital will need a year more to complete full vaccination for all its citizens aged 18 years and above. Delhi has around 1.5 crore beneficiaries who are above 18 years old and eligible for vaccination and so three crore doses are required to give them their two doses. Till August 5, over 76 lakh individuals had received the first dose (50% of the total eligible population) and 28 lakh had been administered both doses. According to a report presented at Friday’s DDMA meeting, 45 lakh vaccine doses are needed every month to complete the full vaccination of all eligible Delhiites by December, but at the present rate of vaccine supply it will take till July/Aug 2022 to fully vaccinate them. Delhi has a daily capacity to inoculate three lakh people. The Covid situation in the capital is currently under control, with the positivity rate having declined to a low 0.06%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/staying-safe-from-rs-25cr-covid-fines-jump-rs-11-crore-in-a-month/articleshow/85138652.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Pune||Pune: Property registrations dive in Purandar taluka||PUNE: Property registrations in Purandar taluka, the proposed site for the new Pune airport, has taken a further hit following the developers’ wait-and-watch stance in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and the state government’s failure to arrive at a final decision. The property registration department’s data revealed that the declining trend persisted in the entire taluka and not just the seven villages marked for the proposed airport. Sub-registrar of Saswad Anil Roundhal said, “There has been an overall drop in registrations in the last two years in Purandar taluka. The pandemic only aggravated the decline. In the last four months (April-July) , Purandar taluka has registered only 43 documents. There has been nearly 20% drop in registrations in 2020-21 when compared to 2019-20.” Purandar taluka comprises 111 villages. In 2019-20, the property registrations in the vicinity of the seven villages earmarked for the proposed airport had nosedived over 50% as compared to the previous financial year. In 2019-20, the number of registrations had plunged to 38 and the stamp duty collection stood at Rs 23.34 lakh as against 87 registrations in the seven villages — Pargaon, Ekhatpur, Munjwadi, Kumbharvalan, Udachiwadi, Vanpuri and Khanavadi — in 2018-19, amounting to the stamp duty collection of Rs 48.65 lakh. “This year too the seven villages have not raked in much investments. With opposition from the villagers, investors or developers are not coming forward. There is absolutely no surety about the site now,” stated an official. After the airport was proposed in Purandar, a number of projects were announced three years ago, which failed to find any takers. The residents interested in the projects are now waiting for the final decision from the new government. A developer said the investors interested in the projects about two years ago had recently told him to alert them only after there was some movement on the new airport project front. After a Covid review meeting, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar even went on to add that there was no clarity yet about the site of the airport. Landowners from Purandar said that they are fed up with the long wait. “Why can’t they (the government) decide on it soon? There is a lot of confusion whether the site will remain in Purandar or move back to Chakan.” Recently, the residents of the adjacent villages from the proposed site too carried out a signature campaign that they wouldn’t allow the airport in their village. In the new proposal, which is yet to be cleared, land is to be acquired in Mavdi, Pimpri, Rajuri, Naugaon, Rise-Pise and Pandeshwar villages. Officials from the administration said there was no progress on this proposal either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/property-registrations-dive-in-purandar-taluka/articleshow/85138642.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Municipal corporations in Delhi plan more CNG furnaces at crematoria||NEW DELHI: Municipal corporations are planning to set up more CNG units at cremation grounds. Also, to ensure smooth operations throughout the year, they have decided to maintain the units either through NGOs or even themselves. Most of these crematoriums where CNG units are installed are operated by NGOs at present. East Delhi Municipal Corporation has four CNG furnaces installed at two of its cremation grounds — Karkardooma and Ghazipur. “Two units are installed in each of these cremation grounds and the NGOs are already supervising the operation of these crematoriums. But considering the increasing demand of these environment friendly units and to ensure their smooth operation, we have decided to engage the engineering department for time-to-time maintenance,” said an official. “Also, we have plans to install more furnaces at two other cremation grounds in Seemapuri and Jwala Nagar. The project will be implemented soon.” In South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) there are three crematoriums — Subhash Nagar (two CNG furnaces) Punjabi Bagh (three units) and Green Park (two). “We have a total of eight furnaces and the process of constructing two more is going on. While the operation and maintenance of CNG units at Punjabi Bagh is done by an NGO, there is a plan to give rest of the units to the NGO for day-to-day running and overall supervision,” said a SDMC official. In north Delhi, there are six CNG furnaces installed at Nigambodh Ghat. “The task for their maintenance and operation has been given to a NGO. We had plans to construct such units at one more place, but the place could not be concretised. During the pandemic there was a long queue/demand for these units, which is why their maintenance became even more important for us,” said former mayor and councillor from Sadar Bazar Jai Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-plan-more-cng-furnaces-at-crematoria/articleshow/85138658.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Parched Bundelkhand to get tap water by December’||LUCKNOW: In its bid to supply piped water to 12 lakh families in water-starved areas of Bundelkhand and Purvanchal before the assembly elections, the state government is racing against time to complete projects under the ‘Har Ghar Nal Yojana’. Principal secretary, Namami Gange, Anurag Srivastava said trial run for several projects would start within next two months and the government would be able to start the water supply to Bundelkhand and Vindhya regions from December. “The government has completed about 80% work of water treatment plants in various districts of Bundelkhand, like Jhansi and Mahoba. Construction work is almost complete in over 50% of the plants. We plan to complete the work six months before the deadline,” he said. Under the central Jal Jeevan Mission, 467 projects are being implemented in Bundelkhand, 43 of which are surface water schemes and the remaining based on groundwater. Srivastava said the schemes would benefit about 74 lakh people in 3,823 villages. “Projects, which include a network of water treatment plants, overhead tanks and a massive network of pipes, we will provide 11,95,265 water connections in 3,823 villages. These projects will benefit 2,608 gram panchayats in seven districts of Bundelkhand,” a government spokesperson said. Project management consultant, Jal Jeevan Mission, Pankaj Singh gave the example of Budhpura village in Jhansi where supply will start in November. “Under the Budhpura drinking water scheme, we are making intake wells, water treatment plant, clear water reservoir and overhead tanks at zonal levels. About 14 tanks have already been constructed. Water for this project will be drawn from Matatila Dam in Lalitpur,” he said. Executive engineer, Jal Nigam, Mahoba, Kamlesh Singh Tomar said over 80% construction work on Mahoba’s Lahchura Kashipura village group pipe drinking water scheme had been completed and preparation was on for the trial run of the scheme in October. This scheme is being executed at a cost of Rs 233 crore and will benefit 44,000 households.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/parched-bkhand-to-get-tap-water-by-dec/articleshow/85140451.cms||---
---||Pune||On stage to online, theatre transcends boundaries to adapt to the pandemic||Pune: Staging theatre online has been a different kind of ball game for theatre artists, requiring them to emote before the camera and making use of filmmaking techniques and editing software to create the right impact. The switch to the digital medium has not been easy for them. “We experimented for days with different cameras and editing software,” said theatre artiste Ritika Shrotri. “It takes time and quite a few bad performances to bond with camera. But once you do, there’s nothing like it. The detailing for an actor goes beyond acting and the craft, on to backstage management,” said theatre actor Renuka Gatlewar. Often the artists have to push the boundaries of creativity, making the best use of light, sound and camera angles. “In one of our productions, we showcased the meeting of two lovers in a jungle when it suddenly starts pouring. In reality, the actors stuck tree branches in their bathrooms and turned on the showers to create the effect of rain,” said director Dhanashree Heblikar. Newcomer Siddharth Ahluwalia said, “Since we are not performing on stage where the audience can see every move, camera handling and positioning of the frames, capturing important movements, is vital.” Actor Sahil Sharma said, “Placement of the camera and lights is important to hide unnecessary part of the background as we perform from our home.” Veteran theatre artists see a silver lining in theatre production going online. “Performances that were once inaccessible have reached audiences across the globe, doing theatre from home forced performers to express themselves in their most minimalist forms because of which we saw a boost in creativity,” said thespian Chezan Lawyer. Said theatre director Abhijeet Choudhary, “I had to rethink my vision at the initial stage not only in terms of characterisation but also in terms of setting up background, lights etc. The screen shift time from one actor to another required some time, so the dialogues needed to be longer,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/on-stage-to-online-theatre-transcends-boundaries-to-adapt-to-the-pandemic/articleshow/85138613.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Akhilesh said such attacks on his father will invite similar reactions from him aimed at the CM and his father. At an event in Lucknow on Friday, Yogi was asked to comment on Akhilesh’s allegations that BJP only believes in ‘shilanyas’(laying foundation stone) and not getting the projects completed. It was here that Yogi said a grand Ram Temple was coming up at Ayodhya for which “Unke abbajaan to kehte the ki parinda ko bhi par nahi marne denge”. “The BJP CM should mind his language.

He said BJP’s manifesto talked about doubling farmers’ income but what happened to the promise.

Many other developers have employed similar tactics to cash in on the “dream” of the upcoming airport. “It is an open plot of 55 acres and just five kilometres from Purandar. One can imagine how prices in and around the area will rise when the construction of the airport begins. We are selling 11 gunthas at just Rs 8.5 lakh. The airport will definitely come up here and people interested in buying plots shouldn’t miss the chance,” an employee of the firm distributing the pamphlet told TOI. Meanwhile, residents of the seven villages in Purandar, where land is to be acquired alongside land in three Baramati villages, who had initially protested against the project, are quiet. “Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar have said no site has been finalized,” Nayagaon resident Rajendra Kad said. An MADC official said land acquisition for the project cannot start unless the site is finalized. “We have no clue when it will start,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/developers-continue-to-cash-in-on-airport-plan/articleshow/85138647.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Many aspirants from Pune ace third JEE Main||PUNE: When Vedant Agrawal (18) attempted his second JEE Main in July, he was almost certain that he would cross the 99 percentile benchmark that he had set for himself. So, when the results of the third JEE Main were announced on Friday night, Vedant was pleasantly surprised to find his assumption to have come true as he scored 99.96 percentile. “In my first attempt in February, I scored just 98.92 percentile. Since JEE Advanced is extremely tough to crack and there is no surety on whether you would score high enough marks to get into a good branch at a good IIT, I wanted to be sure to at least get enough marks to be able to get into a good NIT, as a backup option. Hence, I attempted the exam again in July. Now, I will prepare for the Advanced examination in October,” said Agrawal, who hails from Dhule. Many students from the city recorded 99 percentile in the third JEE Main, which was held on July 20, 22, 25, and 27. Lalit Kumar, founder director of Prime Academy, said that many of the students scoring about 99 percentile or above in JEE Main 1 or 2 have not appeared for the third JEE Main as they have been concentrating on JEE Advanced and they wanted to avoid going to crowded locations during the pandemic. Durgesh Mangeshkar, founder-director of IIT-PK, advised students who have seen their score dipping in the third attempt to seek solace from the fact that the best of four percentiles will be taken into account for every student and there is one attempt remaining for them to still improve their final score. “Students, who have scored over 98 percentile in the best of three exams, must focus only on JEE Advanced now. On the other hand, those students, who have scored between 85 and 98 percentile, may work to further improve their scores in JEE Main in the fourth attempt by taking mock tests with analysis,” said Mangeshkar. The National Testing Agency (NTA) will be conducting one more session of JEE Main. The fourth and final session will be the last chance for candidates to improve their results. The last session of JEE Main will be held for both BTech and BArch aspirants on August 26, 27, and 31 and September 1 and 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/many-aspirants-from-city-ace-third-jee-main/articleshow/85138678.cms||Ardhra Nair

The committees stressed on stepping up the ‘yellow line’ campaigns near schools to mark the 100m boundaries among other measures. The collector, who is the president of the district level committees for NTCP and NOHP, has underlined the need to create awareness by the education department against tobacco misuse near institutions which cannot have any sale or usage of such substances within 100 metres of its premises. Vimala R has also stressed on the co-ordination of different departments like home (police), education, agriculture, health and food and drugs administration for stricter implementation of COTPA 2003. She pointed out during the meeting that despite the law in place there had been rampant violations which need to be checked with multi-pronged approach. The collector also instructed heads of every department to put up anti-tobacco messages at prominent places underlining the information about action to be initiated against misuse in government premises. DySP Sanjay Purandhare, who was present at the meeting, had informed the collector about the role of the police department in enforcing anti-tobacco laws. Dr Danish Iqbal, one of the members of the committee, had informed about action initiated against 25 persons for violating COTPA in the last one year. “Around 55 schools have been covered under the Yellow Line campaign,” he said, adding, around 140 schools in the district have been declared tobacco free. Assiatnt civil surgeon Dr Nitin Gulhane said the two committees would now step up the awareness campaign against tobacco under the supervision of the collector. “Action against violators needs to be taken and highlighted to develop a deterrence mentality,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collector-urges-for-zero-tolerance-towards-tobacco-within-100m-of-schools/articleshow/85136793.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 1875 book first gave glimpse into the ‘lost port city’||AHMEDABAD: Much before ASI archaeologist Jagat Pati Joshi discovered the Indus Valley site of Dholavira in 1964, an education inspector of the erstwhile Kutch state had travelled to the spot in early 1870s and had diligently made note of the site on Khadir Bet (Dholavira). The Dholavira site was inscribed as a world heritage site on July 27. The writer introduced the site as a “lost port city of Kutch” which was once surrounded by sea. The education inspector’s name was Dalpatram Pranjivan Khakhar, who was appointed by the Kutch state to teach history and geography in the early 1870s. Khakhar travelled the length and breadth of the state to record undocumented places and later got Vartaman Press to publish his book titled ‘Kutch Ni Bhugol Vidya’ in 1875. Quite interestingly, on page 35, Khakhar mentions his first visit to the site. “The whole place is strewn with remains from a past city. This unknown city is located on a mound on Khadir, an island that was once surrounded by the sea.” He added, “Locals claim that a certain ‘Ranaji’ ruled this place that had excellent trade relations with nations across the seas. But soon the city and its dwellers moved, leaving behind the ruins.” Khakhar even made a detailed map of Kutch including Khadir and surrounding areas. He also mentions that Khadir has a population of 1,933 persons and is constituted of three small villages Ghadhado, Dholaviro and Janan. “Khakhar mentions that Dholoviro had a population of 361 persons and was among the most isolated location on Khadir bet,” says city-based historian Rizwan Kadri. He adds, “Khakhar realized that children in Kutch knew very little of their ancient history. He then requested Pragmalji Bahadur of Kutch state to support him in his project of documenting places that can be studied in future by historians or archaeologists,” says Kadri. During the project, Khakhartook detailed notes on popular legends and information people had of the ancient sites for later investigation..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/1875-book-first-gave-glimpse-into-the-lost-port-city/articleshow/85138701.cms||---

---||Pune||Most professional courses receive lukewarm response||Pune: Not just engineering but registration for the Common Entrance Tests (CET) for admission to hotel management, architecture and MBA courses have dipped in the state this year as compared to 2020.The slowdown in various industries, coupled with a lack of employment despite paying a high fee for these courses, is the main reason for the declining numbers, say experts. However, just like engineering courses, where the response was still higher for Computer/IT related branches, the response for MCA CET also increased by around 2,000.Anita Moodliar, principal at Maharashtra State Institute of Hotel Management and Catering, said that the pandemic has affected admissions as well as placements. “To add to the woes, the constant news about the loss of business by hotels and closing down of restaurants is also making parents wary about the course. Last year, due to the lockdown, even students, who were given offer letters, were asked not to join or were kept on hold. However, this year, with everything opening up, the placement scenario is looking up, at least by 20%, as compared to last year when it was almost reduced to zero. We are also getting enquiries from parents about various courses. Secondly, TV shows about food and the passion for opening their own restaurant or cafe also encourages students to take up the course.”Parag Kalkar, dean faculty of commerce and management at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) said that the students are unsure of what to do and many students are also opting for gap years, taking up online certificate courses in the meantime. “The annual fee for the MBA course runs into lakhs of rupees. Why would a student want to pay so much money for some online classes? Secondly, the pandemic has affected the market very badly. Consumers are cautious and so are investors, which means new jobs are not being created at the earlier rate. This means placements have plummeted. Almost all households have been affected by the pandemic due to salary cuts and loss of jobs. So, parents also don’t want to spend too much on a course that may not give an equal return on investment. Therefore, students are considering taking a gap year and seeing how the scenario will transform in the next year, thereby reducing the registration or even admissions,” said Kalkar.SS Mantha, former chairman of All India Council for Technical Education, said that primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of employment are down, which also affects employment of students after completion of the course. “The primary employment sector, depending on produce from the earth like farming and mining, are down. Hence, secondary sectors, like manufacturing, cannot provide adequate jobs. Even the tertiary sector or service sector has been suffering due to Covid for the past two years. Brick and mortar investments are giving way to investments in IT infrastructure. Institutions are not willing to make the transition. A lack of interest results in a deficit of quality.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/most-professional-courses-receive-lukewarm-response/articleshow/85138709.cms||Ardhra Nair

The deceased, identified as Vinod Masram Chavan, had sprayed pesticide in his farm where the cotton crop was badly infested by pink bollworm. It is leamt, he collapsed after spraying the pesticide over the five acre farm till 4pm. Chavan allegedly sprayed Nuvacron, which Dr Pramod Yadgirwar, a senior scientist with PDKV, Akola, now posted in Yavatmal, said is a restricted pesticide in Yavatmal since 2020. “It is allowed in the neighbouring Telangana state. It is smuggled into Yavatmal and sold to farmers,” said Dr Yadgirwar. Villagers rushed him to Government Medical College Hospital in Yavatmal but he breathed his last on the way. Confirming the death, dean Dr Milind Kamble said that Chavan was brought dead when he was admitted at 8.45pm. “The body was handed over to the next of kin on Saturday after the post-mortem whose report is awaited,” he said. The dean was unaware of the matter till TOI contacted him on Saturday evening. District collector Amol Yedge, who had visited Mahagaon on Thursday, couldn’t be contacted. RDC Lalitkumar Warhade was also unavailable for comment. TOI had reported about 23 deaths due to pesticide posioning while more than 1,000 had been affected in Yavatmal district between September 2017 and December 2017. The then Union minister of state for home, Hansraj Ahir, had visited the GMC and a few families in the district at the behest of the Prime Minister. Chavan is survived by wife and four children — Aniket, Golu and Nandini and a married daughter. The last rites were held in the village. It is learnt, no officer from the administration visited the bereaved family even after 24 hours. District unit president of Shetkari Sanghatana, Manish Jadhav, on August 3 had alerted the state agricultural minister through the district collector about the widespread attack of pink bollworm on cotton crops. Jadhav had warned the administration and the state government of the “threat from the use of pesticides being sold by unscrupulous krushi kendras right under the nose of agricultural officers”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ytl-farmer-dies-of-pesticide-poisoning-first-for-dist-in-4-years/articleshow/85136832.cms||---

The Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, which has filed one audit and another is in the pipeline this month, had applied for FCRA few months ago. Dollars received from abroad by post have been returned to donors, said office manager, Prakash Gupta. Talking to TOI, Trust member Anil Mishra said, “After submission of two audit reports, the government may consider FCRA clearance, based on the projected balance-sheet of the next fiscal. One audit report has been submitted and the second will be filed this month.” Also, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been given the contract to create an online system to enable instant generation of receipts for funds received from abroad, said Mishra. Construction cost of the temple complex as estimated by the Trust is pegged around Rs 1,000 crore. However, an overwhelming response to temple crowdfunding by VHP has led to coffers brimming with Rs 5,458 crore, as per data released in April by Trust general secretary Champat Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/third-audit-waiver-likely-for-fcra-nod-to-ram-temple-trust/articleshow/85140545.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Lucknow||Subtle Dalit outreach by BJP: JP Nadda greets Jatav block pramukh||Lucknow: BJP national president JP Nadda’s visit to Lucknow on Saturday was marked by a subtle Dalit outreach with a woman block pramukh from the Jatav community, Sonia, being felicitated by the party chief after being welcomed with garlands by a Dalit zila panchayat chairperson from Chitrakoot. However, it was the Sonia, who held centrestage at the function to honour newly elected zila panchayat chairpersons, with UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh specifically introducing the Dalit block pramukh from Saharanpur as a “gritty woman from a humble background”. Singh said, Sonia’s family members were safai karmacharis, yet she managed to win the block pramukh elections. This came soon after Nadda was welcomed by zila panchayat chairman of Chitrakoot, Ashok Jatav. This twin gestures was BJP’s deft move to put the focus back on Dalits, which the saffron party has been trying to wean away from the Opposition, particularly the BSP in the run-up to assembly elections next year. BJP managed to corner a chunk of Dalit voters in 2017, a narrative which is sternly contested by Mayawati in her bid to consolidate her core vote-bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/subtle-dalit-outreach-by-bjp-nadda-greets-jatav-block-pramukh/articleshow/85140597.cms||Pankaj Shah

A model stretch will be developed near the Fatehpuri mosque which will be later replicated along the entire 1.3km road. During a recent Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC) meeting, minister for urban development Satyendar Jain was briefed about consultations with the hotel group for the plantation project in the stretch under CSR initiative, an official said. “The minister has approved the plan and the managing director of SRDC will coordinate with the ITC group authorities for taking up plantation in the Chandni Chowk stretch. The public works department will also extend its support,” the official stated. Deputy director of the PWD’s horticulture section has been asked to ready a sample stretch for plantation in the central median near the mosque in consultation with the chief horticulturist of the hotel group. “Creating a sample stretch with installation of sandstone kerb in the central median near the Fatehpuri mosque will not be disturbing the entire corridor,” the minutes of the latest SRDC review meeting state. The PWD will ensure installation of a central sandstone kerb in the sample stretch to create soil bed for plantation, which will be carried out before August 7, an official stated. Last year, the department had announced that the redeveloped stretch will be a lot greener. It had proposed to populate the 1.3km long stretch with 150 trees, while at present, there are only 90 trees on the boulevard. Under the Chandni Chowk pedestrianisation and redevelopment project, greening of the entire stretch isalso to be carried out with 118 ornamental trees in the 1,300 m redevelopment area between Red Fort and the Fatehpuri mosque. These will be mostly native trees such as Kaim, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plantation-work-to-start-on-chandni-chowk-stretch/articleshow/85138763.cms||Paras Singh

The high number, said Lalbazar, was due to the fact that the top brass zeroed in on the zones that needed attention. “CCTV images showed a lot of vehicles in areas off EM Bypass. While Ultadanga guard showed high prosecution number, Garia and Regent Park traffic guards did not. They were asked to act strict,” said an officer. The city recorded 1,947 cases by traffic police alone. Another 889 prosecutions were carried out by local police. “We launched a concentrated checking. For this, a special drive was held from 10.30pm to midnight,” police said. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said the idea was to ensure motorists did not predict naka locations. Besides the usual hot spots of Park Street, Ballygunge and Park Circus, violations were noticed at Garia, Regent Park and Netaji Nagar. In areas around EM Bypass, Bidhannagar Police and Baruipur district police carried out checks. Among the violators was actress Isha Saha, who paid a fine. A businessman, who misbehaved with cops, was arrested. Cops said apart from near popular eateries, violations were found even in areas like, Diamond Harbour Road and Tiljala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/over-2k-booked-on-a-single-night-for-curb-flouting/articleshow/85138788.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Rs 2,500 crore will be pumped into rural local bodies in next one year, says CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Terming rural local bodies as the axis of development, CM Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that around Rs 2,500 crore will be pumped into rural local bodies for development of villages in the next one year. “This will not only help BJP but also the elected representatives to boost their image,” he said, while speaking at the function organised by BJP to felicitate newly elected zila panchayat chairpersons and block pramukhs. “Your election is not just about getting recognised and honoured but also about how you will perform in meeting the expectations of the people,” he said, exhorting the panchayat representatives to ensure that people in their jurisdiction are brought close to BJP. “This will prove the party motto of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas and sabka vishwas’,” he said. Yogi, at the same time, slammed the Opposition for demanding deferment of panchayat elections to stop development and stall established constitutional procedures. He said his government had decided to get on with the rural local bodies’ elections while controlling the raging second wave of coronavirus. Hailing the performance of BJP in panchayat elections, Yogi said people voted in favour of BJP-supported candidates to accelerate development. “And the people who had looted the state were stopped from winning rural polls,” he said. Yogi said that the roles of newly elected ZP chairpersons and block pramukhs were pertinent to tackle the pandemic. The CM reiterated that political parties which have been raising voices against BJP vis-à-vis management of the pandemic were themselves “self-quarantined” and did not move out of their house. “They left people at their fate,” he said, adding that it was the BJP government which came to the rescue of the affected, especially the poor, for whom various schemes like PM Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana were implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-rs-2-5k-cr-will-be-pumped-into-rural-local-bodies-in-next-one-yr/articleshow/85140641.cms||---

NGO ProHealth Foundation director Jeetendra Nayak has facilitated four mini oxygen plants, 200 oxygen concentrators and 200 transformers worth around Rs2.23 crore.Nayak told TOI that he came to know through his college group on social media that the government of Ontario, Canada, was providing oxygen plants, concentrators, ventilators etc to needy states and countries. “Fortunately, Vikram Khurana is the chairman of Toronto Business Development Centre (TBDC), the nodal agency for the project. Khurana was my senior at Manipal Institute of Technology,” he said. Nayak added, “I requested him to provide oxygen plants and concentrators to Nagpur, citing problems during the second wave. Khurana suggested to get a letter from the government, raising the demand. International ultra-cyclist Amit Samarth and I met civic chief Radhakrishnan, who said the NMC urgently needs oxygen concentrators for developing walk-in oxygen centres for the projected third wave.” Nayak also spoke with the principal secretary of state’s relief and rehabilitation department Aseem Gupta, who asked him to get the letter from the district collector R Vimala. “I met the collector, who issued the letter immediately,” he said.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “The collector’s office has received oxygen concentrators and related equipment. We will collect them soon. This will help materialize our plan of developing around 50 Covid walk-in oxygen centres.” The civic chief added, “We already had 120 oxygen concentrators and now, the number has increased to 320. These centres will help in providing oxygen and primary healthcare to Covid patients before getting beds in Covid hospitals. It will save lives and also prevent deterioration of health of patients.” The civic body is planning to develop five walk-in-oxygen centres in each of the ten zones, and in localities lacking hospitals.Radhakrishnan added that some of the 75 Vande Mataram clinics proposed by mayor Dayashankar Tiwari will be among these 50 centres and the rest will be NMC’s urban primary health centres.Nayak said that a consignment of four mini oxygen plants was expected to arrive soon. “The average voltage of electricity is 230 volts in our country, but 110 in Canada and other foreign countries. Therefore, there was a need for transformers, which too was taken care of by Khurana and the Ontario government. They will also bear the expenditure of transportation,” he added.Nayak further said, “Another collegemate Srikanth Mallya helped Khurana in the project through UPS Foundation. They had supplied around 5,000 ventilators, 500 oxygen concentrators, nine oxygen plants and 500 cylinders to India during the second wave.” Nayak added that his NGO would help NMC in installation of oxygen concentrators and for their judicious use. “We will also take care of maintenance and supply of parts. These concentrators are high-end and will be very useful,” he said.In A Nutshell*NMC had proposed to develop walk-in oxygen centres for Covid patients and required oxygen concentrators in large numbers*NGO ProHealth Foundation director Jeetendra Nayak learnt about the government of Ontario, Canada, providing oxygen plants, concentrators, ventilators etc to needy states and countries*TBDC is nodal agency of the project whose chairman Vikram Khurana is Nayak’s collegemate*Nayak with help from civic chief, collector and principal secretary of relief and rehabilitation department, raised request*200 oxygen concentrators with transformers reached and will be used by NMC in developing walk-in oxygen centres*Four mini oxygen plants expected to arrive soon*NGO will help NMC in installation, followed by operation and maintenance||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-mans-canada-connection-helps-nmc-receive-four-o2-plants-200-concentrators/articleshow/85135195.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Delhi||Maintain parks, get kiosk rights, suggests N corpn||New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has invited bids for taking over the maintenance of parks in place of rights to establish kiosks or milk booths in municipal parks. In the first phase, the maintenance of 215 parks will be handed over to private players. The matter had been sent to the lieutenant governor for approval, who forwarded it to Delhi Development Authority for clarifications regarding MPD 2021 provisions. DDA has put an area cap of residential locality with 5,000 people. The maximum size of the kiosk can be 20 sqm, while the booths will be permitted to run for five years. “The parks to be maintained must be at least 1.3 acres to 1.5 acres in size. In case the park is smaller in size, then nearby parks of the total size of 1.3 acres to 1.5 acres will be maintained by the agency,” states the policy document. “Milk booth operators will need to be equipped with tools and machinery for park maintenance.” Since many of these parks are less than the minimum area of 1.3 acres, several smaller parks have been clubbed to make one site cluster. There are a total of 215 parks under 137 site units being offered in the first phase. Out of the 137 selected kiosk sites, 19 are located in City-Sadar Paharganj zone, which includes the park near Hardayal Singh Public Library, Swami Shraddhanand park of Town Hall, Town Hall complex park, green belt on the rooftop of Meena Bazar and a park abutting Jama Masjid. Eighteen such sites are located in Civil Lines zone, 41 are located in Karol Bagh zone, 37 are located in Rohini zone and 22 are located in Narela zone. The cash-strapped civic body has been trying to reduce the expenses occurring on park maintenance. However, many RWAs and opposition have opposed the idea. Civic officials say that several norms have been framed to allay the concerns. “The maximum size of the booth has been restricted and it will be made with temporary eco-friendly material. For uniformity, a standard design will be provided by the north corporation,” the policy cleared by the civic body states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/maintain-parks-get-kiosk-rights-suggests-n-corpn/articleshow/85138813.cms||Paras Singh

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: After 30 suicides, first victim’s kin still struggling||NAGPUR: Bodbodhan, a village over 15km from Yavatmal where help poured in after 2006 when Vidarbha’s agrarian crisis drew national attention, has again seen a farmer’s suicide when it finally seemed that things have changed. Vilas Kisanlal Rathore, in his 30s, ended life over a week ago, leaving behind wife and two minor children. He had reaped only a quintal cotton due to bollworm attack, say his kin. The village was adopted by spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s Art of Living Foundation in 2006. The village of 3,000 was among the most affected by bollworm attack. It was visited by Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also. With Vilas, there have been 30 suicides since 2002. Out of a population of 3,000, over 300 are estimated to be full-time farmers. The first farmer to end life was Vinod Rathore. He committed suicide on January 26, 2002. His sons have grown up. The elder one looks after the five acre farm, as the younger, Rajkumar, is searching for a job. Vinod’s widow works as a farm hand to make two ends meet. The well that was dug up with the government aid given to the suicide-hit family did not hit water. Vilas, who had a five acre land, reaped only a quintal of cotton as the crop was hit by pink bollworm pest, says his wife Savita and other villagers. He owed Rs1 lakh to a cooperative bank. With none to take care of the farm, Savita works as a farm hand in others’ fields earning Rs100 a day. In 2018, a farmer also named Vilas Rathore had ended life due to similar reasons. His widow also works as a farm hand as his land has been let out to another farmer on contract. The well sanctioned to this family as part of the aid to suicide-hit has not been dug up yet. The latest suicide has dampened the sentiment in the village, say locals. “There were no suicides after 2015-16, but then it was Vilas in 2018 and another Vilas in 2021,” says Anup Chavan, former sarpanch. “After the village was taken over by Art of Living Foundation, around 25 farm ponds were dug up. This helped around half of the farmers, but life has remained the same for the rest,” says Chavan. Cotton growers remain vulnerable to volatilities in prices too. Since last three years, pink bollworm pest has been the major killer. Vilas’s losses were due to the pest attack. “Last year was worse, even I was in losses. I had cotton in 25 acre and the yield was not more than 25 quintal,” he says. At Vilas’s home, his wife Savita says, “My in-laws were not keeping well and both died. He incurred a major expenditure on the treatment. After that the harvest was not more than a quintal cotton,” she said. There were loses in soyabean too, she added. The family now awaits government help. Chhaya, wife of the Vilas who ended life in 2018, said he had a Rs2 lakh loan, which includes that from a private bank. The well that was sanctioned as a part of the government help has not been dug yet. “My elder brother has separated from us, and he cultivates the land, but is not well off either. I am 27 and have just completed graduation, but jobless,” said Rajkumar. “I was 9-year-old when my father ended life in 2002. The compensation we got was spent on two sisters’ marriage and my wife works as a farm hand. Times were tough and we continue to struggle,” he said. Dinesh Pawar, sarpanch, said despite the hype, not much has changed. Of course, farm ponds were dug up, but such measures don’t help unless a fair price is ensured for the farmers. Cotton growers have always been vulnerable, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-2-decades-30-suicides-1st-victims-kin-still-struggling/articleshow/85136947.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Delhi||Delhi: Odd-even threat to Sarojini market traders||NEW DELHI: A show-cause notice has been issued to the traders’ associations of Sarojini Nagar market, which states that they will be made to operate on an odd-even basis if compliance on measures regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour norms is not ensured. The notice states that a meeting with all the stakeholders was held on July 19 during which it was directed that identity cards will be issued to all the authorised shop workers and street vendors by their respective market association by July 21. The circular further stated that if the exercise was not carried out, the respective association will have to follow odd-even operations for their shops. The notice issued by the sub-divisional magistrate of Vasant Vihar states that out of seven market associations, only one has ensured compliance so far. “Despite ample amount of time and relaxations as requested by the associations, till date only one market association has issued ID cards to its members and submitted compliance. Therefore, the president or general secretary of the remaining market associations are hereby required to show cause within three days of this notice, as to why they should not be made to follow odd-even operations,” the notice issued on Friday states. The market associations have been asked to submit a reply by Monday, 5pm. Ashok Randhawa, who heads the mini-market association, said they have issued ID cards to almost all the workers and they were not informed that the list also needs to be submitted to SDM. He said that the number of workers per shop has been kept very low and it will affect the jobs of 50% workers. “When entire Delhi is opening and relaxation is being provided, why is Sarojni Nagar being targeted alone,” he asked. The Sarojini Nagar market comprises the main market with 200 shops, Babu market with 120 shops, Sarojini Nagar mini-market with 32 shops, Thareja street vendors with 104 outlets, 304 vendors who have got relief from the high court, 65 vegetable outlets and 26 spaces for shoe cobblers and other professionals. Earlier, on July 18, the export market section of the market was closed, citing violations in terms of social distancing. A meeting of all stakeholders of the market was held on July 9 to rectify the situation. It was decided that to restrict the entry of hawkers and regulate the crowds in the Sarojini Nagar market, passes would be issued by market associations and authorised vendors to their members and employees. Once the process is complete, police will implement access control at all five entry points to sellers possessing ID cards, while New Delhi Municipal Council would seal any gaps to prevent trespassing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/odd-even-threat-to-sarojini-market-traders/articleshow/85138826.cms||Paras Singh

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Preparing students for online MCQ exams an uphill task, feel schools||KOLKATA: The decision of Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) to split the ICSE and ISC board exams into two for 2022, with the first semester exam scheduled for this November, has got city schools to start planning so that kids are able to cope. This is the first time they will face an entire theory paper in the MCQ mode held online. Schools feel it will be challenging to prepare the kids on how to handle the questions and get them acquainted with computer-based exams. They had been taking pen-and-paper exams and submitting them in the PDF format for online tests, but now they might have to get used to taking a computer-based test like the competitive exams for entry into engineering, medicine or colleges abroad. Many ISC science students preparing for such exams said they have mastered answering computer-based MCQ questions, but most ICSE students are yet to get a taste of this. Most city principals said they will wait for further clarity on whether the November exams will be completely computer-based, where each child will visit the school to take the tests. Schools said since CBSE had declared such a format earlier, it will help to follow it. “Perhaps the IT team of the Council will guide the schools on how to generate the papers,” said acting principal of La Martiniere for Boys John Stephen. Most schools agreed that since the November exam will be held on 50% of the syllabus, students can spend time practising MCQ variables. They also said the pre-Puja first term exam will be treated as pre-board for the November exam and will also be in the MCQ format. “We have already shifted to MCQ in the online assessments and students welcomed it,” said Rupkatha Sarkar, principal of La Martiniere for Girls. “From what I can understand, it will be a computer-based exam held in school under supervision. But we are waiting for further clarity from the Council,” said Heritage School principal Seema Sapru. “We will make kids practice full MCQ tests,” said DPS Newtown principal Sonali Sen. Students preparing for ISC seemed to be at ease. “A lot of entrance tests are computer-based tests, so we are aware of the basic format,” said Rishin Mitra, a Class XII student of LMB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/preparing-students-for-online-mcq-exams-an-uphill-task-feel-schools/articleshow/85136975.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

TOI on Saturday spoke to the athletes who represented the country in various track and field events. “It is a proud moments for every Indian. I believe the way cricket got popular and became a household game after Kapil Dev’s team won the world cup, we would see many Neeraj Chopras in future. It will also encourage more parents to further their children in the field of athletics,” said Devendra Jhajharia, from Churu in Rajasthan, and had won two gold medals in javelin throw in the 2004 and 2016 summer paralympics. He added that for any sports, support of the government, corporates and fellow sportsmen is important. “Since we have the first-ever gold in athletics, I hope the government will make a result oriented strategy to improve facilities and infrastructure in India,” Jhajharia added. On the other hand, Arjuna Awardee Rajkumar Ahlawat, who had won name and fame in athletics and is presently working as a sports officer with North Western Railway (NWR) said, “I must congratulate Neeraj Chopra as he has given us a ray of hope in athletics.

He believes every sport is performance oriented and only the enhancement in performance is key to get attention, infrastructure and other facilities. Vishal thanked the Centre for replacing the name of Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award with the name of his grandfather, but said that the hockey wizard deserves Bharat Ratna. TOI spoke to Vishal, a sports officer based at Baran and a hockey coach, to know how medals and performances will improve the facilities in sports in India. “I believe everything in sports is performance oriented. In the past 41 years, we were not getting any medal in hockey. Thus, ironically our national game was not getting that much attention. I believe the performance of Indian men and women in hockey is phenomenal and this is certainly going to boost the game in India,” Singh said. Vishal is the son of Major Dhyan Chand’s eldest son Brij Mohan Singh. Vishal’s father had migrated to Kota when he got a job as sports officer. “Since then our family is based at Kota and Baran,” he added. “Also I would like to add that we tend to forget the achievement of sportsman within some time. Thus, I will urge the government of India and other states, including Rajasthan to focus, plan and execute for the improvement in facilities and infrastructure in other sports as well.” He said that sportsmen were vouching for changing the name of Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award since 2012. “The moment PM Narendra Modi announced it, we had good number of people coming to our home and congratulated us. I think I am blessed to be part of the family which had Major Dhyan Chand,” he added. Vishal believed that his grandfather deserves Bharat Ratna. “He was the man who had denied a job in German Army and their citizenship that was offered to him after his performance in Berlin Olympics in 1936. He was a true patriot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dhyan-chand-deserves-bharat-ratna-grandson/articleshow/85140712.cms||Ashish Mehta

Some schools also shut down after the students tested positive for the contagion. In the first phase of restarting the schools, 80 schools started functioning for classes VIII to XII. This was followed by several other schools taking permission from the local administration as well as from the special committees formed at the village-level to start offline classes. ZP CEO Ajit Kumbhar told TOI, “We ensured all teachers were completely vaccinated before restarting the schools. We have been extra cautious to keep a check on further spread of Covid from any of our schools. Despite taking all the efforts, the possibility of some student or their family members getting infected cannot be ruled out.” There are 752 schools in Beed with majority of them in rural areas. District education officer Shrikant Kulkarni said, “According to government rules, only schools from those villages that had not reported a single case in past one month were allowed to move a proposal seeking permission to hold classes on the campus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beed-new-cases-force-40-schools-to-shut-down/articleshow/85109947.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Schools start defaulter audit, parents say many still on list despite payment||KOLKATA: City schools have started internal audit of fees due from parents since March 2020. They will submit this to Calcutta High Court after informing the parents next week. The Court has asked defaulting parents to pay 50% arrears in three weeks else schools might take action against children in multiple ways as directed by the court. The stand-off between parents’ bodies and schools have intensified. Parents’ bodies claim that most of them have paid the 80% tuition fees according to the court order of October 13, 2020. They say the amount they have paid does not match the schools’ claims because there are calculation differences. Schools said all calculations have been done according to the court order and there are many parents who have not paid at all since March 2020 and many have paid far lower than the amounts put up on virtual notice boards. Parents bodies have moved court separately. “The court asked us to pay 80% of the tuition fees, which we have. This does not match the schools’ calculation because they included food, transport, digitalisation, magazine, sports charges. So, we have moved court,” said Sumit Agarwal, who represents a parents’ forum of a school. “We have submitted to the HC the faulty fee calculation by the schools,” said Vineet Ruia, an applicant of PIL for parents. Anju Sharma, who represents a forum, said that while some schools like Loreto House have followed the court order in toto when calculating 80% fees, others have not. Auditors at Vidyamandir group of schools that runs Birla High School Boys and Sushila Birla Girls HS School have started identifying defaulters. At South Point School, many defaulters have left. The defaulter list of 2020 is more or less clear, but there are about 350 defaulters in the new session. “We are drawing up the list till July and will intimate parents before submitting it to the court,” said spokesperson Krishna Damani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-start-defaulter-audit-parents-say-many-still-on-list-despite-payment/articleshow/85137006.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Missing man declared dead after 2 decades||AHMEDABAD: A city civil court has declared one Gelabhai Parmar dead, two decades after he had gone missing in 2001 from his home in Maninagar area. The laws require at least a seven-year period to presume a person to be dead after his disappearance. In Parmar’s case, the court itself took seven odd years for this declaration after Parmar’s son approached the court nearly 13 years after his disappearance. A resident of Maninagar area, Parmar, went missing from early morning on October 11, 2001. His children claimed that he was mentally unsound. They reported about the man’s disappearance to the police. The family also obtained a certificate from the police that the missing complaint’s report was filed and an investigation was conducted in that direction. When Parmar could not be traced, his son Amrutbhai Parmar approached the city civil court in 2014 with a prayer that his father, who was about 70 years of age in 2001, was missing for more than 13 years, and hence he may be officially declared as ‘dead’ or ‘not alive’. Parmar’s six heirs became parties in the litigation and there was no opposition to the prayer, either from the children or from the state government. After hearing the case, the judge noted that when Parmar could not be traced, his son issued a notice to the state government under the provisions of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code and then filed a suit. The court further said that it was satisfied with the evidence placed by Parmar’s son, and said, “This court has no hesitation in accepting that said Mr Gelabhai Jivabhai Parmar is not alive and has died. The plaintiff’s father Mr Gelabhai Jivabhai Parmar was continuously absent and untraceable for more than seven years before fling of the suit and he was not heard of by his relatives, friends and neighbours before fling of the suit and therefore, it requires to be presumed that Mr Gelabhai Jivabhai Parmar is not alive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/missing-man-declared-dead-after-2-decades/articleshow/85138851.cms||---

The feat puts Lucknow in the league of a few centres in the country doing such surgery. The institute had procured a medical robot in 2019, and over 200 robotic surgeries have been performed in the last two years. The team was mentored by Dr Rajesh Ahlawat, an expert in minimally invasive renal procedures with an experience of nearly 38 years, and SGPGI’s head of urology and renal transplant department Prof Aneesh Srivastava, who has mentored teams doing renal transplants at medical colleges, including AIIMS Jodhpur and Rishikesh. The renal transplant was done on a 42-year-old female patient from Barabanki diagnosed with end-stage renal disease by head of nephrology department Prof Narayan Prasad. “She had been on maintenance hemodialysis since April 2019. Her mother agreed to donate a kidney to her. She underwent work up for ABO compatible renal transplant for immunological matching, after which the transplant surgery was planned,” Prof Prasad informed. When the transplant was recommended, Prof Srivastava told the patient about the robotic option to which the family agreed. “The patient is stable. The procedure has opened a window of opportunity for renal transplant seekers, especially those who are overweight,” he said. “Robotic surgery means smaller incision; it makes patient management easier and shorter post procedure care. It means shorter hospital stay and reduced chances of infections,” he explained. “The highly-skilled paramedical staff of the institute forms the backbone of any milestone such as this one. Kudos to their untiring efforts in patient care services,” said SGPGI director Prof RK Dhiman while congratulating the team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pgi-docs-perform-states-first-robotic-renal-transplant/articleshow/85140729.cms||Shailvee Sharda

In all, over 8.40 lakh or 28% of the eligible population in the district have received the jab till date.While it was easier to convince people in the urban pockets to get their jab on time, there has been a lot of hesitancy among the rural population thanks to rumours about side effects. However, continuous awareness drives were conducted for weeks to convince the people about the importance of taking the vaccine. Panchayat presidents and block-level doctors who helped achieve the 100% vaccination were felicitated at a function on Saturday at the conclusion of the Covid awareness week. Eight out of the ten villages had women panchayat presidents.Reminding people that we were still not free of Covid-19, district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar said, ‘social vaccination,’ where people exercise self-restraint, avoid crowded places, wear masks properly and sanitize their hands frequently, was the need of the hour.The villages and the ward in Ezhumalai which achieved full vaccination have a total population of 17,762 of which 4,811 were aged over 45 years as against 5,758 above the age of 18. This was the eligible population covered at these places including Jothiyapatti and Thindiyur in east block, Karupukovilpatti in Thirumangalam, Kumaralingapuram, Idayanatham and Seeniyapuram in Kallikudi. Doctors said they had seen people backing out even after coming to the entrance of the vaccination centre. These people finally got vaccinated due to peer pressure as all others received the injection. Assistant director panchayats A Chelladurai said they had come a long way in making people overcome their hesitancy through awareness. ``People living near to the suburban areas are easily convinced, but we have some interior pockets in Kallikudi region where we are carrying out focussed awareness programmes,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/10-hamlets-in-madurai-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/85138890.cms||---

The chief minister also urged panchayats and municipalities to submit their projects as soon as possible. He said that in September-October, PM Narendra Modi will speak to swayampurna mitras and sarpanchs of selected panchayats virtually on Swayampurna Goa. Sawant said that this is an opportunity to highlight the work done in each panchayat to make Goa self-sufficient. The government’s ambitious project, ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat - Swayampurna Goa’, aimed at making the state self-sufficient, restarted in June after being suspended in May to a sharp increase in Covid cases. The chief minister held a review meeting with panchayat members and swayampurna mitras on Swayampurna Goa, and said that all panchayats are ready to provide online services to its citizens. Sawant said that 151 services are available online. Swayampurna mitras highlighted their work in their respective panchayats, including bringing more land under cultivation, providing various government schemes, water and electricity connections. Pointing out how the recently-passed Goa Panchayat (Amendment) Bill, 2021, to allow people to construct one plus one floors at their existing house with only the permission of the panchayat, minister Mauvin Godinho urged panchayat members to appreciate the state government’s decision and be vocal on social media about the benefits of the bill. Under Swayampurna Goa, panchayats and municipalities were supposed to get funds under the 15th Finance Commission and under the funds allocated for the 60th celebration of Goa’s Liberation. The state, through the scheme, wanted to ensure 100% coverage of water and electricity connections to the people. The state has roped in the agriculture department to increase agricultural production, so that the state does not have to depend on other states. At present, the state depends on neighbouring states for milk, eggs, vegetables and food grains, among other things.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/municipalities-to-get-rs-1cr-to-finish-proposed-works-cm/articleshow/85138893.cms||---

Hope of reopening the other centres brightened on Saturday with the arrival of 3.5 lakh doses of Covishield at the state health department’s Bagbazar depot. According to a KMC health official, the Covishield second-dose backlog has already touched the 1 lakh mark and it will steadily rise if KMC fails to administer vaccines from its clinics and mega centres from Monday. “We need 30,000-35,000 Covishield doses daily for our 102 clinics and 50 mega centres. Now, the stock has come to naught. So it is obvious the current backlog will rise steadily and it will be an uphill task to bridge the gap if stocks don’t arrive by Sunday afternoon,” a KMC official said. Chairman of the KMC BoA Firhad Hakim expressed concern over non-availability of Covishield. “At present, we have no stock to continue with Covishield vaccination at civic clinics. We hope the Centre will send fresh supplies without delay. Our CM has sent a letter to the PM seeking an immediate supply of Covishield. We can’t reopen our clinics and mega centres till stocks arrive,” Hakim said. The KMC health department, however, kept its Covaxin clinics and a mega centre open on Saturday. “We have no dearth of Covaxin. We are administering 13,000-15,000 Covaxin doses from our 28 clinics and mega centres. We have stock for four-five days,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-5l-covishield-doses-spark-hope-for-kmc-drive-restart/articleshow/85137017.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Lucknow||‘Urdu can be taught even in areas with low Muslim population’||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court recently said that “Urdu as a language can be taught even in areas where there is low Muslim population”. Hearing a writ petition filed by one Sanover, Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra observed, “This court is of the view that any particular language cannot be connected with any specific religion and Urdu as a language can be taught even in areas where there are few Muslims.” “In a secular state, it would prima facie not be open to frame such policy and to discontinue a Urdu teacher only because Muslim population is less,” added Justice Mishra. The petitioner, Sanover from Pilibhit, was an Urdu teacher in a government-aided school but was allegedly removed from service as the Muslim population in the area fell below 20%. Hence, he filed the present writ petition, challenging his removal. The court also asked the additional chief secretary of the department of basic education to place on record the policy of the state in this regard. The court also asked state government counsel to apprise it on the issue. The next hearing is on August 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/urdu-can-be-taught-even-in-areas-with-low-muslim-population/articleshow/85140806.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cases rise, Swasthya Sathi units may be squeezed||KOLKATA: The number of Covid patients has been crawling up across private hospitals in Kolkata over the last 8-10 days, leading to fears about a possible beginning of the third wave believed to be due in September-October. It is also leading to a squeeze of Swasthya Sathi units at some hospitals. At least two hospitals have seen their daily Covid admissions rise from one-two to around six a day in a week with several requiring ICU care. A section of experts felt this could be a slow and silent onset of the third wave that could see a gradual rise in the number of patients over the next month. Belle Vue Clinic has seen a jump from just two patients last week to 25 on Saturday. “We have 33 Covid beds and will add more once the number of patients touches 30. If the numbers keep rising, then both Swasthya Sathi and non-Covid admissions will have to be reduced,” said CEO P Tondon. AMRI Hospitals now has 22 Covid patients across its three units. Eight were admitted directly to the ICU. AMRI has around 150 patients admitted under the Swasthya Sathi scheme and their number will have to be slashed once Covid admissions rise, said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. “We had been forced to reduce Swasthya Sathi admissions during the second wave. If a similar spurt happens, we will be forced to axe Swasthya Sathi berths again,” said Barua. The number of Covid patients at AMRI has doubled in a week and this is the fastest growth since the second wave ebbed. “Till recently, we would have days with no new admissions, but over the last one week, we had 1-2 every day,” he said. AMRI has 50 beds reserved for Covid patients at its three units which may have to be increased within the next fortnight, felt Barua. Out of its 40 beds for Covid patients, 26 are now taken up at Peerless Hospital. Six were admitted on Friday. “We have seen a noticeable spurt in the last 10 days. In end-July, it had dropped to just five, after which there’s been a slow rise,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. Ten are admitted to the ITU in Peerless. Mitra added that Peerless’ 42-bed Swasthya Sathi unit will not be touched immediately. “If numbers cross 100, then we might have to squeeze it,” he said. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has not seen any rise over the last week. “Covid patients admitted have been ranging between 15-17 at any point of time. These numbers have been consistent over the last 3-4 weeks,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. RTIICS has an occupancy of 15 in its 45-bed Covid ward. “A non-Covid area has been earmarked as a 65-bed ward for Swasthya Sathi patients. So there is a possibility of a trade-off to the extent of the increased Covid beds depending on the situation,” he said. Belle Vue internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain said he had four patients admitted under him now. “This is the highest in over a month. But the good news is three of them are moderately ill,” he said. There will be a slow and gradual spurt in Covid admissions now, said IPGMER professor Diptendra Sarkar. “We are into the third wave and numbers will rise. But due to vaccination, the disease will now be mild to moderate,” said Sarkar. There had been a spurt in end-July but now it has stabilized, said Woodlands Hospital managing director Rupali Basu. The hospital now has seven-eight patients. Others, like Medica and Charnock, haven’t seen a spurt yet.  “We have 15 patients now and the rise in number has been negligible so far,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cases-rise-swasthya-sathi-units-may-be-squeezed/articleshow/85137032.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Nagpur||Some CBSE standard XI classes start in Nagpur, state board students wait||NAGPUR: Some CBSE schools in the city have started classes for Std XI while others have begun the admission process. However, state board affiliated junior colleges still have a long way to go. Since Std XI admissions in the state board junior colleges in the city will be done through Common Admission Process (CAP), students have no option but to wait. Some CBSE schools are taking Std XI classes online while a few in rural areas have started classes in physical mode. Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir Junior College, feels that classes for state board students will not start in August. “The entire problem has been created because of the Common Entrance Test (CET) decision by state education department. That is scheduled to be conducted on August 21 and without that how will admission process for our kids start?” Another state board college principal said, “Our students are losing precious academic time. Effectively they are already one month behind as classes in Nagpur state board colleges won’t start till first week of September. It’s a big mess created by the education department due to suggestion of CET as a benchmark for Std XI admissions.” The CET is not mandatory but priority in admissions will be given to those students who appear for it. A senior junior college teacher said, “Now, who will take the risk of skipping the CET if there is a priority criteria attached. Neither CBSE nor ICSE has any such CET provision in place and that’s why their admission process is going on smoothly. Our state board tried to go above and beyond the brief and that is what is causing these issues.” While the CET issue is currently sub-judice, as certain parents approached the Bombay High Court over its curriculum, education department officials are going ahead with initial stages of CAP. On Monday, a list of CAP guidance centres is expected to be released. An education official said, “CAP is only for junior colleges situated within city limits. Last year around 24,000 seats in junior colleges remained vacant as supply far exceeded demand. We expect seats to go vacant this year too, though number might reduce a bit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/some-cbse-std-xi-classes-start-state-board-students-wait/articleshow/85137063.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Delhi||Delhi: You may take online learner’s licence test from next week||NEW DELHI: Within the next few days, those applying for a learner’s driving licence in Delhi will be able to give an online test and get an e-licence without visiting an RTO. The first-of-its-kind facility in the country is likely to be launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal by early next week, sources in the transport department said. The software prepared by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and the back-end infrastructure are currently in the testing phase. Delhi government has added a new face recognition software to ensure only genuine candidates appear for the test. From February 18 this year, the transport department has been providing 12 of its most transaction-heavy services online — also called the “faceless services”. The e-licence, which will be valid for six months, is a part of the next phase of these services. The department aims to limit its physical presence to just automated driving test tracks in the future. Applicants will first have to register on the department’s website and get an appointment to take the test. There will be an online tutorial, which they will have to take before the test. The 10-minute learner’s licence test will have objective-type questions, in which the applicant needs to score at least six out of ten. Following this, a colour blindness test will be carried out. Once the applicant clears that, an e-licence will be issued. The department’s website will have a dedicated web link for the e-licence service and all information regarding fees, minimum age, eligibility, necessary documents, etc. will be available on it, besides frequently asked questions, and a question bank with quizzes. While NIC software was prepared in June itself, the government insisted that the face recognition component should be part of the system to ensure only genuine applicants appear for the test. The question bank and quizzes will ensure the applicants learn about rules during the learner’s licence test because the permanent driving test is a skill test. The test will check their knowledge about road signage and other traffic rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/you-may-take-online-learners-licence-test-from-next-week/articleshow/85138939.cms||Sidharatha Roy

In absolute numbers, the overall Covid numbers have dropped drastically in the city, with around 300 people testing positive daily. During the peak of the Covid second wave, the corresponding figure was 30 times more, with 11,200 people tested positive on April 3. Although, in absolute numbers, cases from the working age group of 31-40 are the highest, the percentage of infections from this group is on the decline. In July, the city added 12,557 fresh Covid-19 cases, of which 11% were from the under 20 age-group -- which works out to nearly 1,381 youngsters getting infected. While 18% of the total monthly infections were added by the working age-group of 31-40, it was down from the 22% in May. In June too, 11% of the nearly 17,000 cases came from the younger lot. Additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said t youngsters have been stepping out more these days, making themselves more vulnerable to infection as most are still unvaccinated. Dr Joshi said it’s still early days in the vaccination programme to presume mass protection for any age-group. “There is perhaps an indirect benefit in mortality, but it needs to studied in detail first,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cases-among-those-in-working-age-group-down/articleshow/85138931.cms||---

Overall, 35,484 people took the vaccine on Saturday, with 29,354 taking the shot at private centres. Of 4,005 who got the vaccine at BMC centres, 210 were bed-ridden people who got vaccinated at their homes. Usually on Saturdays, BMC registers record number of recipients but due to shortage of vaccines numbers were low this time. On Friday, BMC said due to a shortage of vaccines, it would operate only 34 out of 315 public vaccination centres. In July, public vaccination was cancelled for five days due to a shortage. “We hope to get more supplies on Sunday and should be able to transfer them to centres on the same day,”' said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani.

The BJP leaders, after the function, objected to Fadnavis and BJP’s state unit president and Kothrud MLA Chandrakant Patil not getting the invitation to attend the event last week. Fadnavis said that the question of taking credit did not arise. “Ajit Pawar is the present deputy chief minister and guardian minister. Hence, the trial run was flagged off by him. But, when the project will be ready, we feel it should be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and we hope they will not raise any objection to it,” he said. Fadnavis said, “We do not feel that the Metro project belongs to any single political party or any government. It is the project of Pune residents for the citizens. Hence, we are ready to provide whatever support is required for it.” He said that he was able to give a push to the project when it was stuck. “When I took responsibility as chief minister the project was stuck. There were issues of alignment and space. We held many meetings, discussions and were able to give a push to the project,” he said. While expressing satisfaction over the Metro’s work, Fadnavis said that the project had progressed at a considerable pace, so far and that he was told by the MahaMetro authorities that one section would be functional by October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-project-of-residents-not-of-any-govt-fadnavis/articleshow/85137092.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Bawana bottleneck to find relief in elevated corridor||NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at decongesting outer Delhi’s Narela-Bawana region, public works department plans to create a 12-km-long corridor between Bawana industrial area and Kanjhawala. This will include an elevated corridor of 3km from the industrial area to Bawana bus depot. The elevated corridor will be further connected to Narela Road and Kanjhawala. A senior PWD official said that a study was being carried out to finalise the elevated corridor proposal. “This corridor will help in reducing traffic congestion on all connecting roads between Bawana and Auchandi main road,” the official said. Bawana MLA Jai Bhagwan Upkar said that the Bawana-Auchandi corridor was connected to over a dozen villages in outer Delhi. “This is one of the busiest stretches in outer Delhi and the corridor will be starting from the DSIIDC office and cross Bawana Chowk, Auchandi Road, Narela Road, Hanuman temple before culminating at Kanjhawala Road. The elevated portion will be in the Bawana village area,” he added. The Bawana portion of the corridor witnesses heavy traffic jams during rush hours. In response to a question raised in the previous assembly session of Delhi state legislature, the department had acknowledged that a request for such an elevated flyover had been received. “We are currently carrying out a study on the project and next steps on execution will be taken based on this study,” it stated. Upkar stated that the corridor would benefit the neighbouring rural belt. “Once Bawana-Auchandi Road becomes traffic signal-free, the surface-level arterial roads will be decongested. That is why we had been demanding an elevated corridor, especially in the Bawana village section,” the MLA said. The signal-free corridor will also help in movement of vehicles heading towards Haryana border. The areas, which will benefit from this corridor, include Rohini Sector-35, Sultanpur Dabas, Puth Khurd, Bawana Extension, Auchandi village, Bawana JJ colony, Nangal Thakran and the neighbouring localities. Besides this elevated corridor, another major project that will help in decongesting the outer Delhi area is the East-West elevated corridor connecting Tikri to Anand Vihar. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has incorporated the long-pending project in this year’s budget proposals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bawana-bottleneck-to-find-relief-in-elevated-corridor/articleshow/85138947.cms||Paras Singh
---||Pune||Stress-related hair loss up during the pandemic||Pune: Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic struck, there has been no escape from stress — working from home, balancing responsibilities, financial crunch, job security, health concerns and uncertainty of lockdowns. One of the commonest manifestations of this stress is hair loss. “Every time I remove my scrunchy from a ponytail, there’s more hair on it. Earlier, just a few strands would come out when I brushed my hair, but gradually over the past year, the hair loss has increased at an alarming rate,” said a 29-year-old business consultant from Aundh. A 34-year-old marketing executive from Kothrud started noticing hair on his pillow a few months ago. Now that he is observing hair on a towel after a hair-wash, he is worried about ending up with bald patches. Similarly, a 19-year-old Wanowrie student has observed the volume of her hair reduce by half since the start of the pandemic. It is not just stress that is causing hair-fall. Kapil Borawake, a critical care expert, said many Covid-recovered patients were suffering from aggravated hair loss and it was reported as a common side-effect. Preeti Seth, nutritionist and cosmetologist, expressed that poor diet coupled with unhealthy snacking was a major reason for such hairfall issues. “Diet is a key element and should include adequate proteins, folic acid, Vitamins B7 and B12, magnesium and iron. The thumb rule is one gram of protein per pound of body weight.” “Protein can be consumed in the form of meat, dairy, nut-based milk, pulses, soya or homemade whey protein (the watery leftover when one makes paneer at home). Approximately 40% of every meal should be proteins. Hyderation is also vital. Apart from drinking enough water, one should consume liquids like buttermilk, coconut water, mint or coriander-infused water daily,” Seth explained. “Stress leads to many people shedding hair as follicels do not grow. However, high protein intake helps rejuvenate follicles which can help hair growth,” Seth said. Hair stylist Manassee Dogra said every second person visiting her salon was complaining about an acute hair-fall problem. She observed that irregular haircuts were leading to split ends, dryness and surge in hair-fall. Physician Sachin Kulkarni pointed out that hairfall could be an indication of a medical condition. “Hormonal changes, the onset of menopause, conditions like thyroid and blood pressure can lead to a spike in hair-fall or it could happen as a side-effect of the change in medication,” Kulkarni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stress-related-hair-loss-up-during-the-pandemic/articleshow/85137102.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Pune||Efficient civic services to help Pune to grow as a better city||PUNE: The recently merged Manjari area will require at least 100 more conservancy staff for cleaning and sweeping activities. The civic body has told 17 sweepers attached to the Manjari gram panchayat to continue with cleaning and garbage- related works, but officials in the civic administration said additional staff would be required following the inclusion. Like Manjari, the 22 other villages added to the city’s limits will also need better conservancy staff strength. Residents from these areas say the increased population in the merged villages has put an additional burden on the administration to provide for basic facilities. The locals are facing delays in the delivery of civic services due to inadequate staff in gram panchayats, but now expect improvement following their inclusion in the city. “Strengthening of staff is vital in the merger process. Citizens will not be able to get prompt services unless the newly included areas get more staff and the administration ensures that these localities do not remain neglected,” Mahesh Shinde, a resident of Bhilarewadi, an area beyond Katraj, said. Nitin Kumar Jain of Waghoil Residents’ Association said, “Wagholi has over two lakh residents. But, according to our knowledge the gram panchayat has only 100 conservancy staff which is totally inadequate to handle such a huge population. An increase in their numbers will lead to accountability and prompt delivery of services. People here are looking for quick solutions on issues like garbage, water supply, street lights, issuing of death and birth certificates.” Shriraj Gholap, a resident of Holkarwadi, said, “We just hope that people will no more have to listen to the excuses from the authorities. The gram panchayat office staffers used tell us about their limitations and shortage of resources. We are expecting the PMC to treat citizens better as it already has many systems in place.” The PMC has already advised all the departments to conduct a detailed survey and put forth their requirements for additional staff to handle the merged areas. A consolidated report is expected to be ready soon. Sunil Indalkar, deputy commissioner and head of PMC’s general administration department, said, “We have expedited the process of getting a feedback from each department on the existing manpower, vacant posts and requirement for additional strength. For instance, the departments like building permission, solid waste management and anti-encroachment are coming out with their lists to look after the included area.” The administration will prepare a detailed report based on the feedback. A proposal to create new posts will go to the state government, Indalkar added. While the civic administration has started the assessment of staff requirement, it has also begun appointing coordinating officers for every village. Meanwhile, steps have been initiated to divert some staff from the gram panchayats of the merged villages to the PMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/efficient-civic-services-to-help-pune-to-grow-as-a-better-city/articleshow/85137075.cms||Sarang Dastane

With a total area of about 5,800sqm the new market comprises 60 shops and an area which will accommodate 250 vendors in the open market. The new market complex also includes a hall with 300 seating capacity, said Bhomkar. Apart from this there will be toilet blocks and cold storage facilities available for vendors. A separate arrangement for fish and chicken markets, a spice market and vegetable market is also part of the complex. The two-storey building also has a library and parking facilities on the ground floor. “The new complex, once opened, will solve the issue of roads being blocked due to inappropriate parking during the weekly bazaar,” said MLA Govind Gaude. The Banastarim bazaar which operated around the ruins of a fort built by Adil Shah is famous for its two-day weekly bazaar held on Thursdays and Fridays, as also for its matoli bazaar held in the run-up to the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. “After the completion of the project we are planning to make use of the complex to hold a bazaar throughout the week instead of the current two-day affair,” said Bhomkar. The weekly bazaar at Banastarim remains shut currently due to pandemic restrictions. Since 2019 the weekly bazaar has been functioning near the Maruti Temple in Banastarim. Around 190 vendors from outside the state and locals from nearby areas sell their products during the weekly bazaar and around 600-800 customers visit the weekly bazaar, said Bhomkar. “When I got elected as an MLA for Priol constituency in 2017, I started working on this new market project.

Cops have asked mobile users to be careful before replying to messages for SIM upgradation. The moment the link is clicked, the phone gets hacked. Cops have also asked residents to be careful while ordering food online after several people lost money trying to order food from numbers available on social media. “These two cyber crimes are witnessing a surge again so citizens need to be careful,” said a senior cop at the detective department. Cops have launched a video on their Facebook page where they shared 10 tips to ensure how one can continue online trading and shopping without falling prey to cyber crimes.

The highest pay package bagged by students matched that of last year, with a CTC of Rs 43.3 lakh. The offer was made to seven students by Microsoft. The average CTC offered was Rs 16 lakh per annum. The placement season saw 736 students of the Goa campus receiving offers, which was 162 more students getting offers as compared to 2019-20. Due to an increase in intake, the number of students registered for placements had increased from 635 to 808 during 2020-21. “There was a 28.2% growth in students placed from last year, ie, 736 students placed this year compared to 574 students placed last year,” said Balasubramanian Gurumurthy, chief placement officer, India & Dubai, BITS Pilani. “Even though there was an industrial downturn, the average salary for 2021 was at a healthy CTC of Rs 16 lakh per annum and maximum CTC Rs 43.3 lakh per annum. The figures remained at approximately the same level as last year.” Microsoft remained the top employer with seven offers at a CTC of Rs 43.3 lakh per annum.

The treasures include carnelian beads of various shapes, skeletal remains, pots of various sizes and shapes and iron implements. Curator of the museum Dr M Marudhu Pandian said that the burial cysts and burial urns found at Soolapuram in the foothills of the Western Ghat in Peraiyur taluk are indicative that it is a megalithic site. It is full of many interesting artefacts. It was discovered about a year ago, and experts from the Archaeological Survey of India and Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology assessed it and the site may be taken up for excavation. The artefacts were acquired by the museum, through proper documentation as per the Indian Treasure Trove Act of 1841. The Peraiyur tahsildar handed over the treasures to the museum. Clumps of hundreds of carnelian beads in various shapes tell a story about the site. “Carnelian beads are usually found in places near riverbeds, but interestingly the site is surrounded by hillocks on four sides, and may have had an occasional stream caused by rainwater runoff,” he said. The beads on display include, barrel shaped beads, edged carnelian beads, button shaped beads and glass beads, both shaped and unshaped. “The variety of the beads indicate that the core materials were sourced from places where they are found such as Afghanistan and Rajasthan and they were cut and shaped by the people who lived in Soolapuram,” he said. Numerous copper articles, including hooks, bangles, and weights have also been found. The pots, which have been found here, are in numerous shapes. Black-red pottery, redweare, blackware and rouletted pottery were also found. They are well polished and elegantly designed. There is even a four-legged pot. He said that the site, which was identified initially by B Murugesan, a professor from the Gandhigram Rural Institute, also has large quantities of iron ore, which shows that the people who lived here also worked with iron.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/1500-bc-relics-on-display-at-madurai-museum-for-1st-time/articleshow/85138987.cms||---

Police found that the prime conspirator behind this murder was a spiritual activist. Police said real estate businessman Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy (63), who stayed in a hostel at KPHB, was murdered by the accused by hitting him with a rod. Before that, one of the accused mixed poison in Bhaskar’s food. He fell unconscious after consuming it. The kidnappers later took Bhaskar’s body in a car to a burial ground on Srisailam highway. Manager of the burial ground took Rs 11,000 to arrange for his cremation, cops said. When Bhaskar, a native of Nellore district, remained inaccessible to his family members for 20 days, worried family members lodged a missing complaint in KPHB police station. Cops, during a verification of CCTV footage, found Bhaskar being physically lifted into a car by a few persons from his hostel.

Though he is not able to walk properly after the knee surgery and was advised by the doctors to take rest, Eatala wasted no time in getting back to the poll-bound constituency after being discharged from a private hospital in Hyderabad. Eatala continues to meet people at his home in Jammikunta town. “Hundreds of people are coming to meet him day and night and assuring him that they would vote for him. He (Eatala) has instructed all of us to ensure that no one is stopped or even made to wait to meet him,” a leader close to Eatala said. Eatala had completed a 220-km pada yatra covering over 77 villages during his ‘praja deevena pada yatra’ before undergoing knee surgery. The yatra is likely to resume in less than a week as Eatala wants to move among the people and complete his walkathon at the earliest. On the proposed public meeting by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao marking the implementation of Dalita Bandhu scheme in Huzurabad Assembly constituency on August 16, Eatala said people are watching every move and scheme of the ruling TRS. Even the family members of those leaders close to Eatala who were wooed away from him by the TRS have assured of voting him to victory. “People are with me. I trust and depend on them and not any individual leader. It will be difficult for any party to get its deposits in the elections against me,” Eatala has reportedly told his close confidantes. On the other hand, the ruling TRS has intensified its campaign with finance minister T Harish Rao himself visiting the constituency and holding meetings with other ministers and leaders over implementation of welfare schemes. CM KCR’s public meeting on August 16 is expected to further heat up the political turf in Huzurabad segment. The Congress, which was runners-up in the last election, is hardly visible even as the two ruling parties—TRS in the state and BJP at the Centre—are trying everything to win -voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-banks-on-personal-connect-with-voters-to-ensure-bjp-win-in-huzurabad/articleshow/85140925.cms||Roushan Ali

Farmers could be brought together for this model like the farm producers organisations, he said.The chamber pressed for a boost for dairy farming and drumstick cultivation in the wake of their growing demand in the export segment as well. They pressed for district level ‘Agri-IT-Data Centre’ to study and maintain a record of the quantity of crops raised, productivity and details of the production and demand in India and globally. A well-equipped market committee with proper warehouses, insurance cover for crops damaged due to natural calamities and setting up of pulses board are among their demand. Tamilnadu Foodgrains Merchants Association Limited stressed on reducing GST rates under 22 heads to zero and 5% from the existing 18% and 12%.

This hospital conducts more than 13,000 deliveries annually and is being developed into a full-fledged 500-bed mother-child care centre. Guardian minister of Nagpur district Nitin Raut dedicated this facility to needy patients on Saturday. It will work as a boon for the infants deprived of the benefits of mother milk, he said. “Many infants don’t get mother’s milk which is called the elixir of life. Some kids in orphanages had to grow on artificial infant milk formula. This bank will help many such kids,” said Raut. Dr Seema Parwekar, medical superintendent of the hospital, said that the infant formula is not suitable for majority of kids. “The powder milk, or infant formula is nothing but compromise and can never become a supplement to the mother’s milk. We realized that Nagpur seriously needs a milk bank and took this initiative during the ongoing breastfeeding week,” she said. Dr Madhuri Thorat informed about the reasons why mother’s milk is not available to many children. “Sometimes, mothers fail to produce enough milk for their child. Mothers suffering from TB, jaundice, AIDS and other illnesses cannot produce milk suitable for infants. Those who are on cancer medication, sleeping pills, long term use of tetracycline and likewise drugs cannot feed their kid. The human milk bank at Daga Hospital will provide nourishment to many such kids,” she said. As Daga hospital has a huge footfall of 700 to 800 expecting mothers per day and conducts more than 13,000 deliveries every year, they have enough donors for the bank. The hospital also organized an event about breastfeeding diet for the lactating mothers to mark the week. “Nutritional requirements are maximum during lactation than at any other age in a woman’s life. Hence, the diet should be wisely chosen and balanced,” said Dr Vinita Jain. “A milk bank is needed for a big city like Nagpur which has emerged as a medical hub of Central India. We have big hospitals and a large number of newborns, including premature babies, every day,” said Dr Sandhya Dange. There are visible benefits of the human milk for the infants. They have a lower risk of asthma, obesity, type 1 diabetes, severe lower respiratory disease, acute otitis media (ear infections), sudden infant death syndrome, gastrointestinal infections (diarrhea/vomiting) and necrotizing enterocolitis. Mothers who donate milk also have benefits like lower risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mother-milk-bank-opens-at-daga-hospital/articleshow/85137125.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

A fire official said an earth-moving machine on the premises possibly hit the tank, causing the leakage. TimesViewWhile it is true that the fire brigade and disaster management authorities reacted swiftly to contain the damage and avert a disaster, theleak at such a critical hospital which has been at the centre of major medical work must be thoroughly investigated. Inspections and checks of tanks must be regular and rigorous, and just as mock drills are conducted to bolster preparedness for various kinds of disaster, the only way to avert a tragedy really is to do regular drills for such eventualities too.By the time the fire brigade reached the site, patients had been shifted to other wards in the complex. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said a disaster was averted as a result of quick action. “Some staff in the hospital smelled the gas and alerted us. As a precautionary measure, 77 people, including 19 staff, were evacuated from one of the buildings in the Kasturba complex,” he said. The LPG from the tank is used for cooking, heating and sterilisation purposes. Three fire engines, three jumbo water tankers, and the Hazmat vehicle that handles hazardous material were pressed into service by the fire brigade. The fire officials cordoned off the area, evacuated people — even from the residential buildings adjoining the hospital premises — and called HPCL to send a special decanting vehicle to remove the leftover gas from the damaged tank. The Kasturba Infectious Diseases Hospital holds special significance in the pandemic as the first test for Covid-19 was conducted in the RT-PCR lab here, the first suspected patients were isolated here and the city’s first genome lab was inaugurated here on August 4. Chief fire officer Hemant Parab said the 10-tonne LPG tank was refilled a week ago. Parab said it possibly was half-empty when the leak happened. “We immediately started spraying water to prevent formation of a gas cloud,” said Parab, adding that water was sprayed to keep the temperature low. Mayor Kishori Pednekar, who visited the spot along with cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, said the fire brigade’s promptness averted a major disaster. Kakani said Covid testing would not be affected. “Saturday was a half-day and Sunday is a holiday. We will resume work here on Monday, though the site should be safe to restart electricity as soon as HPCL finishes the decanting exercise,” said Kakani. Mahesh Narvekar, director, disaster management, said: “The whole evacuation could be done quickly as the patients were being shifted within the hospital premises itself. In such a case there was no ambulance required. Also, none of the patients were in a critical condition and were stable medically even after being shifted. We alerted the traffic police to create a green corridor for the HPCL tanker meant to remove the remaining LPG from the tank.” (With inputs from Malathy Iyer)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lpg-tank-leaks-in-kasturba-forces-shifting-of-77-people/articleshow/85139032.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Nagpur||‘Include communities in long-term conservation’||Nagpur: A study conducted by the Network for Conserving Central India (NCCI), an umbrella group of 67 researchers and NGOs, has concluded that its work in the Central Indian Landscape (CIL) has provided pathways towards people-oriented conservation in a human-dominated landscape. The study recommends including local communities is key to long-term conservation and development in regions such as Central India. The CIL includes several embedded tiger reserves like Kanha, Satpuda, Pench, Melghat, Tadoba, Navegaon-Nagzira, Bor, Kawal and Achanakmar and forest corridors that are essential for wildlife movement and genetic continuity across the landscape. The CIL harbours 29% of the country’s tiger population.A study ‘Pathways towards people-oriented conservation in a human-dominated landscape: The network for conserving Central India’ by conservationists Amrita Neelakantan, NCCI, Kishor Rithe, Satpuda Foundation, Gary Tabor, Centre for Large Landscape Conservation, USA, & Ruth DeFries, Columbia University, New York, shows that NCCI has provided a platform for collaborations in landscape-level conservation that maintains biodiversity and livelihoods for local people in a globally important tiger conservation region within a complex social-ecological system.“Using the NCCI as an example, our study identifies indicators to track progress in collaborative landscape-level networks across four dimensions — the composition of the network, collaborative scientific output, dissemination of research outputs through social, electronic, and print media, and participation in policy and decision-making bodies,” says lead author Neelakantan. Since 2013, the NCCI members conducted research that predominantly addressed human-wildlife conflicts and livelihood needs around PAs with less attention to forest ecology and climate. “Our analyses highlight the NCCI’s role as a knowledge platform and bridge among researchers, NGOs, and government, with significant opportunities for boundary work in the science, policy, and practice interface (SPPI). A challenging and unfulfilled goal is the engagement of local communities to co-produce approaches that balance conservation, local livelihoods, and development,” said another author Rithe. “Researchers working in many conservation landscapes have identified the need to focus on human well-being alongside conservation goals and science-informed conservation networks to achieve a balance among multiple objectives that serve both present and future conditions,” said Rithe.In the Central Indian region, the NCCI has helped provide a knowledge-base and a platform for collaborations that improve the well-being of local communities, conserve habitat for wildlife, protect watersheds, promote sustainable tourism, and accommodate development needs for improved infrastructure.The CIL spans across MP, Chhattisgarh, & Maharashtra encompassing more than 4.50 lakh sqkm. The NCCI is evolving into a bridge institution to address the difficult challenge of fostering bottom-up involvement of local communities to further democratize the top-down decision-making structure.It states that networks of NGOs alongside other stakeholders are especially important for local communities who have few avenues to engage in policy and decision-making even at the local scale. NGOs play a crucial role in providing a bridge for wildlife, stakeholders, and policy-makers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/include-communities-in-long-term-conservation/articleshow/85130312.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

In a video conference with Goa government officials, the Centre has asked the state to undertake special monitoring ahead of the coming tourist season to ensure that cases don’t shoot up. Goa must focus on strict enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour, especially with regard to tourists, said the union health ministry during the review meeting. Based on the instructions and guidelines, the state has written to all stakeholders to ensure that complacency does not set in. “Goa must put up signages at prominent places, especially at beaches and railway stations, encouraging people to maintain physical distancing, wear masks in a proper manner etc. Goa must focus on strict enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour, especially with regard to tourists,” the Centre has advised Goa. On July 10, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla chaired a meeting where NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul was also present. Goa DGP Mukesh Kumar Meena and principal secretary Puneet Kumar Goel attended the meeting via video conference. The minutes of the meeting were circulated to the states and key agencies such as Goa Police, the directorate of health services, tourism department, Goa airport, Konkan Railway. Bhalla had emphasized upon the need to put in place systems at the micro-level to check any surge in cases early on and impose suitable restrictions immediately. “Special monitoring is required especially in light of the tourist season,” said ministry of health and family welfare, joint secretary, Lav Agarwal. Goa informed the MHA that field officers have been directed to strictly enforce wearing of masks in public. Strict enforcement of social distancing norms is being followed on beaches and in market areas, with fines being imposed. “Overcrowding in tourist places is a serious cause of concern and any massive explosion of virus will have serious repercussions,” Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ensure-tourists-locals-follow-sops-centre-warns-state/articleshow/85140977.cms||---

Speaking to reporters on his arrival at Nagpur airport, Patole said, “BJP has been constantly giving proof of its vindictive politics. We have seen how the name of Sardar Patel was removed from a stadium and renamed after PM Narendra Modi. BJP is actually afraid of the name Gandhi, that’s why they are trying to rename things.” Patole said such things won’t work because his party has a strong legacy. “It is not possible to wipe out the Congress party. It has been around for so many years and has presence in every single village of this country. Rajiv Gandhi contributed so much for the development of the country and nobody can take away the credit for that.” said Patole. He said the party’s state unit is now working towards celebrating Congress’ foundation day in December with a big rally. Patole said, “Our leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi will be addressing workers at Shivaji Park. This was something which our members wanted.” Shiv Sena leader Milind Narvekar’s post wishing Tejas Uddhav Thackeray on his birthday is being seen by many with political lenses. Reacting to this, Patole said, “Every party decides on its own course. As in media it’s said - launch of a political career. But that’s every party’s right and decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patole-slams-bjp-over-khel-ratna-renaming-controversy/articleshow/85137182.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The show was inaugurated at the State Art Gallery in Madhapur on Saturday to mark National Handlooms Day, which falls on August 7 every year. Fashion designer Hemant Siri and photographer Raghu Mandaati embarked on a project named Tasrika, which means ‘weaving’ in Sanskrit, to connect weavers directly with their potential customers in order to promote their work and subsequently improve their living standards. “When I was thinking of how to give back to the weaver community—who have been struggling to earn a livelihood due to the financial crisis—I realised that the handloom weavers never wore the sarees that they produce in their lifetime. When asked why, they all said it was because none of them could afford it. That’s when I collaborated with about 10 handloom weavers from Narayanpet to buy their products, designed them with Lepakshi temple prints, and gifted them back to the weavers,” Hemanth Siri told STOI. The show, which is being organised from August 7 to 15, will also feature handlooms for the public, in order to create awareness about Telangana’s handloom sector by selling their products. “The purpose of this show is not to raise funds or donations, but to connect the weavers directly with the public so that we can respect their work and improve their living standards,” said Hemanth Siri. The show also showcases the film Tasrika by Raghu Mandaati, which documents the lives of weavers in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/artists-put-up-show-to-help-weavers-in-t-hit-by-pandemic/articleshow/85140975.cms||---
---||Pune||Deputy CM may decide on relaxations in civic limits today: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was likely to take a final decision on relaxations for the city areas and the proposal from the Pune mayor seeking extra business hours for traders in the weekly review meeting on Sunday. “We shall examine the proposal of the Pune mayor regarding relaxations for the city areas separately. The deputy chief minister, Ajit Pawar, is scheduled to convene the weekly review meeting on Sunday. A decision could be taken after discussions with the consent of the local representatives,” said the minister. Pune mayor Murlidhar Morol recently sent a letter to Tope seeking relaxation in timings for traders with the Covid positivity rate being less than 4% in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits in the past few weeks. Tope said low the positivity level in the city areas for the last four weeks, as put out by the Pune mayor, was an encouraging sign. “But the decision on if the state should consider the two municipal corporation limits and the rest of the areas in the district as three separate units while assessing the weekly positivity rate (WPR) would be decided by the chief minister, deputy chief minister and the public health department, which is currently calculating the WPR district-wise,” he said. Tope said the three units in Pune district were treated separately for administrative purposes. But, he said, the state government was considering the WPR of districts as a whole. The health minister said Pune was among the 11 districts having high weekly Covid positivity rate. He said the daily cases continued to be on the higher side in the district, and so all care and caution should be taken ahead of the impending threat of the third wave. He said situation in the “districts of concern” would be reassessed around August 15, as was suggested by the state task force. The Centre has directed all state governments to check for super spreader events ahead of the festivities, commencing from mid-August. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Centre for Disease Control have expressed concern over the mass events during festivals turning into super spreader events. They have directed the states to impose local restrictions to curb mass gatherings to avoid spike in Covid cases. Tope said all the districts had been told not to show any laxity. He said they had been advised to adhere to the five-fold strategy of test, track, treat, vaccinate and ensure Covid appropriate behaviour among people. For industries, the minister said, the health department had already stated that fully vaccinated individuals should be allowed to work without any hurdles. Sources in the industries department stated that an SOP would be finalised next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dy-cm-may-decide-on-relaxations-in-civic-limits-today-rajesh-tope/articleshow/85139013.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Rajya Sabha MP Dr Banda Prakash announced the move during his visit to the site with officials of ASI and the tourism department. An area of ten acres has been identified for the Shilparamam. Following the Unesco’s World Heritage Site tag to Ramappa Temple, the state government now plans to develop tourism in the district, with special focus on the tri-cities of Warangal, Hanamkonda, and Kazipet. The Shilparamam at Warangal Fort will be a site for sale of handicrafts and other tribal-manufactured goods. “Tourists and the people of Warangal can relax and enjoy their breaks here and it will generate income for the government,” the MP said. The state government will also renovate and expand the museum at Warangal Fort at an estimated cost of Rs 5 crore, the proposal for which has been accepted by the Union ministry of tourism. The government plans to develop tourist attractions around all ancient temples and monuments in the city, thus creating a tourism route connecting all important sites. DPRs with their proposals for the development have been handed over to the Centre and ASI by the Rajya Sabha MP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/soon-a-shilparamam-at-warangal-fort/articleshow/85140999.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

Pawar said states have been provided a 15-day projection of how many doses they are set to get. This ‘advance visibility’ of stock also comes with advice on how to prepare and publicise district-wise vaccine programmes. She said, “Under the revised guidelines for implementation of the national Covid vaccination programme from June 21, 75% of the doses are procured from manufacturers and provided free of cost to states based on the following criteria: size of target population, progress of vaccination and wastage.” Maharashtra’s health minister Rajesh Tope said on Saturday that he will be meeting Pawar to discuss increased vaccine allocation for the state, which he said has the capacity to inoculate nearly 10 to 15 lakh people a day. For August, the Centre has allocated the state 1.2 crore vaccine doses. But state officials have said that more would be needed. “If distribution is based on vaccination progress, the state was first in the country to fully vaccinate one crore people,” Tope told TOI on Saturday. He said he plans to reach out to the Centre next week to sort out the supply issues for the state. Pawar said, overall, pace of vaccine coverage has improved significantly across the country, from an average daily count of 2.35 lakh doses (administered in January) to 43.41 lakh doses in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/will-have-enough-doses-to-hit-target-mos-health/articleshow/85139042.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Goa||Goa Medical College and hospital doctors perform rare cardiac surgery on 9-month old, save life||PANAJI: A nine-month old infant got a new lease of life after doctors at Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital performed a critical procedure to close an opening between the two major blood vessels leading to the heart. The baby girl was born with a congenital heart problem, patent ductus arteriosus, and was rushed to GMC with heart failure and pneumonia. Doctors from the cardiology department said that open-heart surgery is usually performed to rectify the defect, but given the risk, cardiologists opted for a non-invasive procedure called percutaneous device closure. The rare feat was performed by the acting head of the cardiology department, Dr Manjunath Desai, along with Parab and consultant cardiologist Dr Amar Prabhudesai. “We have successfully managed to do the procedure and close the hole,” said associate professor of cardiology Dr Michelle Viegas Parab. “The child is doing well now.” GMC dean Dr Shivanand Bandekar said that the child had been diagnosed with a large opening in her heart before delivery. The usual treatment, he said, is open-heart surgery. “What our cardiology department has done is it has considered the child for a closed technique, which is a remarkable achievement for GMC and the department. For a poor patient, the procedure would cost around Rs 2.5-3 lakh, but it was done totally free at GMC,” Bandekar said. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a persistent opening between the two major blood vessels leading from the heart. The opening (ductus arteriosus) is a normal part of a baby’s circulatory system in the womb that usually closes shortly after birth. If it remains open, it's called a patent ductus arteriosus.” “Earlier, most such cases required open-heart surgery, but with advancement in technology, diagnosis and therapeutics, we can now close most of these holes through the skin. We call this percutaneous closure. This is minimally invasive and done under mild sedation,” Prabhudesai said. The advantage of percutaneous closure is that it does not leave a scar and also has a faster recovery time, with the patient being discharged within a day or two. “We had some challenges during the procedure when we were putting sheaths or tubes into the artery of the child’s leg. In a 5kg child, these arteries and veins are very small. This was the major challenge,” Parab said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmc-docs-perform-rare-cardiac-surgery-on-9-mth-old-save-life/articleshow/85140997.cms||Newton Sequeira

According to the state government, about 8,000 artists are registered as folk and performing artistes in Mumbai, Mumbai Suburbs, Thane, and Pune region while 48,000 are registered in the rest of Maharashtra. Many of the many genuine folk artistes from Vidarbha have not yet registered on any platform of the government. Dilip Kosare is the coordinator of ‘Rangakarmi group of performing folk artistes in Vidarbha. He said, “The pandemic has created survival problem for artistes who earn their bread and butter by performing in public events like village fairs. It is through media we came to know about the government aid. But, when and how is still not known,” he said. Zadipatti theatre is quite popular in Chandrapur, Gondia and Gadchiroli districts. Artistes here are also waiting for help from government. “More than 80% of the artistes and technicians in Zadipatti work on daily wages. Most of them were left with no option but to leave the creative field and work as labourers,” said Kiran Karemore, an artiste. Officials of directorate of cultural affairs, Maharashtra, whom TOI spoke to stated that a meticulous survey of the working artistes will be done before disbursal of the assistance. According to a senior official from the directorate, the state has initially agreed to provide Rs5,000 per eligible artiste to those who will qualify. “We have a list of senior artistes who get state government’s pension benefits, but we have to conduct a survey and prepare a fresh list of the active artistes who still depend on theatre, performing arts for their livelihood,” said the official. The state has allocated Rs1 crore separately for this survey and registration of the artistes, said the official. Apart from the traditional art and Zadipatti theatre, Vidarbha also has a large number of artistes who work in band troupes and perform Bhajan, Kirtan, Bharud, Gondhal, Jagran, Powada, Dombari, Lezim, Potaraj, Pingla, Bharad and other folk arts. The proposal of helping the artistes is likely to be placed in Tuesday’s cabinet meeting. Once sanctioned by the Cabinet, a government resolution with complete SOP will be released. Artistes are waiting for the government help eagerly. “It’s already too late. Further delay will create problem of life and death for us,” said Mahesh Lanjewar, a folk singer from Gondia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vidarbha-artistes-unsure-about-eligibility-for-covid-assistance/articleshow/85137132.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Dean Dr A Rathinavel on Saturday said that there have been no suspected deaths at GRH due to mucormycosis.Addressing the media, Dr Rathinavel observed that a multi-disciplinary approach by doctors was in place at GRH to tackle mucormycosis cases. “Mucormycosis cases were a big challenge during the second wave of Covid-19. GRH had referrals from all the south TN districts as well. Doctors from general medicine, ENT, ophthalmology, diabetology, anaesthesiology, microbiology, pathology departments had all worked together to ensure successful treatment,” he said.Low immunity and hyperglycemia due to diabetes are the two major risk factors for mucormycosis. Dr N Dhinakaran, professor and head, ENT department, said that a special treatment centre for mucormycosis cases, which was started at GRH on May 25, has so far seen 365 patients undergoing treatment. Out of 365 cases, 262 had undergone endoscopic surgical debridement. “Most of the mucormycosis cases were diagnosed in patients post Covid-19, who had diabetes and took steroid injections during treatment. The challenge for doctors is that the disease can affect multiple parts of the body, including sinus, nasal cavity, eyes and central nervous system. Some patients come only after suffering significant facial swelling,” he said.During the start of the second wave of Covid-19, GRH was the first centre in south Tamil Nadu to also receive sufficient Amphotericin B, which is vital for the treatment and management of mucormycosis. Dr Vijaya Shanmugam, head, department of ophthalmology, said that GRH doctors ensured that no patient with mucormycosis suffered complete vision loss. “Some of the symptoms affecting the eye in case of mucormycosis are redness in the eyes, ocular pain, and swelling around the eye. For treatment, retrobulbar injections were given for 112 cases, incision and drainage was done for 28 cases, while four patients underwent complete wound debridement,” he said.Doctors from the department of diabetology stressed that control of diabetes is key in the fight against mucormycosis. It was also highlighted that diabetic patients, especially those who took steroids during Covid-19 treatment, should continue taking insulin for at least four weeks after discharge to keep the sugar level under control. Out of the 365 cases, only 36 cases were pathologically black fungal infection cases, whereas, depending on growth of fungus, yellow fungus and white fungus cases were also seen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mucormycosis-331-of-365-admitted-to-grh-discharged-so-far-no-deaths/articleshow/85139027.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The minister has apologised to the employee in question. The employee, a Kamalapur MPP, had been expelled from a meeting with the minister. She had been elected with the support of TRS but is said to be working with now-BJP functionary Eatala Rajender which is assumed to be reason behind her expulsion. The minister had been distributing to cheques to self-help groups in Kamalapur mandal headquarters when the MPP came in 15 minutes to the meeting. He then refused to invite her on to the dais and when she did try to approach him, he is said to have motioned to the organisers following which she was taken out of the meeting by three women police personnel. The incident caused an uproar with local BJP workers staging protests and sloganeering against TRS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-minister-apologises-after-remarks-against-mpp/articleshow/85140984.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

However, the high-power committee meeting held in Malappuram on Saturday termed Ali’s public outburst “wrong and against the traditions of the Thangal family”. In the meeting it was also decided to suspend party worker Rafi Puthiya Kadavu who had hurled abuses at Moyeen Ali at the news conference held at the League House in Kozhikode on Thursday. The meeting entrusted party second in command and Malappuram disrtrict president Panakkad Sadikkali Shihab Thangal to hold consultations with Hyderali Shihab Thangal regarding the final decision to be taken on the matter. The party is learnt to have come to the view that taking disciplinary action against a member of the Panakkad family would further exacerbate the issue and allow the party’s opponents to seize the matter. The sensitiveness involved in taking action against a member of the Panakkad family, especially when Hyderali Shihab Thangal was undergoing medical treatment, also came in for consideration. It is learnt that efforts are on o settle the issue by making Ali give an undertaking accepting his fault. Later, Sadikkali told reporters that Moyeen Ali’s decision to participate in the news conference held at the League House was inappropriate. “It was against the traditions of the Thangal family where there is no practice of individual family members voicing their opinions, be it in matters of IUML or other issues affecting society. Our tradition is to arrive at a joint decision and it is for the senior member of the party to express the opinion of the family. Here that has been violated,” Sadikkali said. He said that the final decision, including the further actions in this regard, will be taken by party supremo Hyderali Shihab Thangal. He added that the family members have made Moyeen Ali realize that he should not have acted likewise. “The high-power committee has also decided to apprise Hyderali Shihab Thangal of the discussions held in the meeting and he will announce the final decision,” Sadikkali said. Meanwhile, Sadikkali and IUML leader and MP E T Mohammed Basheer reacted strongly to the statements made by former minister K T Jaleel targeting P K Kunhalikutty and supporting Moyeen Ali. Sadikkali said that the family has not appointed anyone as their caretaker while Basheer said that IUML was not a party which can be cowed down by such threats. The members of the Panakkad family, Rasheedali Shihab Thangal, Basheerali Shihab Thangal and Abbas Ali Shihab Thangal, also attended the high-power committee meeting. Moyeen Ali, who is also the national vice-president of MYL, had on Thursday alleged in a press conference that all financial transactions related to IUML for the past 40 years had been carried out by Kunhalikutty himself and that Thangal family does not have the tradition of dealing with funds. His outburst came after it emerged that the Enforcement Directorate had issued summons to Hyderali Thangal as part of their probe into allegations of transactions of unaccounted money through the bank account of Chandrika daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/iuml-avoids-disciplinary-action-against-moyeen-ali/articleshow/85137281.cms||---

But, we are also worried about postponing it again due to the rising Covid-19 cases. The state government must consider the option of reopening schools at least in districts where there are fewer Covid-19 cases. If classes are conducted on alternate days, there should be no issue. All teachers can be ensured to be vaccinated as already more than 90% have been vaccinated,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA). He said that private schools are keen to support the state government in following Covid-19 restrictions imposed and keep students safe.Class X and XII students from government schools on the other hand completed their first unit tests this week. Teachers said that there was a good response from students and many had come to school to make submissions. “Around 80% of students appeared in the unit tests. The tests are helping students stay motivated. Students are keen to return to school. We are also prepared and awaiting instructions on making arrangements,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school.K Vimala, a parent of a Class XI student said that while the decision to reopen schools for higher classes from September is welcome, there needs to be more clarity on how students will be kept safe. “They have only mentioned 50% attendance will be allowed. But, we don’t know how it is going to be followed. Also transportation is a concern as many students take public transport or travel by school bus, which can be a risk factor. Not everyone can afford to travel in private vehicles and it will be an additional cost for parents,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/students-parents-hail-school-reopening-move-but-anxious/articleshow/85139037.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune: Small hospitals can now source jabs from large private units||PUNE: Smaller private hospitals nationwide can now get Covid vaccines directly from larger private units, instead of placing an order on CoWIN, health officials told TOI on Saturday. “As per a new CoWIN feature, introduced from August 1, a source private Covid vaccination centre (PCVC) can dispatch doses to a destination PCVC,” said district immunization officer Sachin Edake. He added, “Once it receives the stock, the destination PCVC will record a receipt on CoWIN and the transaction will be closed. CoWIN will also show the stock debited from source PCVC, and credited, to destination PCVC.” Edake said authorities will monitor the process. “No unofficial stock transfer should be done. All vaccine stock transfers between private vaccination centres should be recorded on CoWIN. We will be monitoring the process through regular meetings and site visits,” he said. Edake said a hub-and-spoke model for private vaccination centres has also been introduced, in which a large private vaccination centre becomes a “hub PCVC” for a region. “This 'hub PCVC' will be linked to 'spoke CVCs' (other private hospitals that agree to be part of the arrangement). The Hub PCVC will then handle all transactions for itself and its spokes, such as raising purchase indent, payments, payment status etc,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/small-hospitals-can-now-source-jabs-from-large-private-units/articleshow/85139085.cms||Neha Madaan

Sumit Chauhan, 22, was picked up from his home by Haridwar police. A team of four cops was also stationed at the Olympian’s house on Friday after the family demanded security alleging threats from the dominant caste members in their village. Hockey team captain Rani Rampal condemned the “shameful act” on Saturday, urging people to “rise above casteism”. “Our religions are different, we come from different parts of the country but when we play, we play for the Indian flag,” she told the media, adding that lessons had to be learnt to end such abuse “if India is to become a sporting nation”. Earlier, two men who allegedly harassed Kataria’s family, including a national-level hockey player, were arrested and produced before court. All three have been booked under Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the IPC and sections of the SC/ST Act. Chauhan, Ankur Pal and his brother Vijay Pal — a hockey player who has represented Uttarakhand at the national level — had burst crackers, staged a dance and mocked Katariya’s family after the Indian women’s hockey team’s semi-final loss at the Olympics. The team lost because it had “too many Dalit players,” the men had allegedly said, launching into a stream of casteist abuses. Haridwar SSP Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S told TOI that all three accused were in custody now and investigation in the matter is on. "We have provided police protection to the family," he said. This came even as chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami spoke to Katariya on Saturday and congratulated her on her performance. “We are proud of her achievement. She is an inspiration, especially for women. Her success will encourage many to take up sports, even those living in remote areas who lack facilities,” said Dhami, adding that he had invited the hockey player to his official residence after her return from Tokyo. The state has also announced a Rs 25 lakh cash award for Katariya. Besides, she would be honoured with the Tilu Rauteli award, Uttarakhand’s highest recognition for women. The award is named after a young warrior in Pauri Garhwal in the 17th century who is believed to have fought seven wars by the time she turned 21.

Three among these women have infant children, who are now in jail along with their mothers. Police said that after the accused were produced in court, they found out that three of the accused had recently given birth to children. Since the court had directed these women to judicial remand, it allowed the women to have their children be with them. The women said that their babies were dependent on them for milk. A few days ago, when forest officials had visited tribal areas in connection with podu lands, local women allegedly attacked the officials.

---||Pune||Soon, CoWIN slots for pregnant women, lactating mothers traveling abroad||Pune: Select categories of beneficiaries looking to travel abroad - pregnant women, lactating mothers, persons with disabilities as well foreign nationals living or working in India - will soon be able to book a vaccine slot via CoWIN before their trip, central government officials told TOI on Saturday. A health ministry official said the new feature, set to go live soon, is only for people set to travel internationally and who fall in these categories. The official said, "Select beneficiary segments wishing to travel abroad will be able to declare on CoWIN that they are eligible by selecting the appropriate category while registering. They'll then be able to book appointments for the first or second dose, even if they haven't finished the 84-day interval for Covishield." The official said travellers in these categories can get their jabs at government or private sites. "The new feature is currently in testing. It will go live soon," he said. The official added that the feature aims to ease the vaccination process for these groups as some who were walk-ins had trouble getting inoculated. “On the day of vaccination, these beneficiaries will be required to present the necessary documents for verification at vaccination centres,” the official said. Another functionality that may be reintroduced is the feature that allows a CoWIN user to book appointments for multiple beneficiaries registered in her/his account at one go. "Currently, users have to book appointments one by one on CoWIN, for people registered under their mobile numbers. This feature had existed before but was suspended later. It may be re-introduced after resolving some complexities." CoWIN officials said the platform recently introduced two new options under its ‘Raise an Issue’ tab to remove an unknown member from a beneficiary’s account or transfer a member to another mobile number. This was done after several citizens with CoWIN accounts began tweeting about appearance of unknown people on the list of beneficiaries they had registered on CoWIN. Many citizens have also called for functionalities that let them make corrections in vaccination date, vaccine type, vaccination centre and vaccination status in certificates/records. ST Patil, a 61-year-old resident of Dharwad in Karnataka, said his final vaccination certificate has the same dates (April 13, 2021) for both the first and second dose.

---||Mumbai||Lo & beehold! Honey harvesting at home adds new buzz to Covid-confined Mumbaikars’ lives||Tucked away in a noisy corner of south Mumbai is an unlikely sanctuary where the constant hum of everyday traffic is drowned out by the buzzing of bees. Here, on the fifth floor balcony of a dry fruit trader’s apartment in Byculla, a colony is taking shape that could transform the way one lives in cities. A beekeeper since April, Murtaza Gabajiwala is now part of a growing tribe of at least 50 urban dwellers across Maharashtra raising bees and harvesting honey in their balconies, rooftops and back gardens. Some are doing it to green the city, some to produce their own food and others, out of concern about the plight of pollinators increasingly on the decline. When the virus confined people to their homes, while some turned to gardening or bird-watching to reconnect with nature, beekeeping in man-made hives—introduced a few years ago to help generate livelihood among rural and tribal communities—intensified at urban locations. The promise of “one kilo pure homemade nectar in a month” that could boost his family’s immunity amid Covid and help the environment was reason enough to tempt Gabajiwala. “I had lost faith in the honey available in the market after reading an article about major brands adulterating honey with sugar syrup. I’ve been focused on eating right during the pandemic, so when I heard that you could domesticate honey bees, I wanted to try it. It’s amazing to see honey being cultivated right before my eyes,” says Gabajiwala, delighting in the multiflora honey his bees have produced every month, using nectar collected from different trees and flowers at the Byculla zoo, which is half a kilometre from his SoBo home. With the Central Bee Research and Training Institute (CBRTI), Pune, encouraging beekeeping under the government’s ‘Honey Mission’, apiarist courses have shot up over the last two years. “Earlier, we had mostly farmers sign up for our certificate courses in beekeeping. After we went online because of Covid, we’ve seen lawyers, engineers and professors from Pune, Mumbai and Goa enrol,” informs Sunil Pokare, assistant director, CBRTI. Helping transform the rural art of beekeeping for the city dweller are independent trainers like wildlife veterinarian Dr Madhurita Gupta, who started ‘Bee City’ in December 2019, a project to improve pollinator habitat in urban areas. “Initially people were scared when we started conducting workshops in Kharghar. Once they realised that honey bees are safe to keep at home and grew conscious of the need to save the dwindling bee population, people from Navi Mumbai, Thane, Karjat, Panvel, Pune and Kolhapur started approaching for help with beekeeping in their houses, farms and factories.” The low-maintenance activity that requires little space, few tools, some honey bees, and a hive roughly the size of a desk drawer is drawing a new crowd to an old trade. “One can procure an entire bee colony with the wooden box from farmers in Sindhudurg. The top box is where bees store the honey. The bottom holds the queen bee, worker bees, eggs, larvae, and young ones,” says Gupta, adding that anyone can practice apiculture at home. “It’s not essential to have flowering plants at home either because honey bees can travel up to 5km in search of nectar and pollen,” explains Gupta who has been teaching hobby apiarists to handle bees in a way they do not find threatening. But how wise is it to invite bees into residential limits which can be frightening for the layman or neighbours next door? “The beehives you see hanging from trees are the giant bee types—Apis Dorsata or Apis Florea—that are dangerous. The species that can be domesticated in urban landscape are Apis Cerana Indica and Apis Mellifera because they don’t abscond, their swarming is controllable and won’t sting unless provoked,” explains Gupta, adding that most adults can tolerate more than 1,000 stings. “It’s mostly stingless bees that produce honey worth harvesting. However, one must use caution when extracting honey with protective gear such as a smoker, veiled hat and gloves,” advises Gupta, adding that bee boxes should be kept in an open balcony or window with its entry holes facing outdoors. Like honeybees, the beekeepers, too, are a small and mighty group doing their bit to maintain nature’s balance. “Our ecology has been disrupted by human intervention and therefore the correction has to be human-induced, too,” reasons Ritu Deshmukh, a conservation architect for whom setting up a bee box in her Kharghar apartment was an extension of her sustainable lifestyle and “a lesson for my children about human and nature coexistence.” The sweet summery smell pulsing through a steel manufacturing workshop and the newfound bee love among his staff thrills Vibhu Kapoor, who plonked three bee boxes at his office in Navi Mumbai last year. He attributes it to a desire to counterbalance their tech-laden lives. “Many are now hands-on with honey extraction, we asked them to create something with the beeswax as a social exercise. Interestingly, no one made candles but balm for chapped feet or craft paper,” says Kapoor whose initial aim to improve the tree yield around his workplace bore different fruits. “The bees transformed us. Fostered compassionate behaviour and helped cultivate my team’s hive mind.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/lo-beehold-honey-harvesting-at-home-adds-new-buzz-to-covid-confined-mumbaikars-lives/articleshow/85141751.cms||Mohua Das
---||Trichy||Street food hubs proposed in Trichy||Trichy: The food safety department has proposed two ‘clean street food hubs’ in Trichy city aimed at establishing clean and hygienic street food stalls, a Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) project. The department will train pushcart food vendors on food safety parameters and with the support of district administration, exclusive space for establishing the street food hubs will be identified. The hubs are likely to come up in the city in the next three months.Two stretches in the city namely Central bus stand – Trichy railway junction and Chathiram bus stand – Melachinthamani were tentatively identified as viable venues to set up ‘clean street food hubs’. A cluster requires at least 50 food vendors, and all of them should have a valid FSSAI license. Hand gloves, apron and hair caps are mandatory for the vendors at the hub. Apart from ensuring the quality of water used in cooking and cleaning vessels, the food hub will also ensure the presence of proper handwashing spots, leftover and waste disposal mechanisms and covered containers to store or display food items. “Like the uniform coloured pushcarts in Marina beach, Chennai, we will implement a uniform pattern of pushcarts in the two hubs. CSR or private sponsorship will be sought to develop the infrastructure for the hub,” district food safety officer Dr R Rameshbabu told TOI. The attempt is anticipated to initiate a behavioural change among the street food vendors across the city, pushing them to set up a similar infrastructure, which will improve the quality of street food stalls.The food safety department has conducted an interaction with the street food vendors recently. “There is desirable support for the proposal. We will discuss with the district administration and urban local body for support, such as exclusive space,” the food safety officer said. The food hubs will have periodical audits to examine the quality of food and water. An evaluating agency approved by FSSAI will periodically grade the food hubs based on their adherence to the guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/street-food-hubs-proposed-in-trichy/articleshow/85139148.cms||Deepak Karthik

Thackeray, though, said all these decisions will be taken with utmost caution and after taking into account the Covid-19 situation. “We are taking a calculated risk and don’t want to make a wrong decision that will trigger another wave. A decision regarding restaurant timings and local trains will also be taken in the next few days. We are talking to health officials and the BMC regarding that,” said Thackeray during a function organised by BEST in Mumbai. Meanwhile, cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray said the government was discussing allowing fully vaccinated people to board local trains and also some other relaxations. “We have been discussing easing up local train travel for the past few weeks. A decision will be taken in the next 2-3 days regarding allowing fully vaccinated people to travel on local trains. Some more relaxations will be given in the coming days but after observing the spike due to the relaxations given in the first phase,” said Aaditya. Senior officials said a discussion regarding allowing fully vaccinated individuals to board local trains was held at the cabinet meeting too, but health officials were of the opinion that there should be a gap of at least 10 days before the second phase of relaxations to see the impact of the existing relaxations. Health minister Rajesh Tope also said no one is against the proposal to allow fully vaccinated people on local trains, but a discussion on how to implement it is underway. “A mechanism needs to be put in place for inspection at railway stations, for which the CM may be taking more time. He has said that an appropriate decision will be taken soon,” said Tope. The reopening of local trains to the general public has become a political issue with the MVA government saying the BJP is protesting at stations as it knows that the government will take a favourable decision and it wants to take credit for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-to-decide-on-longer-restaurant-hrs-locals-for-public-in-few-days-cm/articleshow/85139160.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Delhi||Delhi: ‘Balloon seller’ held with 20 new pistols||NEW DELHI: A Delhi Police team on Saturday claimed to have arrested a man and recovered from him 20 pistols that he was planning to supply to criminal gangs in the Capital. The arrested man has been identified as Mufeed Khan, a 27-year-old resident of Mathura district. He disguised as a balloon seller to dodge the police. Khan was previously booked in the cases of Arms Act and attempt to murder in Uttar Pradesh. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said that since Republic Day this year, it was being noticed that Delhi was frequently receiving firearm supplies from other states. “Most of the supplies were coming from Burhanpur and other adjoining areas of Madhya Pradesh. It was also found that criminals are devising novel ways to be in disguise and mislead police for carrying out their activities uninterrupted,” he said. On Friday, information was received that a criminal with a big consignment of pistols is coming to Delhi. A trap was laid and the suspect was spotted carrying a few balloons and a bag. When he was asked to surrender for search, he tried to run away waving a pistol at the police team. “He was quickly controlled and disarmed and the pistol was found loaded with four live rounds. On checking his bag, 19 brand new pistols were recovered and nine packets of balloons were also found,” Meena said. “He said that the consignment was meant for use near Independence Day in Delhi-NCR.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/balloon-seller-held-with-20-new-pistols/articleshow/85139176.cms||---

The sprinters said that they require further training as the international competition is quite challenging against the world’s finest athletes to secure medals.The athletes Subha Venkatesan and Dhanalakshmi Sekar were part of the 4x400m mixed relay team. Although the relay team had clocked 3 minutes and 19 seconds, their season-best, the team did not progress to the final round. However, the journey of two women sprinters from rural Trichy to represent the country in the international event by overcoming poverty was appreciated by locals who gathered at the airport to receive them. “We need further training to equip ourselves. The competition was tough even as we gave our best,” Subha Venkatesan said. “The state government has assured a government job for the Olympians.

However, residents have asked the civic body to drop the proposal as it will pave the way for harassing residents and their guests. The fee collection was scrapped in February 2019 after residents raised a hue and cry. The civic body has planned a public hearing next week to hear the grievances of the residents.A source said that the civic body in July has identified Srirangam Club in Gandhi Road, Amma Mandapam Road, Srirangam Salai and Panjakkarai Road to collect parking fees from the visitors. However, the fee is yet to be fixed. Residents said that the civic body can use space vacant below RoBs and flyovers to streamline the on-street parking. “It seems that the civic body is reviving the parking fee collection. This will yet again result in harassing the residents and their guests. When there is no proper facility to park vehicles, why collect a fee?” asked R Govindaraju, a retired deputy collector from Srirangam. “We will listen to the public. A decision will be taken after the August 12 public hearing scheduled at Srirangam zonal office,” a corporation source said. In 2018-2019, there were also allegations of fleecing against the fee collectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/parking-fee-for-visitors-to-be-reintroduced-in-srirangam/articleshow/85139173.cms||Deepak Karthik

A health ministry official said the feature will go live soon only for people set to travel abroad and who fall in these categories. The official said, “Select beneficiary segments wishing to travel abroad can declare on CoWin that they are eligible by selecting the appropriate category while registering. They will then be able to book appointments for the first or second dose, even if they have not finished the 84-day interval for Covishield.” The official said travelers in these categories can get jabs at government or private centres. “The new feature is being tested. It will go live soon,” he said. The official added that the feature will ease the vaccination process for these groups as some who were walk-ins had trouble getting inoculated. “On the day of vaccination, these beneficiaries will have to present documents for verification at vaccination centres,” the official said. Another feature that may be reintroduced is one that allows a CoWin user to book appointments for multiple beneficiaries registered in her/his account at one go. “Currently, users have to book appointments one by one on CoWin, for people registered under their mobile numbers. This feature was suspended later.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cowin-slots-for-pregnant-women-going-abroad-soon/articleshow/85139236.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||States told to restrict all testing to certified labs||Pune: The National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) has urged states to mandate that testing, including for Covid, should be done at only NABL-accredited labs.The communication to states comes in the wake of the Kumbh Covid testing scam, in which suspects issued fake antigen test reports. “States must not create their own system of recognising and empanelling labs as often, authorities do not have the systems that can verify labs’ competence,” NABL CEO N Venkateswaran said.Venkateswaran said states should also make sure labs are not permitted to test people unless accredited. “This will bring in the required quality in testing. No one will be able to get away with illegality,” he said. Healthcare activists have called for increased vigilance in the wake of the scam. The NABL CEO said while there has been active collaboration between NABL and ICMR, more can be done to ensure action is taken against labs.Venkateswaran said there may be nearly 5 lakh labs involved in testing in the country. “Out of these, NABL has accredited over 7,000 , which is less than 2% of the entire ecosystem. It can take strict action and even withdraw labs' accreditation,” he said. But while accreditation is a voluntary process, all labs, including the unaccredited, are governed by state laws, he added. Officials said an NABL accreditation is granted for a period of two years and an on-site surveillance assessment is conducted after 10 months.. Rohit Jain, secretary of the Practicing Pathologists Society, said NABL accreditation is not binding on medical labs in India. “NABL does not have penal provisions. It can only withdraw accreditation of a non-compliant lab,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/states-told-to-restrict-all-testing-to-certified-labs/articleshow/85139183.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He said Kunhalikutty will have to pay a very heavy price if he plans to make the party high power committee take disciplinary action against Moyeen Ali. Jaleel’s challenge on Saturday morning, before the crucial meeting of the IUML high power committee to discuss the public outburst made by Moyeen Ali against Kunhalikutty, amounted to him taking a head on plunge into the internal affairs of the party. “Kunhalikutty had talked to many members of the Panakkad Thangal family on issues related to ED. The audio clips of those conversations will have to be released as a last resort. If that comes out then he will have to end his political career. It will be good for him if he handles the issue carefully,” Jaleel said. “Even a street hooligan hurled abusive language at Moyeen Ali Thangal. If Kunhalikutty thinks that he can keep members of Thangal family under control through such acts, he is wrong. What will happen is going to be worse than 2006 (when Jaleel defeated Kunhalikutty in the election),” he added. Later, talking to media persons in the evening after the IUML high power committee meeting, Jaleel said he will honour his word on the audio tape matter as no action has been taken against Moyeen Ali Thangal. Jaleel said Kunkalikutty’s dominance in IUML is going to end and added that the party will be forced to do a cleansing drive. “Kunhalikutty is a master of blackmail politics. That is why it was felt that he should be countered in the same coin,” Jaleel said. Jaleel also took a dig at Kunhalikutty by saying that the IUML press conference after the party meeting was the first in its history in which Kunhalikutty has not uttered a word.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kunhalikuttys-dominance-in-iuml-going-to-end-jaleel/articleshow/85137311.cms||---

A stone inscription on one of the pillars of the sluice mentions a local goldsmith who sponsored the infrastructure for the benefit of farmers. The archaeology forum has estimated the period of the structure as 10th century since the inscription has a similar format found in inscriptions belonging to Parantaka Chola I period.The structure was found near Kumilikaruppar Kombadi temple, a rural temple situated near a tank in the village. People still worship the sluice made of stone every Aadi Perukku. Recently, agriculture engineer N Narayanamurthy had alerted the forum following which a team headed by archaeology enthusiast A Manikandan studied the structure. The readable script in Tamil, according to the research scholar, praised a goldsmith named Thiraman who had lived in the Melur village. He has sponsored the sluice gate mentioned as Perumadaikal (a big valve like infrastructure). The superstructure measures about 5.75 feet in height and 1 foot in width. Similar sluice infrastructure was identified by archaeology enthusiasts in Pudukkottai district previously in Kavinadu and Gandarvakkottai. So far 42 stone inscriptions on water management infrastructure were identified in Pudukottai district. “Based on the decoded inscriptions, it is learnt that people have equated the service to agriculture as a service to god. The inscription with 11 lines was not recorded so far,” Manikandan added. Recalling a similar sluice identified in Trichy district a few years back, the forum said wealthy goldsmiths had the practice of contributing to water management infrastructure in the Chola kingdom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/chola-era-inscription-praises-goldsmith-for-sponsoring-sluice/articleshow/85139168.cms||Deepak Karthik

Sumit Chauhan, 22, was picked up from his home by Haridwar police. A team of four cops was also deployed at the Olympian’s house on Friday after the family demanded security alleging threats from dominant caste members. Hockey team captain Rani Rampal condemned the “shameful act”, urging people to “rise above casteism”. “Our religions are different, we come from different parts of the country but when we play, we play for the Indian flag,” she said. Hockey team captain Rani Rampal said lessons had to be learnt to end such abuse “if India is to become a sporting nation”. Earlier, two men who allegedly harassed Katariya’s family were arrested and produced before court. All three have been booked under IPC and the SC/ST Act. Sumit Chauhan, Ankur Pal and his brother Vijay Pal — a hockey player who has represented Uttarakhand at the national level — had burst crackers, staged a dance and mocked Katariya’s family after women’s hockey team lost in the semi-finals. They lost because it had “too many Dalit players,” the men had allegedly said.

With this, he has put an end to speculation that he may float a political party of his own. “My primary focus will be to strengthen BSP in Telangana and it is up to the party to decide my role in national politics. My agenda is to fight for social justice in complete form. It should not be in a token form like garlanding the portraits or paying floral tributes to the statues or even schemes like Dalita Bandhu, which are offered at the time of elections,” he told TOI, while confirming about his decision to join BSP. Praveen Kumar had headed Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TSWREIS) and his stint was marked with students from SC and ST communities excelling in academics and in sports at national and international level. He is also the founder and guiding force of SWAEROES, Social Welfare Aeroes (Greek for sky). It means sky is the limit and there is no reverse gear or no looking back or no slowing down. Political analysts said it was too early to say whether his foray into politics with good following among the youth from SC and other communities would have any impact on the dalit vote bank. Commenting on All India Service (AIS) officers journey in politics, political analyst and social activist Ch Rekha Rao said more bureaucrats should come into politics to make it a better place. “Praveen Kumar’s decision to join politics is a welcome move, but he should not just talk about Swaeroes. It has to be for the development of every one who is economically backward,” Rekha Rao added. n his part, Praveen Kumar said his objective “is work towards achieving social justice in complete form, equal opportunities for all and protecting Constitutional rights and values”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ex-ips-praveen-kumar-to-join-bsp-today-says-will-work-for-social-justice-in-complete-form/articleshow/85141188.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Nagpur||Next task is to maintain Covid-free status: Bhandara district collector||Nagpur: Sandeep Kadam, IAS officer of the 2008 batch, took over as district collector of Bhandara in August last year. Covid-19 spread was fairly under control during the initial months of his tenure, but the second wave hit badly in February 2021 and Bhandara became one of the worst-hit districts in Central India by May 2021. Kadam, who believes in fieldwork, led from the front and stuck to the basics of the ‘trace, test, and treatment’ formula to make Bhandara officially Covid-free on August 6. In a telephonic conversation with TOI, Kadam said the next target is to maintain the Covid-free tag. Bhandara has become the first Covid-free district of Maharashtra. What is the secret? The biggest credit of becoming Covid free goes to the citizens. A majority of them followed the Covid appropriate behavior. Secondly, meticulous planning by administration and coordination in different departments of our team gave the stupendous result. We faced all types of challenges but cooperation and coordination worked for us. Our doctors, paramedic staff, Covid warriors and administrative staff deserve to applaud for this.What was the most challenging period and how you handled it? It was in March-end this year when the Covid curve in Bhandara started a sharp northward movement. This increase in the number of patients continued till April 18. On April 12, we reported 1,596 new cases in a day. On May 1, a total of 35 patients died during treatment. The situation was very serious. Once, we had 12,000+ patients under treatment. Schools turned into makeshift Covid centers in villages. Government buildings, community halls and even wedding halls were utilized to isolate the infected people. Do you think test positivity rate was the biggest scare in Bhandara during the second wave? More than 55% of tests were coming positive on April 12. Our recovery rate also reduced to 62%. The trace, test, and treat formula coupled with ‘break the chain’ restrictions worked for us. Our test positivity rate is under 0.5% for the last one and a half month. It’s officially zero from the last four days. Covid case growth rate is zero for the last four weeks. The recovery rate has increased to 98.11% now. After becoming Covid-free, what is the next challenge for you? To maintain this Covid-free status is a major challenge. This is the most crucial time when people should not take things casually. Third wave of Covid is round the corner and we must be prepared for that. It’s obvious for some people to think that the Covid has gone from Bhandara, but they must understand that the virus is still here. Cases are still being reported in neighboring districts. What will be your strategy to maintain the Covid-free tag? Strict implementation of Covid protocol will be our strategy. We will ensure that people wear masks in public places. There should be no crowding at marriage halls, marketplaces. We will penalize those who don’t wear masks. I appeal to people to follow physical distancing, wash hands regularly, and avoid unnecessary travels for a few more days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/next-task-is-to-maintain-covid-free-status-bhandara-district-collector/articleshow/85133350.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project cost pegged at Rs 1.15 lakh-crore||HYDERABAD: With a majority of works taken up under the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP) having been completed, the irrigation department has started getting approvals for revision of costs for various works under the project. According to sources, the Kaleshwaram project cost is likely to cross Rs 1.15 lakh crore. This is due to escalation of cost in material and land acquisition, delay in handing over sites, enhancement of work scope and taxes which were not included in the project cost at the time of floating tenders. KLIP’s initial cost was pegged at Rs 40,000 crore, which became Rs 80,000 crore. Later, the cost escalated to Rs 1 lakh crore. Officials said its cost would further go up by the time the project is totally completed. The mega project is touted as the most expensive irrigation projects to be undertaken up by any state in the country. Official sources said the chief engineers of various circles have started sending the KLIP works taken up in their jurisdiction and the issuance of GOs is expected soon. “At the time of floating the tenders, there was no GST. The VAT on the works was just 3%, now it is 12%. Similarly, the cost of land acquisition has also increased as oustees demanded more compensation and rehabilitation facilities. Construction of sub-stations was not included in the original proposals and the scope of the work was also modified in some packages,” a senior official of KLIP told STOI. When the KLIP was redesigned five years ago, the project cost was pegged at Rs 80,190 crore. Originally, Kaleshwaram project has been designed to transfer 3 tmcft of water from Medigadda to Yellampally reservoir and 2 tmcft water from Yellampally to Mid Manair. Also, another 1 tmcft water is being lifted from Mid Manair and transferred to Mallannasagar reservoir. To lift more water from Yelllampally and transfer it to Mallannasgar, 1 tmcft was added. This led to an increase in the cost of the project by about Rs 25,000 crore. “Even for other projects such as Mission Bhagiratha, costs have been revised and sent for the government approval for making payments to the contractors. This is not a new practice in the state. It is being followed by other states too,” a chief engineer overseeing the works told STOI. Official sources said a consortium of banks sanctioned Rs 70,000 crore loan under Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project Corporation, which was floated exclusively to execute the project. “So far, the government has taken Rs 45,000 crore and the balance would be used for clearing pending payments,” a KLIP official said. Originally, Kaleshwaram project has been designed to transfer 3 tmcft of water from Medigadda to Yellampally reservoir and 2 tmcft water from Yellampally to Mid Manair. Another 1 tmcft is being lifted from Mid Manair to Mallannasagar reservoir||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kaleshwaram-cost-pegged-at-rs-1-15l-cr/articleshow/85141206.cms||Koride Mahesh

In the second wave, the Covid peak had led to the demand for around 195 MT of oxygen triggered by around 80,000 patients at different hospitals. The crisis had compelled outsourcing of oxygen from other states and even the Indian Air force’s bulk carrier flight had to be engaged in addition to the multiple Oxygen Express bringing supplies by rail. As a part of the third wave preparedness, divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare Verma, collector Vimala and FDA officials like joint commissioner Mahesh Gadekar and asst commissioner PM Ballal visited plants of Inox Air Products limited and Aditya Air Products Private Limited at the Buti Bori industrial areas earlier this week to review the production capacity and functional modalities at these two key oxygen production plants. During the second wave, Inox played a key role as the main source of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) and Aditya air products with their air separation and refilling units. Inox, which had a production capacity of 90 MT, is now capable of taking the production to 100 MT and even more now with the new equipment. Verma said the oxygen supply plants and their management played a commendable role during the second wave and that visits was to ascertain their functional modalities and production capacities proved productive. “We wanted to review and take the feedback from the plant management. Apart from oxygen supplies, efforts are now being undertaken to sort out and settle other issues at the ground level like manpower vacancy at the key positions by taking them up with the concerned authorities,” she said. Vimala said two cryogenic oxygen production centres are coming up at Saoner and Umrer and other oxygen production projects, refilling or separation units are also under the review of the district administration. “A couple of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants are also under the process of getting ready at different locations,” she said. “We are hoping to be self-sufficient in terms of oxygen production and supply before the onset of any subsequent wave,” said the collector. She added the aspect of the use of the industrial oxygen or their production capacities to produce medical oxygen may be later taken up under the guidance of the divisional commissioner in the later phase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/district-admin-to-ensure-adequate-oxygen-supply-to-1-2-lakh-patients/articleshow/85133378.cms||Soumitra Bose

India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an ‘orange’ alert for Sunday, when ‘moderate’ rain is expected. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to IMD, Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station, recorded 6.9mm rainfall between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm. Ridge received the highest rainfall during the same period at 50.8 mm, followed by Pitampura at 16.5 mm. Pusa, SPS Mayur Vihar, Lodhi Road and Palam recorded 3.5mm, 1mm, 1.1mm and 0.6mm rainfall, respectively, during the day. The Met department said light to moderate showers might lash the capital during early hours on Sunday. Thundershowers are also expected. “We have issued an ‘orange’ alert for Sunday as the moderate rain may cause waterlogging and traffic jams in some areas of Delhi,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD. Though the department had earlier predicted subdued rain activity in the region, it changed its forecast on Saturday. “The monsoon trough is shifting towards north India and is close to Delhi and a low pressure system has been formed over north Madhya Pradesh and hence, the rain activity intensified in the capital,” said Srivastava. There is a possibility of very light rain on Monday and the weather is expected to remain dry from Tuesday. “The monsoon trough is expected to shift towards foothills from August 10. The rain activity may remain subdued, while the maximum temperature is likely to rise to 36 degree Celsius,” said a Met official. The brief spells of rain on Saturday led to waterlogging in several parts of the city. Traffic jams were reported near Vikas Minar at ITO. The monsoon report from South Delhi Municipal Corporation stated that a tree felling complaint was received from a municipal girls school near Lado Sarai. The east corporation received complaints regarding waterlogging from Shahdara South zone areas, including Geeta Bhawan near Geeta Colony, Chand Mohalla near Gandhi Nagar and New Lahore Colony in Shastri Nagar. Delhi’s air quality, meanwhile, deteriorated to ‘moderate’ category with an overall Air Quality Index of 101. It is forecast to remain in the lower side of the ‘moderate’ category for the next three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/expect-moderate-rain-today-mercury-to-rise-next-wk/articleshow/85139295.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Hockey star Sumit worked odd jobs to reach Oly squad: Former coach||Dehradun: As the Indian men’s hockey team won the Olympic bronze by defeating Germany earlier this week, none, perhaps, cheered harder than Varun Beniwal. For Beniwal, a hockey coach who mentored Sumit – the midfielder who was part of the winning squad – it was nothing short of a personal win. “I have seen him overcome many financial struggles to be where he is,” Beniwal told TOI. Before the 25-year-old hockey player left for Tokyo last month, he was confident that the team would script a historic win – one that India has been waiting for 41 years, said Beniwal. India had not won an Olympic medal in hockey since 1980. “When we spoke before his trip, Sumit promised me that he would return with a medal. And he did it,” said Beniwal, who is now deputy district sports officer (Haridwar). For the most part of his hockey career, Sumit was forced to do odd jobs to make ends meet. His father is a daily wager in Haryana’s Sonepat. “His elder brother had to sell his watch once to arrange enough money for him to travel to participate in a national level tournament in Secunderabad,” said Beniwal, adding that things turned better for the family once the Indian junior hockey team, which Sumit was part of, lifted the 2016 men’s hockey junior world cup in Lucknow. Beniwal had coached the team at the SAI centre in Sonepat. “Sumit stood out because of his speed and solid instincts,” said Beniwal, adding that it was also his “strict sense of discipline” that set him apart. “Once Sumit had returned late at night from Dhaka after winning the Asia Cup, I didn’t ask him to attend training the next morning since he would be tired. But when I reached the stadium at 5 am, he was already there,” he said. Beniwal now teaches hockey at the Roshnabad Stadium where another Olympic star, Vandana Katariya, first got introduced to the sport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hockey-star-sumit-worked-odd-jobs-to-reach-oly-squad-former-coach/articleshow/85135466.cms||Mohammad Anab

On some occasions, they don’t file FIRs,” he told TOI on Saturday.He said the police will continue to hold monthly meetings with industrial units.Prakash also urged companies to deploy traffic wardens in view of the manpower crunch at the Chakan police station, as was done in the Hinjewadi. IT hubPrerna Katte, ACP (Chakan), conceded that there were some local criminal groups who are active in the industrial areas. “They put pressure on senior officials of the companies to secure contracts.

The organisation that will be set up as a society under the Travancore Cochin Literary, Scientific Charitable Societies Registration Act is being formed to bring organ donation and organ donation surgeries under a single umbrella. The organisation is being set up as per the rule 31 of the transplantation of human organs and tissues rules, 2014, to regulate and stop unhealthy practices like organ trade. As per the rule 31 of the aforesaid rules, in addition to a central organization, there shall also be regional and state-level networking organizations where transplantation of organs or tissues will be performed as the Centre may by notification specify. The state units would be linked to hospitals, organ or tissue matching laboratories and tissue banks within their area and also to regional and national networking organizations. The existing Kerala network for organ sharing will be merged in SOTTO by adhering to the provisions of the transplantation of human organs act and the guidelines of the national organ transplantation programme. The state police had last year found that there was an organ trade racket operating in the state and had been supplying kidney and liver tissues from living to affluent at sizable amounts. The racket was being operated with the help of middlemen, it was found. The new organization being set up is expected to have a deterrent effect over such unhealthy trends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sotto-to-bring-transparency-in-organ-transplants/articleshow/85137379.cms||---

SECR has already managed 100% first dose and 49% second dose vaccination for its nearly 12,000 employees and their family members from different states, by running special trains.Divisional railway manager (DRM) Maninder Uppal used corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to get the training centre — which already had beds in its hostel — converted into a Covid care facility without waiting for budgetary allocations from the headquarters. Uppal has hired 10 doctors, 20 nurses and four paramedical staff for the facility on contractual basis. The facility has also got 30 oxygen concentrators and BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) machines.In the second wave, 1,258 employees of SECR were infected with Covid-19 and some of them passed away too. Viewing the high incidence of Covid infection in the second wave, authorities have started elaborate preparations for the third wave.Uppal said SECR employees and their families were largely dependent upon the 50-bed railway hospital which was under Central Railway (CR). “We have a route length of around 1,157km and our jurisdiction spans across Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, with a railway station every 10km. Around 12,000 staff members are exposed to the virus while managing their duties. This employee base and their families are our concern; we want them to be safe and if infected, get treatment at the earliest,” said Uppal.The DRM said it was very difficult to get staff admitted at private hospitals during the second Covid wave peak. “We have increased our empanelment of private hospitals from six to 37. A 24-hour Covid helpline was created during the second wave, including two doctors and a welfare officer, which would be activated again when the need arises,” he said. Uppal added, “We also have a special system in which the chief medical superintendent and addl chief medical superintendent are supposed to monitor the health of admitted staffers on a regular basis at different private hospitals.”He further said, “We are providing special Covid kits with medicines and oximeters to the home quarantined employees. These patients can seek doctors’ advice and any other help through the dedicated Covid helpline.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/secr-converts-training-centre-to-30-bed-ccc/articleshow/85133372.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Surat||Surat: Want to lodge a cybercrime complaint, take a quiz first||SURAT: When you go to a police station in the city to lodge a cybercrime complaint, it is possible that the officer on duty may ask you to take a test first. As part of its month-long cybercrime awareness campaign the city police is encouraging citizens to take the online exam, especially victims. The cybercrime cell of city police has started a ‘Cyber Sanjivani’ awareness campaign which will continue till the start of September. And cyber awareness quizzes are being used as the main tool to create awareness. “We are asking all those who come to report cybercrime or share information about a possible online racket to appear in the quiz. Over 50 people have appeared in the test while we take their complaint,” said Y A Gohil, assistant commissioner of police, cybercrime cell. Those who have been asked to take the quiz are the victims of cybercrime or those who accompany them to the police station. In the last five days, over 40,000 people have completed the quiz. Each participant is issued a digital certificate with the signature of police officials and the logo of city police. Not only verbal instructions but cops also check the issued certificate when the victim completes the test. “Our officers ask the cybercrime victim and those accompanying them to show the certificate while leaving the police station,” said Gohil.

Deceased Savita Devi and the two injured were working in a farm in Lachhuadih under Bengabaad police station limits when lightning struck around 1pm. On Saturday, the state received widespread rainfall -- accompanied by thunderstorms in the wake of convective clouds forming locally due to a rise in temperature in many parts -- owing to a circulation prevailing over West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh with the monsoon trough passing over Daltonganj. The state capital received 52mm rainfall within an hour and the cumulative rainfall in Jharkhand reached 624.9mm as against the seasonal normal rainfall of 598.9mm, thereby indicating a positive departure of 4%. India Meteorological Department, Ranchi’s acting director Abhishek Anand said the circulation is likely to move northwestward causing fairly widespread rain in the next 48 hours and on Tuesday and Wednesday, widespread rainfall is likely in most parts of Jharkhand and during that period, some districts may receive heavy to very heavy rainfall.” He further said that thunderstorms are also likely in the next 48 hours. “Thundering activity would reduce once the temperature comes down, so we do not expect much thundering when widespread rainfall is predicted from Tuesday onwards,” he added. Though the state experienced normal monsoon this year, there has been a huge disparity in the spatial distribution of rain. While Lohardaga and Jamtara have received excess amount of rainfall -- recording 61% and 65% higher quantum of rain, respectively, Gumla, Simdega, Khunti and Seraikela-Kharsawan are in the rainfall deficient category, recording a rainfall below 19% than the station normal for these districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lightning-strikes-in-giridih-kill-woman-2-more-sustain-injuries/articleshow/85137940.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Rajkot||Absence of cold storage facility dampens ‘kamalam’ export||RAJKOT: The dragon fruit of Gujarat is in demand in the international market. Still, over the last two years farmers from Kutch haven’t been able to export the dragon fruit, known as kamalam in the state, on a large scale because of the high cost involved in air freight. In the absence of a cold storage facility for the ‘kamalam’, it is not possible for the Kutch farmers to stock up huge quantities of the exotic fruit which is must for export through sea route. For shipping purposes, one container requires a minimum quantity of 20 ton of fruit. If a farmer harvests a fruit, which has ripened to about 75%, it can last up to 30-35 days at normal room temperature. The farmers are now demanding the creation of cold storage facilities so they can export through sea routes in bulk which will make them competitive in the international market. ‘Kamalam’ is grown by farmers of Kutch, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Amreli. This fruit has a good export market in the UK, Bahrain, middle east countries, Maldives and even Bangladesh. Haresh Thacker a ‘kamalam’ grower and exporter from Kutch said, “We don’t have enough quantity that we can export through sea route. On the other hand, the air freight charges are around Rs 250 per kg while packaging cost is around Rs 50. It makes our fruit costlier by Rs 300.” Thacker, who is cultivating ‘kamalam’ in 60 acre exported nearly 3,400 kg of produce in the last few months. The ‘kamalam’ is currently being exported through air cargo from Ahmedabad and Mumbai. According to exporters, Vietnam, one of the biggest exporters of the fruit in the world market, can afford to sell at a much cheaper rate because they export through sea routes. “Kamalam imported in India from Vietnam is being sold at Rs 80 per kg because the export cost through sea route is just Rs 10 per kg,” Thacker added. Vishal Gada, one of the pioneers of ‘kamalam’ cultivation in Kutch, has helped many farmers embrace the new crop. Gada is cultivating the fruit in over 75 acres of his farm. “We have exported only 100 kg through a Mumbai based exporter. We are exploring the international market and are in talks with some of the exporters,” Gada said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/absence-of-cold-storage-facility-dampens-kamalam-export/articleshow/85136224.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The NTPC said it has been in regular communication with the railways for the doubling of the railway tracks to transport the coal. In an official statement, the PSU also said the railways have agreed to its proposal including commissioning of a loading bulb at Banadag yard and making provisions for a ‘Y’ section on Hazaribag and Koderma rail lines. These provisions will enhance coal transport by 50%, it said. Several top officials of the railways visited the Banadag railway siding at the Pakri-Barwadih coal mining project and met NTPC officials to discuss the enhancement of coal loading. NTPC officials said the maximum load-carrying capacity from the Banadag siding is 10 rakes in one day corresponding to 39,000 tonnes currently. “Since coal is dispatched to 40 power generating units across the country, augmentation of the coal dispatch infrastructure would help us in securing coal reserves in these power plants,” an NTPC official said. While NTPC is funding the infrastructure development work at the Banadag siding, the railways have asked the PSU to consider financial participation in the project for the doubling of the Koderma-Hazaribagh line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ntpc-rlys-agree-to-improve-infra-augment-coal-transport/articleshow/85138202.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

General Naravane was briefed on construction methodology of the composite vessels at GSL’s glass reinforced plastic facility. The army chief was also briefed on the capabilities of the platform onboard the first prototype vessel that was recently launched, GSL chairman and managing director B B Nagpal said. The need for these new high-speed boats to patrol the Pangong Tso lake was felt in the wake of military clashes between Indian and Chinese troops, leading to a tense situation on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The army chief is in Goa as part of an official visit to the Indian Army’s southern army command. General Naravane reviewed the various other projects being executed at the shipyard and undertook a short sea sortie in the in-house designed fast interceptor craft built by GSL. The Indian Army signed a Rs 65 crore contract with GSL for construction of 12 fast patrol boats under emergency procurement.

"The petitioners, as personnel of armed forces like ITBP, can be posted anywhere based on the requirement...(But) they have no vested right to be deployed in Afghanistan," the bench of justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Amit Bansal said. The petitioners had been deployed in Kandahar before being withdrawn. The ITBP has a unit stationed in Afghanistan to guard India's embassy in Kabul and also the consulate general at Kandahar. Sources said the ITBP posse reports to the ministry of external affairs for duty abroad and the selected personnel receive generous extra allowances and other perks, making it a risky yet lucrative assignment. After the latest disturbances in Afghanistan, India decided to temporarily close its consulate-general in Kandahar. The HC pointed out that the "situation in Afghanistan is fluid, and urgent decisions have to be taken with regard to operations of Indian missions there along with ensuring the safety of the personnel". Appearing for the ITBP director general, the central government's standing counsel Gaurang Kanth contended that deployment of personnel at a foreign mission, de-induction and re-induction were purely administrative matters. The bench agreed to the argument, noting that "courts cannot dictate where and how personnel of the ITBP should be posted".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/30-itbp-troopers-seek-redeployment-in-afghanistan-hc-amazed-junks-their-plea/articleshow/85143114.cms||Abhinav Garg

That 19th-century women’s rights proponent, Rukhmabai, worked as a chief medical officer in Surat and that the hospital she worked at is now named after her must be premium information for the NextGen. Surat, once a major economic centre of the Mughal and later of the British India empire as well, has many unexplored historical facets which exist even today but have been erased from public memory under the humdrum of modern life. To bring these forgotten chapters to life and sensitize Surtis about their illustrious past, a group of heritage enthusiasts embark on a tour of Rander and the walled city’s narrow alleys and lanes every Sunday. The group believes that more colourful tales of common people and traders from that era lie beyond the major heritage structures that are showcased around the present city. “After reading about Surat’s rich heritage and history in books and research papers, I found that very little is done to sensitize people about it. Out of curiosity, I and my friends went around the old city seeking out hidden tales of yore, and soon it became a weekly affair as more people joined us,” said Saloni Prasad, a litterateur and a school teacher. The motley group now has a list of about 200 such sites which were compiled by two NGOs – Dharohar Foundation and Global Shapers Surat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/heritage-enthusiasts-of-surat-explore-citys-long-forgotten-charms/articleshow/85135908.cms||Jay Pachchigar

WAMUL was on verge of closure when NDDB took over its management in 2008. Keeping in view the effect of NDDB’s intervention in restoring and reviving the dairy cooperative institution, the state government of Assam has approved another extension of NDDB’s management of WAMUL. An agreement to this effect was signed on Friday after Meenesh Shah, interim chairman of NDDB met Assam chief minister Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma in Guwahati. “The CM showed keen interest in adopting innovative ways to develop the dairy infrastructure and enhance productivity of milch animals through sex sorted semen and embryo transfer technology. He hoped that NDDB’s intervention will safeguard interest of Assam’s rural milk producers and bring the much needed transformation of rural households,” a release issued by NDDB stated. Shah also met Atul Bora, minister for agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and veterinary, border area development, implementation of Assam accord, cooperation and discussed various aspects of dairy development. WAMUL presently procures an average daily quantity of 41,000 kg of milk from 13,916 dairy farmers. Brand ‘Purabi’ markets around 64,000 litres of milk per day. Even as the market was adversely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, WAMUL attained a sales turnover of Rs 120 crore in the financial year ending March 31, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/nddb-to-manage-assam-govts-wamul-for-another-five-years/articleshow/85135867.cms||---

The flood water from river Seep has destroyed everything in Sheopur, he said, adding, “when we faced the flood fury, there was no government or administration for help. We were left to struggle alone.” Almost 50% of the residential localities of the district headquarters of Sheopur was under water after midnight of August 3. At many places, water entered even in the multi-storey buildings. Earth moving machines have been deployed to clean the roads. The problem is clearing the slush and silt that has entered most houses.

Chief executive officer of GNGPL M Z Khan said that the free gas will be supplied from November to January 2022. Khan also said that GNGPL is in the process of expanding the natural gas pipeline network in Goa with the aim to supply piped natural gas (PNG) to many more manufacturing units and homes in North Goa and Ponda by end of the 2021. “Our aim is to target more domestic customers to use piped natural gas. Interested societies can register latest by August 15 to avail the scheme,” said Khan. Khan said domestic PNG is being supplied in Ponda, Panaji and Old Goa with about 10,500 domestic customers. He said that the aim is to reach out to more homes in North Goa. “This fuel works out to be much more economical and safer than the LPG which is widely used. It is a fairly new concept in Goa, and as such we have to introduce schemes like these to promote its use,” said Khan. GNGPL is a joint venture of Gail Gas Limited and BPCL and has been tasked with supply of piped natural gas to homes, industrial estates and to CNG filling stations for vehicles. It has been authorised to install and operate the piped gas network in North Goa and Ponda. Goa Natural Gas plans to come up with attractive schemes to promote its CNG sector for automobiles in the coming months. “CNG is one of the most environment-friendly fuels as compared to conventional fuels as it has no impurities such as sulphur or lead. With constant hike in petrol price CNG works out to be economical priced at Rs 59 per kg The local taxi operators shall benefit many fold with this scheme,” said Khan. The natural gas pipeline network already covers Madkai and Kundaim industrial estates with at least 10 industrial units shifting to PNG. Goa Natural Gas has five CNG stations in operation with two more planned at Pernem and Colvale respectively by the end of 2021. “The company is in the process of expanding its network to the Colvale and Usgao industrial area and aims to start supply of PNG to many more manufacturing units in the area by end of the 2021,” said Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/firm-offers-free-piped-natural-gas-to-housing-societies-for-3-months/articleshow/85138771.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The then 17-year-old had returned home from the London Olympics opening ceremony to a welcome befitting a medal winner. Union minister and former CM Sarbananda Sonowal, who was the Dibrugarh MP at the time, received her at the airport. A cavalcade of cars and motorbikes escorted the open-top vehicle from which she waved to cheering crowds all the way to the tea garden where she lived. Nine years and two Olympics later, Pinky - now 26 - works as a daily-wage leaf plucker at Borborooah tea estate, earning Rs 167 a day. The girl who used to run Unicef's Sports for Development (S4D) programme in her school and teach about 40 unlettered women every evening is now her impoverished family's breadwinner. Besides her retired father, she has to look after a younger brother and two sisters. "I had big dreams, but now there is nothing left to hope. After my mother's death, I had to drop out of college due to acute financial hardship and start working as a labourer in the tea garden," Pinky said. When she had been selected to carry the torch at the London Olympics, Pinky was in Class 10. She was picked to represent India in recognition of her community work under the International Inspiration Programme, the official legacy theme of London 2012. It was when Pinky was pursuing a BA degree at Dibru College that life took a turn for the worse. She laments that the girl who was the toast of her community is "no longer important" for anyone. "I cannot give advice to anyone. Everyone questions me what I have achieved in life. The government and Unicef have abandoned me," she said. Pinky claims she had been promised "remuneration" for representing India at the torch relay. "Till date, I have not received anything. The truth is that the daughter of a labourer has remained a labourer."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/2012-olympic-torchbearer-toils-at-tea-garden-for-167/day/articleshow/85143198.cms||Rajib Dutta

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: More RT-PCR than rapid tests in districts having high positivity rate||BHOPAL: Damoh district of MP which has seen highest number of Covid-19 cases in the past few days has the highest weekly positivity rate in the entire state. Positivity rate is 0.48% in Damoh. It is followed by Narsinghpur where the weekly positivity rate for the period August 31 and July 6 is 0.36%, as per the official figures. After Narsinghpur, it is Sagar district where the weekly positivity rate is 0.26%. Positivity rate is the number of people testing positive out of every 100 samples tested. It is the Sagar district where maximum cases have been reported in the past 10 days as 35 people had tested positive so far between July 28 and August 7. In Damoh district, 25 people had tested positive in the same period. However, in majority of the districts where the weekly positivity rate seems to be higher, contribution of RT-PCR tests is high compared to rapid tests. In most of such districts, more RT-PCR tests were done compared to rapid antigen tests. In majority of the districts where there has been lower weekly positivity rate like Shivpuri where the weekly positivity rate is zero, 75% of tests done in the week were rapid tests and only 25% of the tests were RTPCR, say official figures. In Raisen too 56% tests in week were rapid while only 44% were RTPCR tests and the weekly positivity rate here too is zero. Sources said that less RTPCR test does not always mean less positivity rate but more rapid tests compared to RTPCR tests definitely make the credibility of low positivity rate weak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-more-rt-pcr-than-rapid-tests-in-districts-having-high-positivity-rate/articleshow/85143207.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh govt withdraws further inquiry against Dr Kafeel Ahmad Khan||PRAYAGRAJ: The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday informed the Allahabad high court that the disciplinary authority’s order dated February 24, 2020, whereby further inquiry was directed against Dr Kafeel Ahmad Khan, a suspended paediatrician of BRD Medical College of Gorakhpur, has been withdrawn. Dr Kafeel was suspended from service on August 22, 2017, following the death of about 60 infants over a few days in the BRD Medical College hospital due to lack of oxygen. During the court proceedings, additional advocate general Manish Goyal, representing the state government, informed the court on Friday that the said order (dated February 24, 2020) has been withdrawn subject to liberty being reserved for the respondents — the state authorities concerned — to proceed in the matter afresh and in light of what was noted by this court in its order of July 29, 2021. The AAG further submitted that all endeavour shall be made to conclude the disciplinary proceedings within a period of three months. Taking the statement of AAG on record, Justice Yashwant Varma said, “That only leaves the court to consider the justification for continuing the suspension of the petitioner, which was made pursuant to an order passed on August 22, 2017 by the state government.” Having made the submission, the AAG requested the court to enable him to obtain requisite instructions in this respect. Hence, the court directed to list this petition on August 10, 2021 for the next hearing. In the present writ petition, by which Dr Kafeel has challenged his suspension and further inquiry, he has disclosed that initially the proceedings were drawn against nine persons. “Seven out of those who were suspended along with the petitioner have since been reinstated pending conclusion of disciplinary proceedings,” Dr Kafeel added. In the present writ petition, the petitioner Dr Kafeel has challenged an order of suspension dated August 22, 2017. An additional challenge has also been made to an order of February 24, 2020 passed by the disciplinary authority, which has while accepting the report submitted by the inquiry officer in part, dissented with the findings returned by the inquiry officer in respect of two charges and directed a further inquiry to be conducted. Earlier, the inquiry officer had submitted his report on April 15, 2019. Thereafter, the disciplinary authority chose to pass the order for further inquiry on February 24, 2020, almost after 11 months which is also under challenge. In its order dated July 29, 2021, the court while taking note of this, had observed, “The delay in taking further action on the part of the disciplinary authority is not explained. The respondents are also obliged to justify the continuance of the order of suspension which has continued for more than four years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/up-withdraws-further-inquiry-against-dr-kafeel/articleshow/85140861.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Lucknow||JP Nadda gives Uttar Pradesh ministers lessons in symbolism, solidarity||LUCKNOW: BJP national president JP Nadda on Saturday taught Uttar Pradesh ministers, MPs and senior officer-bearers the importance of symbolism and show of solidarity in the run-up to the crucial state elections early next year. Giving an example to emphasise the role of symbolism, he said that on posters, the size of photographs of MPs and MLAs should be equal. It presents a picture of unity which has a great symbolic value, he said. “It is seen that MPs downsize MLAs’ photographs in their posters and vice versa. It shouldn’t be the case and sends a wrong message among the people,” Nadda said and added that irrespective of the disputes or ego clashes MPs might have with MLAs, it’s time everyone should be on the same page. He also advised MPs and MLAs to go to each other’s house and have tea together. This also sends a good message among the people and party workers. He also hinted that no MP or office-bearer would have a direct say in MLAs’ tickets. Once a ticket is finalised by the organisation, all would have to ensure the success of the candidate, irrespective of the fact that he or she is of their liking or not, the BJP chief reportedly said at the closed-door meeting ,also attended by national secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his two deputies Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dr Dinesh Sharma, BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and UP BJP organisation secretary Sunil Bansal. Nadda said that there should not be any misunderstanding among candidates and party workers that they would win just like that. “Their win is only because people have voted for them,” Nadda said adding “hence no one should be overconfident that the BJP would win the election easily. Everyone would have to toil hard to achieve the results.” Sources said the national president sought suggestions from the ministers and MPs on strengthening the prospects of the party in UP by both reaching out to the voters and mobilising the cadre, more strongly. “BJP is a party that focuses equally on both the sets of people who make it win, those who vote for it and others who work for it. It’s the time the party reinforces its equation with both sets of people,” said sources. Nadda asked the ministers to prepare a detailed report of what they have achieved in their respective departments since 2017. “The ministers should also set an agenda on what their respective departments would achieve in the coming five years,” he said, asking them to go to the media and explain the achievement of their respective departments. It was not a one-way show and before Nadda spoke, participants like Prayagraj MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi, ministers Laxmi Narain Chaudhary, Mohsin Raza, Dharam Singh Saini, Nandgopal Nandi and Gulabo Devi came up with their suggestions. Chaudhary talked about problems in power department and caste-based politics. Former UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpayi spoke about good governance of Yogi Adityanath government. Some MPs and ministers also expressed concern over rising fuel prices and requested to put a check on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mantris-get-lessons-in-symbolism-solidarity/articleshow/85140680.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Bareilly||Non-bailable warrant against Uttarakhand minister’s spouse for murder||BAREILLY: A non-bailable warrant has been issued against Girdhari Lal Sahu, husband of Uttarakhand women and child development minister Rekha Arya, and his aides in a 31-year-old double murder case. Three accomplices– identified as Badruddin, Naresh and Jagdish – were arrested on Friday and sent to jail, three decades after the crime was committed in 1990, following the warrant by a sessions court in Bareilly. Eleven people, including Sahu, now 59, were accused of killing a Jain couple inside their Bareilly house in the presence of their three daughters. Four of the accused have died since then while one person is on the run. Sahu, then a member of the Samajwadi Party, had allegedly fraudulently transferred ownership of the timber merchant family’s property. Fearing that they might approach court, Sahu and 10 others allegedly barged into the family's house on June 11, 1990, locked the daughters in a room and murdered the couple. The daughters later identified Sahu as the prime accused in court but he managed to get a stay on his arrest from the Allahabad high court. In 2013, the stay was put aside, but the case file mysteriously went “missing”. The case was delayed several years as police put together another file. However, some important information still hasn’t been retrieved. “At that time, all case records were stored manually. We are still assembling everything again, but crucial documents are missing,” a police officer told TOI on condition of anonymity. Counted among the top history-sheeters of Bareilly at one point of time, Sahu had over two dozen criminal cases, many of them related to land grabbing, registered against him in UP. According to a submission in the Allahabad HC, the cases were either withdrawn or he was acquitted – except for the double murder case. The sessions court in Bareilly, which is hearing the case, issued the NBW after it found Sahu “not cooperating and deliberately delaying the court proceedings”, according to additional district government counsel (ADGC) Suneel Singh. “Sahu’s counsel had submitted a medical leave application after the court asked him to be present in the hearing. An NBW was then issued against him. The proceedings in this case have already been delayed after the original case file was lost,” Singh told TOI. Singh added that a chargesheet had been filed in the court against 11 people and proceedings started in 1992. “The accused, however, moved an application in the high court to transfer the case to another district. The plea was rejected and again the accused approached court and managed to get a stay. In 2013, the case file went missing from the record room and all evidence was lost. An order was then given for reconstruction of the file.” Sahu’s counsel Anil Bhatnagar argued that Sahu was “sick” and could not enter court premises due to “threat of infection”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/nbw-against-ukhand-mins-husband-in-31-yr-old-double-murder-case/articleshow/85135199.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||India||Pandemic-hit parents shift kids from private to civic schools||MUMBAI: Sudhir Ahire lost his job during the pandemic last year. Unable to pay private school fees, he shifted his teenage son and nine-year-old daughter to a municipal school. The move from a private school to a civic one seemed painful initially. Now he is all smiles. With students being denied online classes for non-payment of fees, parents faced with job losses are making their children leave private schools and join civic and aided schools where education is free. The 10 new CBSE schools introduced by the BMC this year, and one ICSE, are flooded with applications. The schools spread across Mumbai have 40 seats each from nursery to Class VI. "Till 2019, I used to simply write a cheque for fees. It was only when the pandemic struck that I realised my son's fee was Rs 3,100 per month," said Ahire, who was told about his job loss over a message. He tried to seek time from the school for payment of fees. While that did not happen, his son, in class VIII, was not allowed online access. "He was reluctant to go to a municipal school. But at least a dozen of his classmates have also joined," he said. BMC education officer Raju Tadvi said the non-state board schools run by the municipality are a hit among parents. He said the rush for schools is a result of the pandemic-induced financial crunch. The principal of a civic CBSE school said this year they have got middle-class parents seeking admission for their kids. Nitin Dalvi, one of the 28 petitioners who moved the Bombay HC against two private schools for denying their children online access due to non-payment of fees, moved his son to a civic school. After court intervention, the schools allowed the 28 students online access from Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pandemic-hit-parents-shift-kids-from-private-to-civic-schools/articleshow/85143246.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Kolkata||The Good Mentors||Kolkata: Concerted efforts to improve female literacy and labour force participation notwithstanding, men continue to dominate the top echelons of the business world. A few organisations in the city have taken up the cudgels to fix the gender imbalance in the entrepreneurial sector. One of the oldest is Millennium Mams’, which began its journey in 1993 as a ‘women only’ forum to empower the fair sex through financial awareness and literacy. The brainchild of accomplished entrepreneurs Bishnu Dhanuka and Sanjay Bhuwania, it follows a curriculum that combines theoretical lessons on the basics of finance, entrepreneurship and asset building with a study of current affairs and business dailies and plant visits. “While women form 50% of our population, their contribution to GDP is a dismal 18%. The only way to rectify this anomaly is financial literacy,” said Dhanuka. “Women are multifaceted and we unlock their potential through our various initiatives like Wajood (theatre wing) and Suryodaya (literary forum),” said Rachna Prasad, the president of Millennium Mams’ . In 2008, the Young Ficci Ladies Organisation (YFLO) was launched as a nonprofit in Kolkata to promote entrepreneurship and professional excellence through vocational training, industrial visits, seminars and workshops on subjects concerning business and women. In consonance with its long-term vision — ‘Power to Empower’ — YFLO has also undertaken projects for economic advancement of women. “One of our projects involved distribution of sanitary pad dispensers in village schools for menstrual hygiene. Another project was about imparting digital education to curb student dropout caused by Covid,” said Shefali Rawat Agarwal, chairperson (2020-21), YFLO. The National Expert Committee on Women Empowerment was established by the Indian Chamber of Commerce in 2017 to help women become self-reliant. “We help women entrepreneurs identify and overcome challenges ranging from cyber threats to disasters such as fire or flood. The idea is to make them future-ready,” said Nayantara Palchoudhuri, chairperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/the-good-mentors/articleshow/85141349.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee writes to PM Narendra Modi, says draft electricity bill is ‘anti-people’||KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee wrote to PM Narendra Modi on Saturday, urging him to refrain from tabling the controversial Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2021 in Parliament that seeks to de-license power distribution giving the private sector a free run in picking up high-end consumers when electricity is on the Concurrent List. “It was proposed to be moved last year, but many of us had underlined the anti-people aspects of the draft legislation,” Banerjee said, adding that she had written a letter on the issue on June 12, 2020 on the salient pitfalls of the bill. Saying she was dismayed to note that the fresh draft this year didn’t attempt at a consensus, Banerjee in her letter on Saturday sought “transparent dialogues” with stakeholders on the subject. “I believed that wider consultations with stakeholders would be initiated for a consensual view. Now, I am stunned to hear that the bill is coming back without any consideration for our reservations and in fact with some grave anti-people features this time,” she wrote. “Electricity is on the Concurrent List of the Constitution and any legislation on this subject needs serious prior consultation with the states,” Banerjee added. The bill, in its present form, seeks to take away powers of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) and give the Centre power over the SERC. The CM held that there had been no real exchange of views other than some “token consultations”, which was “antithetical to the federal structure of our polity”. Banerjee objected to the sweeping abdication of the state's pre-eminent role in the power sector in favour of unregulated and de-licensed private players. “Such a laissez-faire approach would result in the concentration of profit-driven private utility players in the lucrative urban-industrial segments while poor and rural consumers would be left to be tended by public sector DISCOMs. In the name of market reforms, the state would have to give up its commanding height. The state PSUs would become sick and forced to serve areas where no corporate body would focus,” the CM said. Banerjee came down heavily on the provisions in the bill that gives powers to private power utilities to cherry-pick consumers. “It will finally end up in profiteering by the new service providers through enhancements in tariffs and every sector of the society will suffer,” she wrote. “Direct interference by the Centre in activities involving distribution will not be helpful to take care of interests of the common people and the states,” the chief minister added. Banerjee was also dismayed with the Centre’s plan to place the entire state electricity grid, including local substations, under the National Grid. “The Electricity Act 2003 had struck a fine balance between the Centre and states in the management of the power sector, while the proposed amendment strikes at the root of that federal architecture,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-writes-to-pm-says-draft-electricity-bill-is-anti-people/articleshow/85139611.cms||---
---||Kolkata||BJP-Trinamool war of words over Damodar basin floods||Midnapore: The recurrent flooding of the lower Damodar basin, spread over Midnapore, Jhargram, Hooghly and Howrah, has become a bone of contention between the Centre and the state. The Bengal BJP president blamed CM Mamata Banerjee for “poor flood management” and the ruling Trinamool accused the Centre of glossing over the sedimentation problem, particularly in Panchet and Maithon dams, that has reduced storage capacity over the years. “What has the CM done for flood prevention in the last 10 years?” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said at Hijli station on Saturday, while touring flood-hit areas at Midnapore’s Ghatal. “It has become her habit to pass the blame on others. Ghatal, Khanakul, Arambag, Moyna are under water. She couldn’t prevent waterlogging even in Kolkata,” the BJP leader said. He pointed out that flooding had become a chronic problem across the state. “Three years ago, people in Malda and Dinajpur were marooned. The CM went to Malda, clicked photos and came back. She didn’t go to Dinajpur.” “The Centre released Rs 225 crore for the Kapaleswari river in 2011. Manas Bhunia received the money when he was state irrigation minister. What happened to that? What did the state government do with the thousands of crores of rupees it got from the Centre under various projects?” Ghosh said. The Bengal BJP president also took a dig at the CM over her letter to the PM fixing responsibility on the Damodar Valley Corporation authorities. “The CM has left everything to God and is now blaming the DVC though state representatives present in the DVC committee were party to the water release decision,” Ghosh added. Trinamool MP Saugata Roy said: “Dilip Ghosh is not aware of the ground reality. No one would deny the continuing sedimentation at the Panchet and Maithon dams under the DVC system. It has reduced the water storage capacity of the reservoirs. Add to it the siltation in the lower Damodar basinthat requires dredging. The CM has been writing time and again to the Centre about the problem that has led to flooding of vast areas in Midnapore, Hooghly, Howrah. But the Centre didn’t pay heed.” State water resources minister Bhunia, who was the irrigation minister in 2011, said: “The Centre had released Rs 228 crore for excavation of the Keleghai-Kapaleswari-Baghai-Chandia channel against Rs 278 crore estimate. It was part of a Rs 650 crore project on 75:25 fund sharing basis by the Centre and the state. Later, the BJP government brought down the Centre’s commitment to 50%. I would like to add that the Centre hasn’t released a single paisa for the Ghatal Master Plan that got the technical and financial go-ahead way back when Uma Bharati was the Union minister.” Bhunia, who was touring flood-hit areas of Midnapore and Jhargram along with MLA Humayun Kabir, asked Ghosh to, instead, find out why the Centre was dragging its feet on the Ghatal Master Plan. “It was originally a Rs 2,200 crore project. The BJP government brought down the estimates to Rs 1,200 crore when Rajib Banerjee was the irrigation minister. But where is the money?” Bhunia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-trinamool-war-of-words-over-damodar-basin-floods/articleshow/85140802.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Kolkata||Man who coined ‘khela hobe’ for TMC attacked in Tripura||KOLKATA: A Trinamool Congress team led by party youth leader Debangshu Bhattacharya, the man behind the wildly successful ‘Khela Hobe’ slogan, came under attack in Tripura’s Dhalai district on Saturday, triggering angry reactions from the party leadership which sought an immediate appointment with Tripura Governor Satyadev Arya to complain about the repeated attacks on its leaders and workers in the state. Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, whose car had come under a similar attack in the state just five days ago, will dash to Agartala on Sunday. Shortly after the incident he took to social media to decry “goonda-raj” in Tripura. In live videos posted on social media, youth leaders Bhattacharya, Jaya Dutta, and Sudip Raha claimed BJP workers perched on elevated roadside embankments rained bricks and stones on their vehicles while they were on the way to a political programme in Dharmanagar. When their cars stopped, the windows were smashed with iron rods. All three sported signs of injuries. Raha was hit on the head and Bhattacharya sustained back injuries. Dutta, a former TMC students’ wing president, was seen bleeding from injuries to her face. The videos also showed the vehicles with smashed windows and shards of glass scattered on the seats. “What is more incredible is that there were cops just 100 meters from the spot,” Raha said. The three youth leaders, who have been tasked by the party leadership to strengthen Trinamool’s youth wing in Tripura, sat on a dharna on the national highway along with party workers in protest. Abhishek Banerjee took to Twitter to post, “The GOONS of @BJP4Tripura have shown their TRUE COLOURS! This barbaric attack on Trinamool workers reveals the 'GOONDA RAJ' in #Tripura under @BjpBiplab's Govt.! Your threats and attacks only prove your inhumanity. DO WHAT YOU CAN.. Trinamool will not budge an INCH!” State education minister Bratya Basu also took to Twitter to allege, “When ‘Goondaraj’ takes over Democratic system, Social order perils! #Tripura is reeling under the Barbaric Rule of @BjpBiplab! @BJP4Tripura shows it’s true colour and fear of Trinamool! This deplorable attack on Trinamool will only make us stronger.” Ghosh had earlier in the day taken to Facebook to allege that he was constantly shadowed by bikers during his three-day stay in Tripura. Basu, Ghosh, state law minister Moloy Ghatak, former MLA Samir Chakraborty and former MP and INTTUC leader Ritabrata Banerjee have been tasked by the party to strengthen the organisation in the state. Asked for a response, state BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya said, “Bengal BJP is not a franchisee of the Tripura BJP. If anything needs to be said on this, the party leadership there will address it.” Till reports last came in, there was no official response from the Tripura BJP on this issue. The Dhalai police also did not issue any statement on the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-team-attacked-in-tripura-again/articleshow/85140874.cms||---

The arrangement of ‘one nation-one ration card’ is being made for people working in other states. Easy bank loans are being provided under PM SVANidhi scheme”, the PM added. PM Modi said that the Swadeshi Movement was started on August 7 in 1905. “It is necessary to encourage handicrafts, handloom and cloth workmanship”, he said and stressed on the need to encourage local products. PM Modi said that everyone must take a pledge for a healthy and prosperous India.He also thanked the people of the state who had gathered in large numbers at more than 25,000 PDS outlets. Chief minister Chouhan, while welcoming PM Modi on behalf of 7.5 crore people of the state, said that the country has developed in ten directions under the PM’s leadership. “Modi ji has the resolve to build a glorious, magnificent, prosperous and thriving India. Development is meaningless unless the light of development reaches the poor, unless changes come in their lives. PM Modi made arrangements to provide food grains to the poor”, Chouhan said. Chouhan said that PM Modi made arrangements to help the poor during the Covid-19 pandemic. Expressing his gratitude with the words of “bhojan bhi, jeevan bhi, samman bhi – dhanyawad Modi ji”, he said that Ayushman Bharat cards of 2.5 crore people have been made in the state. Chouhan said PM Modi enquired about the flood situation in the state twice a day over the phone. “The assistance of the Army, Air Force, BSF, NDRF was provided by him. Helicopters were made available to rescue people”, he added. Food minister Bisahulal Singh and cooperative minister Arvind Singh Bhadauria also addressed the event. Beneficiaries connected with the programme through various platforms, ranging from TV channels and social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pm-modi-lauds-madhya-pradesh-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-for-record-food-output/articleshow/85143301.cms||Ankur Sirothia

The tanker sped away after the accident. The spot where the accident occurred on National Highway 116B is under the jurisdiction of Chandipur police station. Though the car was damaged in the collision, Dibyendu, the younger brother of state opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari, was unhurt. He was yet to file a police complaint when TOI contacted him. “I am fine and have returned home to be with my family. The truck hit the car and then sped away. It was owing to my driver’s alertness that I did not get hurt,” the Tamluk MP told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/oil-tanker-hits-dibyendus-car-mp-unhurt/articleshow/85139672.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Bhopal||80 fatalities every year in Madhya Pradesh: Need to curb crashes due to wrongly-parked vehicles, say experts||BHOPAL: Accidents due to collision with wrongly parked vehicles claim close to 80 lives in a year in the state. Experts say that it is not only enforcement but also engineering interventions that can help to put a curb on it. In an accident two weeks back, four lives were lost in state capital. This week three lives were lost in Ujjain as a car collided with a wrongly parked truck. As per the NCRB report for year 2019 — it is the last available report — as many as 265 such accidents took place in Madhya Pradesh in which 81 people have lost their lives. Experts believe that while enforcement is important, but until and unless it is effectively done, engineering interventions are required. “Road safety is a multiple domain subject there could be no particular solution. There are several important aspects of rear-end collision cases. Our highways are meant for speed limit of 80-100kmph. We can’t have speed breakers everywhere. Bar markers could be used at strategic points to curb speed. It will certainly reduce the impact of accidents. Visibility is also a major factor. There should be proper lighting at such prone points”, says road safety expert from MANIT, Siddharth Rokade. “There is need to ensure proper rear break lights in larger vehicles. There are no severe provisions for ensuring appropriate rear lights. Vehicular reflectivity should be proper. It will alarm the user who is coming from far to check the speed which will help lessen the crash impact. Unfortunately, no one bothers about rear lighting,” said Rokade. “Another major aspect is providing better turning radius. A recent major accident spot in Bhopal had insufficient turning radius . The truck driver had negotiated half of it’s turning radius but then the driver felt that the radius is insufficient. As such, he reversed the vehicle and it is then when the car collided. Had he been able to turn on first attempt there was a chance that there was no accident,” he said. Another expert too echoed similar sentiments. “Major cause of the accidents are over speeding and visibility. To control speed, there should be bar markings or as it is also called strip bar marking, which are one centimeter broad. It should be used at vulnerable and strategic points like curves. And the second part is enforcement, vehicle parking at highways can be tackled by patrolling only. As per norms, there should be patrolling every hour on the national highways”, said Dr Anuj Jaiswal, assistant professor, department of architecture and planning, MANIT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/80-fatalities-every-year-in-madhya-pradesh-need-to-curb-crashes-due-to-wrongly-parked-vehicles-say-experts/articleshow/85143325.cms||Amarjeet Singh

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Mega vaccination drive: Kerala govt to buy 20 lakh vaccines||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/KOCHI: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has urged to increase vaccination in the state. As part of this, a mega vaccination drive will be held between August 9 and 31. "The vaccination (first dose) for citizens above 60 years should be completed before August 15," he said. In the Covid review meeting, he said more focus should be given to vaccinating students above 18 years. The government will purchase 20 lakh vaccine and provide it for the private hospitals in the state, he said. In the meeting, Vijayan said final degree students and PG students should be given priority in the vaccination. School teachers in the upper primary and lower primary sections should also be given priority, he added. In a bid to vaccinate more people, all local bodies have been asked to organize more vaccination camps and vaccination drives for workers employed in shops and establishments in their respective regions. For the Karkidaka Vavu, the government has asked people to observe Bali rituals at their respective houses. The government has also allowed the shopping malls to open in the state from Wednesday. Malls can remain open between 7am and 9pm from Monday to Saturday. All shopping malls have been asked to strictly comply with the Covid protocols. Meanwhile, opposition leader V D Satheesan on Saturday demanded that the state government should provide 50% subsidy on Covid vaccines at private hospitals to encourage people to get inoculated and speed up the vaccination drive. The government has earmarked Rs 1,000 crore in the budget for providing vaccine to all, Satheesan pointed out, adding that it has also collected money through a vaccine challenge which remains unutilized. "Around Rs 1,750 crore is with the government for vaccines. If it is willing to provide 50% subsidy on every vaccine dose in the private sector, more people will come forward instead of waiting for vaccines in the government sector," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mega-vaccination-drive-kerala-govt-to-buy-20-lakh-vaccines/articleshow/85143369.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Ladies, First||Entrepreneurship is not about ideas; it is about making ideas happen. This is the story of five women from Kolkata who chased their vision amid cut-throat competition in male-dominated businesses, built empires from very little or scratch and made a marked difference in lives they touched Kolkata: Building a business is tough and possibly tougher if you are a woman in a patriarchal order. But, things tend to change when you know how to build a door if opportunity doesn’t come knocking. Armed with sheer grit and the sole goal to make a difference, these women broke the glass ceiling and carved a niche for themselves in the country’s startup ecosystem. Shaleni S BiswasShaleni S Biswas struck a balance between family and work while “redefining” the office supplies market with Easy Note Stationery. “I was married and a mother by 21. So, my entrepreneurship dream had to wait. But, it was worth the while. I was more responsible, confident and focused when I started. Stationery had become an unsteady business in the electronic age. I decided to redefine it with hard work and constant learning,” she said. Today, as the managing director of the company she started, Biswas caters to an entire gamut of industries — from academic institutions and corporate firms to confectionery and aviation. “Our goal is to expand and reach out to a larger clientele,” she added. Supriya RoyHaving started her journey with a small confectionery shop in 1990, Supriya Roy is now the MD of The Sugarr & Spice. “My entrepreneurship skills are based on my daily work experiences. I chose the confectionery segment because it looked more promising. My aim is to carry on more efficiently,” she said. Saumya Binani SardaSaumya Binani Sarda, founder-director of TalbotFORCE, is streamlining and keeping up with the current trends in the IFM segment. She is redefining the country’s real estate management sector for commercial office complexes and larger housing societies. She acquired Talbot, a defunct English company with 10 people. In a couple of years, she reformed its structure. It now boasts 8,000 workers across the country. “I grew up in a business family. From the very beginning, my dream was to train unskilled and underprivileged people. Every startup faces difficulties and my journey was no exception. From manpower to money management, I brought in innovative solutions. Passion and perseverance helped me overcome hurdles,” she said. Sonali Ghosal followed in the footsteps of her father — engineer-turned-entrepreneur Shyamalendu Ghosal — and more. The computer engineer from Jadavpur University turned a 22-bed diagnostic centre, a pet healthcare project of her dad’s, into a 100-bed multi-speciality hospital. “Since childhood, I took active interest in my father’s work. Success does not happen overnight; it takes immense dedication and perseverance,” the managing director of Nightingale Hospital told TOI. Ghosal has been on an entrepreneurial streak for 15 years now. “Apart from Nightingale Hospital, I have taken care of civil engineering projects and tea estates in north Bengal,” she said, adding, “I love to launch new services in the hospital; introduce innovative business ideas. I am planning to launch a skill development programme under the brand Nightingale. Being honorary adviser for Ficci-Sikkim, I am also looking forward to more activities in the tiny Himalayan state.” Priyanka MandalIn January 2020, Priyanka Mandal launched Clan Earth with Broteen Biswas. Her mission was to reduce the use of plastic in accessories such as bags, backpacks and wallets. The city-based eco-friendly startup was incubated by WE Hub, an initiative for women entrepreneurs by the Telangana government. Today, Clan Earth trains unemployed youths to make its products and plants five trees for every product sold. Till date, 3,325 trees have been planted across India by the startup that has catered to around 900 people. It raked in a revenue of Rs 15 lakh over a capital investment of Rs 8 lakh in the last fiscal. “The core of our startup is built on environment and social sustainability. We have worked for nearly six years in the slums of Kolkata and Howrah to empower the youth. They have been trained in sewing, tailoring, computers and doodling before being absorbed. Our vision is to plant and nurture one million trees by 2030. Future plans include using coconut and cactus leather for a zero-waste production process and taking our brand to the international market,” Mandal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ladies-first/articleshow/85140775.cms||---
---||India||Pregnant women avoiding Covid vaccine due to fever fear: Doctors||MUMBAI: The fear of fever as an after-effect could be keeping thousands of pregnant women from getting the vaccine against Covid-19, believe gynaecologists. The doctors have called for a massive awareness drive if the state wants success in vaccinating its estimated two million pregnant women. In Mumbai, where the drive started on July 15, merely 429 have taken the shot so far. The city has an estimated 1.5 lakh pregnant women. "The response has been guarded so far. Developing fever after vaccination is the big concern expressed by most. We have been trying to counsel that it is mostly mild and resolves in a day or two, but there is hesitancy," said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC's executive health officer. Of the pregnant women vaccinated so far, only one had a bout of vomiting that required hospitalisation of a few days, she said, adding that no other serious adverse events were noted in those who got vaccinated. Fear of fever is one of the biggest reasons behind vaccine hesitancy of expecting mothers, said gynaecologist Nikhil Datar, and explained why post-immunisation fever is not risky for them. "There is a crucial message that we need to spread. The fever after immunisation is the body's immune response and largely harmless. They shouldn't confuse it with the fever one gets after an infection," said Datar. The fear is more among women in the third trimester, said gynaecologist Sudhir Naik. "Many getting the vaccine in the second trimester worry that the second dose would come in the third trimester. We tell them the fever would be no different from the one they suffer during regular bouts of cold and cough," he said. Little is known about how the drive is faring in the rest of the state as districts are not keeping a count. Dr Raj Gehlot, health officer of Chandrapur, called the response "mixed". Officials from three more districts confirmed they have not been asked to maintain data. Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), said CoWin does not capture pregnant women data, adding that daily reporting will not be possible from 4,000 sites. The Centre had on July 30 said that nearly 2.3 lakh pregnant women had taken the vaccine across India. States leading the chart were Tamil Nadu (78,838), followed by AP (34,228), Odisha (29,821), Madhya Pradesh (21,842), Kerala (18,423) and Karnataka (16,673). Since then, Tamil Nadu has vaccinated 1.9 lakh pregnant women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pregnant-women-avoiding-covid-vaccine-due-to-fever-fear-doctors/articleshow/85143391.cms||---

Many city roads and low-lying areas remained waterlogged for hours as the rainfall continued on Saturday also. While motorists had a tough time plying through the city roads, many of the residents faced difficulty as the storm water entered the ground floor in many houses. Many parts on MG Road, Pottakuzy-Mamangalam Road, Judge’s Avenue, Thammanam-Pulleppady Road, KSRTC Bus Stand, Panampilly Nagar, near Changambuzha Park, Stadium Link Road, etc. saw severe waterlogging. Residents blamed poor drainage system for the waterlogging. Though the water receded in many places by evening, some places continued witnessing waterlogging due to isolated rains in the evening. If the rain continues — which is very likely as an orange alert has been issued for Ernakulam district on Sunday — the waterlogging will become worse. According to the IMD figures released on Saturday, most parts of Ernakulam received more than 5cm rainfall within 24 hours. The rainfall figures are Aluva (5.44cm), Navy airport (8.28cm), Ernakulam South (8.1cm), Cial (4.56cm), Piravom (5.82cm) and Perumbavoor (6.7cm). “The fire and rescue personnel have been standing by to face any untoward situation. We have also arranged a high-power water pump in case the waterlogging becomes severe. The drainage systems in many places were found clogged leading to waterlogging in the areas adjacent to them,” said T B Ramakrishnan, station officer, Gandhinagar Fire Station. However, the incidents of uprooting of trees were not reported anywhere as the winds were not severe. “Usually we get many calls regarding the uprooting of trees or branches falling due to high winds. But only one such case was reported in the last 24 hours,” Ramakrishnan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochis-waterlogging-woes-continue/articleshow/85143390.cms||---

Justice N Anand Venkatesh has made it clear that schools should independently workout remedies for such issues in the manner known to law, but the same can never be a reason to deny issuance of TC. “Students/parents must have absolute freedom to take a decision regarding the continuation of the education in the existing school or to get transfer to any other school. If any student applies for TC, the same must be issued within a one week from the date of receipt of the application,” the judge said. If any school refuses to issue TC, a complaint can be made to the Chief Educational Officer (CEO) concerned and action shall be taken for violation of this order. It shall be ensured that TC is issued to the student. If any such violation is brought to the notice of this court, this court will also initiate suo motu contempt proceedings against the school concerned for violation of the directions issued by this court, the judge added. Justice Anand Venkatesh also made it clear that the directions are issued taking into consideration the pandemic situation and as and when the normalcy is restored, the enactments and regulations will take care of the transfer of students from one school to another. The court also directed the commissioner of school education to issue a circular in this regard to all the schools within two weeks. The court passed the orders on a plea moved by the United District Self Financing Schools Association, represented by its president S Prince Babu Rajendran. The association wanted the court to forbear the school education department from permitting schools in admitting students s without transfer certificate from the members of the petitioner association where the students previously studied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/schools-denying-tc-citing-fee-dues-under-madras-hc-fire/articleshow/85143437.cms||Suresh Kumar

According to a government order in this regard, the number of seats in undergraduate (UG) programmes in arts and science colleges can be increased up to 70. For postgraduate (PG) programmes, numbers can be up to 25 in arts and science courses and 30 in commerce classes. If there exist more seats for any programmes, they can be continued. The state government had last year increased the number of seats in similar fashion, anticipating scrambling for seats as Covid restrictions have crippled the movement of students seeking admission to institutions outside the state. Colleges concerned can take a call on whether to increase the number of seats or not. The government order also asked the state universities to give permission for additional seats without inviting additional financial burden on the government. They have also been asked to include the additional seats in the allotment process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-govt-allows-more-seats-in-colleges/articleshow/85143427.cms||---

Police suspect that gangs operating from Dewas district in Madhya Pradesh may have been involved in the heist. According to police, the truck driven by Suresh Babu started its journey from the manufacturing unit near Chennai with 7,500 mobile phones on Friday evening. It was headed for a storage yard at Hoskote in Bengaluru south from where the mobile phones were to be redistributed. The driver stopped the vehicle near Neralahalli, about 80km from Bengaluru, to answer nature’s call when the car-borne gang blocked the truck and kidnapped him. The gang took him to a nearby farm, gagged and thrashed him and fled the spot with the truck. Police found the empty truck about 500 metres from the spot after the driver, who regained consciousness, rushed to the main road and cried for help. ‘Most suspects in previous mobile heist out on bail’Police suspect that the gang could have moved the loot to another truck. The driver has lodged a complaint with the Mulbagal police station which falls under the Bengaluru rural police circle. “We have got valid leads and a special team has been assigned to track down the suspects with the help of CCTV camera footage,” said Kolar superintendent of police D Kishore Babu According to a Tamil Nadu policeofficer,of the13 suspects arrested in the Krishnagiri heist case, most of them are out on bail. At least 15 more are yet to be arrested. Superintendent of police P Kishore Babu said, “The clues are leading us to the MP gang. But we are not sure if it’s another gang or those who are out on bail in the Krishnagiri case have committed the heist.” Tamil Nadu police officers are working with their counterparts in Karnataka to nab the gang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-truck-with-rs-6-3-crore-phones-looted-in-karnataka/articleshow/85143471.cms||A Selvaraj
---||Kochi||Kochi: People detain woman following misunderstanding||KOCHI: Chaotic scenes prevailed near Kolenchery on Saturday as a 29-year-old woman was detained by passersby alleging that she tried to push her 10-year-old son under a bus. Police, however, found that the woman pushed the child with no intention of causing any bodily harm. They, hence, did not register any case against her. The incident happened at around 11 am at Mazhuvannoor bus stand near Kolenchery town. A man saw the woman pushing the child and raised an alarm as he felt that the woman was trying to kill the child by pushing him under the bus. Soon, local residents gathered and alerted the police. However, according to the police, the woman seemingly shoved the child and he fell under the impact of the push. The mother of five was reportedly on her way to meet a relative to borrow some money. “Her husband had abandoned her two years ago, soon after the birth of the fifth child. It seems like her son tried to follow her when she was on her way to Muvattupuzha. They were arguing about him not wearing clean clothes and the mother asked him to go and change. He, however, insisted on accompanying her and this seems to have resulted in her pushing him,” said an official. The police said the woman was not financially equipped to look after her children and two of them had already been shifted to a child care home. "Following Saturday's incident, the other three children along with the mother were also moved into a similar facility at Pulluvazhy near Perumbavoor,” the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochi-people-detain-woman-following-misunderstanding/articleshow/85143484.cms||---
---||India||Govt gave top priority to poor from Day 1: PM on pandemic||NEW DELHI/ BHOPAL: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday lashed out at past governments for their "hypocrisy", saying they only talked about the poor but hardly did anything for their welfare and said the current dispensation had kept the marginalised in focus and ensured that no middleman can share their entitlement. Addressing beneficiaries of the free ration scheme (PMGKAY) in Madhya Pradesh, Modi said how the state has got rid of its identity of a 'sick state' under the leadership of CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. He added that the cities of MP are setting new examples in cleanliness and development. Accusing past governments of doing precious little, Modi said,"The result was that the poor were deprived of basic facilities for decades even as they struggled for small needs... They (past governments) talked of the poor, sang songs of the poor, but didn't give any facilities. What shall we call it? This is hypocrisy." The Prime Minister said that earlier it was thought that the poor have no use for facilities such as bank accounts, roads, gas connection, toilets, piped water and loans. This false narrative kept the poor deprived for a very long time. Modi said Covid is the biggest disaster in 100 years. Due to the large population of India, the country had to fight together on many fronts. Along with creating infrastructure in the health sector, it also had to face challenges like providing ration to crores of people and giving them employment. "India gave the first priority to the poor, in its strategy to combat the crisis due to coronavirus. Be it Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana or Pradhan Mantri Rozgar Yojana, we thought about food and employment of the poor from day one itself," he said. The PM said from the very first day itself, attention was paid to food and employment of the poor and labourers. More than 80 crore people are getting free ration and over 8 crore poor families got free gas cylinders. Modi added that Rs 30,000 crore rupees were directly transferred to the Jan-Dhan accounts of more than 20 crore women. Similarly, thousands of crore of rupees were transferred to the accounts of labourers and farmers. He said the next tranche of financial assistance to 10-11 crore farmers under PM-KISAN will be transferred to their accounts on Monday. "India gave the first priority to the poor, in its strategy to combat the crisis due to Covid," the PM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-gave-top-priority-to-poor-from-day-1-pm-on-pandemic/articleshow/85143516.cms||---

The region has over 47,000 inmates locked in different jails, of which only 1,517 have been fully vaccinated, while 11,832 have been jabbed once. In all, 13,349 doses have been administered to jail inmates by the authorities of their respective states. As per data of Union health ministry till August 4, as many as 2,518 inmates in Punjab have been provided with the first dose, while only six have been fully vaccinated. Similarly, in Himachal, only 847 have been jabbed once while no inmate has been fully immunised. Haryana is faring better than its neighbouring states as it has so far managed to administer the first dose to 8,467 and the second dose to 1,511 prisoners. The vaccination of inmates has not even started in Chandigarh. In Punjab, there are around 24,000 inmates lodged in 25 jails, including nine central, 11 district and five sub-jails, having a cumulative capacity of 23,488. In Haryana, there are around 20,000 inmates lodged in different jails having a collective capacity of 19,306. There are around 23,00 inmates in Himachal Pradesh and over 900 in Chandigarh. The central government has framed guidelines for vaccinating the prisoners who have been included in the group of people for vaccination without a photo identity card. The central government has set a target of fully vaccinating the prisoners, along with other eligible beneficiaries by December this year. Himachal Pradesh leads country:By providing both doses of vaccine to 19.6% and the first dose to 60.5% of its population, Himachal Pradesh is on the top in the country. At the All-India level, 8.1% population has been fully vaccinated and 29% partially. Chandigarh has fully vaccinated 18.1% of its population and 57.7% has been given at least one dose. In Haryana, 9.6 people out of every 100 have been fully vaccinated and 33.9 people out of 100 have been partially immunised. Punjab is the worst performer in the region with just 7% of its population fully vaccinated and 25.7% partially. Unlike its neighbouring states, Punjab has been complaining about an irregular supply of vaccines. As of Thursday, the state had 3,380 doses of Covishield and 95,940 doses of Covaxin in stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-19-region-lags-in-inoculation-of-jail-inmates-only-3-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/85143490.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Chandigarh||Youth Akali leader Vikramjit Singh gunned down in Mohali; we did it, claims gang in Facebook post||MOHALI: Youth Akali Dal leader Vikramjit Singh alias Vicky Middukhera was chased and shot dead in a movie-style killing in broad daylight in Sector 71 here on Saturday morning. In the evening, Devinder Bambiha gang claimed responsibility for the murder in a Facebook post, accusing the 32-year-old of being an informer of rival Lawrence Bishnoi gang. At 11am, Middukhera was about to sit in his Toyota Fortuner SUV after meeting a property dealer in the market, when two men holding pistols opened fire. The former president of Students Organisation of India (SOI) — a student wing of SAD active in Panjab University (PU) — threw an object at one of the shooters and ran for cover. The two chased and gunned him down. The murder was caught on a CCTV camera. Middukhera had got married two years ago. Two men start firing at Vicky Middukhera as he comes near his SUV in Sector 71 of Mohali on SaturdayPolice said four armed men had reached the parking in a white-colour Hyundai i-20 car. Two of them remained in the vehicle, while the others went after Middukhera as soon as he reached near the door of his SUV. “Middukhera received around nine bullets. He died on the spot. We are checking CCTV footage from the market too. Cops are investigating the murder from all possible angles,” SSP Satinder Singh said. Police have not ruled out gang rivalry. Cops suspect Gaurav Patial alias Lucky, a member of the Bambiha gang, to be behind the killing. Patial is believed to be in Armenia. Patial felt Middukhera was close to the Bishnoi gang, sources said. The Facebook post of Bambiha gang bolstered the theory. In the post, the gang posted a picture of Middukhera with Bishnoi, writing that he was close to their rival group and Patial had warned him. The post alleged Bishnoi gang had killed two Bambiha aides Gurlal Bhalwan and Rana Sidhu on information provided by Middukhera. The gang also claimed he used to provide phone numbers and details of Punjabi singers and other businessmen to Bishnoi for extortion. In a statement, SAD said the killing was the direct result of the “free rein given to gangsters by the Congress government”. The party demanded an independent probe to unmask the conspiracy. Former minister Bikram Singh Majithia demanded an internal inquiry to ascertain the laxity in administering law and order in Mohali leading to the incident. Was bishnoi informer, used to give singers’ details for extortion:Devinder Bambiha gang in a Facebook post claimed Bishnoi gang had killed two Bambiha aides on information provided by Vicky Middukhera. The gang claimed Middukhera used to provide phone numbers and details of Punjabi singers and other businessmen to Bishnoi gang for extortion After the murder of former SOPU leader Gurlal Brar in October 2020, Bambiha gang had owned up to the murder in a FB post It had then claimed that Brar was associated with Bishnoi gang Two hour search in Purab apartments:On the hunt for murder suspects, police said they received information that they might be hiding in Purab Premium Apartments, Sector 88. A police team conducted a search in the society for more than two hours. Residents said around 10-15 cops in plain clothes reached the society, searched the complex and scanned parked vehicles. No one safe in punjab, gangsters operating at will, says SAD:In a statement, former SAD minister Bikram Singh Majithia said the broad daylight killing proved that no one was safe in Punjab. “The law and situation has deteriorated to such an extent that kidnappings, extortions and shootouts have become an everyday event. The government has become powerless to act against the gangsters who are operating at will.” Was active in Panjab University:Vicky Middukhera had been the president of Students Organisation of Panjab University (SOPU) in Panjab University Sukhbir Singh Badal of SAD had later appointed him as the president of Students Organisation Of India YAD president Parambans Singh Romana said Middukhera was a popular student leader during his time in PU||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/youth-akali-leader-vikramjit-singh-gunned-down-in-mohali-we-did-it-claims-gang-in-facebook-post/articleshow/85143615.cms||Pawan Tiwari

It was under 0.8 for most of July. In the past 10 days (July 28 to August 6), the state reported over 2,100 more fresh cases than discharges with eight seeing more new infections than recoveries. It’s the first time since mid-May, when the recovery cycle kicked in, that fresh cases outnumbered discharges. Bengaluru Urban and Dakshina Kannada districts, which had the highest cases in this period, also saw a similar trend. While Bengaluru saw eight of 10 days with more fresh cases than discharges, Dakshina Kannada reported more daily cases than recoveries on all 10 days. Virologist and member of Karnataka Covid-19 technical advisory committee, Dr V Ravi said: “While R0 needs to be continuously monitored, spillovers from neighbouring states is the main reason for fresh cases rising in Karnataka. It’s a matter of concern.” On July 24, the number of active cases in Karnataka dipped under 25,000 for the first time in four months (24,127). A fortnight later, active cases are up at 24,328 (as of Aug 6). Experts push for measuresThe state saw 17,653 fresh cases and 15,505 discharges between July 28 and August 6. Fresh cases were only 15,425 for the 10-day period up to July 27, while discharges (22,704) were 7,279 more than fresh cases. While insisting people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and administrations put measures in place, Ravi said: “The most important tool remains the vaccine. However, that’s not in the state government’s control. While the Centre said it’ll allocate more doses, one has to wait and see.”  Multiple government officials echoed these views and two pointed to measures taken by the government, especially in districts bordering Kerala and Maharashtra. As of 6pm Saturday, over 2.5 crore of nearly 5.9 crore people eligible to receive vaccines in Karnataka got the first dose. Of these, nearly 73 lakh also received the second shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/for-1st-time-since-mid-may-new-covid-cases-exceed-discharges-in-karnataka/articleshow/85143679.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||India||Cop shot dead, two injured in Kulgam terror attack||SRINAGAR: A cop was killed and two more injured after terrorists attacked a police party in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district on Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, an Al-Badr terrorist was killed in an anti-terror operation in Chadoora area in central Kashmir’s Budgam district. His associate, a Lashkar-e-Taiba operative, who had managed to flee the cordon, was arrested later from another location while hiding in a truck. In Kulgam’s Pombay area, a group of terrorists opened fire at the police party, in which three cops sustained injuries. They were immediately shifted to a nearby hospital, where one of them — identified as Constable Nisar Ahmed Wagay, a resident of Anantnag — succumbed during treatment, J&K Police confirmed. Shortly after the attack, the area was cordoned off and a search operation launched to trace the perpetrators, police said. Earlier in the day, a joint team of the Army’s 50RR, CRPF’s 181Bn and J&K Police launched a cordon-and-search operation in Chadoora’s Mochwa area acting on intelligence inputs about terrorists’ presence there. During the exercise, the holed up terrorists were given a chance to surrender but they opened fire at the security forces. In the ensuing gunfight, the Al-Badr terrorist, identified as Shakir Bashir Dar, was killed. As per police records, Dar — from Goripora in Awantipora, in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district — was earlier working as a LeT associate and had joined Al-Badr recently. He was part of groups involved in numerous terror crimes and had several cases registered against him. An AK-rifle with two magazines, 32 rounds, a Chinese pistol with two magazines, 16 rounds, besides a backpack and a pouch were retrieved from the site of the firefight. While the encounter was in progress, it was learnt that another terrorist had escaped from the spot while security forces were laying the cordon. Acting on the information, a joint team of the Army, CRPF and Awantipora Police launched another cordon-and-search operation in Khrew’s Mantaqi Colony and arrested the second terrorist — Lashkar operative Shabir Ahmad Najar, a resident of Wuyan Khrew — who was hiding in a truck. The truck driver was also arrested and the vehicle seized. Security forces recovered a Chinese pistol, a pistol magazine, seven pistol rounds, two AK magazines, 50 AK rounds, a Chinese grenade and 5kg IED, which was destroyed on the spot.

Two are said to be in a critical condition at the district hospital. This is a cause of concern for health officials and the government as Hassan town has become a Covid cluster with cases from three nursing colleges since Thursday. Except for a few, all the infected students are girls. On Thursday, 21 students from Nisarga Nursing College tested positive and 24 others came in contact with them. Of these 24, four tested positive on Saturday, health officials confirmed. All the 25 students are from the same college and stay in a PG accommodation. After the outbreak, authorities tested around 1,800 students of all 10 nursing colleges in the town and over 100 were found infected. Of these, 90% are from Kerala and they had arrived in Hassan before July 27, an official said. On Friday, 37 students from Rajiv Nursing College and 24 students from Rathna Nursing College in Hassan town were infected and they’ve been isolated. Officials are worried as students had gone to eateries and hotels in the past week. "Students in all hostels and paying guest houses will be tested. At first, students in colleges with more students will be tested from Monday", said District Health Officer Dr KM Sathish. On Saturday, Hassan reported 129 fresh cases, which includes the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/karnataka-over-100nursing-students-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-hassan/articleshow/85143717.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka realtors seek pan-India licence to boost sector||BENGALURU: The number of real estate brokers in the state could run into several thousands. Yet, almost five years after Real Estate Regulation and Development Act, 2016 was enforced, only about 2,787 such agents have registered under Karnataka Real Estate Regulatory Authority (K-RERA). The Act not only makes it compulsory for agents to register, but also binds them to deal with only RERA-registered properties. The reasons for poor registration range from lack of awareness about the mandatory requirement to the fear of being held accountable. But one of the major reasons why many leading brokers are not coming forward, according to some realtors, is because of an unscientific licensing system. Ayub Khan, president, Bangalore Realtors Association of India (BRAI), said: “Realtors today work in multiple cities and as per RERA they have to apply for licence in every state they operate. This is creating problems and is unnecessarily burdening and affecting secondary sales. Although RERA is a central act, each state has a different fee ranging from Rs 1-2 lakh.” For example, a realtor who is based in Bengaluru has to obtain a licence from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana if he wants to do business in Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad. “An advocate or CA is allowed to practise in any part of the country without any such hindrance, so why a different set of rules for realtors,” he asked. With several brokers reeling under pressure due to all-time low business (nearzero secondary sales in many cities) in the past one year and more owing to a series of lockdowns, the Indian chapter of International Real Estate Federation (FIABCI) has taken up their cause now.  It has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking a single licence for brokers to operate throughout the country irrespective of the state they belong to. “This will enable realtors and all brokers to carry out business across all states seamlessly,’’ said Farook Mahmood , founder president, FIABCI. Currently, he said realtors have to apply for licence to the respective state governments for primary sales and cannot operate beyond the jurisdiction of the licence being granted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-realtors-seek-pan-india-licence-to-boost-sector/articleshow/85143756.cms||ManuAiyappa Kanathanda

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: 2.4L get jabs daily at govt vaccination centres in August||CHENNAI: The average number of vaccinations per day more than doubled since May with nearly 2.4 lakh people getting the vaccine every day at the government vaccination centres in August. The average vaccinations at private hospitals also increased from around 4,500 a day in May to more than 24,000 by July. If the state continues to vaccinate people at the same pace it may be able to complete adult vaccination only if they vaccinate 7.2 lakh people a day. The state has more than 6 crore adults who require 12 crore doses of the vaccine. Of this, the state has completed more than 2.4 crore doses until Friday. On Saturday, 2.8 lakh more people took the vaccine. “The center has allotted us 79 lakh doses of vaccines for August. But we are hoping that they will give us additional doses so we can increase vaccinations quickly,” said health minister Ma Subramanian. “They added 19 lakh additional doses to the July quota. We also brought vaccines from the private sector using CSR funds to extend free vaccinations. TN is now among the top few states in utilizing private sector vaccines,” he said. Exclusive sessions to complete vaccinations for elderlyWhile there is still discussion on whether vaccinations should be given to teenagers, the state has announced exclusive sessions for administration of second dose on every Sunday from August 8 onwards in more than 50 identified government vaccination centres for people above 60 years. People above 60 years are more vulnerable to the infection and there is high risk of hospitalisation and death among this age group, said senior epidemiologist Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, who is also a part of the state task force. So far, the state has vaccinated about 33% of its 86lakh elderly population with one dose and 13% of them with the second dose. However, the vaccination coverage is not uniform across the all 46 health divisions of the state. For instance, 68% of seniors in The Nilgiris, 60% of them in Chennai and 53% of them in Coimbatore have taken the first dose, but the coverage for first dose is less than 20% in at least six health units – Ranipet (19%), Tirunelveli (19%), Cheyyar (18%), Ariyalur (17%), Villupuram (16%) and Karur (14%). The numbers drop further for the second dose of vaccinations. While Chennai and the Nilgiris have competed two doses for 35% and 30% its senior citizens, less than 4% of senior citizens in Ariyalur, Villupuram and Karur have taken the vaccine. “The exclusive sessions will reduce waiting times and make it more comfortable for the elderly to walk in and get themselves vaccinated,” said director of public health Dr TS Selvavinayagam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-2-4l-get-jabs-daily-at-govt-vaccination-centres-in-august/articleshow/85143795.cms||---

The Bruhat Bangalore Hotels’Association (BBHA) said a representation in this regard will soon be made to CMBasavaraj Bommai. Veerendra N Kamat, general secretary, BBHA, said that more than 6,000 hotels have closed in the last 18 months and that over 1,500 have not opened after the second lockdown. He added that another 10,000 may close down if their financial crisis persits. “Many hotel owners who have closed are unable to even sell off their furniture and other items as nobody is interested in acquiring them,” added Kamat. He added that corporates offices implementing work from home has also affected their business. Aside from this, the industry is also staring at low manpower given that most migrant workers who left Bengaluru after the second lockdown has not returned to the city yet. PC Rao, president, BBHA, added: “The government is taking unilateral decisions without consulting businesses concerned. The sudden imposition of weekend curfew in some border districts has caused huge losses to the industry, which was already struggling because of earlier lockdowns.” He added that lockdowns must be the last resort and that the government must focus on expediting vaccination by making existing doses available to all areas without being partial towards some places. “...The government should also provide RT-PCR test results within hours instead of taking two-three days. We will meet the CM either on Monday or Tuesday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cant-afford-another-closure-say-bengaluru-hoteliers/articleshow/85143797.cms||---

To standardize practices for prevention and management of Covid-19 across the state, the health department released a series of orders outlining the state’s policy of surveillance, testing, triaging, vaccinations and management and reporting of adverse effects of vaccinations. These orders issued by the health secretary J Radhakrishnan on Friday have been given to district health authorities and doctors in government hospitals. “We have used the experiences we have gained over the last one year to standardize prevention measures. Although cases are declining, the number of fresh cases Tamil Nadu is reporting remains very high,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “Any reduction in surveillance, testing or implementation of covid appropriate behaviour can lead to a surge,” he said. The orders details protocols such as active and passive surveillance measures, who and when to ask people to undergo test. “The contents were based on experiences share by doctors and medical experts,” he said. For instance, as per the new order results of all RTPCR tests should be declared within 24 hours and they should be communicated with individuals through SMS even if the test is negative. Random sampling can be taken at work/high risk areas such as pharmacies and marketplaces. Another GO on vaccinations offers details as to how the centres should be established and how wastage should be avoided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/new-covid-19-protocol-for-jails-old-age-homes-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/85143830.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Mistaken for a thief, street vendor abducted, thrashed||GURUGRAM: A street vendor was allegedly abducted and thrashed by three youths, who accused him of stealing a mobile phone, on Friday. The youths allegedly kidnapped Suraj (25) from his shanty in Sector 86 and took him to a vacant plot in Sector 84, where they assaulted him. An FIR has been filed against them. This is the second incident in a week wherein a youth was abducted and assaulted in a case of mistaken identity. On Monday, three men were thrashed in a badminton academy after they were mistakenly identified by a trainee as the accomplice of a biker who had molested her. One of the men died. Police said they haven’t found any role of Suraj in stealing mobile phones and the accused hadn’t registered a complaint of mobile theft either. Suraj sells pottery items on footpaths in new sectors. He lives in a slum in Sector 86 with his father Prakash and wife Anjali. Around 9.30pm on Friday, a Maruti Swift Dzire stopped in front of the slum. A man, identified as Manender from Joniyawas village, allegedly stepped out of the car and accused Suraj of stealing his mobile phone. He tried to drag Suraj inside his car, but the latter’s family and neighbours stopped him. Manender left. After 15 minutes, he returned with two other youths, who haven’t been identified yet. This time, they dragged Suraj inside the car and drove off. “They took me a few kilometres away to a vacant plot near Vatika Seven Lamps. They thrashed me and kept on forcing me to admit to stealing the phone. I kept telling them that they had mistaken me for someone else, but they didn’t listen and thrashed me,” Suraj told police. “They would have killed me. I managed to escape them and ran towards my home. I found my father on the way, with some policemen,” he said. After Suraj was abducted, his family alerted cops. A police team was carrying out a search when they found him. “Suraj was taken to hospital. He didn’t suffer major injuries and was discharged after first aid,” police spokesperson Subhash Boken said. An FIR was filed under sections 323 (causing hurt), 365 (kidnapping) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC at Kherki Daula police station on Friday. Police are scanning the CCTV footage of the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mistaken-for-a-thief-street-vendor-abducted-thrashed/articleshow/85138595.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||Five Rohingya refugees held in Nuh over lack of papers, one had fake Aadhaar||By: Sagrika Kissu GURUGRAM: Five Rohingya refugees, including a woman and her two-year-old son, have been arrested in Nuh for not having cards issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). These cards affirm their refugee status and prevent authorities from taking any “arbitrary action” against them. Fake Aadhaar and PAN cards were also recovered from one of them. While police said the five had sneaked into India illegally, Nuh MLA Aftab Ahmed dubbed the arrests a case of “harassment”. On Wednesday, seven Rohingya refugees were detained initially. While two of them could produce valid papers and were released, the five were arrested over lack of documents. “This is an ongoing investigation. The five Rohingya who were arrested have been kept in judicial custody. They didn’t have refugee cards, which means they were staying illegally,” said Narendra Bijarniya, the SP of Nuh. Saidul Ameen, one of the five accused, was found with fake Aadhaar and PAN cards. Police said the Aadhaar card he had mentioned an address of Aligarh in UP. Although he had a photocopy of a refugee card issued by UNHCR, the date of birth mentioned on it and the one on the Aadhaar card were different. Saidul, who had been working at a meat export company for the past two years, had also procured a fake GST number. “We found a GST form after searching him. To apply for a GST form, there are certain conditions that need to be fulfilled. We think he has more forged documents in his possession. We are looking into that,” a police officer said. Saidul has been booked under sections 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 471 (using genuine as a forged) of the IPC. The others — identified as Ridhwan, Arfat and Haseena — have been arrested under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act, 1946, for not having proper documents. Arfat and Haseena have also been charged under Section 12 of the Passports Act, 1967. “All of them had crossed the border illegally. They didn’t have a visa, passport or any other document. Haseena’s three-year old son will remain in detention with his mother,” the officer said. The police said they would conduct random checks on Rohingya families in Nuh. A couple of weeks ago, three men from Bangladesh and Myanmar were arrested from Ghaziabad railway station for alleged trafficking of Rohingya women and children in Delhi-NCR. Ahmed, the Nuh MLA, described the arrests as “harassment” by the police. “This is a clear case of harassment. There are roughly a thousand Rohingya families living in Nuh and they are trying hard to eke out a living. Earlier, some of them had applied for an Aadhar card. But when they realised that such documents were applicable for only Indian citizens, they backed out,” he added. The MLA, however, did not say anything about the fact that the five arrested Rohingya did not have refugee cards either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/5-rohingya-refugees-held-in-nuh-over-lack-of-papers-one-had-fake-aadhaar/articleshow/85138614.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Olympics success will inspire many. That ambition needs support||By Dip Sengupta Women hold up half the sky,” Mao Zedong had famously said. At the Tokyo Olympics, Indian women have held up more than half the national flag. Irrespective of them not winning a medal, the Indian women’s hockey team has overwhelmed us with their spirited display of grit and gumption in the face of overwhelming odds —some personal, some institutional — but odds so insurmountable that we who watch comfortably from the sidelines can only look on in awe. It’s not just the women’s hockey team. Lovlina Borgohain has not won either gold or silver, but had declared her intent of not just settling for a bronze alone, about which a medal-starved nation had already broken into frenzied celebrations. As a child, Rani Rampal, the women’s hockey team captain, practised with a broken hockey stick because she could not afford any better. Lovlina Borgohain’s father struggled to financially support his daughter’s training. And Mirabai Chanu, the silver medallist, had to depend on the kindness of local truckers every morning for free transport from her home in Nongpok Kakching village to her training centre in Imphal. These are individual sagas of inspiration for our times, significant waypoints in contemporary India’s tumultuous journey. Despite chronic neglect, overt and covert racial othering and debilitating socio-economic circumstances, a precious alchemy is at work here, where ambition and unshakeable self-belief, day after day, transmute laboriously into metals, the type much coveted on the world stage. This is hard, individual brilliance, mined from a long, lonely journey of effort and sacrifice. What will it all mean to us as citizens, consumers, brands? Some headlines will inevitably laud India’s daughters. There are some lessons and a caveat. First, the caveat. This nomenclature “India’s daughters” — seemingly innocent — is insidious patriarchy at a deeper level, seeking to co-opt and appropriate every achievement. When men stand at the Olympics victory podium, they are lauded as star athletes, champion wrestlers and players. When women make it to the same podium, they are often branded as daughters, mothers or sisters — their relation to a male relative, their ascribed domestic roles superseding their achievement on the world stage. This is gender asymmetry, often subconscious. Rani and her braveheart sisters, Lovlina Borgohain, who punched her way to a medal, and Mirabai Chanu, who brought honour to India on the very first day of the Games, needn’t be shoe-boxed as daughters or wives or sisters to remain the singular champions they are and always will be. They don’t need familial validation. They are individuals with broad shoulders, in and of themselves, who have stood up to be counted. Now for the learning and it is a humbling one. Across the small towns and villages of India, some we have perhaps not heard of, like Jhansal, Miadi Kalan, Badkichapar, Nongpok Kakching, Khunti and Kolasib, a caravan of dreams will hear the call and set forth. As marketers and brand custodians, we will be doing our brands, our aspiring sportswomen and our nation a great service by respecting and supporting this groundswell of ambition and resilience as much as we can, in a sustained, substantial manner. Tokyo 2020 has shown us that it is time.

The weapons were found to be dummies, meant to be used in an upcoming movie of actor Suriya directed by Pandiraj. Special sub-inspector Palani and team intercepted a two-wheeler on the 100-FT Road near Koyambedu and a search led to the seizure of two INSAS rifles. Though the man claimed that the rifles were dummy to be used in movies, he was taken to the police station for interrogation. The man was identified as A Victor, 27, of Perambur, who told police he worked as an assistant to director Pandiraj of Pasanga and Kadaikutti Singam fame. He also informed police that he was taking the rifles to the CMBT to send them to Karaikudi for shooting. However, since there were no proper documents to carry the dummy rifles, he was detained at the police station for further investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-man-27-held-with-dummy-rifles-during-vehicle-check/articleshow/85143914.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Facelift for new sector roads on cards||Gurgaon: Roads in new sectors are set for a revamp as the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has prepared a plan for maintenance, repairing and augmentation of master and sector-dividing roads in sectors 58 to 115 at a cost of Rs 206 crore. The authority has divided roads into several categories depending upon their condition — five roads need augmentation and strengthening, in which they will be dug up and built afresh, 13 require special repairs (relaying) and around a dozen others need annual maintenance like filling of potholes or patchwork. Another five roads will be developed as ‘model roads’ with greenery and cycle tracks. The roads have been divided into these clusters for the purpose of issuing tenders and awarding contracts. “We have put the roads into different categories depending upon the kind of repairs and maintenance required. Some roads need complete overhaul, some need relaying of the top layer and some just require regular maintenance,” said a senior GMDA official. The project will be carried out keeping in mind the traffic flow, he said. The roads that will be upgraded and strengthened include those dividing sectors 81 and 82, 81A and 82A, 85 and 86, 89 and 90 and the road linking Rampura Chowk to Pataudi Chowk. The revamp is expected to cost Rs 63.6 crore and the process of issuing a tender is underway. A cluster of five roads will be developed as ‘model roads’ — including the master roads dividing sectors 58 and 59, 60 and 61, 62 and 63, 64 and 65 and 66 and 67 — at a cost of Rs 74.7 crore. A detailed project report is being prepared. Special repairs will be carried on 13 sector-dividing roads at a cost of over Rs 59.5 crore. These roads include the master roads dividing sectors 62 and 65, 65 and 66, 64 and 67, 82A and 83, 82 and 83, 86 and 90, 93 and 94, 102 and 102A, 103 and 106 and the outer roads of sectors 112 and 114. The roads which will undergo annual maintenance include those dividing sectors 60 and 63 and 61 and 62, apart from the master roads of sectors 81 to 95 and 99 to 115. Footpaths and drains along these roads will also be revamped. The repairs of these stretches are estimated to cost Rs 8.6 crore. Residents of new sectors have welcomed the move. “The condition of most of the roads in new sectors is bad and they need immediate repair and maintenance,” said Praveen Sharma, a resident of Sector 65.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/facelift-for-new-sector-roads-on-cards/articleshow/85140848.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: ‘Bank, buyer entitled to relief for delay in handing over flat’||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority has directed a developer to repay two homebuyers and a bank due to delay in handing over an apartment. While the bank took over possession of the flat, the buyer approached TNEREA for delay in delivery, charging the developer and the bank were in collusion. The complaint pertains to ‘BBCL Breeze Residences’ on Poonamallee High Road at Kilpauk developed by BBCL Developers (India) Pvt. Ltd., with HDFC granting loan to the buyers. The buyers said they paid Rs 5.4 crore for the flat to be handed over by December 2018 with a 6-month grace period. Pointing out that construction was not completed in the agreed time, they said they were entitled to relief. Terming the allegations false and noting there was a slight delay due to reasons including GST, demonetization, shortage of input material and Covid-triggered lockdowns, the developer said the buyers too delayed payment. The banker charged that the buyers were loaned Rs 5.75 crore, but they defaulted in loan payment and it was classified a Non-Performing Asset and they were issued notice. The bank took symbolic possession of the property in December 2020, saying the amount due from the buyers was more than Rs 6 crore. After hearing both sides, TNRERA adjudicating officer G Saravanan ruled that the buyers can’t be blamed for not adhering to the payment schedule when the project itself was delayed due to circumstances not in their control. “… it is held that the complainants are entitled to return of the amount paid to the developer with interest including compensation on ground of failure to complete the construction as per the construction agreements,” the order said. The amount due to the complainants under this order is to be paid to the bank towards the satisfaction of the loan. The remaining amount is payable to the homebuyers, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-bank-buyer-entitled-to-relief-for-delay-in-handing-over-flat/articleshow/85143941.cms||---

The cop, who had come to Gurgaon for some work, was crossing the road when the accident occurred. Around 11.30pm on Friday, constable Narender Singh Negi and his friend Deepak were headed towards Delhi in a Honda City, police said. They took the road under the Shankar Chowk flyover, instead of the main carriageway but stopped the car. Narender stepped out and was hit by a vehicle while he tried to cross the road. The impact was such that the constable was flung 10 feet into the air and landed on his neck at a distance. A passerby dialled 100 and called for an ambulance too. Narender was rushed to a private hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival. Satbir Singh, the SHO of Udyog Vihar police station, said a team of cops rushed to the accident spot soon after being alerted by the police control room. “We found a man in uniform lying on the road, oozing blood. We rushed him to the hospital, but it was too late. He had died soon after the accident,” the SHO added. Originally from Dehradun, Narender was posted in Rishikesh. However, a question remains unanswered — why did the cop attempt to cross the road at that hour of the night? Deepak, the police said, is too shocked to give a statement. “We have already informed the police headquarters in Uttarakhand about the accident. We had searched Narender’s pocket and found his identity card. His body has been kept at the district mortuary. Initial investigation has revealed that a heavy vehicle was involved in the accident. Anyway, we are trying to track down the vehicle that sped away after the accident,” the Udyog Vihar SHO said. A case was registered under sections 279 (rash and negligent driving) and 304A (death by negligence) of the IPC against unidentified persons. Between January and May this year, as many as 315 cases of road accidents were reported in Gurgaon. And some 153 people lost their lives in 150 road accidents during the period, of which 42 were pedestrians. On the other hand, around 200 people sustained injuries in these road accidents, of which 37 were pedestrians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/uttarakhand-cop-crossing-road-hit-by-vehicle-at-shankar-chowk-dies/articleshow/85140945.cms||Bagish Jha

Mere contradictions and discrepancies may not be material to deprive pension,” the judge said. The issue pertains to a plea moved by K Mariammal challenging an order passed by the special deputy collector, social security scheme, Coimbatore dated October 6, 2020, denying her Central Government Freedom Fighter Family Pension as a legal heir of her husband late C Kanniah. Kanniah was a member of Indian National Army (INA). The fact was certified by the Union home ministry through a certificate dated May 23,1961. As per the certificate, he was a political sufferer and as such, he is entitled to all the concessions allowed to other political sufferers. The Union government introduced a family pension scheme, but the benefit was denied to the petitioner since her husband had not mentioned about his dependents while applying for pension. Challenging the denial order, the petitioner has moved the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cannot-deny-pension-for-freedom-fighters-kin-madras-hc/articleshow/85143974.cms||---

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an ‘orange’ alert for Sunday, when moderate rain and thunderstorms are expected. According to IMD, intermittent rain is likely in the next two to three days. “The monsoon trough is likely to shift north, leading to more rainfall activities in northern states,” an official said. While rain started early on Saturday morning in some areas, a short but intense spell of rain was reported around 11.30am, which lasted for about half an hour. Many low-lying areas such as sectors 9, 9A and 37 and Basai Road were inundated following the showers, but traffic largely remained unaffected. “It rained for only around 20 minutes, but the streets and vacant plots were flooded with rainwater. Cleaning of sewer lines has only done on paper. It is very disappointing to witness waterlogging after slight rain,” said Manbeer Singh, a resident of Sector 9A. The city’s air quality index (AQI) deteriorated slightly to ‘moderate’ on Saturday. The overall AQI reading was 111, against 93 (‘satisfactory’) on Friday. While IMD’s observatory in the city could not record Saturday’s rainfall, data from the district administration showed Gurugram recorded 14mm rain till 5pm on Saturday. According to IMD, between August 1 and 7, the city received only 30.8mm of rainfall, a deficit of 42% compared to the normal of 53.5mm. Between June 1 and August 7, however, Gurugram received 427.2 mm of rainfall as against the season’s normal of 275mm, an excess of 55%. The rain and cloudy skies throughout the day led to a fall in the daytime temperature by two notches to 32.4 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature was recorded at 23.4 degrees. According to IMD, the maximum temperature during the next six days is likely to hover between 34 and 37 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature will settle between 25 and 26 degrees. Meanwhile, Delhi too received light to moderate rain on Saturday. The brief spells of rain led to waterlogging in several parts of the capital. Traffic jams were reported near Vikas Minar at ITO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/orange-alert-in-gurgaon-today-mercury-to-rise-next-week/articleshow/85141016.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Noida||Noida: ‘Friendly’ neighbours spin fraud with govt contract bait||NOIDA: Police have made two arrests and filed a case against six people, including a senior government official in the animal husbandry department, for allegedly perpetrating a fraud under the ruse of buying cars to transport government officials. Their sales pitch – also a ruse – to potential investors was that they had won a government contract. For this, the perpetrators started a bogus initiative called ‘Car Service Yatra’ and targeted a Greater Noida-based boutique owner. They managed to convince 26 of her contacts – family members and friends – to invest. Police suspect the total number of people cheated to be around 40. The main accused, identified by police as Deepak and is family members, live in the same society as boutique owner Reetu Chaudhary – Stellar MI City Homes in Omicron. Deepak and his family allegedly befriended Chaudhary and her family and invited them to invest in Deepak’s sham company after earning their trust. According to Chaudhary’s complaint, Deepak’s mother Pushpa initiated contact, first by introducing her to a trust dedicated to religious work and then inviting them on festivals and other occasions. Subsequently, Chaudhary got to know Deepak’s wife Ruhi and his cousin Vasu, and later, SK Malik, the government official based in Lucknow. In September 2020, according to the complaint, Deepak and the others invited the Chaudharys home and claimed to have won a UP government contract for 100 cars, which would soon increase to 400. Propping up Malik for his contacts with politicians and government officials, they sought investments for the company, saying the more the investment, the higher the return would be, according to the complaint. “For every car, they needed to invest Rs 3-4 lakh and would get a return of Rs 25,000 every month,” reads the complaint, based on which an FIR was lodged at Phase III police station. Chaudhary claimed she invested Rs 9 lakh via cheque in September and got her brother to invest Rs 3 lakh. “The accused deposited the amount in their own accounts, claiming the company account was yet to be operational. An agreement was made on a stamp paper and they gave returns of Rs 25,000 per month for some months. Later, they claimed the company had received an order of 50 vehicles for EOW (economic offences wing) Meerut and Lucknow and sought more investments,” says the complaint. Cumulatively, Chaudhary arranged for investments worth Rs 2.06 crore, of which Rs 23.5 lakh was returned in the initial months. However, they sold the idea of setting up a partner firm for e-bikes to Chaudhary, which led to the formation of Garv Bharat Innovation on January 6 this year, in which the Rs 23.5 lakh was re-invested. Chaudhary alleged a total of Rs 61.5 lakh was invested in this firm. When the returns began to dry up and she confronted Deepak, she alleged he and others threatened her, saying there was no company and she should forget her money. The FIR has been lodged against Deepak, Malik, Pushpa, Ruhi, Vasu and another woman, Komal, under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 467, 468 and 471 (forgery), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Deepak and a person identified as Vipin Tomar have been arrested. “Vipin’s name came up during investigation and he too is one of the beneficiaries who received the money collected through this fraud in his account,” senior sub inspector Feroz Akhtar said. A Tata Harrier and an iPhone have been seized from the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/friendly-neighbours-spin-fraud-with-govt-contract-bait/articleshow/85139093.cms||Shikha Salaria

GNIDA was supposed to start supplying Ganga water several months ago, but the project got delayed because of the pandemic. It was waiting for a clearance from the authorities to start work at Bisada village. GNIDA could not start digging the land there for laying the pipes because of an Indian Oil pipeline that was already there. A total of Rs 800 crore will be spent on bringing about 85 cusecs of water into the town. The water will be supplied from the Ganga canal in Muradnagar. GNIDA officials also claimed that only 1,500 of 19,000-odd farmers were left to be given developed plots for the land they had given up for various projects. In the next round, 387 farmers from Sakipur and Dadha villages would be given plots. These plots have already been developed and the land department is preparing a checklist that will be issued to execute registries.

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Soon, a new stretch to connect Vipul Lavanya with Sector 81 road||GURUGRAM: Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM) has floated a tender to construct a new road connecting Vipul Lavanya Society to the main road in Sector 81 — a long-pending demand of the residents of the society. “The length of the road would be 800 metres and the project is estimated to cost Rs 78 lakh. The contractor will be given three months to complete the construction work of the road,” said Vijay Dhaka, superintending engineer, MCM. The residents of Vipul Lavanya have been demanding the connecting road for the past three years. The residents have knocked on the doors of corporations, the administration and political leaders. With the formation of a new corporation in Manesar, the residents said that their hope to get a road was renewed. The residents, in their own capacity, have filled up the craters on the kutcha road a number of times in the past few years to make it slightly motorable. “After the MCM was formed last December, we thought that we would get a road before monsoons. But, the second wave hit and the work was delayed. The corporation has now invited the tender and it has given us a ray of hope that we will have a road soon. I had spoken to the engineers of the corporation and they said that even the base of the road does not exist. Even if you spend Rs 10 lakh on the road, it will wash away in the first showers of the monsoon. The situation is worse, especially during monsoons, because the road does not exist,” said Shibashish Rudra, a resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/soon-a-new-stretch-to-connect-vipul-lavanya-with-sector-81-road/articleshow/85141158.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Rod that pierced man’s skull removed after 4-hour surgery||GHAZIABAD: A 24-year-old man, whose skull was impaled by an iron rod that fell from the 20th floor of an under-construction building on July 31, has a “90% chance” of survival after doctors managed to remove the rod during a four-hour-long surgery at a private hospital. There is, however, damage to the right lobe of the construction worker’s brain where the rod went right through the cranium, and the left side of his body is paralysed. He was brought to Flores Hospital by co-workers at the construction site, hospital officials told TOI. The rod that did the damage was a long one, the kind used in scaffoldings. Before the injured worker was taken to hospital, the rest of the rod was cut at the accident spot. The worker, whose name is being withheld following a request from the hospital to maintain the patient’s confidentiality, is from Jharkhand. On July 31, he was working at the construction site in Pratap Vihar when the rod came off the shuttering when it was being dismantled. As other workers shouted at him to move away, the labourer looked up. By the time he could react, the rod – which workers who brought him to the hospital claimed was 20 feet – it had struck him and speared through the skull. Dr Abhinav Gupta, the neurosurgeon who conducted the surgery on July 31 with a team of seven doctors, said the patient had a 90% chance of survival but would need a few more operations. One of those will be to restore the skull bone. “The four-hour surgery was a challenge. I had to open half the skull to separate the iron rod from the bone. The toughest part was to remove the iron rod from the brain without doing any further damage to it. The skull bone has now been kept under the skin in the abdominal wall to keep it viable. We are monitoring the patient closely and the outcome looks positive,” Dr Gupta said. The doctor said it was the first time he had performed such a critical surgery in a career spanning 20 years. “He is breathing on his own now. He opens his eyes, but we are not sure how much he understands. He has a long way to go before he recovers from the injury fully. One more surgery will be done two months later to fix the portion of the skull that had to be removed. He would also require physiotherapy and rehabilitation in future,” Dr Gupta added. Dr MK Singh, director of Flores Hospital, said, “When the patient was brought to the hospital, his condition did not look promising at all. He had 12mm of the iron rod protruding out from the front and back of his head. A team of doctors conducted a few tests and decided to go for an immediate surgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/rod-that-pierced-mans-skull-removed-after-4-hr-surgery/articleshow/85139221.cms||Abhijay Jha

Studies important, but safety of kids vital, say Bhopal parents||BHOPAL: Online classes in schools seem to take on offline classes this academic year also. Though schools are open, poor presence of the students in the school continues. Several private CBSE schools that were not willing to open the campus have also opened their schools. However, missionary schools have allowed the students for practical classes only. Whether it is government school or private school, the presence of students continues to be poor in schools. Parents seem not willing to send their children for campus academics amid talks of third Covidwave. “Fear of the third wave is still there. How to send our children to school. Online classes are smooth and there is no need to send them for offline classes,” said a parent, Milan Yadav. Parents even praised online classes. “Both teachers and students are comfortable in online classes. In such a situation I do not find any reason to send children for offline classes,” said another parent Ganesh Verma. After keeping their campuses closed, several private CBSE schools have opened their campuses. However, the presence of students is very poor. “We have never wanted to trouble students. We have opened it. Presence of students is very poor as they are liking more online classes,” said vice-president, MP Association of Private Un-Aided Schools. He maintained that students won’t come for offline classes till online classes are available. There are 72 CBSE schools in Bhopal. Missionary schools have also opened their campuses but they are allowing only students for practical classes. “Parents are not willing to send their kids. In such a situation, there was no logic in opening such a huge campus for few students. As students can’t do practical classes at home, they are allowed to attend such classes,” said a missionary school official without quoting his name. There are 26 missionary schools in Bhopal. Meanwhile, government schools that were opened since July 26 are not able to attract many students. The presence of students is hardly touching 25%. There are 110 government schools in the state capital. Class 9 in schools are open on Saturday in the week, while class 10 are allowed to run on Wednesday.

However, police dispersed them. No one was injured in the incidents,” said a senior police official at Lailapur outpost. However, despite the effort by the police and administration in Cachar district, who managed to free the highway of the agitators, trucks failed to move towards Mizoram till late in the evening on Saturday, the official added. “Locals, who are extremely unhappy with the action of the Mizos on July 26 when six Assam policemen were killed and many others injured, agreed to allow trucks to move to Mizoram from Assam side during our meeting with them on Saturday,” Assam minister for GDD, urban development and irrigation Ashok Singhal told the media at Lailapur in the evening. Singhal, along with minister for environment and forest Parimal Suklabaidya, visited Lailapur along the Assam-Mizoram inter-state border on Saturday to persuade the locals to lift the economic blockade and to create an atmosphere paving the way for restoration of peace and tranquility. At the direction of CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, both the ministers visited the Lailapur Police outpost along the inter-state border and persuaded the locals to allow the free movement of vehicles laden with essentiala to Mizoram and to ease tension along the border.

---||Guwahati||Restored Sambalpur heritage house of Lakshminath Bezbaroa to be opened soon to visitors||GUWAHATI: The Sadhana Griha or work place of Lakshminath Bezbaroa, the doyen of Assamese literature, which was in ruins on the banks of the Mahanadi in Sambalpur in Odisha, has been renovated and restored would be thrown open to the people soon. The poet had two houses in Sambalpur, one for his writing and business, and the other for residing. Renovation and restoration of the residential house will begin in October. Bringing the Sadhana Griha back to its original status was a big challenge for INTACH, the heritage conservation trust, which was entrusted with the restoration job by the Odisha and Assam governments. Only remnants were left of the original structure. Conservationists had to go back in history, consult books to recreate the house. Mallika Mitra, director of INTACH Conservation Institute, Bhubaneswar, who is overseeing the restoration work, told TOI on Saturday that the first house will be handed over to the government in the next three weeks. "We have used lime plaster with traditional plaster materials for the walls. Only one old window was intact and we used it as a reference to reconstruct the other windows. Our attempt was to support the roof with iron but it will be cladded with compatible materials like synthetic thatch or terracotta tiles to match the original structure," she said. The Sadhana Griha has three rooms with a central hall. Mitra said the rooms have been designed as three galleries dedicated to his life, literary creations and family. “The other house will have more space for audio-visual display and a reading room along with other facilities," said Mitra, adding that they want to highlight his family connections with Rabindranath Tagore. Bezbaroa married Pragya Sundari Devi, Tagore's niece. The other house, where the family lived, is spacious and will showcase cultural exchanges between the two states, she added. After a long legal battle between the owner of the ‘heritage’ plot and the Odisha government, the latter got possession of the land in 2017. The prolonged legal battle, starting in the 1980s, had nothing to do with the sentiments of the people of Assam where Bezbaroa is held in high regard. His memory was resurrected and the heritage plot came under the spotlight when the government began the construction of the second bridge over the Mahanadi. The priceless properties, replete with the memories of a great poet-novelist, who had ushered in the Assamese renaissance, were lying unnoticed for decades. It was then that the former chief minister of Assam, Sarbananda Sonowal, and Naveen Patnaik, his Odisha counterpart, came together to preserve this treasure trove. Sambalpur resident Deepak Panda, an author and historian, took up the cudgels on behalf of both the states to preserve the houses. When he was a child in 1968, he learned about the poet at a convention organised by the Asam Sahitya Sabha in Sambalpur. “People were initially against my decision to seek preservation of the place and even led rallies,” he said. Originally, the land measured 2.78 acres when a Christian missionary, J G Pike, took it on lease from the government in 1902. Later, Bezbaroa acquired the land and constructed two houses in 1924. Bezbaroa died in 1938 and then in 1943, his friend and a well known businessman in Sambalpur, Omkarmall Poddar, acquired 1.63 acres of the land on lease. “The lease expired on March 31,1960 and a resumption case was first filed by the district administration on April 23, 1982, in order to take possession of the land. Different government offices by then had started functioning there," said Panda. Panda single handedly carried out a campaign from 2007 for the restoration. "I propagated through my writings and within two years Sambalpur came to know who Bezbaroa was. It was a hard time for me. I even faced criticism for trying to save something which was of no concern in Sambalpur," said Panda. Though the land was acquired by the Odisha government in 2017, Panda said many people continued to oppose his conservation campaigns even after 2018. But Naveen Patnaik's assurance to the Assam government to preserve Bezbaroa's memory gave Panda, as head of the Sahityarathi Lakshminath Bezbaruah Smruti Rakhya Sammittee, the strength he needed to carry on his crusade. Despite the unprecedented rain last year and Covid delaying their task, Panda said the Sadhana Griha, where Bezbaroa penned most of his literary works and carried out his business activities, is ready to be handed over to the Odisha tourism department this September. "There will be no pause as the renovation of the residential house will start in October," he said. Despite the financial crisis he faced, which was reflected in his letters to his wife, Bezbaroa wrote some of his finest pieces in Sambalpur. "There was constant pressure to contribute to Jonaki magazine and the journal Bahi, which ushered in a new era in modern Assamese literature," said eminent litterateur Basanta Goswami. "The renaissance in Assam was ushered in through Jonaki by Bezbaroa. The trend continued till 1942, even after he died in 1938," he added. Goswami added that it was Bezbaroa, who introduced the great Srimanta Sankardeva from Thapana (a sacred altar in Vaishnavite monasteries) to the people. "Sri Sankardev and Sri Madhabdev are among the most important literary works which he penned in Sambalpur, portraying Sankardev and his ardent disciple Madhabdev not only as saints but as great social reformers, who worked for the transformation of society through art and culture," Goswami said. Bezbaroa lived in Sambalpur for 20 years from 1917 to 1937, though his connection with the present western Odisha region was since he began his timber business in 1895. He was a business associate of the B Borooah Company. Until 1916, Bezbaroa lived in Howrah, and that period is known as the most productive period of his life, from the literary perspective.

The sternal area values that give an accuracy of over 80% was achieved for sex determination. The tests would be helpful in sex-determination of victims following a natural disasters or train and flight accidents or even fire. The outcome, a part of a research work by a postgraduate student in the department of forensic medicine, was carried out by Dr J S Sravan. In this research study, chest CT-scans of 250 adults were diagnosed in the ‘sternum’ bone (located in middle of the front chest wall). The main purpose of the study was to find out whether sex determination is possible by measuring dimensions of the sternum bone on a CT scan. Several dimensions of ‘sternal bone’ using the ‘3D’ rendering technique of CT scan, official said. “The results of this research work look very promising. The researchers were able to determine the sex of an individual with about 80% accuracy,” AIIMS Bhopal official said. This application of this study could prove very useful in sex-determination during, mass disasters such as train wreck, flight accidents, fires explosions, natural calamities among others. It may also be particularly useful in advanced decomposed or exhumed bodies where the usual methods of sex determination are not very effective. “We are looking to develop this further at our institute to help people with quicker autopsy related procedure and lesser ail times before clearance for last-rites. The sub-specialty of Forensic Radiology is emerging at AIIMS Bhopal and is the first in Central Region of the country,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/aiims-bhopal-makes-sex-determination-of-disaster-victims-possible/articleshow/85144205.cms||Jamal Ayub

Deshmukh is being probed by the ED in a case of alleged extortion from orchestra bars in the state. ED had issued summons to the 71-year-old NCP leader and his son Hrishikesh Deshmukh seeking their appearance. The attached assets include a residential flat of value Rs 1.54 crores at Mumbai's Worli and 25 land parcels of Rs 2.67 crores at a Dhutum Villages in Uran of Maharashtra Raigarh district. The ED has alleged that Rs 4.7 crore collected from orchestra bars by dismissed cop Sachin Waze, allegedly on Deshmukh's instructions, was transferred to the former minister's Nagpur-based educational trust by his son, who routed it via two hawala operators and showed it as a donation. Deshmukh is the president of the trust and his two sons, Salil and Hrishikesh, are its trustees. Earlier, the ED had raided Deshmukh's residences in Nagpur and Mumbai. Raids were conducted at five places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-conducts-searches-at-nagpur-hotel-over-alleged-corruption-against-deshmukh/articleshow/85144352.cms||---

Meanwhile, the two alleged kidnappers, Rishikesh Korke and his childhood friend Chiku Chavan, were sent in police custody remand for three days after being produced before the court on Saturday. Police had sought seven days custody. Korke and Chavan had picked up the car from a garage owned by nephew of one Imran Shaikh. Through Chavan, Korke had approached Imran requesting to spare his car for a day to take his girlfriend, arriving from Mumbai, on a joyride. Imran, who had purchased the car in May this year, refused as its tyre was punctured. Imran introduced Korke and Chavan to his nephew who allowed them to use a car of one of his customers. When Korke and Chavan got a hint that cops are chasing them, they abandoned the car at Imran’s rented apartment at Dighori and went to another friend from whom they took a scooter. Imambada police had seized both the car and the scooter. It’s learnt, the car owner is now blaming Imran for seizure of his four-wheeler and demanded the latter’s car as a replacement till his vehcile is released legally. Imran has kept car in his nephew’s garage as a ‘security’ till the customer’s four-wheeler is freed. Neither Imran nor the garage customer have approached cops with any complaint, it’s learnt. Police sources said that Korke and the girl wanted to teach her father a lesson for being “overprotective”. Korke had also made ransom calls to her father demanding Rs30 lakh, threatening to chop off her body parts otherwise. It was after police intervened the three tried to abort the plan but by then Imambada police and crime branch had taken Korke and Chavan into custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drama-over-releasing-car-seized-in-fake-kidnapping-case/articleshow/85136880.cms||Soumitra Bose

He flew from Gwalior to Datia and then visited Shivpuri and Sheopur. From his helicopter, the senior Congress leader recorded a video of the marooned areas on his phone. Speaking to reporters in Datia, Nath said he has never seen such devastation before. “There have been heavy losses due to floods. This is not a political issue, but it is necessary that I give some suggestions to the state government. I have never seen such devastation before,” Nath said. “From the small alleys to the highways, bridges have been destroyed, washed away, crops on thousands of hectares are ruined. Government should specify how they will analyze and survey these damages? Many houses have been washed away, many have been damaged, people have taken shelter in relief camps in large numbers. State government should explain how it will resettle these persons again,” said Nath “I want to ask the government to tell us the details of relief work preparations and in how much time will the assistance reach the people,” said the PCC chief. “There are villages that are completely deserted. I could not see any person in many villages. By when will compensation be paid to the families of those who lost their lives in the floods?” he asked. Kamal Nath demanded that the government waive electricity bills of the affected areas for one year. “No benefit can come from showmanship, drama and politics of pretentiousness. I request the chief minister to tell us the time limit to carry out the relief work, to give us the statistics – how many bridges, roads have been washed away. How has electricity supply been affected? How many transformers have been damaged? He should reveal the details to the people and specify the government’s preparations regarding these,” Nath said. The former chief minister said that the meteorological department gives the forecast and predicts the regions that are in the orange zone and those in the red zone. “Despite having this knowledge, how much did the government prepare for floods?” he asked. “They are celebrating the Anna Utsav today during this extreme flood disaster. Is this the time to celebrate? We stand with the state government during this calamity and will support. But the government must provide relief and assistance to the affected,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-floods-never-seen-such-devastation-government-should-act-fast-says-former-cm-kamal-nath/articleshow/85144326.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Stray cattle take to highways as Madhya Pradesh government looks the other way||BHOPAL: Stray cattle herds on highways during the monsoon pose a huge risk to traffic. Large number of cowsheds seem to be inoperative leading to the menace and the presence of cows on the roads. The number of stray cattle has almost doubled in the state from 2012 to 2019. Long distance travellers on highways find it very risky, especially during the night in the monsoon, as the fear of running into a herd. Government sources said that many of these stray cows squatting on the roads belong to the people who live in the nearby villages . In the common parlance, stray cattle include cows, bulls or calves that are abandoned because they are unproductive. They also include low-yield cows, mostly owned by city and village dwellers, that are set free to roam about in the open, especially in the monsoon. “We have been trying to convince the villagers not to do this but in vain,” the minister for animal husbandry Prem Singh Patel told TOI. But statistics show that Madhya Pradesh is the state with one of the largest numbers of stray cattle. There are about 5 million stray cattle in India, according to 20th Live Stock Survey released by the Union ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying in January 2020. Madhya Pradesh has 8,53,971 stray cattle. From the 2012 census to 2019, the number of stray cattle saw a jump of 95% in MP. Only Rajasthan with 1.27 million and Uttar Pradesh 1.18 million are aheax. But in these states also, the increase in the number of stray cattle from 2012 to 2020 was much less- 34.48 % (Rajasthan) and 17.34 % ( UP). Struggling with a fund crisis, the state government is working on a plan to construct 3,300 cowsheds or gaushalas. Vinod Kumar Tiwari, who was associated with Shriram Ram Gaushala in Damoh district said, “As soon as the cow stops giving milk or the yield is low, people abandon them. The government should come out with some scheme to protect cows, but it has not been able to do so.” Four years ago, per cow fodder fund for gaushalas was Rs 2, which was increased by Kamal Nath government to Rs 20 per cow. The animal husbandry minister said, “There is no dearth of funds. We are giving Rs 20 per cow for fodder.” He said that almost 1,000 cowsheds have been constructed so far. More are under construction. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in November last year announced a ‘cow cabinet’, yoking together six departments — animal husbandry, agriculture, panchayat, forests, home and revenue and its first meeting was held on November 22 at a cow sanctuary set up in Agar Malwa . The ‘gau cabinet’ will work towards conservation and welfare of cows, Chuouan had said. But the stray cow problem has exposed the government claims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/stray-cattle-take-to-highways-as-madhya-pradesh-government-looks-the-other-way/articleshow/85144514.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

School managements said that lakhs of rupees are needed to get the buses back to running condition which will be an uphill task due to dip in revenue for most schools. Moreover, the livelihood of hundreds of people, including drivers and cleaners, has been affected. Even though the drivers ensure that buses are taken for a ride within the school compound once in a while, they said that the engines of many buses developed faults and the long idle state has resulted in other mechanical and electrical problems. The batteries of many buses have suffered damage and body parts have become rusty. There are around 1,031 schools that follow state syllabus in the district and most schools have at least one bus. There are around 150 CBSE school in the district and most of them have around five to 10 buses each. Kerala CBSE school management association president T P M Ibrahim Khan said that most schools have submitted Form G stating that they are not operating buses. This will allow operators to not pay the tax. But due to this the buses have to stay off the roads which makes the situation worse. “Exemption from tax is a relief but the additional cost schools have to bear to make the buses ready for transport will be challenging. Moreover, the taxes and insurances have to be renewed once schools reopen. There is zero revenue from school bus fees over the last 1.5 years. Due to poor fee collection, many CBSE schools are already struggling to survive. The drivers are struggling to survive and many schools cannot pay the salary,” Khan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/repairing-buses-an-uphill-task-for-schools-in-ernakulam/articleshow/85144621.cms||---

Destinations under the district tourism promotion council (DTPC) have already opened, and the tourism centres under the forest department will open from Monday. According to officials, the tourism centres will be following strict Covid-19 guidelines. According to tourism stakeholders, they hope that the Onam season will be helpful to bring back the glory of the tourism sector in the district. Idukki DTPC secretary Girish P S told TOI that12 tourism centres under DTPC in the district have already opened to tourists. “Nearly 40% tourists have arrived after opening the centres. The Kolukkumalai jeep safari in Munnar has also opened for tourists,” he said. “Those visiting the tourism centres should have taken at least one vaccine dose or have an RT-PCR negative certificate tested within 72 hours before the visit, or those infected and recovered from Covid-19 within one month before visit must carry a positive certificate. Without these papers, we will not allow entry to the centres,” said Girish. Eravikulam national park assistant wildlife warden Job J Neriamparambil said the park will open for tourists from Monday. “The total trekking path of the park is 1.5km, and we will allow 340 tourists per hour. Per day we will allow 2,880 tourists into the park. The entry charge is fixed at Rs 200 per person," said the official. “The pandemic severely affected the operation of the park. We are finding it difficult to pay the monthly salary of the watchers in the park,” said Neriamparambil. Tall Trees Resort (Munnar) general manager Aju Abraham Mathew said the vaccine drive for tourism sector-related people in Munnar is almost complete and will help manage the tourists. “The tourism sector is already in a huge crisis, and we hope that opening the sector and the Onam season will help bring back normalcy,” he said. Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Thekkady will open for tourists from Monday onwards, said PTR east deputy director A P Sunil Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-tourist-destinations-open-in-idukki/articleshow/85144678.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||World||Five reported missing in huge California wildfire||LOS ANGELES: US authorities said Saturday they were searching for five people missing as a huge wildfire raged in northern California, leaving two towns in little more than cinders. The Dixie Fire, the largest active wildfire in the United States, recently became the third-largest in California history. As of late Saturday it had destroyed 447,723 acres (180,782 hectares) in four counties, up from the previous day's 434,813 and surpassing the vast Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon. Dixie is now 21 percent contained, the CalFire website reported, adding that three firefighters had so far been injured fighting the blaze. While the fire continued to grow, officials said Saturday that cooler, calmer weather was giving firefighters a much-needed break. Those conditions are expected to continue into Sunday. "We expect the same fire behavior as yesterday, which was fairly moderate," Jake Cagle, a firefighter sections chief, said in a briefing Saturday. Earlier, the Dixie Fire left the Gold Rush town of Greenville charred and in ruins, while also burning through the small town of Canyondam. The Plumas County sheriff's office said it had received descriptions of five people considered missing in Greenville and was searching for them. Five other missing people were confirmed found on Saturday. As authorities urge thousands of locals to evacuate, they have been met at times by armed residents refusing to budge, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. Law enforcement officers are asking any residents who stay for the names of next-of-kin -- to be notified if the fire claims their lives. The Dixie Fire's movement northeastward has been slowed in part because it has reached the "scar" of an earlier blaze, the 2007 Moonlight Fire, reducing available fuel, CalFire said. More than 5,000 personnel are now battling the Dixie blaze, which is sending enormous clouds of smoke into the air that are easily visible from space. A preliminary investigation has suggested the fire was started when a tree fell on a power cable owned by regional utility Pacific Gas & Company (PG&E), a private operator that was earlier blamed for the huge Camp Fire in 2018, which killed 86 people. By late July, the number of acres burned in California was up more than 250 percent from 2020 -- itself the worst year of wildfires in the state's modern history. A long-term drought that scientists say is driven by climate change has left much of the western United States parched -- and vulnerable to explosive and highly destructive fires.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/five-reported-missing-in-huge-california-wildfire/articleshow/85144694.cms||---

The clerical staff, whose name officials refused to divulge, said couldn’t be questioned properly as he didn’t turn up with requisite documents. His parent department is WRD and has been posted as personal assistant for a long time, sources informed. He has been asked to appear before the investigation agency once again for another round of questioning. Insiders say, the then PS - a senior IAS officer -- would be the next to be questioned. Earlier, the then engineer-in-chief (EnC) of water works department (WRD) – Rajeev Kumar Suklikar – had in his statement reportedly denied any wrongdoing on his part while emphasising that everything was done as per an enduring ‘system’. In his statement to the EOW he maintained that advance payments were made as per the protocol that was being followed in every project executed by this department over the last many years and, the same can be verified by summoning his predecessors and recording their statements as well, sources say. This case was handed over to the EOW by the state government to ascertain whether advance payments were made to contractors by changing the payment schedule without government’s approval. Probe ambit was restricted to the role of then engineer-in-chief, chief engineer (procurement) and a former chief secretary but if Suklikar’s statement is anything to go by, the EOW will have to look back into similar payments in all the WRD projects so far. A departmental inquiry by the water resources department (WRD) – after BJP returned to power – found that these officers had changed the conditions of the tenders without the government’s permission and on ‘verbal’ directives of the then additional chief secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-pa-of-official-quizzed-by-eow-in-advance-payment-scam/articleshow/85144689.cms||P Naveen

In the evening, the Devinder Bambiha gang claimed responsibility for the broad daylight murder in a Facebook post, accusing the 32-year-old of being an informer for a rival, Lawrence Bishnoi gang. At 11 am, Middukhera was about to sit in his Fortuner after meeting a property dealer in the market when two men holding pistols opened fire. The ex-president of Students Organisation of India (SOI), a student wing of the SAD active in Panjab University (PU), threw an object at one of the shooters and ran for cover. The two shooters chased him and shot him. The murder was caught on a CCTV camera. Middukhera had got married two years ago. Police said four armed men had reached the parking lot in a white Hyundai i-20 car. Two of them remained in the vehicle, while the others went after Middukhera as soon as he reached near the door of his SUV. Middukhera was hit by around nine bullets. He died on the spot. We are checking CCTV footage from the market too. Cops are investigating the murder from all possible angles,” SSP Satinder Singh said. Police have not ruled out gang rivalry. They suspect Gaurav Patial, alias Lucky, a member of the Bambiha gang, to be behind the killing. Patial is believed to be in Armenia. Patial believed Middukhera was close to the Bishnoi gang, sources said. The Facebook post by the Bambiha gang bolstered the theory. In the post, the gang posted a picture of Middukhera with Bishnoi, writing that he was close to their rivals and Patial had warned him. The post alleged the Bishnoi gang had killed two Bambiha aides, Gurlal Bhalwan and Rana Sidhu, on information provided by Middukhera. The gang also claimed he used to provide phone numbers and details of Punjabi singers and other businessmen to Bishnoi for extortion. In a statement, SAD said the killing was the direct result of the “free rein given to gangsters by the Congress government”. The party demanded an independent probe. Former SAD minister Bikram Singh Majithia said the broad daylight killing proved that no one is safe in Punjab. Majithia demanded an internal inquiry to ascertain whether there had been laxity in administering law and order in Mohali. Youth Akali Dal president Parambans Singh Romana condoled the demise of Middukhera. He said Middukhera was a popular student leader during his time in PU and had played a pivotal role in strengthening SOI.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Son fulfils promise made to fallen Covid warrior, scores 296 out of 300 in JEE-Main||BENGALURU: Before Dr Balaji Prasad, a nephrologist, lost his battle with Covid-19 on December 5 last year, he made his two sons promise that no matter what the situation, they would work hard and not miss any examination. His sons Hrishit BP and Niryan BP were in grade 12 and 10 respectively at that time. Hrishit, who had taken the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Main did his father proud with a score of 296 out of 300 marks. He has bagged a perfect 100 in mathematics and chemistry and 96 in physics. His success has given his family a new beacon of hope in all the despair since last year. The 54-year-old doctor, who treated kidney patients at five hospitals in the city, was a frontline Covid-19 warrior and had contracted the disease in the line of duty. He had tested positive for the virus on September 19. Nearly three months after that, Dr Prasad died at a Chennai hospital on December 5. He is survived by his 80-yearold mother, wife Hemali B Prasad and two sons. “I had promised my father that no matter what happens, I will not miss any exam. He is my role model and the main reason behind my results,” Hrishit told TOI. He said immediately after his father’s death, he struggled to focus on his studies but his mentors Mahesh Yadav, Udit Arora, Atul Kumar Jha and Aman Kumar at Allen Career Institute helped him get back his grit. “My mother and brother also kept me motivated. Whenever I felt low, they would counsel me and keep me focused,” he added. Hrishit attributed his high score to the strong foundation laid at his alma mater Bishop Cotton Boys’ School and Nehru Smaraka Vidyalaya. His advice to students suffering due to the pandemic is to work consistently with the same energy, focus, and rectify previous mistakes. “More than academic help, my children got strong moral support from their teachers,” Hemali said, adding Hrishit’s results have brought much-needed positivity into their home. “My son took it up as a challenge. He wanted to make sure his father would be proud of him, wherever he is.” Even when her husband was hospitalised, he continued to motivate his children by checking their academic progress, she said. “Both my children used to video call him everyday. They also recorded videos for their father to keep his spirits high,” she recalled. Niryan is now working towards his dream of becoming a doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-son-fulfils-promise-made-to-fallen-covid-warrior-scores-296-out-of-300-in-jee-main/articleshow/85144708.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||World||Californians hit hard hard with weekend of wildfire fears||GREENVILLE: After four years of homelessness, Kesia Studebaker thought she finally landed on her feet when she found a job cooking in a diner and moved into a house in the small community of Greenville. She had been renting for three months and was hoping stability would help her win back custody of her 14-year-old daughter. But in just one night, a raging wildfire tore through the mountain town and "took it all away," she said. Fueled by strong winds and bone-dry vegetation, the Dixie Fire grew to become the largest single wildfire in state history. People living in the scenic forestlands of Northern California are facing a weekend of fear as it threatens to reduce thousands of homes to ashes. "We knew we didn't get enough rainfall and fires could happen, but we didn't expect a monster like this," Studebaker said on Saturday. The fire incinerated much of Greenville on Wednesday and Thursday, destroying 370 homes and structures and threatening nearly 14,000 buildings in the northern Sierra Nevada. It had engulfed an area larger than the size of New York City. The Dixie Fire, named for the road where it started, spanned an area of 700 square miles (1,813 square kilometers) on Saturday night and was just 21% contained, according to the California department of forestry and fire protection. Four firefighters were taken to the hospital on Friday after being struck by a fallen branch. More than 20 people were initially reported missing, but by Saturday afternoon authorities had contacted all but four of them. The fire's cause was under investigation. The Pacific Gas and Electric utility has said it may have been sparked when a tree fell on one of its power lines. A federal judge ordered PG&E on Friday to give details about the equipment and vegetation where the fire started by August 16. Cooler overnight temperatures and higher humidity slowed the spread of the fire and temperatures topped 90 degrees fahrenheit (32 degrees celsius) instead of the triple-digit highs recorded earlier in the week. But the blaze and its neighboring fires, within several hundred miles of each other, posed an ongoing threat. Studebaker sought shelter at an evacuation center before setting up her tent in a friend's front yard. She is counting on returning to her job if the restaurant where she works stays open. Her boss also evacuated when the town of Chester, northwest of Greenville, lost power and the smoke was so thick that it made it hard to breathe. Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists have said climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. Near the Klamath National Forest, firefighters kept a close watch on small communities that were ordered evacuated in the path of the Antelope Fire, which earlier threw up flames 100 feet (30 meters) high as it blackened bone-dry grass, brush and timber. It was just 20% contained. Further northwest, about 500 homes scattered in and around Shasta-Trinity National Forest remained threatened by the Monument Fire and others by the McFarland Fire, both started by lightning storms last week, fire officials said. About a two-hour drive south from the Dixie Fire, crews had surrounded nearly half of the River Fire that broke out on Wednesday near the town of Colfax and destroyed 68 homes and other buildings. Evacuation orders for thousands of people in Nevada and Placer counties were lifted on Friday. Three people, including a firefighter, were injured, authorities said. Smoke from the fires blanketed Northern California and western Nevada, causing air quality to deteriorate to very unhealthy and, at times, hazardous levels. Air quality advisories extended through the California's San Joaquin Valley and as far as the San Francisco Bay Area to Denver, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas, where residents were urged to keep their windows and doors shut. Denver's air quality ranked among the worst in the world on Saturday afternoon. California's fire season is on track to surpass last year's season, which was the worst fire season in recent recorded state history. Since the start of the year, more than 6,000 blazes have destroyed more than 1,260 square miles (3,260 square kilometers) of land - more than triple the losses for the same period in 2020, according to state fire figures. California's raging wildfires were among 107 large fires burning across 14 states, mostly in the West, where historic drought conditions have left lands parched and ripe for ignition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/californians-hit-hard-hard-with-weekend-of-wildfire-fears/articleshow/85144749.cms||---

During the pandemic-induced nationwide lockdown last year, Kirana Devadiga, 36, started cultivating Udupi Jasmine on her terrace, which is now a successful business. Kirana told STOI,“I have always been interested in gardening and agriculture. As a legal advisor for a private firm for the last 10 years, until the lockdown, I never thought that I could pursue my passion. It began in March, when I started doing an online search, and learning about terrace gardens. Things changed after I visited Sahyadri Nursery near Pumpwell, and bought nearly 100 jasmine plants. As we were returning from the nursery, Mahesh, my husband and a lecturer at a private PU college, asked me what I would be doing with so many plants. Just then, I spotted street vendors selling concrete pots. They were from North India, and wanted to sell whatever they had, before leaving the city. I bought more than 100 pots for about Rs 65 each,” she said. The family stays on the ground floor in Derebail Konchady, and have rented out the first floor, and all these pots had to be shifted to the terrace.  Mahesh and her seven-year-old son Takshil Devadiga helped her. She went back to the nursery and bought organic manure and mud. Within three months, Udupi and Mangaluru variety jasmines began to bloom, but she did not pluck them for the first six months, hoping for a better yield. “Initially, I had planted jasmine saplings only in one portion of the terrace, and the rest was dedicated to vegetables. After six months, my whole terrace was converted into a jasmine garden. As the yield increased, I learnt the art of tying jasmine buds together with a string made of plantain stalk. So far, I have earned about Rs 83,000. I have not sold less than an ‘atte’ comprising four chendus, till date. One chendu has 800 jasmines woven intricately to form a string. Time management is definitely a challenge. I have learnt to balance family, work and my passion for gardening,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mangaluru-based-advocate-earns-rs-83000-through-her-jasmine-garden-on-terrace/articleshow/85144765.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Millions of people in Brisbane and surrounding areas have spent just eight days under stay-at-home orders after an outbreak of more than 100 cases spread among several school communities. Deputy Queensland premier Steven Miles said the region had achieved "something quite incredible" by seemingly bringing the outbreak under control. "It looks like we may have been able to contain a Delta outbreak in just eight days of lockdown, just 10 days from when the first case was notified," he told reporters. Restrictions on leaving the city and gatherings will remain in place for at least two weeks. Authorities also announced a snap three-day lockdown for the northern city of Cairns, after a taxi driver spent 10 days infectious in the 150,000-strong community. They will join millions of people in Melbourne and Sydney under stay-at-home orders, with Australia's biggest city about to enter a seventh week of lockdown. New South Wales state recorded 262 new cases Sunday, taking the outbreak that began in Sydney in mid-June to more than 5,000 cases. State premier Gladys Berejiklian urged Sydney residents to get jabbed, with supermarket and fast-food workers taking priority in a fresh vaccination drive Sunday. "This is a race. We're keen to sprint to get those vaccination rates up," she said. Limited supply and pockets of vaccine hesitancy have slowed efforts to inoculate Australians, with just over 20 percent of the population now fully vaccinated. Health officials are now expecting supplies will be boosted in September, with the Moderna vaccine arriving for the first time and Pfizer imports set to increase. Australia managed to avoid the worst of the pandemic for the past 18 months, but lockdowns have struggled to contain repeated outbreaks of the highly-infection Delta variant. The nation has recorded about 36,000 cases of Covid-19 and 935 related deaths to date in a population of 25 million.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/brisbane-to-lift-virus-lockdown-while-sydney-outbreak-grows/articleshow/85144798.cms||---

Minister of state for sports and youth affairs Sandeep Singh was also present. While Neeraj won the historic gold medal in men’s javelin throw, Bajrang Punia from Jhajjar district bagged bronze after registering again a historic win of 8-0 in freestyle wrestling. “Apart from the cash reward of Rs.6 crore, the state government has decided to offer the position of head at Centre of Excellence for Athletics to be constructed in Panchkula to Neeraj," announced Khattar, adding that Bajrang will also be given a government job according to the provision made in state's sports policy. He further announced that both Neeraj and Bajrang will also be provided a plot of HSVP at concessional rates. "To encourage the young and budding players hailing from Bajrang’s Khudan village in Jhajjar district, a wrestling indoor stadium with world-class facilities will be constructed by the state government," said CM Khattar. Earlier, Haryana home and health minister Anil Vij had tweeted, “Congratulations to Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra for creating history by winning (sic) the first #Gold medal for India at #Tokyo2020; throw 87.58 meters in the first attempt. Haryana Govt. will give Rs. 6 crore, Service and a plot as an incentive.” Later Vij told journalists that Neeraj has written history by winning a gold medal. .@Neeraj_chopra1 के #Tokyo2020 में गोल्ड मेडल जीतने पर मुख्यमंत्री श्री @mlkhattar ने दी देश को बधाई, प्रदेश की खेल… https://t.co/SzqlkHA97R— DPR Haryana (@DiprHaryana) 1628342900000Meanwhile, Congress Rajya Sabha member Deepender Singh Hooda, who is also president of the Haryana Wrestling Federation, on Saturday, demanded that the Haryana government should give posts of additional superintendent of police (ASP) to Neeraj and deputy SPs to wrestlers Ravi Kumar Dahiya, who won a silver medal and Bajrang Punia, who won a bronze medal at Tokyo Olympics. Deepender said, "All three medal winners of Haryana are sons of farmers and their families have struggled hard to raise their children to this level so that they can brighten the name of the country. When Manipur government can appoint Mirabai Chanu as DSP, why cannot Haryana government appoint its medal winners as ASP and DSPs? All the players of Haryana who participated in the Olympics should be honoured with prize money of at least Rs 50 lakh."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/rs-6-crore-to-neeraj-chopra-bajrang-punia-rs-2-5-crore-jobs-plots-for-both-announces-haryana-cm-manohar-lal-khattar/articleshow/85144789.cms||---

The decision was announced as the UK has moved India from its Red to Amber list, a categorization created for facilitating international travel during Covid time. The Heathrow-Kochi-Heathrow service was a success when it started on August 21 last year but later had to stop after four months due to a rise in Covid-19 cases. AI will deploy a Dreamliner aircraft to operate this sector. Flight AI 150/149 will arrive in Kochi at 3.45am and depart for London at 5.50am on all Wednesdays. Cial is the only airport in the state offering direct connectivity to London. Cial also decided to waive parking and landing fees as part of its effort to attract more European carriers. “The flight will take10 hours from Kochi to reach Heathrow. Entering the UK from places on the amber list requires three Covid-19 tests —the first, at least three days before departure, the second, on the day of arrival or before day 2 of arrival, and the third on or after day 8 of arrival. Home quarantine for 10 days is mandatory. For UK nationals who are fully vaccinated, neither quarantine nor the day 8 test is required,” said a Cial statement. Cial MD S Suhas said the airport operator worked hand in glove with AI for making this a reality. “European connectivity is a long time demand of the expats. We have waived parking and landing fees for the airline operating direct services to London. Cial believes this gesture will give an impetus for our effort to attract carriers from other parts of the world. The chairman and board of directors have prioritized it. We hope that within a year, we will be able to host more foreign airlines,” he said. Earlier on Thursday, Cial resumed flights to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Till Friday, 450 passengers flew to the UAE from Cial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochi-london-direct-flights-to-resume-from-cochin-international-airport/articleshow/85144735.cms||---
---||World||Saudi Arabia to reopen borders for vaccinated umrah pilgrims||RIYADH: Saudi Arabia will begin accepting vaccinated foreign pilgrims seeking to visit the Islamic holy city of Mecca, state media reported Sunday, around 18 months after a border closure prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities in the ministry responsible for coordinating foreign pilgrims will from Monday begin "gradually receiving Umrah requests from various countries of the world," the Saudi Press Agency reported. The umrah is a pilgrimage that can be undertaken at any time -- distinct from the hajj, which takes place once annually -- and usually draws millions from around the globe each year. The Covid-19 pandemic hugely disrupted both pilgrimages, which are usually key revenue earners for the kingdom -- in normal times, they together rake in around $12 billion (10.3 billion euros) annually. Before Sunday's announcement, only immunised pilgrims resident in Saudi Arabia were eligible for umrah permits, though the hajj has taken place in a scaled down form since the pandemic began. Any foreign pilgrims must be immunised with a Saudi-recognised vaccine and agree to undergo quarantine, the SPA report said, citing Saudi deputy minister Abdulfattah bin Sulaiman Mashat. Riyadh has spent billions trying to build a tourism industry from scratch, as part of efforts to diversify its oil-reliant economy. The once-reclusive kingdom began issuing tourist visas for the first time in 2019 as part of an ambitious push to revamp its global image and draw visitors. Between September 2019 and March 2020, it issued 400,000 of them -- only for the pandemic to crush that momentum as borders were closed. The government has accelerated a nationwide vaccination drive as it moves to revive tourism and other pandemic-hit sectors, such as sport competitions and entertainment extravaganzas. Vaccination is mandatory for anyone seeking to enter government and private establishments, including education institutions and entertainment venues, as well as to use public transport. Saudi Arabia has registered nearly 532,000 coronavirus cases and more than 8,300 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-to-reopen-borders-for-vaccinated-umrah-pilgrims/articleshow/85144836.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||BS Yediyurappa gets cabinet-rank status, courtesy Basavaraj Bommai||BENGALURU: Former chief minister BS Yediyurappa has been given cabinet-rank status by his successor Basavaraj Bommai. An order was issued on Saturday, which said he will enjoy the status till Bommai remains at the helm. This is the first time in Karnataka that such a status has been accorded to an ex-CM without him holding a statutory post. Sources said the status was given mainly to ensure Yediyurappa retains his official bungalow Cauvery, the designated residence of the CM, although he is bound to get an official car to move around besides perks and other allowances. This will leave Bommai without an official residence as of now. Currently, he is functioning from his family home in RT Nagar, which is on a site that was allotted to his father and former CM, SR Bommai, in the early 1990s. According to a member in Yediyurappa’s office, the former CM wanted to retain Cauvery bungalow as it is closer to the seat of power. In 2018-19, former CM Siddaramaiah continued to reside in Cauvery when HD Kumaraswamy took over as chief minister in the JDSCongress government. Though he did not avail cabinet-rank status, he got the bungalow allotted to KJ George, who was a minister in the coalition government. Siddaramaiah moved out after BJP formed the government in 2019 and Yediyurappa occupied the bungalow because it proved lucky for Siddaramaiah since he was the only CM after Devaraj Urs to complete full term. According to officials, the administration gives official residences to only cabinet members. But the CM can recommend them for MLAs. Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda also enjoyed cabinet-rank status for some years after stepping down. “Governments according cabinetrank status to people occupying a position is common. A former chief minister getting the status because of being a former CM may be a first time. This tag being conferred is possibly a reflection of his contribution and also to assuage him on not having his way in the manner he would have liked the cabinet to be structured,’’ said Sandeep Shastri, a political analyst.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bs-yediyurappa-gets-cabinet-rank-status-courtesy-basavaraj-bommai/articleshow/85144812.cms||---

On Friday, cops registered a case against three accused on charges of fraud and started the investigation. Investigating officer ASI Hemant Singh said, Ashok Meena, a resident of Chandukheri, runs a dairy. Around eight months ago he was in need of money, so he searched the website of a private finance company and applied for loan. In January, he received a call from Aman Singh and Vimlesh, who introduced themselves as officials of the private finance company. Both also sent their IDs to him over WhatsApp and asked him to deposit processing fee for releasing a loan of Rs 2 lakh. They asked him to deposit Rs 2500 in the first transaction and then took Rs 41345 from him in parts. When nothing moved, Ashok realised that he was duped and asked the accused to return his money. They started threatening him and switched off their mobile phones. Subsequently Ashok approached the cyber crime branch and filed a complaint. Meanwhile in another online fraud case, Talaiya police acting on complaint of a victim registered a case on Friday, on charges of fraud against unidentified accused, who had posted a fake advertisement for selling a used mobile phone on a website online and took Rs 6000 from him. SHO Talaiya DP Singh said, victim Mohammed Tahir Khan, 51, a resident of Retghat, saw an advertisement in August 2020, to sell a used mobile phone, on a website. He called on the given number and finalised the deal for Rs 6000. The accused took money from him through an online payment wallet but did not send his phone. He filed a complaint with the cyber crime branch which was forwarded to Talaiya police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/dairy-owner-seeking-loan-duped-of-rs-41000-in-bhopal/articleshow/85144853.cms||---
---||World||#HelpTurkey: Hashtag sparks culture war over Turkish fires||ISTANBUL: It looked innocent enough. As Turkey burned, ravaged by its deadliest and most destructive wildfires in living memory, #HelpTurkey began trending on Twitter, supported by sympathetic celebrities and traumatised Turks. But in a deeply divided country where even minor events spark culture wars between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's supporters and opponents, the hashtag turned into a scandal, leading to a prosecutors' probe. The powerful Turkish leader, unexpectedly facing one of the most serious challenges of his 18-year rule, sounded scandalised by the idea that his country needed help, even as the government revealed it no longer had functioning firefighting planes. "In response to this, there's only one thing we can say: Strong Turkey," Erdogan said after Friday prayers, mentioning a hashtag being circulated by his voters. "A terror of lies is being spread from America, Europe and certain other places," he said about the #HelpTurkey campaign. Acting on Erdogan's anger, the prosecutors' office said it would investigate whether the posts were designed "to create anxiety, fear and panic in the public, and to humiliate the Turkish government". Around the same time, the media regulator threatened to fine TV channels that continued airing live footage of the fires or running stories "that provoke fear and worries in the public". Most stations complied, minimising their coverage of a disaster that has killed eight people, destroyed forests across vast swathes of the Mediterranean and Aegean coasts, and upturned the lives of a generation of farmers. The uproar stemmed in part from Erdogan's proud nationalism, and in part from a perception among his opponents that cronyism and corruption were taking root. Erdogan's fiercest critics charge that he sacked capable leaders from top positions in the purges that followed a failed coup attempt in 2016, replacing them with friends and allies who were not up to the job. An energetic, hands-on leader who rose to power on a popular anti-graft campaign, Erdogan's own actions suddenly seemed out of touch. Twitter exploded in outrage when he went on tour of the damaged region under heavy police escort, tossing bags of tea to locals out of a moving bus in the middle of the night while a megaphone announced his presence. "Help us!!!!!" Turkish comedian Enis Arikan tweeted hours after Erdogan's visit in a typical #HelpTurkey post. "We need planes urgently. We only have one world." In self-defence, the government is promoting a narrative that #HelpTurkey is being fanned by "sock puppets" -- fake accounts designed to manipulate public opinion. Marc Owen Jones, an assistant professor at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Qatar, told a media event organised by the presidency that his analysis showed up to five percent of the #HelpTurkey tweets being spread by such accounts. "I don't know the purpose of it. What I can say is that I guess the manipulation is happening of the hashtag... It looks fishy," the British academic said. "If it was started as a manipulation campaign it was very clever because #HelpTurkey is a really innocent message, you can understand why people tweeted. Why wouldn't an average person want to help?" Gareth Jenkins, a veteran Turkey analyst, said this criticism cuts both ways. Erdogan's government "oversees thousands of fake accounts, which they use to troll and try to intimidate into silence anyone who questions its narratives," Jenkins told AFP. "But I think a much greater problem is that a large number of Turks, including many of those around Erdogan, actually believe the regime's propaganda." The battle over #HelpTurkey comes with the screws tightening on social media, which had remained an area of spirited debate in a country dominated by pro-government media and newspapers. After initial resistance, Twitter, Facebook and others have complied with a new law requiring platforms to appoint local envoys who can handle court orders to take down contentious posts. Erdogan says his government will submit another bill to parliament in October to further regulate social media, although he has not explained how. Yaman Akdeniz, a digital rights expert who questions the strength of Jones's "sock puppet" analysis, said Turks' pleas for outside assistance were "real and not a hoax". "While the hashtag wars continue on the social media platforms, the fires continue in real life," Akdeniz told AFP. "In reality, we have a seriously malfunctioning government machinery which in turn will undoubtedly introduce a new crime and law on disinformation to further silence critical voices on social media platforms," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/helpturkey-hashtag-sparks-culture-war-over-turkish-fires/articleshow/85144882.cms||---
