While the wellness industry has flourished due to the demand for traditional and alternative practices, consumers are currently exploring new options, as the focus has shifted on health, nutrition, fitness and preventive healthcare. Power Gummies, for instance, has devised a novel way to make people take vitamins. Founded by Divij Bajaj in 2018, the startup wants to break down people's fear of medicines with chewable vitamin gummies. These cute-looking scientifically-backed gummies are vegan-based with negligible or zero added sugar. "In nutraceutical space, gummy is the highest selling alternative in the west,” said Divij Bajaj, founder and CEO at Power Gummies. “We are expecting the same boom in India and south Asia. Our aim is to ride the wave with first mover advantage, best in class'' technology and efficacy.” Nilay Mehrotra, founder at Janani.life realised that the awareness around sexual health in India is quite low, especially due to taboos and misconceptions. The startup launched in April this year and claims to be one of India’s fastest growing wellness brands that combines technology with medical expertise to provide affordable solutions to problems surrounding sexual wellness, reproductive health and fertility. Within the first two months of launch, the company said it grew more than 100% M-o-M in terms of number of visitors to the website and is on track to grow around 300% in number of orders for its semen testing just from Bangalore. Similarly, Redcliffe Hygiene was incubated in April 2017, and relaunched as a toilet seat sanitizer under brand Pee Safe, which was initially developed in 2013 by Vikas Bagaria, Srijana Bagaria, and Dheeraj Jain. PeeSafe is working in the business of manufacturing products related to feminine hygiene and sexual wellness and is helping consumers battle health issues brought on by unhygienic conditions. Over the last four years, the company has expanded into several personal hygiene categories including feminine hygiene (pads, tampons, cups), men's intimate hygiene, female grooming, sexual wellness, hand hygiene, face masks and mist. It has achieved an average growth rate of 200% in revenue in the first three years of operations, growing 80% in the last financial year despite the pandemic. The company expects a growth of over 100% in three years, taking its domestic revenue to $30 million by FY2022-23. Pranav Malhotra, founder at TruNativ, said, “Lifestyle nutrition is a largely under explored category in India. 73% of Urban Indian’s are protein deficient making India home to 1B lifestyle disease incidents. We believe this market has huge potential.” Malhotra started the nutraceutical division in 2019 with the import of proteins and bio-actives, generating a revenue of $5 million. Realising the nutrition deficiency in normal Indian households, he introduced Raw Whey and decided to enter the D2C market with TruNativ. The startup has plans to roll out new smart nutrition products and a complete breakfast of drinkable oat fibre with real fruits. It is also exploring multiple SKU launches in the coming months with plans of becoming the “family-friendly” FMCG nutrition brand. In the beverage segment, Raskik was founded by former Coca-Cola veterans, Vikas Chawla, Abhay Parnerkar and Satyajit Ram. With sugary carbonated drinks facing strong headwinds, they have bet on the fact that Indian consumers are looking for healthier alternatives. A millennial-centric brand, Raskik has built a portfolio of natural fusion beverages at mainstream prices, such as coconut water and real fruit juice fusion, with no preservatives and artificial ingredients. “Growing health and wellness awareness is driving a change across industries,” said Vikas Chawla, co-founder at Raskik. “The Covid-19 crisis has further put it in everyone’s minds and it’s not a niche play anymore. Affordable health and wellness driven products will change the game for many sectors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/innovative-startups-ride-the-wellness-wave-to-growth/articleshow/85191461.cms||John Sarkar

Nationwide, COVID-19 cases have averaged 100,000 for three days in a row, up 35% over the past week, according to a Reuters tally of public health data. The surge of the disease was strongest in Louisiana, Florida and Arkansas.  Hospitalizations rose 40% and deaths, a lagging indicator, registered an 18% uptick in the past week with the most fatalities by population in Arkansas.  The intensifying spread of the pandemic has led to cancellation of some large high-profile events. One notable exception is an annual motorcycle rally in South Dakota which has been proceeding as planned.  Florida set records for hospitalizations for eight days in a row, according to the analysis. In that state, most students are due back in the classroom this week as some school districts debate whether to require masks for pupils.  The head of the nation's second-largest teachers' union on Sunday announced a shift in course by backing mandated vaccinations for US teachers in an effort to protect students who are too young to be inoculated.  The number of children hospitalized with Covid-19 is rising across the country, a trend health experts attribute to the Delta variant being more likely to infect children than the original Alpha strain.  With the virus once again upending Americans' lives after a brief summer lull, the push to vaccinate those still reluctant has gained fresh momentum.  States including California, New York and Virginia have mandated vaccinations or weekly testing for state employees, as well as several cities.  The administration of President Joe Biden set new rules late last month requiring federal workers to provide proof of vaccination or face regular testing, mask mandates and travel restrictions.  In the private sector, a growing number of companies are also mandating COVID-19 vaccinations. United Airlines, meatpacker Tyson Foods Inc and Microsoft are requiring employees get vaccinated. Sturgis crowds The evolving pandemic and the rapid community spread spurred by the Delta variant have already prompted the cancellation of some large-scale events. Last week, organizers canceled the New York Auto Show that had been set for later this month.  The New Orleans Jazz Fest was canceled for the second straight year as Louisiana fights a severe outbreak.  But fears about the Delta variant seem to not have dampened the mood in Sturgis, a small town in South Dakota that welcomes hundreds of thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts for the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.  This year's gathering, taking place Aug. 6-15, might already be attracting record crowds.  "It is one of the biggest crowds I have seen," Meade County Sheriff Ron Merwin said in an email. "I think there will definitely be some spread."  The city of Sturgis has partnered with health officials to provide Covid-19 self-test kits to rally-goes but the event does not require proof of vaccination or mask-wearing.  Last year, the rally became the super-spreader event that many feared it would become.  While cases and hospitalizations were relatively low in South Dakota when the event started on Aug. 7, 2020, three months later the state set a record for hospitalized Covid-19 patients and new infections.  In the month of November alone, the state lost 521 people to Covid-19, nearly three times the number of deaths reported in October, according to a Reuters tally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/delta-variant-pushes-us-cases-hospitalizations-to-6-month-high/articleshow/85191702.cms||---
---||World||Lawsuit filed over Alabama interstate crash that killed 10||MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA: The driver of a girls home van in which eight children died in a fiery interstate crash in Alabama has filed suit against trucking companies based in California and Georgia and a driver, her lawyers said Monday. The federal lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount of money, recounts a desperate attempt by the woman, Tallapoosa County Girls Ranch director Candice Gulley, to free victims from the wreckage. Two of her own children and two nephews were among those killed. Pulled from the crumpled van by others, Gulley ran around trying to help children escape the burning vehicle, the suit said, but no one could be saved because of the flames and damage. "All the children were killed by the fire,'' said the suit, filed Friday. Eight children ranging in age from 3 to 17 died in the van, and the suit said Gulley suffered burns, bruises and severe emotional and mental distress. A Tennessee man and his daughter died in a separate vehicle in the crash, which happened on Interstate 65 as remnants of a tropical storm crossed the region on June 19. The lawsuit names the California-based Hansen & Adkins Auto Transport and Asmat Express of Clarkston, Ga, which both were identified by the National Transportation Safety Board as being involved in the crash. It also named an Asmat driver identified as Mamuye Ayane Takelu. While Hansen & Adkins has declined comment on details of the crash, Asmat has not responded to messages seeking comment. Neither company nor the driver filed immediate responses in court. Besides Gulley and her husband Tommy Gulley, who lost two children, plaintiffs include the parents or personal representatives of four other children killed in the van. Gulley was driving the van in the left lane on northbound Interstate 65 when the Hansen & Adkins truck failed to stop in traffic, struck a sport-utility vehicle and swerved into her lane, the suit said. The van was then struck from behind by the Asmat Express truck, it said. The suit claims the trucks weren't outfitted with anti-crash safety technology and that drivers were going too fast, distracted or following too closely. An attorney for Gulley, Greg Allen, said the wreck "should never have happened.'' "We cannot erase or change the disastrous outcome, but we can work to provide answers that will allow a court to hold the defendants accountable for the lives they have devastated,'' he said in a statement released by Beasley Allen Law Firm in Montgomery. A preliminary report by the NTSB described the crash similarly to the lawsuit but did not place blame or say what caused the wreck, which happened about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Montgomery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/lawsuit-filed-over-alabama-interstate-crash-that-killed-10/articleshow/85191078.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Voices of discontent grow louder in BJP after portfolio allocation||BENGALURU: The discontent over not being able to secure a berth or a plum portfolio in the state cabinet continues to simmer in the ruling BJP. B Sriramulu, who's reportedly unhappy over being given transport and ST welfare portfolios, said on Monday that he was hoping to be the deputy CM and continue to helm the social welfare department, which he had held in the previous BS Yediyurappa cabinet. “But that has not happened. I'm confident that the leadership will do justice in the coming days," he said. Former minister and senior MLA SA Ramdas, who was also among the hopefuls for a berth, did not make himself available to welcome chief minister Basavaraj Bommai when he visited Mysuru for the first time. He also skipped the meeting chaired by Bommai to take stock of the Covid situation in the district. Ramdas also expressed disappointment over his non-inclusion in a sarcastic tweet. “Congratulations to the new ministers who have built and developed the party and qualified for the position. I hope and believe you strive to make Karnataka No. One state in the state. Let Chamundeshwari bless you all,” Ramdas said, taking a dig at the new party entrants. When asked why he stayed away from the CM's programmes, Ramdas said he would write to Bommai explaining the reason. He claimed his name was in the list of ‘to-be ministers’, but was dropped at the last minute following a call from a senior functionary. Bommanahalli MLA M Satish Reddy also flayed the party for giving posts to “outsiders’’ while ignoring loyal party workers. Supporters take out rally:Supporters of Madikeri MLA Appachhu Ranjan took out a rally, demanding his inclusion in the cabinet. The four-time MLA has been making efforts to become minister ever since the BJP came to power in 2019. Meanwhile, supporters of Raibag MLA Duryodhan Aihole held a press conference and demanded a cabinet berth for their leader. Duryodhan is a three-time MLA from Raibag in Belagavi. Balachandra Jarkiholi plans meeting:Several disgruntled legislators are likely to hold a meeting led by Balachandra Jarkiholi in Bengaluru on Tuesday, sources said. Balachandra was expecting a ministerial berth in lieu of his brother Ramesh Jarkiholi as the latter has not yet got a clean chit in the sex CD case. Sources said Balachandra might not push for his inclusion but for R Shankar and Shrimant Patil, the two turncoat MLAs. Former minister CP Yogeeshwara is reportedly in Delhi to meet the central leadership. Sources said Ramesh Jarkiholi will soon fly to Delhi to meet the leadership over denying berths to migrant MLAs who helped BJP form the government in 2019. Ministers Anand Singh and MTB Nagaraj who are also unhappy over tourism and municipal administration ministries allotted to them, respectively, had met the CM on Sunday to express their displeasure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/voices-of-discontent-grow-louder-in-bjp-after-portfolio-allocation/articleshow/85192116.cms||---

The list of business for Tuesday mentions a proposed discussion on “agricultural problems and solutions”. The notices for this were submitted by nine MPs including three Congress lawmakers, Jairam Ramesh, Anand Sharma and Pratap Singh Bajwa. Soon after the discussion was listed in the revised list of business, Ramesh tweeted, “Tomorrow, in a too clever-by-half move, the Modi Govt has scheduled a discussion on 'The agricultural problems and solutions’ and added my name to it. The discussion has NOTHING to do with my notice given on July 23 on the ongoing farmers’ agitation.” On Monday, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu had said he had received seven notices for discussing Pegasus, farmers’ issue and floods across states by suspending other business. Soon after he said that he approved the notice for a discussion on farmers issues, MPs from opposition parties, led by Trinamool Congress lawmakers, started making demands for discussion on Pegasus. They said the government must have a discussion of the snooping issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-lists-short-duration-discussion-on-farmers-issues-in-rajya-sabha-for-tuesday/articleshow/85192710.cms||Dipak K Dash

Meanwhile, averting a possible tragedy on Independence Day, a joint team of security forces busted a terrorist hideout in Poonch’s Mendhar and recovered a huge cache of arms and ammunition. “A truck driver spotted two suspicious persons carrying backpacks crossing the road near Kapagala in Chowki Choura area in Jammu’s Akhnoor, and informed cops deployed at a check-post. A joint team of the Army and J&K Police subsequently launched a CASO in the area to trace the suspects,” Jammu SSP Chandan Kohli said, adding that the operation was still underway. Based on similar inputs, another CASO was launched near Kasablari village and its adjoining areas — about 25km from Poonch’s Mendhar — early Monday. “The operation is being jointly carried out by the Army’s Rashtriya Rifles, J&K Police’s Special Operations Group and BSF,” confirmed Poonch SSP Vinod Kumar. Meanwhile, giving details of the arms recovery in Mendhar area, BSF spokesperson DIG Jammu Frontiers, SPS Sandhu, said: “On specific inputs, a joint team of the Army, BSF, and Special Operations Group (Poonch) launched a search operation in the forest area in Sangad village in Mendhar’s Mankot.” “During the search, two AK-47 rifles, four AK magazines, a Chinese pistol, 10 pistol magazines, four Chinese grenades, four non-electronic detonators, 15 fuse detonators of Chinese grenades, 16-metre cordex, 257 AK-47 ammunition rounds, 68 rounds of 9mm Chinese ammunition, 23 rounds of 7.65mm ammunition, an I-Com set, two mobile phones, 12 battery mobile chargers and two 9V batteries were recovered from the hideout,” DIG Sandhu added. Meanwhile, the combing operation continued for the fourth consecutive day on Monday in Rajouri’s Thannamandi, where two Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists had been slain on August 6. Ahead of I-Day, security forces have increased surveillance in border areas, especially after the recovery of airdropped arms and ammunition and frequent drone activity in Jammu division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terror-suspects-spotted-in-two-jk-districts-search-ops-on/articleshow/85192929.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||India||Afghan warlords struggle to counter Taliban onslaught||ISLAMABAD: The exit of western forces from Afghanistan has opened a pandora’s box in the war-ravaged country, with armed supporters of government forces and insurgents going wild against sympathisers of one another at places controlled by them. While Taliban had held sway over several rural districts of the country ahead of the US announcement of complete troops pullout, the withdrawal of western forces saw rapid advances of the insurgent group, capturing the countryside and border crossings with the neighbouring countries before besieging cities. The Taliban’s rapid gains in battlefields prompted the Kabul administration to rearm private militias led by former warlords to fight on the side of the US-trained Afghan forces against the militants. This project, according to senior Afghan government officials, has been funded by the National Directorate of Security (NDS), the Afghan intelligence service. Some of the Afghan warlords have been despised for their alleged human rights violations while fighting against the Soviet forces in the 1980s and Taliban regime in the 1990s. They had also fought along the western forces after the 2001 American invasion of Afghanistan to expel the Taliban from power. In 2004, Kabul had started a disarmament process and disbanded all militias while appointing its chiefs on high profile positions. After serving as governors, ministers and high-ranked security officials for nearly two decades, many of the warlords, having high stakes in an ongoing struggle for power, reorganised their private militias, with Kabul’s consent, in a bid to halt the advances of the insurgent group. Muhammad Ismail Khan, an Afghan politician and a veteran of the resistance against the Soviet Union, the civil war, and the post-9/11 anti-Taliban fight, is currently leading a charge against the insurgents in the western Herat province at the age of 75. Khan, a Tajik by origin, has described the defence of Herat as one of the most important campaigns of his life. Khan, leading 2,000 militiamen, had recently succeeded in forcing out the militants from the centre of Herat. Abdul Rashid Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek, who had served as a former pro-Soviet fighter, anti-Taliban commander and Afghanistan’s vice-president, had returned to Kabul from Ankara last week, vowing to defeat the Taliban in the country’s north. Heading one of the largest militias, the insurgent group had on Saturday seized control of Sheberghan, capital of the northern Jowzjan province, from his fighters supported by the government forces. Dostum had garnered a fearsome reputation for allegedly massacring thousands of Taliban prisoners of war in the past. Ahmad Massoud, the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, an influential commander killed by al-Qaeda, and Atta Mohammad Noor, a former governor and northern commander, are other prominent warlords resisting Taliban advances in the country’s north, while Abdul Ghani Alipoor, a Hazara militia commander, has taken up arms in the central province of Maidan Wardak to protect his community. The former strongman, Gulbaddin Hikmatyar, however, has been engaged in a fight with the Taliban in the Badakhshan province. Reports from places captured by Taliban depict horrible scenes of executions, revenge killings and door-to-door searches for government and military employees by the insurgents. Many of the journalists, rights and women activists have fled either to Kabul or abroad. The scenes are said to be equally horrible in places recaptured by militias. In Herat, Ismail Khan’s fighters had captured two men on August 2 on suspicion of being the Taliban loyalists and beat them to death using butts of their AK-47 rifles. Then they threw the bodies on a road and pumped them with bullets. Several observers believe that the resurgence of private militias will have drastic consequences for the war-torn country in the long run. If they succeed in defeating the militants with the support of the Afghan army, it will be nearly impossible for Kabul to disarm them again in the absence of western forces. If Taliban overthrow president Ashraf Ghani's government, the presence of private militias will lead to unending civil war in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/afghan-warlords-struggle-to-counter-taliban-onslaught/articleshow/85193093.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Dr Rick Bright, formerly of the US Department of Health and Human Services, reached a settlement with the agency, lawyer Debra Katz said.  The settlement resolves Bright's "allegations that HHS retaliated against him for blowing the whistle about the Trump Administration's inadequate and irresponsible response to the coronavirus pandemic," Katz said in a statement.  Neither side disclosed specifics of the settlement, but Katz said "Dr Bright has been compensated to the fullest extent allowed by the law" and "will receive back pay and compensatory damages."  The US Office of Special Counsel, an independent government agency that hears whistleblower complaints, said in a statement that it helped facilitate a "mutually agreeable resolution."  HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bright was removed in April 2020 as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a part of HHS responsible for developing drugs to fight the coronavirus.  Bright said he was removed and demoted because he raised concerns about pandemic preparedness.  HHS has disputed Bright's account, saying last year he was transferred to a job where he was entrusted to spend around $1 billion to develop diagnostic testing.  Bright testified at a congressional hearing in May 2020 that he would "never forget" an e-mail he got in January 2020 from a US supplier of medical-grade masks warning of a dire shortage.  "He said 'we are in deep shit. The world is. We need to act,'" Bright told lawmakers. "And I pushed that forward to the highest level that I could of HHS and got no response."  Bright said he was ousted from BARDA in part because he resisted efforts to push the drug hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid-19, something advocated by Trump himself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-settles-scientists-whistleblower-complaint-about-trump-covid-19-response/articleshow/85193284.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Restaurants have been the backbone of Mumbai’s life, help us save them’||Last week, in the new COVID guidelines, no relaxations were made to the 4pm deadline for Mumbai’s restaurants, even as all shops were allowed to operate till 10pm, delivering yet another blow to the industry that has already been reeling under financial strain amid the pandemic. Stakeholders from the beleaguered industry recently met the CM and are also planning to hold a silent protest today, hoping for relaxations in the coming weeks...Last week, the BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) rolled out new unlock guidelines for the city, which saw relaxations for several businesses, including non-essential shops to remain open till 10pm. The fresh set of guidelines came as a huge relief for malls, gyms and salons, but the sector that felt a huge blow was the hospitality industry, which includes all of Mumbai’s restaurants, eateries and bars. As per the new guidelines, while they can now stay open on weekends, no changes have been made in the daily operation timings, and the 4pm deadline continues. Owners of restaurants, bars and hotels across Maharashtra have decided to hold a silent protest march today if their original operation timings are not restored. Meanwhile, members of four associations — NRAI, HRAWI, AHAR and HAI — met with Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray on Friday to voice their grievances and concerns. ‘There is a severe drain on our resources and complete lack of clarity and helplessness’Riyaaz Amlani, owner of restaurants like Social, Smoke House Deli, Salt Water Cafe, Goodness To Go, and Slink & Bardot, tells Bombay Times, “It’s all about livelihoods. The concern, of course, is that there should not be any spread of the virus. They feel if they open up restaurants and normalcy is completely restored, then people will forget about the dangers of the pandemic. But resources in the F&B industry have completely dwindled. Earlier, we took some loans and then opened up, and now we’ve got losses and also these new loans on top of it, so we are in a very precarious position. We just want clarity and communication from the government so that we can plan ahead — if not now, maybe one or two weeks from now, if we can open up in a phased manner. We are asking for a clear roadmap because uncertainties are raking up. There is a severe drain on our resources. There is a complete lack of clarity and helplessness and that’s what’s causing this frustration.” He adds, “A group of association members went and met the chief minister for this on Friday. I was also present. They have assured us that they will study the issues and give us some information by Wednesday after having considered various factors. More than the restaurant owners, I think it’s the employees who are really frustrated now because there is no certainty of their jobs in the current situation.” ‘The CM’s intentions are actually great, but they aren’t involving the real stakeholders in the decision-making process’Talking about their meeting with the CM, Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, Vice President of the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI), and spokesperson of HRAWI, says, “The meeting was fruitful, we apprised him of the situation and said that it is the right time now to start reopening restaurants. When we spoke to the CM at length, we learnt that the disaster management cell has been guiding him. And while doctors are adept at running hospitals, the concerns of the hospitality industry are different. We can understand the fear they have, but right now, the focus should be on livelihood. The CM told us that he would attend the next disaster management cell meeting and definitely find out how to open restaurants. The CM’s intentions are actually great, but they aren’t involving the real stakeholders in the decision-making process, so it doesn’t work. They should realise that if there is no livelihood, the hospitality people will end up in the hospitals.” ‘A more thoughtful idea would have been to allow restaurants to open from 5 pm onwards’Pritina Shrestha Tuli, owner of House of Lords, The Frontier Post, Raaga, and Rhythm and Blues, says, “There has to be a reasonable solution to keep the spread under control and to keep our economy going at the same time. Hospitality industry not only gives a place for people to unwind and refresh and see some hope in tough times like these, but also has one of the highest hiring rates. The livelihood of many people is completely dependent on us. The 4pm closing timing means that our business is down to 20 per cent of the usual revenue, whereas, our overheads remain the same. For most restaurateurs, the main business hours start post 5pm. A more thoughtful idea would have been to allow restaurants to open from 5pm onwards. This would serve both purposes, that is, keeping the restaurants shut for half a day and allowing the industry to have some hope and scope of income. As restaurateurs, we are ready to do everything to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by following strict social distancing norms and also by making vaccination records a must for entry.” ‘We’ve followed all Government protocols and norms, they should hear our plea’Restaurateur Vedant Malik from Mizu feels it’s “terribly unfair” that the F&B industry has been singled out and subjected to massive restrictions. He says, “We, like every other business, have followed all government protocols and norms, and have also got everyone working with us vaccinated. How are we to sustain and grow our businesses with the constant and multiple overheads in this industry? We hope the government hears and understands our plea, and allows us to function just the way they have allowed other businesses.” ‘Vibrancy of Mumbai city lies in family dining’Mumbaikars have been waiting for long to go back and dine in their favourite restaurants, and they’ve been disappointed with the new rules. Rupa Naik, Executive Director of the World Trade Center, says, “Allowing restaurants to open only till 4pm is as good as imposing a lockdown. Restaurants are one of the largest contributors to the economy in terms of employment and taxes. These restrictions in addition to burdens such as salaries, rent, property tax and input costs are making the entire restaurant business unviable. Traditionally, dining is a family activity with people enjoying fine dining on weekends. The vibrancy of Mumbai city lies in family dining.” Amrish Arora, a city-based restaurateur, adds, “Doing food deliveries is just 20 per cent of our run rate and if we had to operate on these deliveries, we would only float cloud kitchens.” He says the curb on nightlife due to the timings will leave them badly impacted. “For us, a large chunk of business — almost 80 per cent of it — is at night. Our employees want to come back to work, but where should they come when restaurants are doing so badly,” he adds. CELEBS BACK RESTOSZareen Khan, Sophie Choudry, Ishitta Arun and Varun Badola‘Every industry should be given a fair chance to operate’Actress Zareen Khan says, “Everybody in each industry can be given a fair chance to operate and overcome the past financial casualties that the pandemic brought about. Given that spas, salons and shops have opened up with preferable timings, I feel the restaurant industry too should be able to operate under the same guidelines.” ‘There is no logic in the factyou keep something open until 4PM but not 8pm’Expressing her concern over the F&B industry being the worst hit, actress Ishitta Arun says, “I stand in solidarity with the restaurateurs. There is no logic in the fact you keep something open until 4pm but not 8pm, whereas, shops are open until 10pm. We need to support and perpetuate this industry that has been the backbone of Mumbai’s life.” ‘We need things to open up, but also follow guidelines’Actress-singer Sophie Choudry says, “Times are really tough for the hospitality business and they need our support. Unfortunately, the last time Mumbai opened up, no SOPs remained in place and the second wave hit us hard. Yes, we need things to open up now for the sake of businesses, but we need everyone to follow very strict guidelines.” ‘The government must come up with a concrete plan that’s a win-win situation for all’Actor Varun Badola says, “I understand what the government is trying to do and it is our personal responsibility and duty as citizens to follow the norms and maintain social distancing. Nonetheless, I empathise with the restaurant owners. The government must come up with a concrete plan that is a win-win situation for all.” TIMES VIEWThe concerns of the industry are totally valid and the decision of the government to keep to the 4pm deadline for restaurants and bars even as malls, gyms and salons are allowed to stay open till 10pm is a poorly thought out one.The industry is in an extremely precarious situation financially. To take calls without consulting the industry, to not provide a clear roadmap, is at this point of time tantamount to presiding over the gradual collapse of the sector. The industry has neither resources nor clarity and has been reduced to pleading and protesting just to protect its existence.Putting arbitrary timelines on the functioning of business — more so a 4pm cut-off for a sector where the bulk of activity and revenue has always been in the post 5pm space — is irrational. Standalone restaurants and bars must not only be allowed to function till the other categories, till 10pm at the very least, but the government should go beyond that and allow them to open till 1am. The longer the hours, the more dispersed will be the footfall, minimising the chances of crowding and the spread of COVID-19. Equally importantly, in a sector that generates so much employment and is struggling to pay and engage staff, allowing a longer period of operations will encourage more shifts, and thereby, the necessity for more staff to be provided gainful employment. Surely there is no scientific rationale on the day vs night formula — the virus does not multiply faster at night. A decision such as this therefore does little to save lives but ensures that it destroys livelihoods.Not only should the government immediately easen the timeline restrictions, it should also, retrospectively, ensure that no licence fees are charged from the venues in the period commencing from the date of the first lockdown till the date where all restrictions are finally lifted.Maharashtra is of course not the only state to enforce timelines that have little scientific rationality but have immense and sometimes irreversible ramifications on the sustainability of an entire industry, and on the livelihoods of those employed in it. Governance cannot be an arbitrary exercise of power.Rationality cannot be abandoned in the process of rule-making, even if the ostensible objective is bringing down the COVID numbers. The taxpayer is the final master and decisions that affect him/her must be thought out, made in consultation, and be able to withstand scrutiny. To treat the taxpayer as a silent observer who must put up with bureaucratic calls made in closed rooms and then plead to make his voice heard is indefensible — be it in Maharashtra or elsewhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/restaurants-have-been-the-backbone-of-mumbais-life-help-us-save-them/articleshow/85181692.cms||Debarati S Sen
---||World||Lawmakers slam Afghan govt for fall of cities to Taliban||ISLAMABAD: Afghan lawmakers have strongly criticised President Ashraf Ghani’s government for failing to defend the strategically important cities of Sheberghan and Kunduz in northern Afghanistan, which fell recently to the Taliban without much resistance. Some members of the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, or Junbish-e-Milli, a political party headed by former Afghan vice-president Abdul Rashid Dostum, warned that more cities in the north would come under threat if Taliban advances were not prevented in Kunduz province. They also linked the fall of neighbouring Jawzjan province to the Taliban to rivalry between Dostum and other powerful leaders. "The internal rifts and rivalries between Dostum and others had provided an opportunity for Taliban to take over Jawzjan. The Taliban, otherwise, had not the ability to overrun the province with such ease," said Bahruddin Jawzjani, a tribal elder from Jawzjan. The insurgent group had captured Sheberghan three days ago to complete its control over the province. During their interaction with Afghan media, lawmakers from Kunduz and Jawzjan provinces accused the Kabul administration of not paying sufficient attention to the security situation in the north. They said that the takeover of Jawzjan’s capital, Sheberghan, and parts of Kunduz city in Kunduz province by the insurgent group has threatened the security of other cities in the north. "The Kabul administration had not focused on the security of Kunduz. The situation in Kunduz affects the situation in Takhar and Baghlan. The capture of Baghlan by the insurgents would cut off Kunduz and other key northern towns from Kabul. Kabul is now threatened from the north," said former deputy interior minister Mirza Mohammad Yarmand. He urged the government to retake control of Kunduz as soon as possible to avoid further setbacks in the north. Kunduz provincial council member Rabbani Rabbani said that the Taliban knew the importance of Kunduz while the government saw it as a small village. "The government’s focus has been primarily on the fight in southern Afghanistan to protect Kandahar, and in the mountain passes of eastern Afghanistan to protect Jalalabad," Rabbani said. Amruddin Wali, the head of the Kunduz provincial council, described Kunduz as "little Afghanistan". "Kunduz houses all ethnic groups. For the last 20 years, every ethnic group had a say in its affairs. Now, a single ethnic group (Taliban) has captured it and the power has been shifted to a single group (Pashtuns)," Wali said. Halima Sadaf Karimi, a legislator from Jawzjan, called on the authorities in Kabul to immediately start a military offensive against Taliban invaders in the region. "If the government does not start an operation now, it will have a negative impact on all the northern and northeastern provinces," she said. Meanwhile, a group of Kunduz residents, who had escaped the city, had held a rally in front of the presidential palace in Kabul on Sunday criticising the lack of support for government troops in the province. "Our people who came to Kabul have no shelter. Others have been caught there (Kunduz). Some have been killed and wounded," said Jawad Rafat, a rally participant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/lawmakers-slam-afghan-govt-for-fall-of-cities-to-taliban/articleshow/85193551.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||Official: Protracted Afghan war Pakistan's worst nightmare||ISLAMABAD: A protracted war in neighboring Afghanistan is Pakistan's "nightmare scenario,'' the country's national security advisor said Monday. He also slammed relentless blaming of Islamabad for the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan. The US needs to take the lead to get the Afghan government and the Taliban back to the negotiation table, Moeed Yusuf told foreign journalists in the Pakistani capital. He said Pakistan is pushing the Taliban to return to negotiations but its leverage is waning as the insurgent group gains more ground in Afghanistan. Pakistan hasn't even been able to convince the Taliban to reopen the border crossing at Spin Boldak in southeastern Afghanistan, which the insurgent force captured last month, Yusuf said. In their sweep through Afghanistan, which began with the late April start of the final withdrawal of US and Nato troops, the Taliban have gained control of strategic and lucrative border crossings, including the Spin Boldak crossing with Pakistan. Last weekend the Taliban closed the crossing in southeast Afghanistan after Islamabad demanded that Afghans crossing to the Pakistani side have a passport and a Pakistani visa, something that had not previously been required. The Taliban accused Pakistan of imposing the new rules to please Kabul and President Ashraf Ghani. They shuttered the border, insisting Pakistan reinstate an earlier lax policy under which the thousands who cross daily were rarely required to show even local identity cards. As a result, thousands of Afghans and Pakistanis are stuck at the border and hundreds of trucks loaded with perishable goods have been waiting to cross. As the Aug. 31 deadline for the final withdrawal of US and Nato troops from Afghanistan approaches, Yusuf called for "a reinvigorated, re-emphasized, rejuvenated effort to try and get Afghan political actors ... in one room ... to get to a settlement of how to move forward." "Anything but an inclusive political settlement means a protracted conflict, through which instability will likely spill over into Pakistan,'' he said. "So our nightmare scenario is a protracted conflict." Yusuf said Pakistan, which already hosts about 2 million Afghan refugees, hasn't got the resources to absorb a fresh wave of refugees. The government fears that will happen if fighting continues and the sides don't return to the negotiating table. The Taliban's onslaught defies statements by their political leadership in the Middle Eastern country Qatar advocating for talks. The insurgent force has shown no sign of wanting to negotiate, instead pressing ahead on the battlefield, sweeping through five provincial capitals in less than a week. Yusuf accused Afghanistan of scapegoating Pakistan, blaming it for the Taliban advances and demanded evidence of accusations by Kabul at a recent UN Security Council meeting that 10,000 fighters were crossing from Pakistan to Afghanistan. Instead he attacked the performance of Afghanistan's National Defense and Security Forces in those areas where they abandoned districts, occasionally crossing into Tajikistan or Iran or Pakistan to escape the advancing Taliban. "We are told that over a trillion dollars were put into Afghanistan and much of that into the ANDSF to prepare the army and the security forces ... What is going on with this well-equipped and trained force?''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/official-protracted-afghan-war-pakistans-worst-nightmare/articleshow/85192766.cms||---

The slain couple – sarpanch Ghulam Rasool Dar of Kulgam's Redwani panchayat and his wife and colleague Jawahira Begum – had recently chosen to move back home from a secure government-provided hotel accommodation in that district, IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said. The personal security officer assigned to the couple was not with them when the attack occurred. "The PSO has been placed under suspension with immediate effect," IGP Kumar said. The manner of the killings bore a striking resemblance to the June 27 storming of special police officer Fayaz Ahmad's home at Hariparigam in Awantipora, when two Jaish terrorists sprayed him, his wife and their 22-year-old daughter with bullets. Since last year, a total of 19 BJP members, including elected panchayat representatives and grassroots workers, have been killed by terrorist outfits across the Valley. Congress has had its share of casualties in the spate of attacks that peaked after the first-ever District Development Council elections in J&K and ebbed at the start of this year. Overall, 40 political activists have been killed in terror attacks since the nullification of Article 370 in August 2019. "Once again, Pakistan-sponsored terrorists have bled Kashmir. The sacrifices of BJP workers in Kashmir will not go waste," said J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina. The spectre of political killings has returned to haunt the Valley on the cusp of democratic restoration, a process coinciding with a multi-agency crackdown on terror funding, alleged supporters of outlawed outfits within the ranks of government employees and state-funded schools and seminaries that allegedly radicalise youth for terror activities. Compared to 2020, there has been a steep decline in terrorist-related violence in J&K, according to official data. Till July 16, the number of such incidents officially reported this year stood at 67. Between January and June 30 last year, 105 such incidents had been recorded in the Union Territory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/terrorists-shoot-dead-jk-bjp-sarpanch-wife-at-home/articleshow/85193630.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Indianapolis man alleges van ride to jail left him paralyzed||INDIANAPOLIS: An Indianapolis man who says he was paralyzed while being taken to jail in 2019 filed a lawsuit alleging officers threw him head-first into the back of a van that had no safety restraints. The lawsuit, announced Monday, alleges that by the time the van arrived at the jail 20 minutes later, Travis Shinneman could not support his body weight. The 49-year-old remains paralyzed from the neck down and requires around-the-clock care, his attorneys said. The case is reminiscent of that of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man, who died in 2015 after his neck was broken while he was handcuffed and shackled in a Baltimore police van. Shinneman, who is white, was arrested by Indianapolis metro police officers in September 2019 for disorderly conduct and public intoxication, according to court documents. Police then handed him over to officers with the Marion County sheriff's office to take him to jail. He was the only passenger in the back of the van and there were no cameras to monitor him, the lawsuit states. The lawsuit names the Marion County sheriff's office and some of its employees, as well as Indianapolis police officers and some city officials. The sheriff's department issued a statement Monday saying that it does not comment on pending litigation but that "there are two sides to every story, and that ultimately it will be a judge and jury that will likely resolve the litigation.'' The lawsuit states that when the van arrived at the jail, Shinneman was lying face down on the floorboard with his head at the tailgate doors. He was then "forcibly removed'' by several deputies and put into a wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Shinneman's lawyers released security camera footage that they argue shows some Marion County jail employees "manhandled'' him, furthering his injuries. Other employees mocked him for his condition or "simply ignored'' him, according to the lawsuit, which was filed Sunday. The lawyers also say an onsite nurse observed Shinneman only from a distance before refusing to accept him because she believed he merely was intoxicated. Shinneman eventually was carried out of the intake area in what his attorney's described as "a hog-tied manner and taken to Eskenazi Hospital. There, he was diagnosed with a fractured and dislocated spinal cord, resulting in paralysis. Shinneman now lives in a nursing home, his attorneys said. His legal team is seeking "accountability among public and law enforcement officials,'' as well as damages. "This is a disturbing case because it could literally happen to anyone,'' said Jennifer Culotta, one of Shinneman's attorneys. "It is shocking that in the wake of Freddie Gray's death, that the Marion County Jail transport vans were not equipped with safety belts, cameras to monitor transports, or security measures to ensure that transports are not thrown around the back of a transport van like a pinball in a machine.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/indianapolis-man-alleges-van-ride-to-jail-left-him-paralyzed/articleshow/85193789.cms||---
---||India||Nirav Modi gets nod to appeal extradition to India on grounds of mental health, suicide risk||LONDON: Billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi, who is detained in a London prison, has been granted permission to appeal against extradition to India on the grounds that he is mentally ill, poses a high risk of suicide and that it could be oppressive to extradite him. Handing down judgment at the high court on Monday, Justice Chamberlain granted Nirav permission to appeal on two grounds: that his extradition could be contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment; and that it could be oppressive to extradite him by virtue of his mental and physical health pursuant to Section 91 of the Extradition Act of 2003. On February 25 at Westminster magistrates’ court district judge Samuel Goozée had concluded that despite an "undisputed diagnosis of severe depression", there were no bars to extradition and had sent Nirav’s case to UK home secretary Priti Patel. She ordered his extradition on April 15. On July 21 Nirav sought permission to appeal against Goozée and Patel’s decisions. In his written judgment Chamberlain said: "The question for me is whether the appellant’s case on these grounds is reasonably arguable. In my judgment, it is. I will not restrict the basis on which those grounds can be argued, though it seems to me that there should be a particular focus on whether the judge was wrong to reach the conclusion he did, given the evidence as to the severity of the appellant’s depression, the high risk of suicide and the adequacy of any measures capable of preventing successful suicide attempts in Arthur Road prison." At the July 21 hearing Nirav’s barrister, Edward Fitzgerald QC, had argued that Goozée was wrong to discount Nirav’s high risk of suicide on the basis that it was not "immediate". "It requires the court to ask what will happen if a person suffering from a mental disorder who might commit suicide is extradited," he said. "The level of medical care afforded to prisoners at Arthur Road Jail has been completely inadequate for over 20 years, and the deficiencies are particularly acute in respect of experienced psychiatric staff. The problems will be exacerbated by the pandemic. The judge was wrong to rely on the government of India assurances," he said. Nirav (50) will be able to argue these grounds at an appeal hearing. Whichever side loses could seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law. Nirav is subject to three extradition requests. The first relates to fraud worth over Rs 7,000 crore on Punjab National Bank; the second relates to money laundering; and the third relates to interference with evidence and witnesses. Chamberlain refused to give permission to appeal on the other grounds sought, ruling there was a "prima facie case" and that the offences were extradition offences, branding Justice Thipsay’s submissions on this as "irrelevant". He refused to entertain arguments that Nirav would not receive a fair trial in India because Christian Michel had been "mistreated" or that Indian politicians were trying to influence the outcome.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nirav-modi-gets-nod-to-appeal-extradition-to-india-on-grounds-of-mental-health-suicide-risk/articleshow/85193754.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||Aircrafts help fight California wildfire as smoke clears||Thick smoke that held down winds and temperatures in the zone of the largest single wildfire in California history cleared on Monday from scenic forestlands, allowing firefighting aircraft to rejoin the battle to contain the massive Dixie Fire. The newly clear skies will allow more than two dozen helicopters and two air tankers that have been grounded to fly again and make it safer for ground crews to maneuver. "With this kind of weather, fire activity will pick up. But the good thing is we can get aircraft up,'' said fire spokesman Ryan Bain. Winds were not expected to reach the ferocious speeds that helped the blaze explode in size last week. But they were still a concern for firefighters working in unprecedented conditions to protect thousands of threatened homes. Fueled by powerful gusts and bone-dry vegetation, the fire incinerated much of the small community of Greenville last Wednesday and Thursday. At least 627 homes and other structures had been destroyed by Monday and another 14,000 buildings were still threatened in the northern Sierra Nevada. Damage reports are preliminary because assessment teams can't get into many areas, officials said. The Dixie Fire, named for the road where it started nearly four weeks ago, grew to an area of 765 square miles (1,980 square kilometers) by Sunday evening and was just 21% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It had scorched an area more than twice the size of New York City. Four firefighters were taken to the hospital Friday after being struck by a fallen branch. More than 30 people were initially reported missing, but by Monday the Plumas County Sheriff's Office had accounted for all of them. With smoke clearing out above eastern portions of the fire, crews that had been directly attacking the front lines would be forced to retreat and build containment lines farther back, said Dan McKeague, a fire information officer from the US Forest Service. The blaze became the largest single fire in California's recorded history, surpassing last year's Creek Fire in the the state's central valley agricultural region. The Dixie Fire is about half the size of the August Complex, a series of lightning-caused 2020 fires across seven counties that were fought together and that state officials consider California's largest wildfire overall. The fire's cause was under investigation. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) has said it may have been sparked when a tree fell on one of its power lines. A federal judge ordered PG&E on Friday to give details by Aug. 16 about the equipment and vegetation where the fire started. Governor Gavin Newsom surveyed the damage in Greenville over the weekend, writing on Twitter that "our hearts ache for this town.'' "These are climate-induced wildfires and we have to acknowledge that we have the capacity in not just the state but in this country to solve this,'' Newsom said on CNN. Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists have said climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. Northwest of the Dixie Fire in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, hundreds of homes remained threatened by two fires that continued to grow. About a quarter of the McFarland Fire was contained. New evacuation orders were issued on Monday for residents near the Monument Fire, which was only about 3% contained. South of the Dixie Fire, firefighters prevented further growth of the River Fire, which broke out Wednesday near the community of Colfax and destroyed 68 homes. Smoke from wildfires burning in the US West continues to flow into parts of Colorado and Utah, where the air quality in many areas was rated as unhealthy. Denver's air quality improved on Sunday, but the smoke has made the air there and in Salt Lake City among the worst in the world. California's fire season is on track to surpass last year's season, which was the worst in recent recorded state history. Since the start of the year, more than 6,000 blazes have destroyed more than 1,260 square miles (3,260 square kilometers) of land, more than triple the losses for the same period in 2020, according to state fire figures. California's raging wildfires were among 107 large fires burning across 14 states, mostly in the West, where historic drought conditions have left lands parched and ripe for ignition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/aircrafts-help-fight-california-wildfire-as-smoke-clears/articleshow/85188973.cms||---

The top US diplomat's speech reflects what President Joe Biden's administration calls a "foreign policy for the middle class" with a focus on competitiveness at home and abroad and a winding down of costly military commitments. Blinken toured an engineering laboratory at the University of Maryland on the outskirts of Washington where noisy 3D printers churned out prototypes for new products. "The Chinese and Russian governments, among others, are making the argument in public and in private that the United States is in decline so it's better to cast your lot with their authoritarian visions for the world than with our democratic one," Blinken said at the university's Advanced Fabrication Lab. "Nothing would put to rest faster their specious argument about America's best days being behind us than if the United States made serious investments in our domestic renewal right now," he said. Blinken cited a World Economic Forum study that the United States ranks 13th in infrastructure and said that China was spending three times as much and also investing more in research and development. Blinken described China - identified by the Biden administration as the pre-eminent long-term challenge of the United States - as a "rising power" but said that challenges on competitiveness came from multiple countries. The top US diplomat nonetheless said the United States remained "the most powerful country and economy in the world," pointing to its long history of inventions and how international students remain drawn to US universities. "We want always to be the place that represents opportunity, possibility, achievement. Investing in our domestic renewal now means that we can continue to be that beacon to the world," Blinken said. Blinken's remarks come before the US Senate is expected to approve a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, a major priority for Biden that will build bridges, roads and an electric car network while improving drinking water and high-speed internet across the country. Biden has ordered an end this month to the 20-year US war in Afghanistan, which according to Brown University's Costs of War Project has cost the United States more than $2.2 trillion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/blinken-urges-investment-at-home-to-compete-with-china/articleshow/85194086.cms||---

He said the corpus generated through the social contribution can be used to finance projects such as 100 zero fatality corridors in India. Social bonds are the use of proceed bonds that raise funds for new and existing projects with positive social outcomes. Gadkari made this observation while addressing a virtual workshop organized by the World Bank on “Private financing for road safety”. “The idea presented to me of private capital mobilisation through social bonds, sustainability-linked bonds and pooling of CSR funds can be widely used for road safety improvement efforts…I urge all private sector entities to pro-actively come forward for the development of social bonds,” he said. Gadkari said the first Zero Fatality stretch. Gadkari said although insurance companies are direct beneficiaries of a saved life, they have made hardly any contribution to the cause in India. He said there is a huge scope of improvement in approving claims and providing support to families of the victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gadkari-urges-private-players-to-develop-social-bonds-to-fund-zero-fatality-roads/articleshow/85194230.cms||Dipak K Dash

The government made the tests free for all in March to make a gradual return to normal life possible after a lockdown to break a third wave of Covid-19. But with 55% of the population fully vaccinated there have been calls to stop spending taxpayers' money on a subsidised scheme that now mainly benefits those who are not yet vaccinated even though vaccines are available for all. "Given that all vaccination is immediately available to all citizens, it is no longer justifiable that the federal government and therefore taxpayers cover the cost of all tests," RND cited from a draft proposal. Less than seven weeks before a federal election, Merkel and state leaders will discuss measures to keep rising new infections spurred by the Delta variant in check without instituting lockdowns. The draft stipulates that people who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons like expectant women and children under 18 will continue to be entitled to subsidised tests. An exact date in October for curtailing the program has not yet been made, RND added. Germany has recorded more than 3,000 cases on each of the past five days but with almost 63% of the population having received at least one shot the government is hoping lockdowns could be avoided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/germany-to-stop-free-covid-19-tests-report/articleshow/85194967.cms||---

"My administration is committed to ensuring the maximum degree of transparency under the law," Biden said in a statement. "I welcome the Department of Justice’s filing today, which commits to conducting a fresh review of documents where the government has previously asserted privileges, and to doing so as quickly as possible." Family members of victims of the attacks on New York and Washington, which killed nearly 3,000 people, made the appeal to Biden in a letter released on Friday as the 20th anniversary nears. Saudi Arabia has said it had no role in the hijacked plane attacks. The Saudi embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. The office of US Attorney Audrey Strauss, in Manhattan on Monday said that the FBI had "decided to review" earlier claims it had made about why it could not release some information requested by families. Prosecutors said the FBI had decided to review earlier assertions it had made about documents being privileged "to identify additional information appropriate for disclosure" and added that it "will disclose such information on a rolling basis as expeditiously as possible." James Kreindler, a lawyer for some families, said that he and his clients hoped the FBI and Justice Department moves indicated that "we will be getting documents we have been seeking for years." He said such documents include reports on the investigation of the attacks as well as documents related to Operation Encore, a review by the FBI of its September 11 probe conducted in 2016. Families of victims and their lawyers have complained for years that US agencies were sitting on documents describing Saudi Arabian links to the attackers. "We appreciate President Biden acknowledging our families today as we pursue justice and accountability against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia," Brett Eagleson, whose father Bruce Eagleson was killed, said in a statement. "Unfortunately, however, we have heard many empty promises before." Eagleson's statement said the Justice Department "can act immediately to produce the documents including the unredacted 2016 FBI Review Report of the bureau’s years-long investigation of Saudi government agents who 'are known to have provided substantial assistance to’ the hijackers, as well as phone records and witness statements."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-reviews-september-11-attack-files-after-families-told-biden-to-skip-memorial/articleshow/85194087.cms||---
---||World||New push to disband Minneapolis police after Floyd's death||MINNEAPOLIS: On a hot summer afternoon, Latrell Snider and his partner knocked on Abdullahi Mohamed's door, introduced themselves and launched their pitch: Minneapolis, they said, has a chance to replace its police department with something new, and they wanted Mohamed's support.  With his children looking on from a living room window, Mohamed reacted cautiously, saying he likes police and relies on them to keep his family safe. When Snider assured him that a new public safety department would still have a police unit but would do things differently - such as responding to some 911 calls without armed officers - Mohamed brightened.  "I think that would be a better idea," he said.  More than a year after George Floyd's death sparked a failed push to abolish the Minneapolis Police Department, activists and several City Council members are trying again, with a well-funded initiative that would ask voters in November whether the department - disparaged by critics for what they say is an enduring culture of brutality - should be dismantled.  In its place would be a public safety department that employs a "comprehensive public health approach" and licensed peace officers "if necessary." The new department would no longer be under the sole command of the mayor's office, which is significant given that incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey opposes abolishing the police department while a majority of City Council members supports the idea.  More than 30 local groups are pushing for change under the "Yes 4 Minneapolis" banner. They gathered 20,000 signatures to get the measure on the ballot - almost twice the number necessary - and have raised about $1 million, including $500,000 from Open Society Policy Center, which has ties to billionaire George Soros.  "What we knew as public safety - which is only the police right now, the only option that we have - was unacceptable," said Brian Fullman, lead organizer with one of the groups, Barbershop and Black Congregation Cooperative. "The murder of George Floyd ignited a lot of historical pain and disrespect that we have been going through, and we made the decision that we no longer wanted to have what we have now as the only option for public safety."  A majority of City Council members first began pushing to eliminate the police department soon after Floyd's death, but they failed to meet deadlines to get it on the ballot last November. The Rev. JaNae Bates, a leader of the Yes 4 Minneapolis campaign, said the ease with which the campaign gathered signatures shows the momentum for change is still there more than a year after Floyd's death.  "The residents of Minneapolis really were the ones who made the call for this, who were like, we can't just let this lesson that took place in the summer to be something that fizzles out, and then what? We just wait for the next person to be killed by the police?" she said.  Minneapolis, like most other major U.S. cities, has been on edge due to rising violence and property crime in almost every neighborhood in the past year. And the police department is more than 200 officers, or about 25%, below its authorized strength due mostly to a wave of retirements and disability leaves following Floyd's death.  Both factors have energized opponents of the initiative. All of Mpls - a new group that has raised more than $109,000 - will begin campaigning against the proposal in the coming weeks with door knocking, community events, mailers and digital ads through the fall.  All of Mpls campaign manager Leili Fatehi called the proposal to eliminate the department "a gimmick." She said plenty of residents want police to be held accountable and changes in the department, but they also worry about rising crime.  "It's not getting us to the real solutions that balance those two concerns," she said.  Opponents also say the ballot question doesn't guarantee that a new public safety department would have police officers at all. Instead, it says officers would be included "if necessary to fulfill the department's duties." Bill Rodriguez, co-founder of Operation Safety Now, called the proposed amendment a "trojan horse" and warned that the campaign's end goal is to abolish police.  "The amendment doesn't say there will be a police force - it says there could be, maybe, if necessary," he said. "That's the most important thing that needs to be understood about this amendment."  It's among several aspects of the ballot question that city officials plan to highlight with an explanatory note in November. Activists are trying to block such a note, arguing that the city is improperly trying to influence voters.  Regardless of how the ballot question fares, the city remains under pressure to make changes. The police department is the target of federal and state investigations into policing practices, and both investigations could force widespread change. In addition, the mayor and Chief Medaria Arradondo have launched several policy changes since Floyd's death, including requiring new training on de-escalation, overhauling use of force restrictions and strengthening the disciplinary process.  Details of what a new public safety department would look like are scarce, but Bates said that's intentional, to get city residents involved in the process. If the amendment passes, council members would need to first pass an ordinance to establish the new department, explain how it would function and how its commissioner is selected. It's not clear how long such a process would take.  Ed Brown, 69, listened to Snider's pitch on his north Minneapolis doorstep in July. Brown, who is Black, told The Associated Press that a new public safety department seems like a good plan. He thinks it would mean police officers are no longer sent to some calls that they aren't equipped to deal with and that can otherwise end in violence.  "What we need to do is reimagine the police department," Brown said.  "That is to say not necessarily defund but maybe in some cases even give them more money if they're going to do the right thing with it," he said. "We have to have the proper responses for the proper situations."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-push-to-disband-minneapolis-police-after-floyds-death/articleshow/85195528.cms||---

In a first for any Indian Prime Minister, PM Modi chaired the first-ever independent discussion on maritime security in the UNSC on Monday, its first major activity during India’s month of presidency of the global body. U S secretary of state Antony Blinken represented his country, even though the US permanent representative is a cabinet-level person, indicating the importance of the issue and the growing convergences with India. China, however, showed its displeasure by sending its deputy permanent representative Dai Bing to the meeting. Significantly, Russian President Vladimir Putin was also present. China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea, islandbuilding and bullying of countries by its fishing militia have been a source of international concern. Even though the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) under UNCLOS ruled in 2016 that China’s activities in the South China Sea are illegal, Beijing has continued undeterred, leading to growing tensions. On Monday, however, China submitted diplomatically to asserting the primacy of UNCLOS under severe international pressure. In his remarks, Modi pointed to India’s own record of abiding by the decision of the PCA and settling its maritime boundary dispute with Bangladesh in conformity with international arbitration. The session had its tense moments, with the Chinese official lashing out at Japan for emptying Fukushima waters into the Pacific as it asked the ASEAN countries to work out a code of conduct. It was left to Blinken to criticise China’s actions in the South China Sea. Held under the agenda item “Maintenance of International Peace & Security”, the meeting was attended by two presidents (Russia and Kenya), two PMs (India and Vietnam), and 10 ministers, seven of them being foreign ministers. It was one of the highest levels of participation in the UNSC of late. Speaking at the event, Modi called for joint efforts to arrive at a framework for dealing with maritime issues. Officials, who negotiated the outcome document, said India had taken a consensus-building approach by consulting with all UNSC members for the most acceptable language. The PM’s five-point principles, which called on UNSC to develop a roadmap for international maritime security, was welcomed by all participants. “India’s role as a ‘net security provider’ in the Indian Ocean was reiterated. PM’s vision on SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) & IPOI (Indo-Pacific Oceans’ Initiative) was discussed in the UNSC,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-led-unsc-meet-snubs-china-backs-law-of-sea-convention/articleshow/85195559.cms||---

James Savage of Los Banos completed the trip across the scenic lake, which straddles the California-Nevada line, in 12 hours on Aug. 1. He earlier swam the other two legs of the Lake Tahoe Triple Crown, all 10 miles (16 kilometres) or longer. Savage and his mother, Jillian, agreed the physical training was a lot easier than the mental endurance it takes to complete such a long-distance swim. The trip across the lake started in South Lake Tahoe, California, and ended in the Nevada town of Incline Village. She said she knew after the first mile that he would get the job done. I had no doubts whatsoever, Jillian Savage told the Tahoe Daily Tribune. He's been swimming almost every day, six, seven days a week since he was 8. With open water, it's just what he does. But mentally, even though it takes a whole bunch of us to make the swim possible, he's out there by himself. James Savage said he enjoys swimming in pools, but they're pretty much all the same. Open water, you can swim in oceans, lakes, and you get to travel around, he said. Last August, at age 13, Savage became the youngest to complete the 12-mile (19-kilometre) ``true width swim.'' It's also known as the "Godfather'' swim because it starts on Tahoe's west shore at the site of a mansion in Homewood, California, featured in the movie ``The Godfather: Part II.'' He also swam the 10-mile (16-kilometre) Vikingsholm route that traverses the southern portion of Lake Tahoe, known for its pine tree-lined beaches and ski resorts. And at age 8, he swam from Alcatraz to San Francisco. The latest swim was piloted by Captain Tom ``Reptile'' Linthicum of Lake Tahoe Marathon Swim Federation. The team also included an official observer and pace swimmer. Jillian Savage served as a kayaker for the trip. Mom's biggest worry originally was he might abandon the trip after a few hours if it became monotonous. ``It's not like he can sit and talk to us when he gets bored. His face is in the water and so really, he's by himself,'' Jillian Savage said. ``But this time, he kept telling me, `Mom, I feel so much better mentally prepared this time.' And he went out, and he just did such a great job,'' she said. With the title of the youngest person to ever achieve the Triple Crown, James said he isn't sure what he wants to do next. His mom says he'll likely set his sights high. ``When he started this whole open water thing and he told me, `Mom, I want to swim from Alcatraz,' and we kind of laughed in his face,'' she said. ``We let him do it kind of hoping and thinking it would be a one and done, and he got out and he said, I want to do this again. When's the next one?''' she said. And it just kept going and going and going and his feats kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and I'm kind of afraid to see what he wants to do next. But whatever it is, we'll make it happen.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/14-year-old-becomes-youngest-to-swim-length-of-lake-tahoe/articleshow/85195539.cms||---

At a meeting of the floor leaders of opposition parties, called by Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, it was decided that they will participate in the debate. Sources said there was some reservation expressed by Trinamool Congress but it agreed to go with the larger consensus given the political sensitivity of the OBC issue. Kharge, flanked by other opposition members, told reporters it was a legislation concerning the backward classes that would be supported. However, as protests later showed, the opposition has only made an exception for the Constitution amendment Bill and is not willing to allow any other discussion in keeping with its “Pegasus first” stance. Congress deputy leader in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi said, “By agreeing to support the Bill, the opposition has made a positive gesture to the government, and now the government should reciprocate by agreeing to a discussion on Pegasus.” It clearly reflects that despite the conditional thaw, the situation remains fraught in the final week of the session. A senior leader said the agreement on the 127th amendment Bill can also break down on Tuesday if the government uses the opportunity to bring another bill for debate before the OBC-related legislation. It may even lead to passage of the said bill without discussion, some feel. As the uncertainty looms, the opposition is preparing to use the bill to demand a constitutional amendment to remove the 50% quota cap. Congress’s charge in RS will be led by Abhishek Singhvi and Digvijaya Singh. Shiv Sena’s Vinayak Raut said the 50% cap is a critical barrier to instituting Maratha quota and must go. NCP and DMK have the same view. The opposition is also planning to embarrass the government by saying that it’s red flags on the formulation of 102nd constitutional amendment were ignored which resulted in the SC order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opposition-makes-exception-to-its-pegasus-stand-will-join-talks-on-obc-quota-bill/articleshow/85195738.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: These government school kids ace exam, thanks to TV classes, WhatsApp||BENGALURU/MYSURU: While the number of top scorers in SSLC skyrocketed this time with 157 students securing 625 out of 625, the stories of 19 of them stand out — they are from government schools and many belong to farmers’ families. Without much parental guidance, these children learnt largely through DD Chandana, WhatsApp and Vidyagama, the state’s continuous education programme that took teachers to students’ doorsteps. While 125 of the toppers are from unaided schools, 13 are from aided institutions. Besides, 42 students from government schools secured 623 marks, one bagged 622, 74 got 621 and three landed 620. Some of the centum scorers from government schools are from farmers’ families and first in their families to go to school. They had minimal online classes and mostly relied on their dedicated teachers who travelled to their villages to teach them, sent model question papers via WhatsApp and trained them for three months in a classroom. “My teachers came to my village for three months. We sat in a temple or under a tree to learn. It was fun to learn in our own neighbourhood, in an open area. From January to April, we had regular classes until the lockdown. After that, we interacted through WhatsApp,” said Chaitra D, who is the daughter of a farm labourer who earns Rs 250 a day. A student of Government Junior College, Bhaktharahalli, Tumakuru district, Chaitra is the first one in her immediate family to go to school. Srikanth NR, whose father grows ragi, said his teachers used to visit his village once in 15 days during Vidyagama. “We sat under a tree and studied. They used to give us homework until they came back again. My brother, a BCom student, also helped me. I want to pursue computer science engineering later,” said the student of Government High School, Navile Maddur, Mandya, who had some live classes. Keerthi Rajendra Kareppagol, whose father is a dailywage worker and mother an anganwadi teacher, said revision classes aired on DD Chandana were of great help. “I did not miss one single day of it. I also answered model question papers,” she said. Keerthi is a student of Government High School, Shiragavi, Belagavi. All these toppers nurture ambitions of becoming doctors/engineers. Harshitha GS, a student from Government High School, Menasikyathanahalli in T Narasipura taluk of Mysuru district, said she was expecting 624 as she didn’t write the correct answer to a question in Kannada. “However, as the question itself was wrong, a grace mark was awarded. My dream is to become an engineer,” said Harshitha, whose father is a farmer. Keerthana, a student of BM Government High School, Maragowdanahalli in Mandya district, said. “I was expecting full marks as I had prepared well. Teachers used to send model question papers and conduct tests every week. They prepared us keeping the new format in mind,” she said. “I am moving to Bengaluru for PU. My dream is to pursue medical education,” said Keerthana, who studied in English medium. Srinivas C, a student from Government High School, Navilemaddur village, Mandya district, said he was confident of this score. A Kannada-medium student, Srinivas said he will choose the science stream in PU. “Closure of the school due to Covid-19 or switching to online mode of learning didn’t affect my studies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tv-wa-helped-19-govt-school-toppers/articleshow/85195899.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

The results of the Class 10 exam — conducted in multiple choice format — were announced by the new primary and secondary education minister, BC Nagesh, on Monday. Nagesh’s predecessor S Suresh Kumar had announced that all students who appear for the exam would be promoted owing to the pandemic. While 16% of the candidates (1.28 lakh) secured A+ grade, scoring 90-100%, 2.5 lakh or 32% landed A grade (80-89%). With the multiple choice question format giving ample scope for scoring high marks this time round, 157 students scored the maximum: 625 out of 625. The number was only six last year. Curiously, no one scored 624, against 11 last year. Next in line, 289 students scored 623, against 43 last year. The biggest group among toppers was those who secured 621 marks — 449. Thirteen kids were given maximum grace marks of 28 in one subject to enable them get promoted. In all, 9% of the total students received grace marks. The lone student who was deemed failed was a private candidate and repeater in the 26-30 age group who tried to send a proxy candidate to appear for her. The department did not disclose which place she hails from. Last year, the SSLC pass percentage was 71.8%, with girls leading at 77.74, at least 10 percentage points ahead of boys. While several other states and the central boards cancelled the Class 10 exam, the Karnataka government decided to go ahead in the middle of the first wave last year. This time, the exam was a truncated two-day affair, held on July 19 and 22. District-wise competition became a thing of the past with all districts securing A grades. There were binaries like urban and rural and girls and boys as all fared well. With the heavy traffic, Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board website was not accessible for a few hours. With the all-promoted policy, all language medium schools secured a 100% result. This includes Hindi-medium schools that had last year clocked only 48% pass rate, Tamil medium 69% and Urdu 61%. There were 4,626 differently abled candidates who took the exam and cleared it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/8-7l-pass-sslc-exam-1-3l-get-a-1-student-failed-over-proxy-bid/articleshow/85195910.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

According to the BJP’s annual audit report for the year 2019-20 put out by the Election Commission on Monday, the ruling party earned Rs 2,555 crore from electoral bonds in 2019-20, a 76% surge over its Rs 1,450 crore income through this route 2018-19. Its total election expenditure in 2019-20, when the general elections were held, stood at Rs 1,352.92 crore, up from Rs 792.37 crore in 2018-19. Read AlsoWhy electoral bonds have become controversial againElectoral bonds that were meant to clean up India's political funding, have been raising a stink... Compared to the Congress’s total receipts of Rs 682 crore in 2019-20, the ruling party’s income was almost 5.3 times of it. Its expenditure was 1.6 times of the Congress’s total spend of Rs 998 crore in the same year. Interestingly, the BJP’s income in 2019-20 was more than three times the combined income of national parties, namely, the Congress, Trinamool Congress, NCP, BSP, CPM and CPI. In sharp contrast to the 50% surge in the BJP’s income between 2018-19 and 2019-20, the Congress’s income had registered a 25% decline to Rs 682 crore from Rs 998 crore in the corresponding period.  Meanwhile, of the total receipts of Rs 3,623 crore declared by the BJP for 2019-20, Rs 2,555 came from electoral bonds. Total contributions received by the ruling party totalled Rs 844 crore, of which Rs 291 crore came from individuals, Rs 238 crore from companies and organisations, Rs 281 crore from institutions and welfare bodies and Rs 33 crore from ‘others’. Aajiwan Sahayog Nidhi donations totalled Rs 23 crore, contributions from morchas were at Rs 5.03 crore and from meetings were at Rs 34 lakh. Applications fees fetched the BJP Rs 28 lakh, delegate fees Rs 1.29 crore and membership fees Rs 20.12 crore. Read AlsoProblem with electoral bondsDonor anonymity defeats the very purpose of transparency in political funding As part of its election expenditure, the BJP spent over Rs 400 crore on advertisements, almost double of the Rs 229 crore it spent in 2018-19. Spending on electronic media publicity totalled Rs 249 crore and that on print media Rs 47.38 crore, up from Rs 171.26 crore and Rs 20.32 crore respectively. The party also spent Rs 250.49 crore on air travel by its leaders and candidates, up from Rs 20.63 crore in 2018-19. The higher expenses on advertising and air travel may be explained by the fact that 2019-20 was also the Lok Sabha election year.  Financial assistance extended by the party to its candidates was Rs 198.27 crore in 2019-20, up from Rs 60.35 crore the year before.  A study of annual audit reports of other national parties for the year 2019-20 shows the total income of Congress at Rs 682 crore, Trinamool Congress at Rs 143.67 crore, CPM at Rs 158.62 crore, BSP at Rs 58.25 crore, NCP at 85.58 crore and CPI at Rs 6.58 crore. NCP annual audit report was also put out by EC on Monday.  Some regional parties matched the income of their national counterparts like the TRS whose total receipts of 2019-20 was Rs 130.46 crore, YSR Congress Party’s was Rs 92.73 crore, TDP’s was Rs 91.5 crore, BJD’s was Rs 90.35 crore and AIADMK’s was Rs 89 crore.

---||India||Criminal cases against MPs, MLAs see 17% jump in 2 years||NEW DELHI: Criminal cases pending against sitting and former MPs and MLAs registered a 17% jump in less than two years, evidencing the nexus of politics with crime, an abnormality the Supreme Court is struggling to curb despite its five-year endeavour to speed up the trials which are long-delayed by the money and muscle powers of elected representatives. On the eve of an SC bench led by Chief Justice N V Ramana resuming hearing after nine months on a PIL filed by Ashwini Upadhyay, seeking speedy trial in cases against MPs and MLAs by setting up of special courts, amicus curiae and senior advocate Vijay Hansaria has submitted a report painting a dismal picture of the status of trials against elected representatives. In the report submitted with assistance from advocate Sneha Kalita on Monday, Hansaria said the number of criminal cases pending against sitting and former MPs and MLAs in December 2018 was 4,122. This has increased to 4,859 in September 2020, registering a jump of 17% in less than two years,he said in the 54-page report. The central agencies, including the CBI, were repeatedly asked by the SC through its orders last year, on September 16, October 6 and November 4, to submit a status report of pending cases being investigated by these agencies. Hansaria said despite repeated directions, the Centre has submitted no such report. Hansaria also said the SC had been repeatedly asking the Union government about central funded video-conference facilities at the special courts, set up to exclusively try criminal cases against the present and former elected representatives, but it has not yet spelled out its decision on the issue. The amicus curiae highlighted a trend of state governments attempting to withdraw cases against their party MPs and MLAs, even those booked for serious offences. He said the UP government has sought to withdraw 76 cases against elected representatives, including the Muzaffarnagar riot cases against Sangeet Som, Kapil Dev, Suresh Rana and Sadhvi Prachi. Hansaria quoted a report published on December 17 last year on the move by the Maharashtra government to withdraw political cases against activists lodged prior to January 1, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/criminal-cases-against-mps-mlas-see-17-jump-in-2-years/articleshow/85196451.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||SC refuses to intervene on plea against making vaccine must||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to intervene on a plea that vaccinations should not be made mandatory, saying the steps were being taken by countries across the world to push vaccination and no measure should be taken that will fuel vaccine hesitancy. While agreeing to hear a PIL seeking disclosure of clinical trial data of Covid vaccines, the SC said doubts should not be created about vaccine efficacy without scientific proof as many people are already reluctant to take the shots key to contain the pandemic. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose issued notice to the Centre seeking response on a plea filed by former member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, Jacob Puliyel, for making public segregated data from the clinical trials. The bench refrained from passing any direction on other issues relating to vaccines, saying it may seed doubt in the minds of people. Advocate Prahant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, said he did not seek any direction to stop the vaccination drive, but it should not be made mandatory. He said though the government on paper is taking the stand that it is voluntary, authorities have passed various vaccine mandated directions which make vaccination virtually mandatory. The bench, however, said such practices were being adopted by various countries across the world to push vaccination and the court should not interfere at this stage. "Worldwide it is being done. We are facing a situation which we did not face in the last hundred years. As per World Health Organisation, vaccine hesitancy is one of the major problems facing the world. Would it not amount to throwing doubts in the mind of people if we pass any order," the bench said. Bhushan claimed vaccine hesitancy was among highly educated people with scientific knowledge and doubt about the efficacy of vaccines cannot be brushed aside and should be evaluated scientifically for which data was needed He also claimed there had been adverse impact of vaccines and more than 12,000 people died in the US. "In India, the manner in which vaccines have been licensed vitiates and even precludes the possibility that the vaccines can be evaluated objectively in the future. Under these circumstances the petitioner is forced to appeal to this court for public disclosure of trial data and post-vaccination data, as required by international medical norms," the petition said. Justice Rao, however, said he came to know that many doctors were saying that they were not aware on how the body would react to vaccines but said the court should not pass any order which creates more confusion as the situation is "very dangerous". "Nobody will be safe if everybody is not vaccinated and that is something that is being done across the world," the bench said while supporting government decision to push people to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-refuses-to-intervene-on-plea-against-making-vaccine-must/articleshow/85196483.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Return of commercial activities helped the worst hit sectors to join the recruitment action. Digitization is seen to be leading to addition of new jobs in tech and improving demand for freshers, said job portals and staffing firms.HR firm Teamlease’s data showed that new job postings grew around 20% in July. “IT, pharma, life sciences, biotech, FMCG, e-commerce & technology startups are on a hiring spree,” Kaushik Banerjee, VP and business head, Teamlease.com, said. “The hiring is going to increase further by 4%-7% from July. The fear of a third wave is there, but recruitments are in full swing given that most people in urban areas are partially / fully vaccinated,” he added. With over 2,90,000 active white-collar jobs, July overtook June to emerge as the strongest month for the current financial year and the closing figures for July ended more than double that of July 2020, specialist staffing firm Xpheno said in a monthly report. At 2,70,000 active openings, full-time opportunities were at an 18-month high, and a spike in active jobs was powered by entry-level roles that rose 16% in volume over June. Online portal Naukri.com’s analysis shows hiring activity is at an all-time high and surpassed pre-Covid levels in July. Naukri’s JobSpeak index grew by 11% month-on-month in July to touch 2,625- at its highest-ever level including pre-Covid timeline. Hiring activity doubled (108%) compared to year-ago period. Almost all sectors increased jobs in July including those hit by the pandemic as jobs in hospitality grew at 44%, travel at 42% and retail 17%, Naukri’s data showed. “July has provided conclusive proof of the revival of hiring activity in the country after a setback in April and May,” said Pawan Goyal, chief business officer, Naukri.com. “The most noteworthy and consistent growth over the last few months belongs to the IT/ITES sector and the tech functional area, which has stayed relatively insular to the effects of the pandemic,” he added. India Inc’s optimism for hiring in July to September is at a six-quarter high as per Dun & Bradstreet’s latest business optimism survey. 36% of respondents expect an increase in the size of their workforce employed during the period as compared to 28% in April to June. As per TimesJobs’ monthly recruitment indicator RecruiteX, overall talent demand grew 10% m-o-m in July with retail, FMCG and IT/BPO recording sharpest jumps at 30%, 29% and 23% respectively. Demand for talent is highest at fresher level (people with less than 2 years of work experience), RecruiteX data said.The festival season kicking in for several states will further improve the manpower demand in the consumer-led sectors in the coming months, Sanjay Goyal, business head, TimesJobs, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/job-market-sees-12-15-m-o-m-rise-in-july/articleshow/85191081.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The flood fear in the Gangetic basin has become acute. Further, moderate rainfall is expected till August 12. On Monday, the Ganga was flowing 31cm above the danger level at Buxar, 41cm above the red mark at Digha and 98cm above at Gandhi Ghat in Patna town, as well as 88cm at Hathidah in Patna district. The water level was also rising all along its downstream, including at Munger and Bhagalpur, and was flowing 71cm above the danger level at Kahalgaon, around 50km west of Farakka. The flood problem in the Ganga basin in Bihar is likely to accentuate in the next couple of days, as contrary to expectations, the water levels along its upper reaches in Uttar Pradesh (like at Allahabad and Varanasi) have gone high due to continued heavy rainfall in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and UP. Consequently, the Ganga water has been surging along its downstream in Bihar up to Farakka in West Bengal, where the water level was 61cm above the danger level. Similarly, Burhi Gandak and Bagmati have been also adding to the water of Kosi in Khagaria district. The Kosi, passing through north Bhagalpur district, falls into the Ganga near Kursela in Katihar district. Further, the catchment areas of several north Bihar rivers lying both in Nepal and Bihar – like of Kosi, Gandak, Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamla and Mahananda — are expected to receive moderate rainfall (15mm to 64mm) up to August 12. Similar rainfall forecast has also been made with regard to south Bihar districts and Jharkhand, where the catchment areas of rivers like Punpun and Sone also lie.

While private schools in the city witnessed 90% attendance on Day 1, less than 45% students attended offline classes in the government-run schools. All educational institutions had been shut since February in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. Ramashish Roy, the principal of DAV Public School-Khagaul, told this reporter that around 91% of the students had turned up on the first day. “It was a good start, much better than what we had expected. Six offline classes with 50% capacity were conducted along with online classes. While some teachers gave online classes, others delivered lectures in the classrooms,” he said. Roy added, “The morning assembly was conducted in different classrooms and a 10-minute lunch break given to the students.” The principal of Baldwin Academy, Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, pointed out that the students of classes IX and X were quite enthusiastic. “Since 90% of the students attended offline classes, we took all precautionary measures to check the spread of Covid-19. They were also given a 20-minute lunch break,” he added. Government schools, on the other hand, witnessed poor attendance. Meena Kumari, the principal of Bankipore Government Girls’ High School, claimed that only 15-20% of the pupils attended their classes on Day 1. Echoing similar views, the principal of Patna High School, Ravi Ranjan, said, “We witnessed poor attendance in classes IX and X, but expect that the turnout will improve in a week or two. All the teachers, staff and students followed social distancing norms strictly and wore face masks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-schools-in-patna-witness-poor-attendance-on-day-1/articleshow/85184370.cms||Faryal Rumi

The yellow metal has lost almost Rs 2,000 (per 10 gm) in the last two weeks. Gold futures on MCX were down 1.36%, or Rs 636, at Rs 46,004 per 10 gram. Silver futures tanked 1.92%, or Rs 1,2,48, lower at Rs 63,752 per kg. In Mumbai, spot gold price (24 carat) stood at Rs 46,690 per 10 grams and (22 carat) Rs 45,690 per 10 grams. The better than expected US jobs data had fueled the belief that the US Fed may start tightening the monetary policy earlier than expected. “High interest rates reduce the appeal for investment in gold. Also, an expectation of a quicker recovery in the US and global economy will reduce uncertainties and thereby investor’s appetite for gold,” says Nish Bhatt, founder & CEO of investment consulting firm Millwood Kane International. Rising inflation in some countries may force their respective central banks to tighten monetary policy, raise rates. “Going forward, the way countries control the spread of new variants of the virus, recovery in the global economy, the pace at which global central banks unwind their easy monetary policy regime will guide gold prices,” Bhatt added. Ravindra Rao, VP and head of commodity research at Kotak Securities says, “Weighing on the gold price is increased expectations of Fed’s monetary tightening post US non-farm payrolls data and some hawkish comments by Fed officials.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gold-price-falls-to-a-one-month-low/articleshow/85191024.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Hearing a petition filed by social activist Vatti Vasanth Kumar, the bench comprising NGT chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel, Justices Sudhir Agarwal and Brijesh Sethi and expert member Nagin Nanda criticised the Union environment ministry and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for failing to act against environmental violations. The bench sought to know from the AP government what action was being taken while the cofferdam of Polavaram project was flooding. “Why there is so much negligence while Polavaram is flooding. If the water inundates the houses of the residents, they will lose everything,” the bench said while addressing the counsel representing AP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ngt-flays-inaction-against-erring-babus/articleshow/85189440.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Civic officials have come up with these figures in its survey to find out the vaccination status of residents. As per figures available, roughly about 6.7 lakh people live within the BMC jurisdiction area, which means over three lakh have still not taken even one jab. BMC officials said according to estimates, BMC has administered close to 1 lakh doses — comprising both first and second. “Rough estimates say another 2 lakh doses have been given by Bidhannagar sub-divisional hospital and private hospitals in BMC combined. Of this, the number of fully vaccinated people should be close to a lakh,” said a BMC official. Civic officials, however, said these were rough estimates as there are many, including domestic helps, caregivers, hawkers, street vendors and others who are not technically residents of BMC, who are being inoculated for working in the township,” said a civic official. Officials said vaccination camps are being held across Bidhannagar where, on an average, around 2,500 to 3,000 people are getting vaccinated daily. “We are conducting the drive depending on the availability of vaccines,” an official said. The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is also carrying out a survey to ascertain how many residents are yet to get vaccinated. The authorities have so far inoculated about 40,000 people, including residents and others from nearby villages. “Most of the gated community residents have at least received their first dose, but there might be a considerable number of block residents who are yet to be inoculated. We are asking residents’ welfare associations to send us lists of persons who are yet to be inoculated. On an average, around 200 people are being vaccinated from the two centres every day, according to availability of vaccines,” said an NKDA official. However, the drive-in vaccination facility introduced in Eco Park and the multi-storey parking complex in Sector V in the last week of June has been withdrawn as mostly people from outside were driving in and the authorities could not cope with the demand. In Sector V, Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority is vaccinating IT and other private firm employees in batches at the camp at Nabadiganta Bhavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/20-in-bmc-get-both-jabs-50-not-even-one/articleshow/85191600.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The government, however, reiterated that it would like to wait for further communication from the Union Jal Shakti ministry before sharing details of the projects for which it has reservations and sought amendments in the principal notification. The two boards, which held an emergency meeting in Hyderabad on Monday, directed the governments of AP and Telangana to comply with the notification issued by the Union Jal Shakti ministry and ready the organisational roadmap as they wanted to enforce the notification as per schedule. The board chiefs stated that the ministry has already requested the Union home ministry to spare personnel from CISF to oversee the safety and security of the irrigation projects in Krishna and Godavari basins in the Telugu states. KRMB chairman MP Singh and his GRMB counterpart J Chandrasekhara Iyer presided over the joint session in Hyderabad, which was attended by AP irrigation secretary J Syamala Rao and engineer-in-chief C Narayana Reddy. Their counterparts from Telangana skipped the crucial meeting. Though Rajath Kumar, special chief secretary (water resources) of Telengana, had requested the meeting to be rescheduled to another date, the boards went ahead with the schedule stating that they are left with just one week to ready the blueprint for implementation of the gazette notification. It was decided in the meeting that the boards have to put in place the organisational structure within a month after the release of the gazette notification which would expire by August, 15. The notification would come into force from October 15. AP expressed its willingness to provide all details sought by the board chiefs. Irrigation secretary Rao assured to share the information regarding the projects as per clauses 1(j) and 1(k) for which they have no reservations. He said they would approach the Centre for modifications on the other clauses. AP officials also informed the board chiefs that the issue of releasing seed money of 200 crore to each board is under the examination of the government and a call on the same would be taken shortly.

The special investigation team (SIT) constituted by Munger SP J J Reddy on Monday arrested four people, including a sorcerer (tantrik), on charges of killing the minor girl and performing rituals to avoid miscarriage of an expectant mother. The SP said one Dilip Kumar, a resident of Padham village under Naya Ramnagar police station area of the district, was suggested by a sorcerer, Parvez Alam, to sacrifice a girl to avoid miscarriage of his pregnant wife. “Dilip’s wife had conceived after many unsuccessful years of pregnancy. Hence, he acted on the suggestion of the tantrik from neighbouring Khagaria district, which led to the gruesome killing of the minor girl,” the SP said. During investigation, it came to light that the tantrik had advised that the expectant mother should wear an amulet consecrated with blood and eyes of a virgin blood for which Dilip consulted his co-resident, Tanveer Alam. Tanveer had introduced Dilip with the sorcerer. He took the help of his associate Dasarath, who made arrangements for performing rituals at his poultry farm located at Pardah village. SHO of Safiabad police outpost Gaurav Kumar said the girl was picked up while returning home alone after delivering lunch to her father, a fisherman. She was then killed and her eyes were gouged out. Later, the tantrik made an amulet which Dilip’s wife wore around her neck. The police initially arrested Dilip, Tanveer and Dasarath. Later the sorcerer, Parvez Alam, was taken into custody from Khagaria district. “The police cracked the case based on evidence,” the SP said. The police had recovered some articles from the spot where the girl was sacrificed. Earlier, the police had registered a case of murder and suspected rape as marks of injury were found on the girl’s private parts. The SP said the case would be listed for speedy trial as all the accused have been arrested. “Instructions have been issued to submit the chargesheet in the case at the earliest,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/police-nab-4-say-munger-minor-girl-was-sacrificed/articleshow/85183835.cms||Ramashankar

Police said the accused was earlier associated with a Maoist group. Das was arrested after his neighbour Shakuntala Devi accused him of killing her goat in an inebriated state on Sunday. According to the police complaint, Shakuntala’s goat was tied to an electric pole in front of her house. Das, a habitual drunkard, held the goat with his arms, causing severe injuries around its neck. The goat later died. When Shakuntala’s husband Sudama Sao tried to intervene, the accused not only hurled abuses on him but also attempted to hurt him in full public view. Aurangabad SP Kantesh Mishra said Das was arrested under relevant sections of IPC and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. He was also charged with violating the state’s prohibition law. SHO of Goh police station Md Shamim Ahmad said Das was earlier involved in Maoist activities in Aurangabad district. “He was also evading arrest in several Maoist violence cases,” he revealed. The body of the goat was handed over to its owner after post mortem at the veterinary hospital at Goh. “The postmortem report is still awaited,” the SHO said. Sources said if pronounced guilty under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 the accused may be punished with fine up to Rs 100.

The court initiated suo moto contempt proceedings against eight IAS officers. Seven out of eight officers appeared before the court. The court observed that 90% of the officials in the state are of the view that implementing court orders is not their responsibility. The court had earlier directed the state government not to construct any buildings like village or ward secretariats and Rythu Bharosa Kendras on the premises of government schools. Disposing of a petition seeking directions to prevent officials from constructing village secretariat in Visakhapatnam district, the high court had passed an order in June 2020, stating that no constructions should not be made in any of the school in the state, other than that are intended for school purpose. The court issued directions to panchayatraj, municipal administration and education departments in this regard. After the court passed the order, similar petitions were filed before the high court from Nellore, Kurnool and Visakhapatnam districts. Taking suo moto cognisance of the issue, the court initiated contempt proceedings and summoned the officials concerned for appearance.

---||Business||SAT split verdict stalls PNBHF’s deal with Carlyle||Mumbai: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has delivered a split verdict in the appeal filed by PNB Housing Finance (PNBHF) against an order by Sebi that stayed a preferential allotment to private equity investors led by Carlyle for not appointing an external valuer. “After today’s split SAT order, Sebi’s order dated June 18, 2021 remains intact and so the SAT’s interim order — prohibiting PNBHF from disclosing the results of the EGM vote — stands. Therefore, the parties will have to appeal to the Supreme Court for the dispute to come to a logical conclusion,” said DSK Legal partner Harvinder Singh. This would mean that the Rs 4,000-crore preferential allotment to Carlyle Group and other investors at Rs 390 per share cannot be completed. PNBHF’s share, which touched a high of Rs 924 on June 8, closed 2% lower at Rs 693 on Monday. In his order, the presiding officer of the tribunal, justice Tarun Agarwala, noted that there cannot be two sets of procedure for valuation of the price of the shares — one for a company that has a provision in its Articles of Association calling for a registered valuer, and another for a listed company with no such stipulation. “Having two different procedures, in our opinion, would run counter to the provisions of Section 62(1)(c) of the Companies Act read with Rule 13 of the Rules of 2014 read with Section 6 and 24 of the Companies Act,” the order said. Justice Agarwala ordered the letter issued by Sebi general manager dated June 18 be quashed and allowed the appeal directing PNBHF to declare the results of the EGM, which was held on June 22, 2021 Judicial member, Justice M T Joshi, however, took a different view. “In the corporate world, while the memorandum of association is recognised as the constitution of a company, its Articles of Association provide the mechanism for implementation of the constitution,” said Justice Joshi in his order. PNBHF did not respond to a request for comments. “In my view, there can be two methods of valuation of the shares and the higher of the valuation would be the valuation of the shares for the purpose of preferential allotment of the shares, which ultimately would be the price for an open offer under the SAST Regulations to the general shareholders, giving them an opportunity to exit,” the order said. Given the split verdict, the parties will need to appeal to a higher court to resolve the dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sat-split-verdict-stalls-pnbhfs-deal-with-carlyle/articleshow/85192120.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh high court reserves its orders on validity of SEC appointment||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Monday reserved orders in the petition filed challenging the appointment of Nilam Sawhney as state election commissioner. The petitioner contended that the appointment of Sawhney was made in contrary to Supreme Court’s directions. One Regu Maheswara Rao from Vizianagaram district had moved the court seeking to quash the GO issued by the state government appointing Sawhney as SEC. Rao also sought the court to issue a writ of quo warranto against her to show the authority to hold the office of SEC. The petitioner’s counsel B Sesibushan Rao argued that when the apex court has clearly stated that the post of SEC should be given to an independent person, in the present case it was given to someone whose name was recommended by the chief minister. Sawhney is not independent person as she was given the role of advisor to the government immediately after her retirement as chief secretary, Rao said, adding further that she resigned as advisor only to join as SEC, which shows she is not an independent person but has a close association with the chief minister. Senior counsel CV Mohan Reddy, arguing for the governor’s secretary, countered the arguments, stating that the governor considered 11 names before zeroing on Sawhney. It was only incidental that her name was also there in the list of three names sent by the CM. He argued that the petition is not maintainable and liable to be dismissed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-reserves-its-orders-on-validity-of-sec-appointment/articleshow/85189273.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Singarayakonda mandal in Prakasam district posted a worrying 44% positivity rate on August 8, while Alamuru in East Godavari reported a 26% positivity rate. Nearly 21% of all samples tested on August 8 turned out to be positive n Kadiyam mandal in the disease epicentre East Godavari. Of the 14 mandals that recorded at least a 10% case positivity rate on August 8, seven are from East Godavari and four are from Prakasam. Even on August 7, 19 mandals of East Godavari were in the top-20 mandal list in the state in terms of positivity rate. When it comes to urban local bodies, Ongole from Prakasam district once again tops the charts with a 17% positivity rate, followed by another urban local body in the same district Addanki (15.3% positivity rate). Jaggaiahpeta in Krishna district and Visakhapatnam urban local bodies recorded an over 10% positivity rate. Despite the steady positivity rate and daily infections, East Godavari continues to be a major Covid-19 hotspot. With a nearly 8% positivity rate in the last week, it is the sole district in the state currently recording an over 5% positivity rate. Even on the cumulative case positivity rate front, East Godavari has recorded a 12% case positivity rate to emerge as the only district with a double-digit case positivity rate. State Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said the health department is taking all measures to curb the spread of the disease in East Godavari. “Several factors may have been at work. East Godavari is marked by a blend of rural, urban and tribal areas with towns at almost every 20 km distance. The population density and migrations may be the reasons behind the increase in cases in the district,” said Dr Rambabu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/several-mandals-in-eg-log-over-10-positivity/articleshow/85188844.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The district administration had shifted all the interstate and intercity buses from the Mithapur bus stand to the new ISBT on July 31. However, people are finding it difficult to reach the IBST to catch their buses. As per the plan, there will be three separate zones for interstate, north Bihar-bound and south Bihar-bound buses. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said based on the number of buses plying from the new ISBT, a plan will be made to streamline the bus operations. “The parking bays will be divided into zones for the convenience of passengers. The timing will also be set for the departure and arrival of buses. The step will avoid chaos as the bus operators currently park their vehicles as per their convenience,” he said. About 1,600 interstate and local buses have been operating from the ISBT located at Mauza Pahadi on Patna-Gaya road. The DM said radium stickers would be installed to guide the passengers to their respective buses. “Additional space will be created for the parking of at least 150 more buses. Bus operators can also use this parking space for overnight stay. The bus operations will be regularised in the next two weeks,” Singh said. Praveen Kundan, deputy collector and nodal officer for ISBT, said passengers often complain that some bus drivers park their vehicles near the main gate, thereby blocking entry and exit for other buses. “To avoid this, we have decided to create zones for buses of different routes. When the city bus service will start from the ISBT, a separate zone will be created. Besides, one more gate will be ready by August 12. Once the new gate becomes functional, there will be separate gates for entry and exit of buses,” Kundan said, adding three helpdesks have also been set up at the ISBT for the convenience of passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-district-admn-bid-to-streamline-bus-operations-at-isbt/articleshow/85184689.cms||Faryal Rumi

His friend, Bikram Yadav (21), was also injured in the firing. Ritu was shot by the members of a rival group allegedly led by one Tuntun Tiger near Mehsauri Chowk where he had gone with his friend for some work. Though the bullets hit Ritu’s hands, he succumbed to his injuries at a local hospital. A bullet also hit his friend Bikram, who is undergoing treatment. Jamui superintendent of police Pramod Kumar Mandal said four people have been named as accused in the FIR lodged by Ritu’s father Vinod Kumar with the Town police station. The statement of the injured has also been recorded. Ritu’s father, who runs a PDS shop, said his son had differences with some youths of Bodhvan Talab locality in the town. “He was shot from a close range,,” Kumar said. Police have detained three suspects for interrogation in connection with the incident. “Raids are on to nab the named accused,” the SP said. Surprisingly, the prime accused, Tuntun Tiger, took to a social media platform to declare a war of attrition against his arch rival. “Bhale hi aaj jail hoga, kal bail hoga aur parso phir wahi khel hoga. Mujhe halke mein mat lena,” he posted on a social media platform. A police officer said Tuntun was released from jail recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/youth-shot-dead-over-love-affair-in-jamui/articleshow/85190207.cms||Ramashankar
---||Agra||UP CM says there was shortage of oxygen supply during second Covid wave||Agra: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday admitted that there was indeed shortage of oxygen supply during the peak of Covid second wave. Earlier, in April, the UP CM had categorically denied any crisis of oxygen in any public or private Covid hospital in the state. Addressing a group of doctors in Agra on Sunday, the CM said, “Shortage of oxygen supply was noticed during the second wave… usually resources fall short during the pandemic… and this was the century’s largest pandemic, but the government worked on a war footing to provide oxygen cylinders to every district.” The CM further said that oxygen plants are being set up in every district of the state. “Around 300 plants have already been established out of the total 552,” he said, adding that the remaining will be completed soon. In April, as people faced oxygen shortage in every part of the country, Yogi Adityanath speaking during a virtual interaction with editors of different newspapers had said, “There is no shortage of oxygen in any Covid hospital, be it private or government. The problem is black marketing and hoarding, which will be tackled with a heavy hand. We are going to conduct an oxygen audit in collaboration with IIT Kanpur, IIM Lucknow and IIT BHU for proper monitoring of oxygen. The system of live tracking of oxygen demand, supply and distribution will be implemented.” Adityanath had also said that oxygen was not in short supply provided only the needy use it. “Every infected patient does not need oxygen, cooperation is expected from the media in increasing awareness about this,” he had said. He had also acknowledged that there were some initial problems in increasing the number of hospital beds in the state but they were quickly overcome.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-cm-says-there-was-shortage-of-oxygen-supply-during-second-covid-wave/articleshow/85188721.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Business||Salesforce shifts data to local servers||MUMBAI: Salesforce, a company that provides businesses with cloud-based applications for customer service, has moved its data to a domestic data centre. This is expected to significantly expand the market for the company in India as some regulators, like the RBI, insist on data localisation. Speaking to TOI, Salesforce India chairperson and CEO Arundhati Bhattacharya said that the trend of moving applications to the cloud has accelerated during the pandemic. Two sectors that have made big moves towards cloud applications are edtech and financial services. Salesforce has added 1,000 employees in recent months, taking its headcount in the country to 5,000. “There used to be a mistaken notion that storing data on-premises is safer. That is now changing and even government IT solutions like CoWin are now cloud-based,” said Bhattacharya. According to Bhattacharya, customers have come to expect the AI- (artificial intelligence-) driven experience that they get on large e-commerce platforms. She points out that the huge quantity of data that is required for machine learning is only possible on common cloud platforms. Also, businesses are realising that they need some elasticity in the IT capability as sales shoot up on certain days and this flexibility is provided by cloud-based systems. Salesforce, whose mainstay is customer relationship management (CRM), is seeing a big growth opportunity since the pandemic. A survey done by the company of consumers revealed that 68% of them had heightened expectations over digital capabilities from the brands they use. According to Bhattacharya, private banks and finance companies have been the early adopters and some have managed to triple the value of existing customer relationships using CRM. She added that for public sector banks, this could level the playing field as it provides them with a comprehensive view of their customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/salesforce-shifts-software-to-local-servers/articleshow/85192250.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||Bihar: Poster with Tej Pratap’s photograph replaced outside RJD office||PATNA: The controversy over the RJD poster put up outside the party headquarters here continued as the one showing Tej Pratap prominently on Sunday was brought down on Monday and replaced by the older poster with the pictures of only his younger brother and leader of the opposition in state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, and their parents, Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi. Uproar started on Sunday when an event was organized by Chhatra RJD and big posters, in which Tejashwi was missing and Tej was shown prominently along with Lalu and Rabri, were put up outside the party office. Tej is the patron of Chhatra RJD and was the chief guest of the event. Even Chhatra RJD state president Aakash Yadav was shown in the the posters. Apart from the poster controversy, Tej used the event to renew his attack on RJD’s state president Jagadanand Singh by comparing him with Hitler. Tej was so angry with Singh that he said “kursi kisi ki bapauti nahi hai” (the party president’s chair is not anyone’s fiefdom). He reacted over the way the party's office gate was being kept locked since Singh took charge as the RJD state president. When asked about this poster war and tension in the RJD first family, party’s state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said, “There is no war and these are all media stories. Tej Pratap ji has made clear about his love for his younger brother and how it is important to have a person in his heart and not just on posters. As far as changing of posters is concerned, the poster put by the Chhatra RJD was for a particular event and the party put back the old poster after that.” However, some senior RJD leaders expressed discontent over the way Tej mistreated Singh, a person of high stature and also close to his father Lalu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/poster-with-tejs-photograph-replaced-outside-rjd-office/articleshow/85190280.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The group spends its earnings to prepare and distribute the meals. Those in need can visit any of the three areas of town—Seven Roads Junction, Surya Mahal and Day and Night Junction—and pick up a food packet. The concept of such a food bank came about after members of the group noticed the hesitation of some people who were unwilling to wait in line for food, in the prevailing Covid-19 situation. Everyday, around 250 food packets are distributed by the organisers of Daddy Helping Foundation, started by a taxi driver Srinivasa Rao, an autorickshaw driver G Suryanarayana and a handful of other members. The initiative was launched in April this year. “Initially, we faced a lot of problems. No one came forward to help us with the cooking. I prepared the food at my house with the help of the other members. We have 20 members, most of them are daily wage workers,” Srinivasa Rao said. Now, as their intiative grows, others are coming forward to donate essential commodities to the organisation. Some donated rice and other essential material on special occasions. G Suryanarayana said they are providing rice, two curries and curd to 150 people for lunch and 105 people for dinner. “When we started distribution, many people did not come forward to take food distributed in the lockdown as they felt shy to stand in line. We discussed this and planned to keep food at one place, so people could come and take away the food without anyone’s interference,” he said. The foundation even brought two ambulances with the donations. One has been kept in service free of cost within a 20-km radius while the other has been kept for Covid-19 patients and deceased persons. Those in need of ambulance services will have to bear fuel expenses and pay a token amount to the driver, foundation members said, adding that the needy would not be charged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/daily-wagers-pool-pay-to-set-up-food-bank/articleshow/85189045.cms||Siva G

---||Business||You can soon buy Google, Apple shares on NSE IFSC||MUMBAI: Indian investors will soon be able to buy and sell shares of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other US-listed companies through NSE’s GIFT City arm in the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Gujarat. NSE International Exchange (NSE IFSC) on Monday said it has set up infrastructure for Indian investors to buy US stocks and broker registration is under way. The arrangement will allow fractional ownership of US stocks for these investors, who would need to open demat accounts with entities based in GIFT City. Currently, Indian investors buy US stocks through designated online brokers who have the permission from US and Indian regulators. These brokers allow ownership of up to one-millionth of a US stock. The concept of fractional ownership is popular has been prevalent for racing horses, yachts, aeroplanes and other high-value assets. Recent tech innovations now allow such ownership in US shares too, industry executives said. The entire trading, clearing, settlement and holding of US stocks will be under the regulatory purview of the IFSC Authority, a release from NSE IFSC said. IFSC Authority has facilitated the offering under its regulatory sandbox where the fund transfers for buying will be through the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the RBI, it said. At present, every Indian is allowed to remit up to $250,000 annually under the LRS. However, the usage of the funds remitted under LRS has certain restrictions, including that it cannot be used for leveraging. Hence, investors sending money abroad through this route cannot use the fund for investing or trading in any derivatives product. However, investing in stocks directly, in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), fixed-income products and mutual funds is allowed, market players said. NSE IFSC Clearing Corporation will undertake clearing and settlement of all these trades in depository receipts and also provide settlement guarantee. Additionally, these trades will be covered under NSE IFSC’s investor protection framework, the company said. Speaking about the initiative, GIFT City MD & group CEO Tapan Ray said the place was emerging as a financial gateway of a country for investing in India and abroad. “The ecosystem of international banks, international exchanges and capital market intermediaries has been growing rapidly at GIFT City,” he said. Ray believes that introducing this innovative product, which gave Indians the option to invest in US stocks through GIFT City, was conceived at the right time. “We have seen over a period of time that Indians have started investing in global stocks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/you-can-soon-buy-google-apple-shares-on-nse-ifsc/articleshow/85192014.cms||---

Arvind Chauhan, 24, had joined the Indian Army in 2017. His father and grandfather retired from the army while his elder brother is currently a serving member. The soldier's family was informed about Arvind's death in Rajouri garrison, late on Sunday. The deceased's uncle, Satish Chauhan, said Arvind had interacted with his elder brother via a WhatsApp video call in the afternoon, hours before his death. "We were informed about his death on Sunday. But, the circumstances under which Arvind died is still unclear. The body is being brought to the village,” Chauhan added. According to sources, the defence ministry has ordered a “court of inquiry” to investigate the circumstances leading to the jawan's death. Jammu and Kashmir police are also investigating the matter. Additional district magistrate Vivek Kumar Mishra said, “The soldier's body will be reaching his village on Tuesday. It is located in Bijori under Kotwali Dehat police station. We are yet to receive any orders for the protocol accorded to a soldier in cases of natural or accidental death on duty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/24-year-old-army-jawan-from-etah-found-dead-at-duty-station-in-jk/articleshow/85188754.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Kolkata||Over 100 Kolkata municipal corporation vaccination units shut today, tomorrow||KOLKATA: Over 100 KMC-operated Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) that had reopened on Monday after a three-day closure will again be shut on Tuesday and Wednesday after the civic health depart-ment on Monday ran out of Covishield stock after administering barely 30,000 doses. The centres may reopen on Thursday if fresh stock arrives. “During Monday’s vaccination drive, our entire stock was exhausted. The queue for the second dose at the 102 CVCs and 50 mega centres is growing longer everyday. As of Monday evening, there are 1.5 lakh first-dose recipients who are now due to get the second dose. By Wednesday, this figure will cross 2 lakh as we don’t have any stock to give jabs on Tuesday and Wednesday,” a civic health department official said. KMC currently has over 36,000 doses of Covaxin, which will last for at least three days. A couple of weeks ago, the civic health department had faced a Covaxin supply crisis as well. But that is now over. It is Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India in Pune, that has now emerged as a major worry because an overwhelming majority of citizens had been administered Covishield when they took the first jab. KMC officials said after the Covishield second-dose backlog is cleared, the civic body will need around 35,000 doses daily to meet the demand. The development comes at a time when researchers have claimed that mixing Covaxin and Covishield doses will not reduce the vaccines’ effectiveness. However, many are sceptical and may not agree to a cocktail of vaccines even if the Union health ministry issues a notification to that effect. A health official said the scepticism is not misplaced given that the Centre had suddenly increased the gap between the first and second doses of Covishield from 4-6 weeks in March to 6-8 weeks in April, and then again to 12-16 weeks in May, claiming that this was following studies that had proved a longer time between the two doses would make the vaccine more effective. However, a section of researchers claimed the only reason why the gap was increased was to buy time to manufacture more vaccines for the second dose. KMC health officials said they hoped to receive a large consignment of Covishield soon to tide over the crisis. While the civic body was planning to change the ratio of first and second doses, which had been heavily skewed in favour of the latter to meet the second-dose demand, the crisis will force the civic body to abandon any such thoughts and continue to allocate a bulk of the vaccines to second-dose recipients when fresh stock arrives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/over-100-kmc-vax-units-shut-today-tomorrow/articleshow/85191526.cms||Saikat Ray

The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar permitted the transfer by allowing a petition (MJC) filed by the state government last year, urging that an old order of a bench of Justice SN Hussain passed in 2007 be modified where direction had been given that the entire park west of Patna Junction, divided in northern and southern side, be developed for use by common people. On Monday, the bench simultaneously disposed of a PIL filed by advocate Shambhu Sharan Singh in 2015 where he had prayed that order be given to the government to develop the entire park as no action had been taken till date in the light of the 14-year-old judgement. Singh had also opposed the government’s petition for modifying the old order. The court, however, praised Singh’s constructive role in the entire matter. Advocate general Lalit Kishore had submitted that 16.31 acres of the northern part of the park had already been developed for use by common people, but the southern part just beside the rail tracks, be allowed to be transferred to railways, which needs it for the development of Patna Junction. Kishore had also apprised the high court that in lieu of transfer of this plot, railways in principle has agreed to hand over to the state 19 acres of its track land from Patna Sahib to Patna Ghat in Patna City (western Patna), on which a road would be built for better transportation, and nine more acre land having tracks in Khagaul (western Patna), on which an elevated pathway would be constructed in future. Kishore had submitted that the state was ready to pay the additional price of the land to railways after complete evaluation. Altogether 24.3 acre land was acquired by the British government to build a park for Lord Hardinge when he had reached here to lay the foundation for the Patna high court in 1913. The land, earlier managed by Hardinge Memorial Fund Trust, first got divided into two parts with construction of a drainage then into three parts with road construction. In 1953, the trust gave around 1.48 acre land to Postal department where it developed some infrastructure, which still exists. The entire park land was taken over by the state government from the trust in 2005 on grounds that it was misusing and destroying the property. It was then that the trust challenged the takeover in the high court, but the bench of Justice Hussain ruled in favour of the government in 2007 with direction to develop the entire park area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-allows-bihar-govt-to-hand-over-hardinge-park-land-to-railways/articleshow/85184576.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Though the tree fell on the engine, a major accident was averted as the alert loco pilot stopped the train in time and only the overhead electric wire on the track was damaged. Movement of trains remained affected for around four hours on the Varanasi-Audihar route, railway officials said. North East Railway Varanasi division spokesman Ashok Kumar said, “The uprooted tree fell on the engine of Bapudham Express train near pole number 191 along Piyari village area between Sarnath and Kadipur railway stations. Except for damaging a glass window of the engine of the train, the tree did not cause any major harm. However, as the overhead electric wire was damaged, a diesel engine was arranged to take the train forward.” “The accident affected the train movement for almost four hours,” he said adding, After repair of the overhead wire, the train movement normalised on the Varanasi-Audihar route by afternoon.” Reports said after leaving Banaras (Manduadih) railway station at 7.30 am, the 12538 Bapudham Superfast Express train had crossed Sarnath railway station. When it was passing through Piyari village, a train fell on its engine after damaging the overhead wire. After breaking a glass window, the parts of tree also fell on the railway track. Acting promptly, the loco pilot stopped the train avoiding any further harm. On being alerted, the NER officials reached the spot immediately and a diesel engine was arranged to take the train forward. After it, the process of clearing the track and repairing of overhead wire was initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/tree-falls-on-moving-bapudham-expmajor-accident-averted-by-loco-pilot/articleshow/85189663.cms||---

He said due to the lack of facilities and opportunities, sportspersons of Bihar either move to other states for training or parents do not permit their wards to choose this field. “During Olympics, people of Bihar enjoyed like other countrymen. They were happy for India’s win and also felt sad when we lost. But one thing which is hitting each and every Bihar native is that in spite of having a population of 13 crore, we did not have a single representation in this world level sports event,” said Tejashwi. He gave the example of 1996 cricket World Cup match organized in Bihar, which he said was the last international match played in the state. He also cited the examples of other states, which promote sports culture and give job opportunities to sportspersons. “Smaller states like Manipur, Punjab and Haryana are doing much better than Bihar in the field of sports. In fact, Haryana and Punjab give government jobs and promotions to sportspersons who bring laurels to the state. Even in Bihar, we have sports quota in jobs, but only people close to the government get benefited,” he alleged. Tejashwi recalled the promises made by his party in its manifesto for the 2020 assembly elections. It included formation of a Sports Policy. “I am thankful to the state government for analysing our manifesto and giving nod to a sports university which was mentioned in it,” he said. JD(U) state spokesperson and former captain of Patna University volleyball team, Ranbir Nandan, hit back at Tejashwi saying the RJD leader should better recall the condition of sports during his parents’ regime. “Munna Mustaq, who was the minister in-charge of sports when Lalu Prasad was the CM, used to call himself a minister with nil budget,” said Nandan, adding, “We are thankful to our CM Nitish Kumar for putting all efforts for improving sports infrastructure in Bihar. Now our state will be among the selected few states of the country to have a sports university.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-blames-bihar-govt-for-no-representation-in-olympics/articleshow/85189973.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Following the initiative taken by Gaya forest division, two incense stick production units have been established at Dhungeshwari. Divisional forest officer Abhishek Kumar said Dhungeshwari would be developed as a model site for ecotourism and eco products’ production centre. “An eco-cafeteria has also been established at Dhungeshwari. Local men and women, who had been imparted a five-day training on hospitality, have been engaged at the eco-cafeteria,” he added. Dhungeshwari hill is located around 12km north-east of Bodh Gaya. Here exists an ancient cave, also known as the Mahakala cave. It is believed that before attaining enlightenment under the banyan (peepal) tree in Bodh Gaya, Lord Buddha had visited Dhungeshwari hills. Therefore, a large number of Buddhist devotees and tourists visit the hills. Apart from the incense stick units at Dhungeshwari, five units of biodegradable sanitary napkins have been set up at Dhungeshwari, Pretshila, Bankebazar, Suhail and Barabar. These units will be run by the forest management committee, a democratically elected body of villages in and around forest areas. The DFO said, “The biodegradable sanitary napkin units have generated permanent employment for 50 households. These napkins, when thrown after use, decompose and make the soil rich in macro and micronutrients. These units will distribute napkins for free to forest-dwelling women to promote menstrual hygiene. There is also a proposal to supply these napkins to Kasturba residential schools and women ITIs across the state.” There is also a plan to establish a neem oil production unit at Atri range of the division. The neem seeds will be processed for production of oil. So far, around 15,000kg neem seeds have been collected through different forest management committees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/flower-waste-being-used-to-make-incense-sticks-here/articleshow/85184134.cms||---

Transplantation, however, is yet to begin after the section was recently discovered to be a ‘deemed’ forest under the Delhi forest and wildlife department. A deemed forest is an expanse with more than 250 trees growing per hectare. With the categorisation of the IGNCA plot as such, permission now has to be obtained under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, to transplant or fell trees. Forest officials in Delhi said such a permission can only be availed of from the central government. The Central Public Works Department will need to send a fresh project proposal to be able to transplant the displaced trees. A forest official revealed that transplantation was yet to begin on the site despite a list prepared for the shifting of 1,838 trees. While it is easier to get permission to prune, fell or transplant a tree under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, the process is stricter when it relates to a forest. “CPWD had submitted a list of trees to be transplanted, complete with their height and details of the species. That work is yet to commence because an inspection of the site later qualified it as a deemed forest area,” the official explained. Navneet Srivastava, deputy conservator of forest (West), under whose jurisdiction the IGNCA site falls, confirmed the development. “Upon checking, we found the site met the criteria for a deemed forest and informed CPWD. Fresh permission will have to be sought under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and felling or transplanting trees under that law is not as easy,” said Srivastava. The forest department said that the new request had to be sent to the central government, with the Delhi department required to pass on the project details once CPWD reapplied for permission. “We have received the fresh request and a proposal will now be submitted to the Centre,” said an official. The project details show that 1,838 trees of 60 species are to be relocated. The most abundant species at the site were Gular (172), Shahtoot (114) and Pipal and Ashok (112 each). Eco activist Bhavreen Kandhari said she wrote a letter to the DCF (West) requesting an inspection of the site to ascertain where it was a deemed forest or a part of the morphological Ridge area. “If it is indeed a deemed forest, then it is strange how the permissions to transplant were given in the first place. We have sought details of all the trees being transplanted,” said Kandhari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-transplant-nod-for-ignca-trees-yet/articleshow/85193427.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The death has made doctors worried about a possible rise in swine flu cases amidst the fears of a third Covid wave. The woman was initially admitted at a nursing home in Phoolbagan where swine flu was confirmed. She was shifted to ID Hospital when her condition deteriorated. “She was on BiPap when she was brought to us with dangerously low oxygen saturation. Her condition was so bad that she died even before we could start treating her,” said a doctor at the hospital. While state health department officials were relieved at the other two patients testing negative, a section of private hospital doctors warned that H1N1cases have already started rising. “We had two patients with symptoms of both swine flu and Covid. Their reports have come negative for both. They are now stable,” said ID Hospital principal Anima Haldar. Though stray cases of swine flu are not uncommon around this time of the year, what concerns health officials is that the rise in number could coincide with the Covid third wave. At ID Hospital, the non-Covid ICU is currently being used to treat suspected H1N1 cases. The hospital administration has decided to monitor the trend for the next few days. “In case we see the number of suspected cases rising, we will have to arrange a ward to isolate and treat them,” said Haldar. H1N1 virus and its non-swine flu variants are fast turning into an epidemic in Kolkata, according to CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. The hospital, Dhar said, has been receiving 10 such cases a week and these are just the severe ones. Symptoms, including respiratory distress, fever, body ache and weakness, are common to Covid, but RT-PCR tests and scans are ruling out Covid in most cases. Dhar added that since swine flu tests are expensive, treatment is symptomatic in most cases. “Our microbiologists believe that a majority of those reporting with symptoms have swine flu,” he said. Once H1N1 strikes, there is a 30%-40% chance of other family members getting affected, said doctors. The modes of transmission are similar to Covid. H1N1 transmission happens in two ways — through droplets released by the patient during coughing and sneezing, and by contact with the patients’ clothes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/years-first-swine-flu-death-sparks-concern-amid-3rd-cov-wave-fears/articleshow/85191655.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

With the stock market rallying to new highs at regular intervals, monthly systematic investment plan (SIP) flows also recorded a new high of Rs 9,609 crore, data from fund industry trade body AMFI showed. In addition, July set records for several other MF heads. These include retail SIP accounts at nearly 4.2 crore, total assets under SIPs at over Rs 5 lakh crore, retail assets under management (AUM) at Rs 16.3 lakh crore, net retail flows at Rs 40,302 crore and net flows into equity funds at Rs 22,584 crore, a note from AMFI said. According to AMFI chief executive N S Venkatesh, the RBI’s accommodative stance, healthier earnings growth, vaccination-driven steady containment of the pandemic and global & domestic liquidity helped equity markets to historic highs. “Taking cue, retail investors too are participating in the equity rally, largely through MF SIPs, on a continued rising quantum of record levels,” he said. Data showed that during July, net inflow into all equity funds — at nearly Rs 22,600 crore — was its fifth consecutive month of positive inflow. The corresponding figure for the debt segment of the industry was almost Rs 73,700 crore. Hybrid schemes too witnessed net inflows of nearly Rs 19,500 crore, driven mainly by large flows into arbitrage funds. NFOs too attracted strong interest among investors during the previous month. From 15 fund offerings that included four closed-ended ones, the industry mobilised a little over Rs 17,300 crore, AMFI data showed. According to Priti Rathi Gupta, founder of the investment platform for women LXME, growing economic activities and higher savings due to lower spending have also enabled investors to reserve discretionary income to invest. Gupta further noted investors’ waning interest for gold ETFs with the July data showing a net Rs 61.5-crore outflow from these funds. “Investors seem to have lost interest in gold ETFs, mainly due to two reasons: Gold prices have been at an all-time high for a while, creating anticipation among investors for a price plunge. And due to attractive returns fetched by equity and debt funds, investors tend to divert their investments into these instruments,” she said in a note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/record-mf-kitty-sips-on-mkt-rally/articleshow/85192048.cms||---
---||Business||After 5G, Tatas gear up for chip manufacturing||Mumbai: Days after it announced its entry into production of 5G network equipment, the Tata Group is gearing up for a play in semiconductor manufacturing. The move will pit India’s largest industrial house against the likes of Samsung, Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor and Renesas. Tatas are placing bets on hi-tech manufacturing to boost its fortunes in a post-pandemic world. Estimating the market opportunity of hi-tech manufacturing of electronics to be worth $1 trillion, Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran said the conglomerate has set up a business to seize the opportunity. He, however, didn’t elaborate. The development comes against the backdrop of group flagship Tata Motors facing production challenges due to the ongoing chip supply crisis globally. While the semiconductor manufacturing hubs are in East Asia — China and Taiwan — India has been encouraging companies to set up chip-fabrication units to make the country a production hub and to reduce auto and electronics industries’ dependence on China for supplies following the border skirmishes last year. Chandrasekaran said that there will be alterations to global supply chains, which are highly dependent on China, in the aftermath of the pandemic and geopolitical changes, and businesses will have to shift their reliance onto other countries, providing India with a huge opportunity to become a second base. “At the Tata Group, we have already pivoted into new businesses like electronics manufacturing, 5G network equipment as well as semiconductors.” On July 29, Tata Group inked a Rs 2,923-crore deal to buy 72% of Tejas Networks, marking its entry into 5G network equipment manufacturing. It is also putting up a mobile phone component factory in Tamil Nadu. And is now gearing up to manufacture chips, which are used in products ranging from CCTV cameras to 5G equipment. “We have set up a business to seize the promise of hi-tech manufacturing of electronics, precision manufacturing, assembly & testing and semiconductors,” the chairman said, while speaking at the annual general meeting of industry body Indian Merchant Chambers on Monday. Significantly, the public health crisis pushed Tata Group to be more resilient to alterations in the global supply chains it relies on and one way to do this was to be a part of it. The foray into electronics and semiconductor manufacturing are part of this gameplan. “Business needs to develop resilience in its global supply chains to head off pressure of shortfalls from sudden disruptions like the pandemic-induced lockdowns,” Chandrasekaran said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/after-5g-tatas-gear-up-for-chip-manufacturing/articleshow/85192180.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Four others - all part of a small group of men from Firozabad district - received head and shoulder injuries and were referred to Aligarh medical college. They were on foot to Lehra Ghat under Soron police station. Kanwar Yatra, this year, has been suspended in the state and neighbouring Uttarakhand due to the pandemic. But, local authorities are finding it difficult to prevent small groups of pilgrims sneaking through districts to fetch the holy water. When contacted, deputy superintendent of police Ramkrishna Tiwari said, “We are taking strict measures to stop any movement of kanwarias. Police teams are already deployed at the district borders and along the Ganga ghats." The two deceased men have been identified as Vikrant, 21, and Sunil, 38. Vikrant, a B.Sc student, was a son of farmer Rakesh Kumar, while Sunil used to work as a tractor driver. According to Kasganj police, the four injured men were identified as Bhola (28), Lal Kishan (40), Gauri (18) and Pankaj (20). Sanju, 25, the mini-truck driver, is a resident of Bareilly district. Soon after the incident, the mini-truck driver was caught and thrashed by other kanwarias. He was taken away by police and admitted to a district hospital. Soron SHO Anil Kumar said, “An FIR has been registered against the mini-truck driver under IPC sections 304-A [causing death by negligence], 279 [rash driving or riding on a public way] and 338 [causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others]. The entire incident is being thoroughly investigated.” The bodies of the two men have been sent for postmortem and their families informed. Meanwhile, local gram pradhans have sought monetary assistance from the state government for the families. DK Nim, the husband of Rajpur Balai gram pradhan, said, “Sunil went to bring holy water for a village temple. The entire village is now in mourning.” While Nagla Nathua gram pradhan Ajay Kumar said, “Vikrant was a good student. He was the first in his family to pursue graduation. His father is a landless farmer. The families should get monetary support from the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/2-kanwarias-crushed-to-death-by-mini-truck-in-up-4-critical/articleshow/85188793.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Delhi||DCW summons cops over post against Muslim women||NEW DELHI: Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has issued summons to Delhi Police in the case of alleged abuse and rape threats to Muslim women by a group of people. Police had replied to the commission stating that they had not received any complaints in the matter, while the commission said it had sent 250 such complaints to them. DCW has asked the investigating officer to appear before it on August 18 with a detailed report. DCW, in its notice to police on Monday, said the commission received a reply from Delhi Police that UP Police had not provided any information to it in the case. “This reply is totally unsatisfactory as the commission had itself annexed copies of 250 such complaints received by it with its notice and asked specific point-wise information with respect to the case. Clearly, your office has failed to provide the information sought by the commission,” said DCW. The commission issued summons to police to provide complete point-wise information on the matter. On August 2, DCW had sent a notice regarding posting of indecent messages against women of the Muslim community on social media. The complainant had informed the commission that five people had been posting derogatory messages that incite people to commit crimes against Muslim women on social media. The notice from the panel said one person had posted names and contact details of some women on his Instagram account where he had asked people to rape them. DCW had said UP Police had informed that the accused were from Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dcw-summons-cops-over-post-against-muslim-women/articleshow/85195366.cms||---

While Maharashtra admits nursing degree aspirants based on NEET scores, several states take in students based on class XII marks. This year, the National Testing Agency has mandated all BSc (Nursing) graduates to take the NEET (undergraduate). Applications have opened for the same and students can apply till August 10. The exam will be conducted on September 12. “Even since the NEET was introduced, the number of candidates joining the nursing programme has fallen and vacancies have gone up,” said Ramling Mali, former head of the Maharashtra Nursing Council. This year too, the state has 20% seats that have remained unfilled. In other states, medical universities issued a circular to colleges asking them to admit nursing aspirants for the BSc programme based on NEET scores. The entrance test can also be taken by candidates from state open schools recognized by state govts and The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-neet-now-mandatory-for-nursing-aspirants/articleshow/85193531.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Flood situation worsens in Dist asGanga, Yamuna cross danger mark||Prayagraj: After maintaining an upward trend for the past 24 hours, both the Ganga and Yamuna rivers crossed the danger level of 84.73-meter in the city on Monday morning. With the water level still rising in both the rivers and inundating fresh areas, the district administration has started evacuating the affected people and moving them to the safer places and in flood-relief camps. The water level in river Ganga (as recorded at 8am) at Phaphamau was 85.08- meter while at Chhatnag, it was 84.29-meter. Likewise, water level in river Yamuna at Naini was recorded at 84.90-meter. Water level in both the rivers and Yamuna increased with a pace of around 6cm every two hours. Because of the rising water, the water level at all the three recording points of the rivers (as recorded at 6pm) increased to 85.31-meter at Phaphamau and 84.55-meter at Chhatnag. Water level of Yamuna was recorded at 85.18-meter. The water level, as recorded by the irrigation department, is still increasing with the rate of 4cm at Phaphamau, 6cm at Chhatnag and 5cm in Naini (Yamuna). With the increase in volume of water in both the rivers, flood water has entered further into the localities that are being affected. Ganga Nagar, Nevada, Ashok Nagar, Beli Gaon, parts of Rajapur, Salori, Bada and Chhota Baghara, Badra and Sanauti, Daraganj, Nagvasuki, etc. Similarly, with the level of water increasing in the Yamuna, flood water has reached Baradari on the banks of Yamuna at Baluaghat, Gaus Nagar, JK Ashiyana, parts of Karelabagh and areas located near the banks of the Yamuna. As many localities are marooned in floods, flood relief camps have been set up by the administration, which is providing facilities to the flood-affected people. Meanwhile, the district administration and the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) is helping the locals to shift to safer places as well as keeping a strict vigil on the flood level. “We are keeping a close watch on the water level and since it is increasing in the upstream of Yamuna, the trend would continue at Prayagraj and further downstream towards Varanasi,” executive engineer of irrigation department Brijesh Kumar Verma told TOI on Monday. Meanwhile, troops of the Red Eagle Division are providing aid to the areas in 12 villages in Jalaun district affected by Yamuna flood, around 350 kms from Prayagraj. The villages have been cut off due to the rising water level. Between August 7 and Monday, a total of 135 villagers, including 20 children have been evacuated by the troops. Rations and relief materials have also been provided by the Army’s teams. On August 7, a pregnant woman Sadhna Devi was rescued by the Army’s flood relief team in close coordination with the civil administration. During the course of evacuation, the woman developed labour pains and due to the concerted efforts of the Red Eagle Division’s flood relief team, she was shifted safely to the nearest hospital. The evacuated woman gave birth to a baby girl the next day, with both the child and mother in a healthy condition, informed the defence public relation officer. The efforts of the flood relief team have been appreciated by the locals and the civilian administration. The Army’s flood relief teams have provided much needed support and relief to the villagers of Jalaun district and helped in mitigating the hardships of locals to a great extent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/flood-situation-worsens-in-dist-asganga-yamuna-cross-danger-mark/articleshow/85189908.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Revival of Mughal lake to start by September-end||NEW DELHI: The process of setting up a sewage treatment plant (STP) and rejuvenation of a four-acre lake in Roshanara Garden is likely to start by September end. Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has finalised the tender and is in the process of allocating the project to a concessionaire. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has agreed to provide 500 square metres space and given the NOC for carrying out the work. The 57-acre park is maintained by the civic body, but due to lack of a water channel it has become dry. “For constructing the STP and laying pipelines till the lake, all damage done will be repaired by DJB at its own cost. As the lake is a natural waterbody, there is a high likelihood of migratory birds coming there. So, the quality of water after treatment should be such that no harm is caused to the birds and plants. The 6-7 million litres per day capacity of the STP will be sufficient for filling the pond and irrigating the parks within Roshanara Bagh,” the horticulture department of the corporation mentioned in its letter to DJB. A senior DJB official said they were doing the technical evaluation of the bids and would soon open the financial bids. “We are expecting to initiate the work by September. As far as treatment of waste water is concerned, we have shared the required output quality parameter based on NGT’s guidelines using the best technology (either hybrid or physicochemical). The concessionaire will be responsible for operation and maintenance of the plant for 15 years. The cost will be around Rs 11 crore,” added the official. Unlike previous projects, the net value of this one would be calculated on the basis of cost of land, technology used, power consumption and O&M value of the plant. “We are considering these factors before finalising the bidder. The same method will be exercised in other upcoming projects for rejuvenating lakes,” said the official. Earlier, the lake was fed by rainwater and channels from Najafgarh drain. “However, because of the change in slope surfaces in the surrounding areas and increased concretisation, it was lying in a dried-up state for the last one decade, except from 2012-14 when a railway underbridge was constructed nearby and the water pumped out from the site was diverted here,” said a senior corporation official. The rejuvenation of the lake would be done by filling it with treated waste water from drains and sewers. Situated in Shakti Nagar, Roshanara Bagh is a Mughal-style garden built by the second daughter of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. The lake inside the lush garden was once a hotspot visited by migratory birds during winters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/revival-of-mughal-lake-to-start-by-sept-end/articleshow/85193512.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Delhi relies on drainage plan that’s 4 decades old||NEW DELHI: The city’s drainage system can only cater to 50mm rainfall and anything more than that overwhelms the system. This has been revealed by a Public Works Department report. Delhi received 69.6mm rainfall on July 19, 100mm on July 26 and 72mm on July 29. The normal rainfall for the month is 210.6mm, but this year 506mm was received despite the monsoon arriving very late. The capital is still operating on the 1976 drainage master plan even though the population has increased manifold. Officials said the process of implementing the new drainage master plan was under way and inputs from drain managing agencies had been sent to the irrigation and flood control (I&FC) department, which is the nodal body. In all, 10 agencies, including the municipal corporations, PWD, DSIIDC, DDA and I&FC department, manage over 3,700km of storm water drains. In 2009, the then lieutenant governor Tejendra Khanna had asked the civic bodies and all stakeholders to prepare a master plan for the watershed and drainage system. “The last drainage master plan was finalised way back in 1976. A new plan must be prepared keeping in view the fast-changing scenario of the city’s growth,” former chief minister Sheila Dikshit had remarked in 2012, while announcing that IIT-Delhi would be making the city’s much-needed drainage master plan. Now, almost nine years later, the master plan continues to remain unimplemented, while the “fast changing capital” is being repeatedly brought to its knees by massive waterlogging even with moderate rainfall. The report on limitations of the drainage system also highlights that areas like the Walled City have a system where sewage lines also function as storm water drains. In many cases, the colonies have expanded, but the drainage system hasn’t. At Pul Prahladpur, the excess runoff from colonies in a 4-5km radius reaches this site. The place was not designed to take such a large volume of storm water. The Yamuna water levels are also linked with waterlogging. When the level rises above 205m, waterlogging worsens. Delhi’s topography prevents gravity-based flow to the larger I&FC department drains that carry excess water to the river. A senior PWD official said smaller colony drains were managed by the corporations, while drains along roads wider than 60ft were managed by PWD. “The drains managed by the corporations carry excess runoff from colonies to the PWD drains that take the water to much larger drains like Barapullah and Najafgarh, which are connected to the river. When Yamuna levels approach the danger level, the gates of many drains are closed to prevent backflow,” added the official. Interestingly, PWD has hired three divers to save lives in case of an emergency situation if vehicles get stuck in waterlogged underpasses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-relies-on-drainage-plan-thats-4-decades-old/articleshow/85195395.cms||Paras Singh

---||Delhi||Delhi: After haul of crores, police try to plug influx of drugs||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police's Special Cell is all set to scale up the crackdown on the entry of heroin into the city through the Manipur route. The police action comes in the wake of revelations made by traffickers after the recent Rs 50-crore drug bust. The demand for heroin that is mostly smuggled in from Myanmar has shot up due to its superior quality, said the cops. The Special Cell has found that huge consignments of heroin are being brought to Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh from Manipur since the past three-four years for onward distribution in Delhi and other parts of the country. The contraband smugglers seem to be collaborating with contacts in militancy-affected areas. Further, as the border areas are not fenced and there are dense forests along the borders, the smugglers easily cross into Myanmar to procure crude heroin and return just as easily. The final product is developed by processing the crude stuff in makeshift laboratories and shipped via trucks with cavities under the footrest, according to the findings of the cops. Recently, the Special Cell arrested four alleged drug traffickers and recovered 12 kg of heroin, which would have a value of Rs 50 crore in the international market. On August 5, the cops received information about the movement of one drug-ferrying truck at Rajapuri in Matiala area of west Delhi and planned an interception there. Two suspects were arrested with 10 kg of heroin. Two others were arrested in north Delhi after another tip-off. According to Sanjeev Yadav, DCP (Special Cell), the arrested men have been identified as Mohammad Abdur Razzak and Mohammad Idrish Ali, both of Manipur, Shahnawaj from Bareilly and Sachin from Delhi. Razzak was deemed to be the head of the syndicate. He lived at Madrassa Darul Uloom Makha in the Thoubal area of Manipur along with the other accused. Yadav added that many members of the cartel were at large and police teams were pursuing them. During interrogation, Shahnawaj disclosed that he used to travel in his truck to hilly areas of Manipur and Assam and especially to Guwahati to procure heroin from Razzak and his men. The accused have detailed how the drug was being pumped into the north-eastern states of India from Myanmar, fully capitalising on the porosity of the international borderline there. DCP Yadav said, “The main supplier in Manipur used to collect the raw material from the hilly areas straddling the international border between Manipur and Myanmar, apart from certain areas in that Indian state, especially the militancy-affected areas around Saikul and Thoubal where illegal cultivation of opium is rife. This crude was processed into a pure form of heroin at labs and transported across India."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-haul-of-crores-police-try-to-plug-influx-of-drugs/articleshow/85195407.cms||---

The rampaging river and its tributary continued wreaking havoc in low-lying areas. Around 21,000 people of over 4,000 families were compelled to shift to safe places or take shelter at upper floors of their buildings. As the water of Ganga had come on roads after submerging the ghat steps the daily Ganga Aartis were being performed on roads at small scale. According to the bulletin of the Central Water Commission’s Middle Ganga Division office, the water level of the Ganga in Varanasi had crossed the danger mark of 71.12-metre on Monday early morning and by 6 pm it had reached the mark of 71.53-metre while the trend of rise was maintained at the rate of 1 cm to 2 cm per hour. The highest flood level of 73.90-metre had been recorded on September 9, 1978. In 2013, the Ganga level had gone up to 72.63-metre mark while in 2016 it was 72.56-metre. As the trend of rise in water level was maintained upstream from Phaphamau, Prayagraj and Mirzapur, where the Ganga was flowing at 77.19-metre, no respite is expected in a day or two. In Ghazipur, the river was flowing at 63.94 metre against the danger mark of 63.10 metre while against the danger mark of 57.61 metre the Ganga was flowing at 59.38 metre in Ballia, where the highest flood level is 60.39 metre. After taking stock of the flood affected rural areas, including Gobraha, Rampur, Ramchandipur in Dhab — an island in Ganga downstream — district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said that flood water has entered 40 villages so far. Mainly, the fields have become water-logged while around 30 families from each of these villages have shifted to safe places. The villagers apprised the DM of their past experiences and said that serious problems will be faced in case of one feet or further rise in the water level of the Ganga. Problems are greater in the city areas compared to the rural belts of the district as the water of the swollen Ganga started marooning more localities after flooding several areas, including Maruti Nagar, Shivaji Nagar, Gayatri Nagar, Ratnakar Nagar colonies, Maderwa of Samneghat and Nagwa areas as well as Ramnagar, Sujabad and Domari on opposite bank. The localities in the catchment of the river Varuna are the worst hit. Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said, “Over 30 densely populated localities falling in the limits of Jaitpura, Adampura and Sarnath on Varuna banks and Bhelupur, Lanka and Ramnagar on Ganga banks have been marooned so far. Over 1,000 families from these areas have been shifted to safer places while more than 8,000 families are still staying on the upper floors of their buildings.” “In view of past experiences and cases of theft that took place in houses vacated during flood in previous flood seasons, each of these police stations have formed minimum three patrolling teams to move in flood-hit areas on boats. These teams are also giving alerts to people stranded in flood-hit areas with loudhailers apart from alerting officials in case of any other requirement,” he added. The DM said that 17 flood relief camps, where people have taken shelters, are operating community kitchens while seven more community kitchens will also be operationalised from Tuesday to provide meals to people taking shelter at other places or stranded in marooned areas. Distribution of 5,000 ration kits will also be ensured in the coming two days, he said adding, teams with fodders will reach relief camps in rural areas, where people from flood-hit areas have reached with their cattle. Health check-up by teams of doctors in flood hit areas will also start from Tuesday. As the flood water started coming on roads in areas like Nagwa and Assi, boats could be seen sailing in some streets where flood water had entered. After shifting to upstairs and upper platforms at ghats with the rise in the Ganga water level the site of performing daily Ganga Aarti also came on water logged roads at Dashaswamedh Ghat as well as Assi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ganga-breaches-danger-mark-in-kashi4000-families-shifted-to-safer-places/articleshow/85189710.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The protesters were stopped by the police at the secretariat but the Asha workers managed to meet DG health Dr Tripti Bahuguna and health secretary Amit Negi. Later, health minister Dhan Singh Rawat also met the protesters. The Asha workers had sought permanent incentive of Rs 18,000 per month and job regularisation along with 19 other demands including health insurance and timely payment of incentives. “The protest march today turned out to be quite fruitful. The minister agreed to increase our incentive from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000. While several other demands like health insurance cover of upto Rs 5 lakh has also been agreed upon. We are happy with the decision,” said Lalitesh Verma, general secretary of Asha Swasthya Karyakatri Sangthan, Uttarakhand. According to health officials, Uttarakhand has around 13,000 Asha workers and due to Covid duties, their absence from the field hit the health department severely. “This was one of the prime reasons why their demands were agreed upon,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/asha-workers-conduct-protest-march-to-put-forward-their-demands/articleshow/85188957.cms||---
---||Allahabad||CM directs deployment of nodal officers in flood affected districts||(With Pics) Kanpur: Deployment of a nodal officer, besides arrangement of a generator should also be made for potable water in each flood affected village, said chief minister Yogi Adityanath while reviewing flood situation at the auditorium of Police Lines in Etawah on Monday. The CM said, “Ration kits should be distributed in every village with the help of public representatives. Also, the arrangements for relief material should be increased further.” Earlier, the CM conducted an aerial survey of the flood affected areas of Etawah and Auraiya districts. He also said that all the departments should coordinate with each other and speed up the relief work. “So that ration can be made available to each and every flood affected families,” said the CM further. He also said that chances of spreading infectious diseases are more once the water level in the rivers decreases, so bleaching powder and lime should be sprayed in the flood affected areas. The Chief minister also directed that concerted efforts should be made to rehabilitate those villages which are situated at the banks of the rivers. “Teams of NDRF, SDRF and PAC to be present till the effect of flood is visible,” he said. He also said that the relief work is less going by the population affected by the floods. “Relief measures should be expedited immediately,” he said. The Chief minister also directed the chief veterinary officer that arrangements for animal feed and treatment should be made in every village. “Ensure stock of chlorine tablets in the village by coordinating with the health department and panchayat department,” he said and added, “So that after purifying the contaminated water, people can use it for drinking.” On being questioned by the chief minister regarding flood posts, district magistrate Shruti Singh said that 20 flood posts have been established in which food packets are being distributed in three shifts. The DM further apprised the CM that Chakarnagar tehsil is more affected and in order to counter the situation, additional sub-divisional magistrates have been deputed there to take stock of the situation. The CM meanwhile expressed dissatisfaction over the deployment of one police personnel in each village and said that two police personnel should be deployed in each village. “Also, police patrolling should be increased,” he said. The CM thereafter met the flood affected people at Police Lines and distributed them food kits. At the Collectorate in Auraiya, the CM distributed relief material to the flood victims and held a meeting with the officials of the district administration and reviewed the relief and rescue operations conducted in the district. According to the Auraiya district administration, 24 villages of Ajitmal and Auraiya tehsils are affected by the floods in Yamuna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cm-directs-deployment-of-nodal-officers-in-flood-affected-districts/articleshow/85189622.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The traders argued that the civic body had developed a huge mall at a park located in the middle of the market after getting its land use changed and later it also got the land use of bungalows on Bungalow Road changed for developing commercial complexes. In the given circumstances, “when everything has been commercialised”, they too should be allowed to get the benefit by changing the land use of the main market, which was established in the 1950s, said the traders in a letter sent to DDA. They are seeking a meeting with DDA officials on this issue. “In the draft Master Plan 2041, our area has been specified in the list of rehabilitation colonies while no other mention has been done. We are requesting the agency to change the land use of main roads from mixed to commercial category as the majority of them are fully commercialised. We have copies of notices issued by the civic body for not using the property on various roads such as Kamla Nehru Marg for residential purposes as these are commercial ones. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has already changed the land use of various properties to develop commercial complexes in the area,” said president of Kamla Nagar Traders Association Nitin Gupta. Traders have also stated that the area which falls under the list of rehabilitation colonies under MPD 1962 should be exempted from conversion and parking charges. In a notification issued by DDA in June 2018 it was stated that areas developed prior to 1962 like Lajpat Nagar, Rajouri Garden, Tilak Nagar, Kamla Nagar or such other colonies which existed prior to MPD-1962 but were not included in the master plan (subject to documentary proof) having concentration of commercial activities, may continue subject to conditions prescribed under the mixed use regulations. The amendments also include having a uniform floor area ratio (FAR) for shop-cum-residence plots and complexes, at par with residential plots. “Now that the ground situation has been changed, we want DDA to give permission for declaring certain roads fully commercial,” said Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mark-area-as-commercial-urge-kamla-nagar-traders/articleshow/85193585.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Allahabad||Covid casts shadow over Raksha Bandhan, rakhis in short supply in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: With barely a fortnight left for the festival of Raksha Bandhan, the city markets are facing an acute crisis of rakhis. The dealers in wholesale rakhi trade in Prayagraj and adjoining districts attributed uncertain market scenario and prediction of the third Covid wave as reasons behind rakhi crisis. Mohd Kadir, city’s wholesale rakhi distributor and district president of Zila Udhyog Vyapaar Pratinidhi Mandal, told TOI, “We are facing an acute shortage of rakhis as manufacturers have not sent consignments to the markets in view of the uncertain conditions.” He added, “The traders are in a piquant situation ahead of the festival as the demand for rakhis has gone up manifold this year but the supply has dwindled.” Kadir claimed, “The manufacturers in view of the third Covid wave and ongoing coronavirus pandemic have not invested appropriately for making and selling designer rakhis this year.” As the markets are witnessing slowdown in terms of sale of all types of products, rakhi manufactures have not invested much this year suspecting that their consignments would be dumped if third wave of the pandemic arrives ahead of the festival. This year, limited stock of resham, chandan and cotton rakhis along with old stock of Teddy bear and musical rakhis for kids are available in the markets. “For the past two years, the trade has been derailed due to Covid pandemic and we don’t want to take risk in investing too much money in stocking rakhis and decorative items ahead of the festival,” said a trader at Chowk, adding that “we have brought limited items from Delhi and other states for sale”. Rakhis made of resham (silk), chandan (sandal) and cotton ‘ke kacche dhage’ (row cotton thread) are available in the market. However, there is limited stock of designer rakhis at stalls being set up at Civil Lines, Katra, Chowk, Bahadurganj, Sulemsarai and some other areas. Kadir, meanwhile, said: “For the past two years, we have been facing a dull market due to the corona pandemic and this year only a limited stock of rakhis is available”. Ironically, this year a limited number of self-help groups have come forward to make rakhis in the Prayagraj district. Around 120 women are currently preparing rakhis in Baharia, Karchana and Bhagwatpur blocks of the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/covid-casts-shadow-over-raksha-bandhan-rakhis-in-short-supply/articleshow/85189987.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Portal to screen vax status of local commuters, issue ‘universal pass’||MUMBAI: A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced a system to issue QR code-embedded passes enabling those fully vaccinated to get suburban train tickets in Mumbai, officials said the card is likely to be converted into a 'universal travel pass' which will allow access to multiple transport modes in the metropolis, including monorail and metro when they open up. The pass is to verify the immunisation status of a commuter and enable them to avail of other relaxations like entry to malls or government offices. The portal issuing the passes is likely to be launched by Wednesday. It will be linked with Co-Win so that vaccination certificates uploaded by an individual can be verified. In case the portal is delayed, BMC plans to set up facilitation desks at local railway stations to help office-goers get their papers verified. Officials said Government of India has agreed to share the back-end software with the state for setting up the proposed portal. ‘SOPs for trains fine on paper but difficult to implement’"Linking with Co-Win is important to weed out fake certificates. Also, since the certificate doesn't have a photo, this pass will require one to be uploaded," said a senior official. The QR code on the pass is to be verified using a mobile scanner by a ticket checker. The BMC’s plan is to supplement the government’s effort by setting up verification desks at ward offices and outside stations to check on vaccination certificates. “We had a meeting with state government officials. If the portal is not ready, we will set up verification desks outside railway stations. Citizens can come with their vaccination certificates and we will check if they are authentic on Co-Win and stamp them. Once this is done, they can buy their railway tickets,” said a civic official. The state's decision to allow fully vaccinated persons to access public transport, especially local trains which are the city's lifeline, has been praised by a section of experts. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, epidemiologist and health systems expert, said allowing them to board suburban trains is a step in the right direction. “What’s the purpose of vaccination otherwise? If people are not allowed to go back to normal lives with the related precaution of masking, then why are we vaccinating even,” he said. According to him, the state must also make exemptions for those who have taken one shot. “If they have taken the first shot, it means they are most likely to go for the second one too,” he added. The opposition, especially the BJP, has however found flaws in the plan. It said the government was making the entry system for train travel a cumbersome process. Minister of state for railways Raosaheb Danve said the state should have consulted railways beforehand. Party spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said instead of using the established central Arogya Setu app, the state has chosen to create its own app, which will place hurdles before the working class. Some railway officials said the SOPs look fine on paper but are difficult to implement. Member of Zonal Rail Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) Shailesh Goyal said, “I was the first to come up with the suggestion but the state government and railways are not prepared with the technology or a field plan to stop non-vaccinated passengers from entering the station.” Viren Shah from the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said it is a welcome move and will only encourage more people to get vaccinated. "50% of people employed in retail sector in Mumbai have been fully vaccinated. And as far as hurdles to get a pass is concerned, we will help our employees," said Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/portal-to-screen-vax-status-of-local-commuters-issue-universal-pass/articleshow/85195439.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Allahabad||47 more ATMs to be installed at 23 NCR stns||Prayagraj: With the aim of providing cash to railway passengers, the Prayagraj division of North Central Railways (NCR) have started the process for installing 47 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) at 23 stations of the division. The authorities have already floated the tender and within the next two months, the entire process would be completed. Presently, just seven ATMs are functional in different railway stations under Prayagraj division. With the new 47 ATMs coming up in the 23 stations across the division, over 50 ATMs will provide cash to train passengers. Among the stations, on which the ATMs would be installed include seven at Prayagraj Junction, eleven at Kanpur Central, four at Subedarganj, two each at Kanpur Anwarganj, Mirzapur, Fatehpur, Etawa and Aligrah. Besides, ATMs will also be installed at stations like Chunaar, Vindhyachal, Prayagraj Choeki, Bamrauli, Hathras, Firozabad, Tundla, Khurja and Dadri. The decision to install more ATMs at several major and minor stations of the division bears significance as often train passengers are in need of cash during their journey. The need was felt especially during the last 20 months when the entire country was under the grip of pandemic and large number of migrant workers used to arrive at stations. “There had been instances when these people, coming from different cities, did not have cash despite having money in their bank account and as such many of them use to ask us to drop near the nearest ATM”, recalls Girjashankar, a battery rickshaw owner standing at Prayagraj Junction. According to pubic relation officer (PRO), Prayagraj division, Amit Singh, “The process for installing more ATMs (47 at 23 stations) have been initiated and soon these 23 stations of the division would be having ATMs serving them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/47-more-atms-to-be-installed-at-23-ncr-stns/articleshow/85189950.cms||---
---||Mumbai||New IT rules draconian, may gag media, Bombay HC told||MUMBAI: The new Information Technology Rules of 2021 are “so wide and so vague” that they will have a “terrible chilling effect” and a “draconian effect” on the people who want to put content on the internet, media, editors and publishers too, contended a petitioner before the Bombay high court on Monday. For the first time, the I&B ministry seeks to regulate content and free speech beyond the reasonable restrictions permitted under Article 19(2) of the Constitution, submitted senior counsel Darius Khambata, appearing for a digital portal that has raised a constitutional challenge to the validity of the amended rules. He likened it to policing the media.Khambata said “9 out of 10 people may not say anything out of fear” as the two rules empower the I&B ministry to direct deletion and modification of content. The HC was hearing two public interest litigations (PILs) against the new IT rules that came into effect in May. The second PIL, by Nikhil Wagle, argued by his counsel Abhay Nevgi, said the rules were nothing but an “attempt at mass censorship” and that the rules “are a new way of bypassing the legislature for whatever its reasons.” Both Khambata and Nevgi sought interim orders to stay the new IT rules. Khambata sought staying of “rules 9, 14 and 16 which induce a chilling effect and (are) anti-free speech”. Khambata said “the essence of democracy is criticism of public officials. But no, now you do it at your own peril, because these new rules will censure, punish and sanction you if it is not found in favour of an inter-ministerial committee.” Even ‘music reviews’ has been pushed into the rules, he said. “They do not want sting operations too,” he added. “That is the sting in the rules.” The new rules are called the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021. Arguing before a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, Khambata said the main ground was the “indeterminate and wide terms” of the rules by which “regular publishers, authors, editors are all chilled because for anything they can be hauled up”. The rules are “manifestly unreasonable” and go beyond the IT Act of 2000, its aims and provisions. He said the rules define the ‘news and current affairs content’ very widely and bring within its ambit publishers of news and current affairs content and make them liable for any contravention. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Centre said its transfer petition was likely to come up before the Supreme Court on Tuesday and sought time. The HC observed that it was a month when he had mentioned about the transfer petition before the SC and asked what steps were taken since, but posted the matter for further hearing to August 10. The HC said it will on Tuesday at 2.30 pm hear the Centre’s submissions to oppose the two PILs provided it was not precluded by an SC order by then. Singh said while only Kerala high court, via a single judge bench, has passed interim orders of no coercive steps, two other high courts, including Madras HC, had issued notice to the Centre and not stayed the rules. He said there are 15 petitions filed all over various HCs against the rules, hence the Centre had sought a transfer of all to the SC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/new-it-rules-draconian-may-gag-media-hc-told/articleshow/85195417.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||Cong calls BAP BJP’s B team formed to regain lost ground||Ludhiana: The announcement to launch “Bhartiya Arthik Party” (BAP) comes at a crucial time when all major political parties of Punjab are busy working out alliances ahead of 2022 elections. Sources said BAP, which will field businessmen as candidates on majority of the seats, might play a crucial role this election. While those affiliated with it claim BAP is the brainchild of prominent businessman Tarun Jain Bawa, who is the president of the Bahadurke Textile and Knitwear Association (BTKA), representing hundreds of members belonging mainly to the garment sector, Congress has dubbed it as the ‘B’ team of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Bawa is believed to be enjoying a good rapport with large number of businessmen and business associations. Bawa was once with the BJP and his wife also remained a councillor from the party. But after demonetisation and GST measures of the BJP government in the Centre, he took a tough stand against the BJP. He opposed several decisions of the central government openly, even staged protests against the government. In 2018, a case was registered against Bawa and other businessmen for allegedly obstructing an income tax survey being held at a garment factory. Bawa recently was in headlines when he locked horns with the big leaders of Congress, including cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, by claiming that the Rs 650 crore estimate of Buddah Nallah Rejuvenation Project has been inflated by almost double and the same work could be executed at the cost of Rs 325 crore. Bawa had also presented several facts and reports from different organisations to further claim that the design of this project is flawed. BAP is B team of BJP: Congress Congress senior leader from Ludhiana, Parminder Mehta has claimed that BAP is the B team of BJP. Speaking to TOI, Mehta alleged, “After seeing its ship sink in Punjab, BJP’s has swung into action and they have launched failed farmer leader from Haryana Gurnam Singh Charuni as CM candidate under the mask of BAP. Charuni’s intentions have already been exposed and that is the reason why he was expelled by the farmer organisations. As far as BAP is concerned, this is a nexus being run by the agents of BJP and RSS, as it is no secret that majority of the people in this so called traders party have strong links to the saffron party. BAP is BJP’s B team and it has been floated with the aim to regain the lost ground by BJP, which, however, is impossible now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-calls-bap-bjps-b-team-formed-to-regain-lost-ground/articleshow/85193556.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Delhi||Doctor dupes another with admission bait in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has arrested a doctor from Kolkata for allegedly duping a city-based medical practitioner who paid lakhs of rupees after being assured that his son would be admitted in a medical college. Police said Dr Naveen Kumar, originally of Haryana’s Narnaul, introduced himself as a former Union health ministry official with contacts in the field. According to the cops, a complaint was lodged by a Delhi doctor in 2015 narrating that he got a message from an unknown mobile number regarding admission in postgraduate medical courses. A police officer disclosed, "The caller introduced himself as Dr Naveen Kumar, a former official of the Union health ministry. The complainant said Kumar assured him that he could get his son admitted in a medical college through the management quota because he had good contacts in the universities. Kumar confidently promised admission to the diploma in radio medical diagnosis course at DY Patil Medical College in Pune if he paid Rs 1.5 crore.” The victim said that after several telephonic discussions, he paid an advance sum of Rs 24 lakh to Kumar, but when his son wasn’t able to get entry into any medical institution, he demanded that Kumar return his money. “However, even after repeated requests, Kumar only returned Rs 7.9 lakh to the victim and then stopped responding to calls. His mobile phone then remained switched off,” the police officer said. The officer said that during the initial investigation police realised that the victim had never met the accused and didn't have a photo of the conman. Urvija Goel, DCP (West), said the police teams collected the address of the beneficiary bank account to which the Rs 24 lakh was transferred. "Our team visited the addresses mentioned in the bank account of the accused, but failed to find him there,” said Goel. “Then, using technical surveillance, we managed to identify the current mobile number of the accused which was found to be active in the Salt Lake area in Kolkata. A team was sent there and it managed to nab Kumar." Goel said that Kumar, now 39 years old, after completing his MBBS from Rohtak, went to Mumbai to pursue his MD degree and came in contact with some people who provided admission in medical colleges through the management quota. "Leaving his studies, Kumar joined the group. In 2015, he shifted to Kolkata where he started running a laboratory samples collection centre," the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doctor-dupes-another-with-admission-bait/articleshow/85195427.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Traffic cops plan 7 bus shelters in city, send proposal to KMC||Kolkata: The city traffic police has proposed to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation regarding the construction or designing of at least seven bus shelters that will help stop commuters from blocking the thoroughfares, ensure normal traffic flow at crossings and spots of dense pedestrian movement and cut down on accidents. Lalbazar officers stated that they have identified at least two of the city’s government hospitals where such bus shelters are needed to be set up urgently. Similarly, at least four crossings have been included in the plan. The cops have asked for immediate setting up of a bus shelter on the eastern flank of Deshapran Sasmal Road near the MR Bangur Hospital for south-bound passengers. “Those coming to the hospital — especially in this Covid situation — are mainly from the southern suburbs of the city and South 24 Parganas. But even as there is a bus shelter on the western side, there is none on the eastern flank. As a result commuters come down on the streets while looking to board public transport. The entire areas between the Anwar Shah Road-DPS Road crossing (complete with auto stands) now witnesses slow movement of vehicles,” said an officer. The police have also asked the stretch close to the DPS Road-Izatullah Lane crossing to be redesigned and the pavement area reduced to allow smooth movement at the Anwar Shah Road-DPS Road crossing. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said the recommendation has been sent to the KMC commissioner. The police have made extensive recommendations for the NRS Hospital Bus stop, too. This includes a refurbished bus shelter complete with proper illumination and CCTV cameras, the repair of the adjoining pavement and removal of unwanted concrete structures on it and around the bus shelter. “Those using the bus stop should feel secure. Similarly, unless facilities are improved, we cannot stop passengers from stepping on the road even as buses move into the bus bay,” stated an officer. Police have also recommended that the main Maniktala bus stop be re-developed 50 metres from the crossing to allow normal flow of traffic. Three new bus shelters have also been recommended at the Khanna crossing, Lenin Sarani near Tipu Sultan Mosque and the Jadavpur police station crossing. These recommendations are part of the multiple letters that are being exchanged between Kolkata Traffic police and KMC to streamline traffic flow in the city. The move follows after three accidents at bus stops this month — two of which were fatal. In all the cases, the victims were either trying to cross after getting off a bus in the middle of the road or trying to get off while the bus was still moving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traffic-cops-plan-7-bus-shelters-in-city-send-proposal-to-kmc/articleshow/85191412.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

All want people to cycle around the city to reduce pollution load. Ironically, Kolkata traffic police, which is implementing the ban, is the biggest victim of air pollution. Some of the eminent people who have endorsed the open letter include member of Parliament Saugata Roy, writers Amitav Ghosh and Ruskin Bond, actor-film director Aparna Sen, Olympian archer Rahul Banerjee, singers Usha Uthup, Anupam Roy, clinical director, oncology, Suman Mallick, sportsperson Dola Banerjee, actor Anindya Chatterjee, photographer Raghu Rai, human rights activist Sumanta Banerjee, economist Jean Dreze and director of Hazard Centre, Dunu Roy. Other prominent names include actor Dia Mirza, cricketer Varun Aaron, documentary filmmaker Anand Patwardhan, Mohandas Pai, chairman, Aarin Capital Partners, senior advocate Justice Anjana Prakash, fashion stylist Prasad Bidapa, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, Tushar Gandhi and activist Aruna Roy. Air pollution affects respiratory and cardiovascular health of traffic cops, said Vinay Jaju, the founder, SwictON, which spearheaded the campaign. Among 64 major roads, where cycling is banned, are Camac Street, Shakespeare Sarani, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Rashbehari Avenue Connector and Ashutosh Mukherjee Road, to name a few. A study — Evaluation of Impact of Ambient Air Pollution on Respiratory Health of Traffic Police in Kolkata — by researchers from Sister Nibedita Government General Degree College for Girls, Kolkata and University of Kalyani, found that high levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) resulted in reduced lung function — the impact is more on police personnel towards north Kolkata followed by south and central zones. A total of 228 police personnel participated in the study of which 128 undertook pulmonary lung function tests. The survey also showed many traffic cops with restriction of lung expansion, obstruction and narrowing airways. “We found PM 2.5 and PM 10 are key polluting agents in Kolkata. Though ambient air quality varies across locations and with seasons, traffic cops working were found to be seriously vulnerable due to long term exposure,” said Subhashis Sahu, associate professor and head, department of physiology, University of Kalyani and co-author of the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/celebs-authors-appeal-to-cm-to-lift-cycle-ban/articleshow/85191484.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

On Sunday night, a trial run of these lights was done and certain pictures were posted on the social media after which locals started condemning the officials and project. Some even said only lights cannot make city smart rather basic facilities and clean environment was to be provided. An activist Kuldeep Khaira wrote in his social media, “When we get up in the morning, we need to take bath. We do not apply make up directly, so colourful lights in posh areas will not make city smart.” He said the city will become smart when people will get a the basic facilities like roads, street lights, drinking water and proper drainage system.” Another resident from Model Town. Sunil Sharma shared contrasting picture of these lights and a potholed road in city. He mentioned that beautification will look good when public will get infrastructure like roads and potable drinking water. He said here people are suffering due to deep potholes and in such conditions people will not like these cosmetic measures. However, a resident from civil lines Kamaljit Singh said under smart city, only one area has been given all facilities and for officials only Sarabha Nagar deserves to be developed as smart area whereas other areas need many things. He said the authorities should have planned something for other areas too. Meanwhile, one of the officials said the development projects were planned under smart city mission while other routine works are being done through MC funds so both things should not be mixed up. He said the work was being carried out under both heads. BJP leaders protest on Malhar Road The BJP state vice-president Parveen Bansal and other BJP leaders staged a protest at Malhar Road on Monday. They questioned the planning of the road. Bansal claimed that the roads have become congested and people are facing traffic jams now at this roads because officials had faulty planning. He alleged that officials had nexus with contractors and a few selected contractors were given the contract to complete smart city projects. He said they will approach Union minister Hardeep Puri in this regard and complained that MC officials for pleasing some ruling party leaders had got constructed. The purpose he claimed was to ensure that the owners of commercial complexes get enough parking at roadside which ideally should have been in the basement of building. He said they will ask for thorough inquiry in these projects and seek action against those officials who wasted funds that had come under smart city mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-draws-flak-for-cosmetic-measures-and-poor-planning/articleshow/85193624.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED attaches plot where businessman’s office is located||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday attached a plot of land worth Rs 4 crore where Pune businessman Avinash Bhosale’s corporate office, Avinash Bhosale Infrastructure Ltd or ABIL, is situated. The ED had initiated a money laundering probe on the basis of an FIR registered by the Pune police. The current market value of the plot along with the building is around Rs 100 crore, sources said. In the ground-plus-two-floors building, 50% of the premises are owned by ABIL whereas the remaining are equally divided between Soma Enterprise and RDD Construction, ED sources said. The land, situated at Plot No 2, Yashwant Ghadge Nagar Cooperative Housing Society, Range Hill Corner, Ganeshkhind Road, Pune, originally belonged to Ranjit Mohite, through inheritance. The government had allotted the land to family members of Mohite in 1951, with the condition that it could be transferred only to the government or commissioned officer. It was meant for housing purposes. The plot was meant to construct homes for bureaucrats, but Bhosale purchased it by manipulating the records. It is alleged that in 2002, Avinash Bhosale, through his son Amit’s company, purchased the land for Rs 4 crore. He constructed a building on it. Thereafter a sale deed was executed between Bhosale and Mohite showing the land value as Rs 11 crore. The ED suspects that the sale deed was illegal and Mohite had interest in several of Avinash Bhosale’s companies. The ED alleged that Bhosale paid the entire amount to Mohite in 2002 itself and manipulated the government record to purchase the land and laundered the money. Earlier, the ED had searched Bhosale’s premises in Pune and Kolhapur and collected documents for examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-attaches-plot-where-bizmans-office-is-located/articleshow/85193696.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Dehradun||Custodial death at Haldwani sub-jail: CBI records statements of victim’s family||Nainital: A five-member team of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday recorded the statements of the family members of Pravesh Kumar, the inmate who died at Haldwani’s sub-jail while under judicial custody. Speaking to TOI, Kumar's family members said the CBI team was at their house for nearly two hours. The team questioned Kumar’s wife Bharti and their 12-year-old daughter. “The CBI team assured us that they will investigate the case thoroughly and the perpetrators will not be spared. We told them he was in perfect health when the police took him to jail and that there were injuries on his back when we went to see his body at the morgue,” said Deepak Kumar, Bharti’s brother. Last week, the CBI team questioned the accused prison guards and the inmates of Haldwani jail. As reported by TOI, Kumar had died at Haldwani’s sub-jail in March this year allegedly after being thrashed by prison guards. Days later, his wife tried to register a complaint but the police refused. An FIR was filed only after the orders of a magistrate. The family also approached the HC seeking a CBI probe in the matter. While ordering a CBI investigation into the custodial death, the HC noted that 10 injuries were recorded on Kumar’s body during his post-mortem and yet CO Haldwani, in his preliminary inquiry report, did not record the doctor’s statement. The court also asked the government to consider the transfer of CO Haldwani and SSP Nainital. The bench even remarked if “ties of brotherhood” led police to find no evidence of thrashing by prison guards. The state government, meanwhile, has challenged the HC ruling in the Supreme Court (SC) and sought a stay on its order. In its plea, the state said that the nature of injuries recorded on Kumar’s body does not show culpable homicide or murder as provided under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The petition goes on to say that SSP Nainital and other police officials discharged their duties as per the law and if the HC ruling is allowed to sustain, it “will tarnish the image and career of honest and innocent officers”. The case was listed for hearing in the SC on Monday but the counsel for the state government could not appear before the court. Now, the apex court will hear the case next Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/custodial-death-at-haldwani-sub-jail-cbi-records-statements-of-victims-family/articleshow/85189086.cms||Prashant Jha

Most of the tracks are on the busiest thoroughfares and crossings for which roads have been dug up and routes have been diverted causing chaos and traffic congestion. Diversions have led to hikes in public transport charges, adding to the woes of the residents. Work is going on at full swing as the National Capital Regional Transport Corporation (NCRTC), which is executing the RRTS, plans to open the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS by 2025. Out of the 82-km-long corridor, a 68 km stretch of the RRTS corridor is in Uttar Pradesh, of which 8 km is underground and 60.57 km is elevated. In Meerut, the NCRTC has started the foundation work of Shatabdi Nagar RRTS station. A total of 165 pilings are to be made for the foundation of this station. “The construction work of the rapid rail has resulted in perennial traffic jams on Begum Bridge. The crossing is the way to three major roads -- one that goes to Hapur, the other to Abu Lane and the last one to the railway station. Buses, trucks, autos and private vehicles choke the roads as half of the way is dug up due to construction of the RRTS,” said HS Rajan, a resident of Saket who has a shop in Abu Lane. Areas like Football Chowk and Transport Nagar are also witness to frequent traffic jams due to the ongoing construction of the RRTS. At Roorkee Road, the residents are not just struggling with traffic congestion but also waterlogging caused due to the construction work. Nitin Kapoor, a resident of Roorkee Road, said the lane outside his house is never dry even when it does not rain and gets worse when it rains. “The mud dug out has been left in the open in some areas. When it rains, it spills on the road, making it slippery for both two-wheeler riders and pedestrians,” said Komal Tiwari, another city resident. Meanwhile, the NCRTC authorities have claimed that all the rules are being followed in the construction work. In Meerut, there will be 13 stations dotting the 21-km stretch for local transit needs. The project Completion Cost is around Rs 30,274 crore. “At present, the foundation work is being done on both sides of this station on Delhi-Meerut road and thereafter, the foundation work will begin on the divider or middle of the road. The objective is to maintain a smooth flow of traffic on the main road and ensure minimum inconvenience to the residents during construction,” the NCRTC said in an official statement. The authorities also added that the construction activities are being carried out in compliance with Covid-appropriate behaviour and safety protocols at the sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/construction-of-rrts-throws-traffic-out-of-gear-causes-waterlogging-in-meerut/articleshow/85189090.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Pune||Criminal hurt as rivals chase, open fire at him||Pune: A criminal was injured when a gang of six men riding two-wheelers chased his car from Shivane to Ganapati Maatha temple along NDA Road in Warje Malwadi and fired six rounds at him on Sunday night. Prima facie investigation revealed that the assailants wanted to kill the victim, Kedar Bhalshankar (24), whose friend is accused of murdering one their acquaintances. Bhalshankar has a criminal case registered against him with the Uttamnagar police. “The suspects too have cases or murder and other criminal charges against them. They wanted to avenge the murder of their friend by killing Bhalshankar,” said Shankar Khatke, the senior inspector of the Warje Malwadi police. Police said Bhalshankar was returning home with two friends from Sinhagad Road on Sunday around 9.45pm when two men on a scooter started following their car from Nanded City.  Further ahead, two more scooters joined the first and the riders began firing at the car all the way from Shivane to the temple. They retreated when Bhalshankar drove to the Warje Malwadi police station nearby. “One bullet punctured the boot of the car and pierced through the driver’s seat to hit Bhalshankar’s back,” said a crime branch police officer. Bhalshankar was later shifted to a hospital. The Uttamnagar police have registered a case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) and other provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Indian Arms Act. Teams from the Warje Malwadi, Uttamnagar, and Kothrud police, as well as the Pune crime branch, are part of the investigation.  “Bhalshankar has named those involved in the attack. We are verifying this information with the help of CCTV camera footage,” Khatke said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/criminal-hurt-as-rivals-chase-open-fire-at-him/articleshow/85191520.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Patchwork on pothole-riddled Belgharia Expressway||KOLKATA: The National Highways Authority of India(NHAI) on Monday started patchwork repairs on the 8km stretch of Belgharia Expressway — leading to the airport from Dakshineswar — that has been riddled with craters and has turned into a commuter’s nightmare. In some stretches, the craters have got bigger after the spells of heavy rain and has been in desperate need of repairs for more than a couple of months. The stretch close to Baranagar Metro station turned into a death trap after rainwater filled the craters, making it difficult for motorists to spot them, leading to accidents. Most potholes there are almost as wide as the road. The situation is similar in parts of Durganar, Mathkal, Prafullanagar Purba Talbagan, Vidyasagar Pally and near Sreenagar. At Khalasitolla, the potholes on the airport-bound flank are so wide that motorists cannot skirt them and have to drive through. “Over the last fortnight, the condition of the stretch has gone from bad to worse. The potholes have widened into craters, making it almost impossible for drivers and bikers to manoeuvre around them. Several people have been injured in accidents while slow movement of vehicles has led to traffic congestions almost regularly,” said Sambhu Debnath, a local trader. An IT employee of Salt Lake sector V, Sudipta Mukherjee, who rides a bike to office from his Baranagar home, along the Expressway, said the stretch has turned dangerous. “It is scary driving on this road. The potholes are so big that you have to climb out of them. I have seen two bikers skid and fall in the last one week,” Mukherjee informed. Sandeep Karra, DCP, traffic department of Barrackpore Commissionerate said they have repeatedly asked concerning authorities to initiate repairs. “Rains have made it worse. We have deployed adequate traffic personnel to tackle the situation during the peak hours. The repair work has already been initiated on the Dakshineswar bound flank and I spoke to the NHAI project director and contractor in this connection. All the craters on the entire stretch would be covered soon,” DCP told TOI. NHAI engaged contractors to start the repair work on a war footing. “The area where the potholes have come up is low lying and regular movement of heavy vehicles coupled with waterlogging makes temporary repairs difficult to sustain. We are doing some patchwork but a full-fledged repair is possible only after rain recedes,” said a senior official of the National Highway Authority of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/patchwork-on-pothole-riddled-belgharia-e-way/articleshow/85191521.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Pune||Trash volumes spark chorus for more vans, daily rounds||Pune: Garbage collection from the areas merged with the Pune Municipal Corporation recently is heading for a serious problem. Vikram Gaikwad, a resident of Narhe, said the daily collection from the housing societies in his area is erratic and more vans have to be deployed. “Residents are being told to pay more money for garbage collection. We do not know if those asking for more money represent the PMC-appointed waste collectors. We want authorities to streamline the system at the earliest,” Gaikwad said. Citizens from other merged areas like Kirkitwadi, Manjari, Gujarwadi and Wagholi also want more garbage vans to ensure 100% collection of daily waste from their homes. Clearing of the trash dumped on the roadsides would also help, they added. Narendra Hagawane, a resident of Kirkitwadi, said the vans come daily but should go to all societies. “The vehicles currently deployed will not able to cater to the increasing population in the area,” he added. Manjari resident Sanotsh Ghule said the garbage collection system needs streamlining. “Daily collection of waste is limited to some pockets at present. Some newly developed areas in Manjari are still not in the process. There is no waste processing unit in the area which is leading to roadside dumping of garbage.” Sanjeevkumar Patil from Wagholi said roadside trash is a big problem. “The gram panchayat was not able to find a solution. We expect PMC to look into it. Most areas in the old limits of the city has a good system of daily door-to-door collection. There are separate teams for cleaning roads and public places. We want similar services to be extended to the merged areas as well,” he added. The 23 villages were merged in the city limits in July and have been attached to the nearest PMC ward offices that will extend basic services like garbage management and road cleaning. The civic authorities said more vans have been deployed in the new areas and the services of vans that were with the gram panchayats have not been discontinued. Door-to-door garbage collection will improve, the authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/trash-volumes-spark-chorus-for-more-vans-daily-rounds/articleshow/85191535.cms||Sarang Dastane

The people from the community had fled Pakistan in pursuit of a peaceful life in India. While offering tribute to the departed migrants on Monday, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the incident in Alkosar settlement of the community, they pledged to fight for justice and accused the state of not adhering to its promise of justice. “These Pakistan minority migrants required compassion and attention of state and Centrer for resolution of their grievances, which they have been suffering from inspite of coming to India in pursuit of a better life,” said pesident of Seemant Lok Sangthan, Hindu Singh Sodha. He said that appearing in a condolence meet in Jodhpur after the incident during his visit to the place, CM Ashok Gehlot had clearly said that if we were dissatisfied with the probe, it could be handed over to the CBI. It may be noted that Budharam Bheel, his wife, 3 daughters, 1 son, and 5 grandchildren were found dead under mysterious conditions inside a shack on an agriculture farm that he had hired for farming, in Lodta village of Dechu tehsil in Jodhpur last year. The lone survivors of the family Kewal Ram and Achuki Bai were present in the event, who said that they had come to India in the hope of better life assuming that they will be among their own people, who would care for them. “But what we got here was also a kind of persecution from some of our own people with vested interests as well as those from the government and police”, they said. It may be noted that Budharam Bheel, his wife, 3 daughters, one son, and 5 grandchildren had been found dead under mysterious condition in a shack on the agriculture farm, that he had hired for farming, in village Lodta of Dechu tehsil in Jodhpur on August 9 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/year-after-death-of-11-pak-migrants-fight-for-justice-continues/articleshow/85193719.cms||---

It will be held under the aegis of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha - the umbrella body of various farm unions - which has been protesting at the Delhi borders for nearly a year. "We do not want any confrontation with this government. They have tried to destroy the reputation of farmers. We are still willing to talk, but our demands are the same as before - repeal the farm laws and give proper price to farmers for the produce," Tikait told the media recently. The 'mahapanchayat' will take place on the GIC grounds. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha members and farmers from various states will participate, Tikait said. Tikait also alleged that several BKU workers had been framed in fake cases. "So, we had plans to 'gherao' the local police on August 4, but after a meeting with senior police officers the issue has been resolved, for now." The "gherao" call was taken back on August 2. On the expected number of farmers, Shahid Alam, senior member of the BKU, said that over a lakh farmers had attended the 'mahapanchayat' on a short notice in January. "Just imagine how many farmers will come after a month's preparations. BKU workers are visiting all the villages to invite farmers and make them aware of the black laws," he added. Notably, in a massive show of strength, tens of thousands of farmers had reached Muzaffarnagar’s GIC grounds with Tricolour and tractors to take part in the earlier 'mahapanchayat' called by Tikait in January. Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary and AAP MP Sanjay Singh were present on that occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mahapanchayat-on-farm-laws-on-sept-5-says-naresh-tikait/articleshow/85189143.cms||Mohd Dilshad

According to the FIR, the victim’s brother told the police on the afternoon of July 30, his sister’s husband, who was travelling, called and asked him to rush to their residence, saying his wife was not opening their bedroom door. The brother quickly reached their home and managed to break it open to find his sister “lying unconscious” on the bed with a cloth belt used for practising karate around her neck, which he took off. He immediately called the cops, around 3.10pm, who in turn took the victim to Vashi NMMC Hospital where doctors declared her brought dead. Her brother showed the cops a message he had received fromthe victim’s mobile phone at 2.39pm, stating, “I tried everything, I quit.” Hence, Rabale police initially registered an accidental death case. After the post-mortem, though, NMMC’s provisional cause of death certificate stated “asphyxial death due to strangulation with head injury”. When police enquired with the family, the minor stated her mother constantly pressurized her to study, which led to quarrels. On July 27, her father had scolded her for using her phone. She then went to her maternal uncle’s residence nearby. Later, her mother reached there and the two fought. The matter reached Rabale police station, but the cops resolved it. On July 30, the girl’s father had gone to Thane to meet his sister. Around 2.10pm, her mother called the minor to the bedroom and scolded her for not studying and beat her up. The girl told cops her mother even brandished a knife. Fearing for her life, she pushed her mother who fell and hit her head against the bed. Thereafter, her mother picked up the cloth belt lying on the bed but the girl snatched it and allegedly strangled her. Then, on her mother’s phone, she sent the WhatsApp message to her father, uncle and aunt. She locked the bedroom door and called her father, saying her mother was not opening its door. Senior inspector Yogesh Gawade said, “As the girl is a minor, she has been sent to the juvenile remand home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-15-yr-old-girl-kills-mother-over-neet-studies-row/articleshow/85189136.cms||George Mendonca

Schoolteachers roped in by the Madhya Pradesh health department to motivate people to take the jab sowed paddy for farmers and farm labourers in Dindori district after the beneficiaries said they would be able to go to the vaccine centres only after they are done with sowing. The seedlings of hope were sown at Manikpur village in Shahpur tehsil, 380km east of Bhopal, on August 7. The teachers, doing their usual get-the-vaccine rounds, arrived at a vaccination booth in the village to find it empty. According to their records, at least 33 people were due for their second dose and there were many others who needed to be motivated to take their first shot. “Till 1pm, there was no vaccination. We got worried. We went into the village and found that everyone was in the fields, sowing paddy,” said primary teacher G R Jharia. The teachers rolled up their trousers and salwars and walked into the muddy fields to talk to the farmers. “We tried to convince them that they should get themselves vaccinated. Jaan hai to jahaan hai. They said they could get the vaccine some other day, but the season won’t wait. The weather is favourable now for sowing. If it changes, their crop will be ruined,” Jharia added. It was a compelling argument. Most of the teachers grew up in villages and knew exactly why the farmers were willing to risk Covid in their race to catch the clouds. They had a quick discussion on the ‘bund’ and decided to trade places. “We proposed to the farmers that we, teachers, would work in the fields while they went to get themselves vaccinated. We immediately began helping the farmers,” he said. By evening, all 33 farmers had got their second dose, and the field ‘lesson’ had got to those yet to take the shot. Chief medical and health officer Ramesh Marawi lauded the teachers and said: “This is sowing season, so our teams are doing everything they can to get people vaccinated, like reaching villages before people leave for their farms, or waiting for them to return from the fields to get the jabs.” Watch Madhya Pradesh: Teachers in Dindori district sow paddy so that farmers can get vaxxed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/teachers-sow-paddy-so-that-farmers-can-get-vaxxed/articleshow/85191560.cms||Siddharth Pandey

More than 500 people from the villages in and around Anaimalai had turned up at the location by throwing Covid-19 precautionary measures to the wind to watch the shooting. Revenue department officials have imposed a fine of Rs 19,400 on the crew members for violating Covid-19 norms. A police officer said film director Sibi Chakkaravarthy and crew had shot some scenes of the movie at Mukkonam and Athupalam near Anaimalai, where a large crowd thronged without maintaining social distancing and flouting face mask etiquette, on the day. When Anaimalai police sub-inspector Chinnakamanan and team came to know about the film shooting, they rushed to the spot and dispersed the crowd. Deputy superintendent of police Srinivasan (Valparai sub-division) and Anaimalai tahsildar Vijayakumar also reached the spot and held an inquiry.

---||Kolkata||CNG buses on trial run hit streets with Firhad at wheel||Kolkata: Transport minister Firhad Hakim on Monday drove the first retrofitted CNG bus in the city, as curious pedestrians and motorists gathered on EM Bypass to catch a glimpse. Six diesel buses are being converted into dual engine CNG buses after retrofitting CNG kits. After inaugurating the buses, Hakim said, “Kolkata will now have CNG. In future, buses will be mostly electric and CNG. This will bring down fuel cost to at least 25-30% as well as reduce pollution.” “We are focusing on electric buses and now CNG, so that Kolkata becomes greener and cleaner. Today, as per the commitment, a trial run of 2 CNG buses is being done. If found operationally feasible, CNG bus conversion will be expanded,” Hakim added. After receiving international recognition from IEA Paris and C40 for electric buses; CNG buses will be added to the city’s green mobility. In June 2021 HMIC, Firhad Hakim had mentioned that CNG buses will be started in Kolkata. Then WBTC and BCGL signed a MoU for setting up the first public CNG station at Kasba. It was signed between Rajanvir Singh Kapur MD WBTC and Satyabrata Bairagi CEO Bengal Gas in presence of Transport Secretary Rajesh Sinha. Hakim had said that the first CNG station for government buses shall be operational in the next 6 months. “We were desperately looking for an alternative to fossil fuel, the price of which has left everyone pauper. The CNG can be a very good alternative. It is cheaper, clean and its sources are here in the country. It is not an imported one. If the CNG experiment is successful, then it can give us huge benefits — both the government and private. CNG buses can ferry passengers without hiking fare,” said Hakim “CNG emits significantly less pollution directly than petrol or oil when combusted (e.g, unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur oxides (SOx) and PM (particulate matter)). For example, an engine running on petrol for 100 km produces 22 kilograms of CO, while covering the same distance on CNG emits only 16.3 kilograms of CO2,” said an officer of WBTC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cng-buses-on-trial-run-hit-streets-with-firhad-at-wheel/articleshow/85191596.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Chandigarh||Bank colony and Silver Kunj colony to be developed as model colonies for plastic free zones||Ludhiana: With an aim to set an example for 100% plastic-free zones and complete source segregation of waste, the municipal corporation (MC) has identified Bank Colony near Sector 32 Chandigarh Road and Silver Kunj Colony near Jalandhar bypass, which would be developed as plastic-free zones. If the the initiative evokes a positive response, it would be emulated in other colonies as well. The civic officials had tried to implement complete source segregation in city but the move did not bear fruitful results. While some residents did not respond and failed to adapt to the new method, the MC staff too did not keep the garbage in segregated form in most of the places. However, now the MC officials have decided to focus on these two colonies, so that the drive could be monitored and implemented. The officials have distributed the jute bags in these colonies as an alternative to plastic carry bags. Also the residents are being convinced for segregating the garbage into dry and wet waste. The residents will be told to compost the wet waste in colony, so that zero waste generation target is achieved. MC nodal officer Swachh Bharat Mission, MC Maheshwar Singh said, “We are meeting people and are trying to convince them to stop using plastic carry bags and other products and also explaining to them about dry and wet waste and compost.” Once it becomes successful here, the drive would be emulated in other areas. Also the officials will work on sanitation, roads, sewerage system and basic amenities in these colonies for overall development. Notably, earlier the MC had converted a vegetable market near Lodhi club into plastic free-zone but that exercise turned futile due to the outbreak of Covid 19.

---||Jaipur||Bring employment guarantee law for people in cities: Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas||JAIPUR: Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas on Monday demanded the Centre to bring an employment guarantee law for people in cities to overcome the crisis of unemployment and lack of livelihood. Paying tribute to freedom fighters on Kranti Diwas, Khachariyawas said the country was struggling with unemployment after the pandemic. “The common man is sad and upset due to inflation caused by the central government; a crisis of livelihood has arisen in the whole country,” he said. At present, people who are getting work in villages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) can carry on in their daily routines. MGNREGA has proved to be a boon in removing unemployment in villages. Now, the time has come when the Narendra Modi government should make an employment guarantee Act for cities on the lines of the earlier Manmohan Singh government that made employment guarantee law for villagers,” the transport minister said. Khachariyawas said five days ago when a NITI Aayog team from the Centre came to Rajasthan, chief minister Ashok Gehlot told it that lack of livelihood was a problem across the country. “To eliminate this, an employment guarantee law for city residents was sought. The NITI Aayog members assured the CM to take the state proposal to the Centre government,” Khachariyawas said. The transport minister said that if an employment guarantee Act for cities is not brought soon enough, the Congress will run a public campaign to force the Modi-government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bring-employment-guarantee-law-for-people-in-cities-khachariyawas/articleshow/85191533.cms||---

Joginder Singh Bankura, a resident of the region and chairman of West UP Chamber of Commerce (rural and agriculture), said 51 pages of the book were found torn on Saturday night in the gurdwara. “Police have taken no concrete action in this regard. We consider Guru Granth Sahib as our living guru and miscreants should be booked for murder,” he told TOI. On Monday, Sikhs from several nearby districts reached Tarapur village to register their protest. Sikhs from Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand will also assemble in the region to decide the course of action and participate in an Akhand Path. “We have given three days to the administration to arrest those responsible or we will launch a massive protest,” said Surender Singh Fauladia, member of the Tarapur gurdwara management committee. Police told TOI that an FIR has been registered under section 295 (Injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class). “It is incorrect to say that police are not taking the matter seriously. We suspect the role of an insider. Forensic teams have been sent to the spot. We are relying on local sources and circumstantial evidence to catch the culprits,” said Uday Pratap Singh, circle officer (Mawana). Similar acts of sacrilege have previously led to mass protests in Punjab, especially after the disappearance of the holy book from a gurdwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in Faridkot district of Punjab in June 2015. In October 2015, two protesters in Kotkapura were killed in police firing. The incident set off a chain of events that would continue to haunt successive governments in Punjab. Even after six years of probe that involved two judicial committees, four SITs and a parallel investigation by the CBI, no conclusion has been reached. A recent order of the Punjab and Haryana high court that quashed the report of the Congress government-appointed special investigation team (SIT) into the 2015 Kotkapura firing case led to fresh political turmoil just months ahead of assembly elections next year.

---||Chandigarh||Plastic ban: Employees seek revoking of MC secretary Sekhon’s transfer||Ludhiana: After the transfer orders of municipal corporation (MC) secretary Jasdev Sekhon were received, the officer is receiving support at social media where his transfer is being condemned just because he was checking plastic carry bags sellers.  On Monday, the MC employees and a few NGO members gathered in his support in the parking of Rose Garden near mayor camp office. The employees of MC wanted to hand over a memorandum to mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu for cancellation of his transfer. The leaders of MC employees Ashwani Sahota said they wanted to meet mayor, but he was noth available. The employees also wanted to know the reason behind this transfer. The MC had started a drive against plastic carry bags from August 2 and regular challans were issued against defaulters for two days. Then Sekhon who was heading the drive received his transfer orders to Abohar after which drive came to an abrupt end. The mayor, however, had claimed that drive started from August 2 while the date of transfer was of July 31. But the employees are still linking the transfer with plastic carry bags drive and claiming the move was politically motivated. As employees gathered for the protest, the zonal commissioners and senior officials started calling the employees who were standing there in support of Sekhon for returning to their duties. Now speculations are rife that employees will have to pay the price for holding a demonstration in support of Sekhon. Some members from NGOs also later joined MC employees in support of Sekhon. At social media too people are sharing pictures of Sekhon while mentioning that he was the one officer who was out on street during lockdown days for sanitisation while others were inside their houses. The Municipal Employees Sangharsh Committee will decide what to do next. Notably, Sekhon was on tour to Prayagraj for studying solid waste management when he received these orders. He will be back on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/plastic-ban-employees-seek-revoking-of-mc-secretary-sekhons-transfer/articleshow/85193775.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||PM Narendra Modi yet to reply to my letter on caste census: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar||PATNA: Reiterating his demand for a caste-based census in the country, chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Monday said PM Narendra Modi was yet to respond to his letter on the issue. “The letter written by me was received by the PMO on August 4. The reply, however, is yet to come,” Nitish told mediapersons here. Nitish had earlier written to the PM seeking his appointment so that a Bihar delegation of all-party MLAs could meet him to discuss the issue of caste-based census. “It is our strong desire that the headcount is held caste-wise during the census. Once the caste-based census is held, the data about a particular caste will be available. Benefits of development schemes will then be made available to all. Caste-based census is in the interest of all castes and social groups,” Nitish said. He added the demand for caste census was driven by social concerns, not political. “It now depends on the Centre. This issue is now being discussed in many other states,” the CM said. The Centre’s proposal to hold caste census only for SCs and STs has triggered protests in different states, including in politically sensitive Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. The Centre had informed the Parliament last month that a headcount of only the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes was proposed. In Bihar, the ruling JD(U) and opposition RJD are on the same page on the issue. Asked whether the Bihar government would hold a caste-based census on its own in case of no positive response from the PM, Nitish said, “For this, we will hold talks with all political parties and other stakeholders. Census is conducted for the entire country at the same time. Earlier, the Karnataka government had once held a separate caste census. It would be better if the caste census is held by the Centre across the country. If a separate caste census is required in Bihar, we will hold talks with all stakeholders. But I have not said anything about holding a separate caste census in Bihar. Our demand is that caste census be held across the country.” Nitish said the last caste census in the country was held in 1931. “It should be held at least once more so that people can know the exact population of different castes. It is in the interest of all. It is necessary for the development of all social groups,” Nitish said. No factionalism in JD(U): NitishChief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said there was no factionalism in the ruling JD(U). “There is no dispute over elevation of Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh as the party president,” Nitish said. Reacting to the poster controversy in the party, he said, “Some people have a hobby of getting something published somewhere, but such people are not properly aware about the party’s functioning. In December, I had said that I want to give responsibility of the party to RCP Singh. Everyone had welcomed it. RCP then started working as the party president. When RCP became the Union minister, he said it would be better if Lalan takes over the charge of party president. Lalan is a very senior man. He has been in the party since the days of Samata Party,” Nitish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-pm-yet-to-reply-to-my-letter-on-caste-census/articleshow/85191604.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Pune||New garbage processing plant planned in Wagholi||Pune: Garbage processing will be decentralised with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) coming up with a new processing plant in Wagholi. The plant is expected to work for the 23 newly merged villages that generate around 300 MT waste per day. The new processing unit is expected to deal with much of the generated trash. While the unit is being finalised, there has been opposition from local citizens from its planning stage. Local residents said they have finalized three locations in their vicinity for the garbage processing plant. They are gairan (grazing) land plots and of the three, two are of one acre each while the third is a two-acre plot. “We had started this project when the village was under the gram panchayat. We want garbage to be processed at source. There should be no deviation from the project proposal, and garbage from other areas should not be brought to this plant,” local resident Shivdas Ubale said. Ramdas Dabhade, another resident, said transporting garbage from other places will be detrimental to Wagholi which is densely populated. “Our areas have undergone huge urbanization in the last decade. The location where the garbage plant has been proposed has a high population density. Transporting garbage from other places to Wagholi will be a problem for the residents and for the surroundings,” he said. Former gram panchayat members said funds have been generated from corporate social responsibility funds. The PMRDA has also chipped in for the garbage plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-garbage-processing-plant-planned-in-wagholi/articleshow/85191598.cms||---

Similarly, an uncovered manhole at Railway Colony has been causing inconvenience to residents due to the foul smell from it. These are not isolated cases as uncovered manholes or those with damaged covers can be found even on main roads in the Cantonment. Secunderabad Cantonment Board’s health & sanitation wing handles the sewerage system, whose lines run over 500 kilometres, with three jet machines. SCB officials admit that they were receiving, 15 to 20 complaints, on an average, every day regarding sewer water overflows or choking of the sewer network. According to SCB official records, there were 50,000 manholes spread over 500 kilometre length of sewerage network in the Cantonment. SCB officials said they would not allow manual cleaning of choked drains in the cantonment. “Like GHMC and HMWS&SB, Cantonment Board does not have a sewerage system like trunk mains and lakhs of manholes. In the existing network, as manholes are not deep, SCB uses jet machines to clean choked manholes and sewer lines,” SCB senior superintendent (SWM) M Devender told TOI. Regarding uncovered manholes, except a few, over 80% of them have covers. “Whenever we receive complaints of uncovered manholes, sanitation workers fix the covers. As a result, till now, no single manhole death has been reported,” said the SCB official. Social worker T Satish Gupta said that though residential welfare associations (RWAs) had given representations about uncovered manholes, it fell on deaf ears. “As a result, manholes have become death traps in the Cantonment,” he said. Officials have to inspect every manhole for people’s safety, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-80-manholes-have-covers-scb/articleshow/85195859.cms||---

---||Kolkata||City coin collector starts online currency exhibition to celebrate the Olympics||Kolkata: A city-based numismatist launched a unique online currency exhibition on Monday to celebrate Olympic feats of countries that have either not participated in their own names or are small in size but have managed to win medals. Anindya Kar has rare currencies of all these countries and has exhibited them, explaining the history of the rare currency chosen and linking to the Olympic feat. Russia for example did not participate under its own flag in the Olympic games because of an ongoing doping ban till 2022. So participants entered as representatives of Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) this time and won 20 gold medals out of a total of 71 to rank fifth in the games this time. Kar on his exhibition has displayed a paper currency of Russia from the time of Nicholas II in 1909. “This was the last currency issued by him. After this period, revolutions started and currencies were not in vogue in Russia for a long time,” Kar explained. Similarly, Taiwan entered the Olympics as Chinese Taipei. After the second world war when Japan lost, China took control over the country and till 1979 it was not allowed to participate in any international event. The exhibition displays a 1949 currency of Taiwan which is a uniface currency meaning that it is printed on one side and the other side is white. Chinese Taipei won 12 medals, of which two are gold medals. This time Kosovo, a small country of 10,000 square kilometres won two gold medals. Kar has displayed a currency of that country from a time when it had broken from Yugoslavia and had borrowed Macedonian currency, only to print its own name and denomination in black, because it did not have currency printing infrastructure of its own. The exhibition has a rare currency of Puerto Rico from 1895. The country stopped using its own Peso notes since 1911 and now uses only USD. “It’s a small country of just over 9000 kilometres but has won one gold,” Kar explained, holding up the rare currency in his collection. But perhaps San Marino, a country of just 61.2 square kilometres was one of the biggest surprises this year with its three medals. Till the 1860s it had its own Lira but thereafter it started depending on the Italian Lira. “I have shown a Lira from 1976 which almost looks like a bank cheque,” Kar said. Kar has also exhibited a 1944 Philippines Peso to celebrate their four medals in the Tokyo Olympics. “The Spanish conquered Philippines and introduced coins in 1521. In 1861 a mint was established to make standardised coins. In 1898 the country won independence and made its first currency replacing the erstwhile Filipino Peso,” Kar explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-coin-collector-starts-online-currency-exhibition-to-celebrate-the-olympics/articleshow/85191643.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Manganese reserves in Banswara district could be over 100 million tonne||JAIPUR: The mines department is expediting the exploration of manganese in Banswara after preliminary studies by Geological Survey of India (GSI) and Department of Mines and Geology (DMG) indicate that the reserves could be over 100 million tonne. The mineral reserves in Banswara are spread over a length 25km with a width of 40 metre and depth of 50 metre, as per the initial findings. Chairing a review meeting on exploration of the mineral, Subodh Agarwal, additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, said, “Manganese will add a new feather to the already mineral rich state. We are expediting the exploration work so that these minerals could be monetized through auctions.” A private company is already mining the mineral on a lease over 18 hactares and a total of 98,879 tonnes of manganese ore has been produced since the start of the operation. As per the mine plan of the lease area, a minable resource of 2.12 lakh of manganese has been established. Manganese ore with 20 to 34% metal content in Kalakhunta and Tambesra-Rupakhedi is considered to be high. While previous attempts to explore the entire stretch of 25 km have failed because of local area protests, now GSI and DMG plant to undertake the survey in the non-disputable areas of around 18 km. Because the manganese reserves are exposed in some village areas, the locals are not allowing the government to carry out exploration. They are illegally mining the resource and selling. It is expected that the exploration work will be completed by the end of next year. “After scientific assessment of the mineral reserves, we will delineate blocks and then invite bids for their auction,” added Agarwal. Potash has been another mineral that can bring rich dividends to the state. It is available only in Rajasthan in Nagur-Sriganganagar basin having estimates reserves of 2400 million tonne. Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd is already doing commercial feasibility studies for the mineral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/manganese-reserves-in-banswara-dist-could-be-over-100-million-tonne/articleshow/85193796.cms||---

The representatives from the villages had earlier submitted a memorandum of demands to district guardian minister Satej Patil and district collector Rahul Rekhawar. They had sought a meeting to discuss their demands in two days. However, there was no response from the authorities and the villagers of around 30 villages took out to streets. Bandu Patil, resident of Herwad village, said, “The relief announced by the government for flood-affected citizens is meagre when compared to the help Karnataka has extended to its residents. We want 100% ex gratia for the residents of villages that were submerged completely due to floods. There should be no criteria and sub-criteria to fix the compensation for the damages to the houses and crops.” Patil added that they also want monetary relief for daily wage workers as they are out of work due to damage to the crop and halting of most business activities. The villagers in their petition also have demanded that the administration work out a plan to avoid flooding in Shirol taluka. Both Krishna and Panchganga rivers, which flood during monsoon, pass through the taluka and converge at Narsinhawadi, the famous temple town. The flooding at the confluence point causes damage to the nearby villages. Ulhas Patil, Shiv Sena’s former MLA of Shirol, said, “We want the roads to be restructured in a manner so that they do not cause obstructions to the flooding rivers and also the traffic remains unaffected. We want some solution to be worked out for this issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/flood-hit-villagers-march-to-taluka-office/articleshow/85187133.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: With Gurnam Singh Chaduni as its CM face, Bhartiya Arthik Party launched||LUDHIANA: In a development that may increase the rift between different factions of farm unions, farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni on Monday appeared as the chief guest at the launch of Bhartiya Arthik Party (BAP), a new political party floated by businessmen. BAP is the brainchild of Ludhiana-based business associations led by Bahadurke Textile and Knitwear Association (BTKA). According to the BTKA, the newly-launched political party has support of traders of 29 states of the country. Ludhiana businessman Tarun Jain Bawa, who has been appointed the national president of BAP, declared that the party would contest on all 117 seats in Punjab and Chaduni would be its chief minister candidate. Chaduni himself did not comment on the remark, but during the programme businessmen and people from other organisations, including dalit bodies and women groups, held his hand and announced that he would be the CM candidate of BAP. Addressing the gathering, Chaduni said, “We are grateful to the traders, businessmen and workers of the country who have united to topple the corporates who want to finish poor farmers. This initiative of BAP launched by businessmen is the beginning of Mission 2022 in Punjab, which is a joint effort of traders, farmers and labourers. The main aim of the mission is to oust the traditional political parties, which, instead of serving the people, have turned politics into a business. They rule us with our votes and ditch us, then why can’t we form a government to serve the public. After completion of our mission in Punjab, we will head for the next Lok Sabha elections and it will be called Mission 2024.” Chaduni claimed that there was no rift between him and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha and when required, comrades had to contest elections to bring about a change in society and country. According to party chief Bawa, “Traders from all over India came out in large numbers to support Mission 2022 of BAP and also to contest elections under the leadership of Gurnam Singh Chaduni. Till now, all the political parties have exploited traders and businessmen, who are easy targets. We pay our taxes honestly, contribute to the growth of the nation and also support the political parties. But it is the business community that suffers the most once the governments of these parties come to power. We are haunted by the departments of these governments. Besides the business community, the farmers and workers too are oppressed and therefore it is time for a revolution to change the political system of the country and that revolution will start from Punjab.” Several prominent farm union leaders of Chaduni faction and businessmen from Ludhiana and other cities were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/with-chaduni-as-its-cm-face-bhartiya-arthik-party-launched/articleshow/85189202.cms||Mohit Behl

Raje was speaking to media after conducting an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas of Baran district on Monday. She was accompanied by MP Dushyant Singh. She said while people are distressed, the state government was sleeping peacefully in the Civil Lines of Jaipur. She pointed out that PM Narendra Modi had visited at the time of cyclone Tauktae. Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan also visited the flood affected area and provided relief to people. CM Ashok Gehlot should also come out and take care of people, Raje demanded. Raje alleged that state government had left the flood-hit people to fend for themselves in the last 10 days. “In this hour of crisis, instead of sharing pain and suffering of people, the CM and the ministers were engaged in conducting review through video conferencing.” Dozens of people died, hundreds of houses collapsed, thousands of animals died or missing, but the state government and administration remained paralysed. In this era of crisis, BJP is standing on the ground to know the plight of the people and to help them. Raje expressed surprise that while 100 per cent crops have been destroyed in Hadouti, the divisional commissioner was claiming 30 per cent crop loss. There is no one to take care of them, she said. The former CM said due to the short-sightedness of the government, such a situation had happened in Hadouti. She alleged that today not only the Kota division, but the entire state was suffering the consequences of discontinuing the Chief Minister Jal Swavalamban Yojna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raje-tours-flood-hit-baran-areas-says-govt-sleeping/articleshow/85193824.cms||---

The video shows a man ordering kebabs for his child’s birthday. The man at the other end of the line asks him to click a random link and then send over Rs 10 as a nominal fee to place orders at a huge discounted rate. Minutes later, the man finds money from his bank disappearing to unknown bank accounts. “This is a crime that has seen a huge rise ever since the lockdown began. Despite all the messages we send out, people are not careful. We hope the video will register in the minds of net users,” explained an officer. Several hotel chains across Park Street and Park Circus whose names are used by fraudsters welcomed this move. “We have received complaints from guests about why we are asking for a booking amount while ordering. This alerted the manager who recorded the conversation with the accused. We at once informed the police. We have also informed our private telecom service provider and held a meeting with them,” said an official of a popular restaurant. “This is difficult even for customers to detect as they are calling on the authorized landlines,” said an investigating officer. Sources said that across south Kolkata, gangs are constantly changing their modus operandi. Even local eateries in the Lake and Jadavpur areas have not been spared. “The fraudsters are now also using display advertisements on networking sites like Facebook and Instagram in the name of some of the finest eateries of south and central Kolkata announcing that you can buy two meals for the cost of oneMultiple cases of food order frauds have emerged in the city since restaurants became operational,” said an officer from the anti-bank fraud cell of Kolkata Police asking residents to be on the guard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-alert-via-fb-video-against-online-food-fraud/articleshow/85191700.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

But according to another estimate by some Gulf organisations, the number is close to 10 lakh, including about 1 lakh from Telangana. The Centre has said that India was in touch with other countries on the issue of allowing Indian workers to return to their destination in the Gulf. “Our embassies and consulates are actively pursuing this matter with host governments,” said foreign minister S Jaishankar recently in reply to a query on Gulf Indian workers by Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi. However, migrants rights activist Bheem Reddy Mandha said: “The issue is much bigger. It is about wage theft. Many of those who were forced to return came back without the employers giving them their end of service benefits. The government has to take up their matter so that they get their dues from employers in those countries.” After the exodus began, the Centre on May 30, 2020, launched SWADES (Skilled Workers Arrival Database for Employment Support) initiative for Indians returning under the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM). SWADES is a joint initiative of the ministries of skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE), civil aviation and external affairs which aims to create a database of returning Indiana based on their skill sets and experience. The returning nationals are required to fill an online SWADES skills card containing details related to the work sector, job title, employment and years of experience. The information collected via the skills card has been used to facilitate placement by integrating with Skill India’s ASEEM (Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employee Employer Mapping) portal, Jaishankar said. “The number of people who have been given employment, as can be seen from the figures, is low. There is not enough awareness about it,” Bheem Reddy Mandha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-exodus-india-talking-to-gulf-countries-for-return-of-workers/articleshow/85195869.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

He convened a meeting with the bureaucrats, village panchayat presidents, representatives of various traders’ associations and industrial sector at the district collectorate here on Monday evening to discuss the course of action to be implemented in the wake of a slight spike in daily cases. Addressing the media, Siddique said the district had only 43% of seroprevalence (percentage of the population with antibodies against the virus). It was the second lowest seroprevalence in the state. “Hence, there is a possibility of a third wave in the district. Both the public and health department officials should be ready to face the wave, which might hit the district next month. Vaccination is the only solution. So, we are taking steps to allot more vaccine doses to the district.” He requested the people to wear face masks compulsorily, maintain social distancing and wash hands with sanitizers. People should be vigilant, he said. “Beds, including the ones with oxygen facilities, are kept ready at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), ESI Hospital and private hospitals in the district. We are expecting the viral load to reduce in other districts. So, there are plans to shift the doctors and medical staff there to Coimbatore, if needed,” Siddique said. The officer said the district administration was ready to face any challenges. “We can face the third wave without mortality and people should be more vigilant for the next two months. For children, the district administration has set up 124 oxygen bedsand 82 ICU beds at CMCH, and 40 oxygen beds and 30 ICU beds at the ESI Hospital.” The meeting was attended by collector G S Sameeran, city police commissioner Deepak M Damor, corporation head Raja Gopal Sunkara, district revenue officer Leela Alex, CMCH dean Nirmala and other officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/third-covid-wave-may-hit-dist-next-month-official/articleshow/85193836.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The jail authorities expect to get the government’s approval for the proposed barracks any day. Over the past 172 years, the jail’s capacity has been enhanced to accommodate some 582 prisoners. Today, almost double the number of inmates, at 1,213, are lodged here. While the proposed new barrack will have a 60 capacity, the high security “anda cell” will accommodate 20 prisoners. According to officials, if the proposal is approved by the government, Bijnor jail will be counted among the most secure prisons in the state. Giving details about the high security barrack, jail superintendent Lal Ratnakar Singh said, “Preparations are underway to build a high security barrack in the Bijnor jail on the lines of the Central Jail. The plot where vegetables are grown in the jail complex has been earmarked for the same. The state government had asked us to prepare a proposal in this regard, which we have done and sent to the authorities concerned for approval. “Once, the official nod is given, the budget, capacity and space will also be decided for the high security barrack. The construction work will be handled by the contractors working in the police and other such sensitive departments. Once it is built, the dreaded criminals, including those who indulge in rioting in jail, will be separated from other inmates and kept here,” said superintendent Singh. He added that the walls of high security oval cells will be specially made to be very strong. Its roof will have layers of steel mesh, which is almost impossible to break. In addition , a barrack is under construction to house 60 inmates. Work on this new barrack is expected to begin by next month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/172-year-old-bijnor-jail-to-get-high-security-barrack-to-house-dreaded-criminals/articleshow/85189311.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Goa||Sandesh Jhingan agrees terms with Croatian top-tier club HNK Sibenik||Panaji: Sandesh Jhingan will finally realise his dream of playing in Europe after agreeing terms with HNK Sibenik, a top division club in Croatia. Jhingan, India’s Footballer of the Year, had Europe in his sights for the last two years but a major injury and then the Covid-19 pandemic kept his dream on hold. This season, there was interest from Croatia, Austria and Greece, and the ATK Mohun Bagan defender has now opted to join HNK Sibenik. “We have an agreement in place with HNK Sibenik. All efforts are now on to get him to Croatia as soon as possible,” Sandesh’s representative, Anuj Kichlu from the Madrid-headquartered Best Of You Sports, told TOI on Monday. Jhingan has an existing five-year contract with ATK Mohun Bagan, signed last year. The contract, though, has clauses that allows the star defender to move to Europe, if a club came calling. So when HNK Sibenik registered their interest in writing to the club, ATK Mohun Bagan could not refuse. Jhingan’s absence, though, will hit them hard in the AFC Cup, Asian football’s second-tier club competition, to be played next week. “There were several offers for Sandesh last year but with Covid-19 restrictions it became very difficult,” said Kichlu. “This year, there were four different clubs who reached out to us. After considering the different types of leagues and offers, HNK Sibenik looked like the best fit for Sandesh. Croatia, after all, are World Cup finalists and the league has grown a lot in the last few years.” HNK Sibenik play in the top-tier of Croatian football which has 10 teams, who play against each other four times and log 36 matches. Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb are Croatia's biggest clubs and their rivalry can be traced back to almost 100 years. Last season, Sibenik finished sixth in the league but have struggled this year with just one point from their first four matches. Jhingan, 28, has come a long way since being voted Emerging Player of the Year in 2014. He has worked his way up to become national coach Igor Stimac’s most trusted man in defence. He had picked up an ACL injury while doing duty for India in a friendly against NorthEast United in 2019 and then forced to miss the entire 2019-20 season. Jhingan returned to the field in November last year after being out of competitive action for 13 months and won the Footballer of the Year award.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sandesh-jhingan-agrees-terms-with-croatian-top-tier-club-hnk-sibenik/articleshow/85221421.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

They said she usually returned home from school by 3.30pm. But when on Monday when she did come back, they started searching for her and reached the house of her friend, who told them that five men had kidnapped her when they were returning home from the school.” “We immediately sounded an alert, but found no clue.

The farmers, led by All-India Kisan Sabha, agitated to get the right price for milk given that the cost of production is going up on a daily basis. Alleging that the dairy cooperatives and private organisations came together to buy milk at cheap rates from farmers under the garb of lockdown, the association claimed that the selling price of milk and other dairy products produced by the same companies never came down. “Under the garb of lockdown the milk was procured from the producers at 20 per litre only for the cow milk and Rs 40 per litre for buffalo milk. This was cheating and we have urged the government to give an allowance of Rs 5 per litre to every farmer,” Ajit Navale of AIKS, who headed the state-wide agitation, said. Navle claimed that the farmers had met dairy development minister Sunil Kedar and it was decided that the state would implement a provision of Fair and Remunerative Pricing (FRP) for dairy producers as well, but that is yet to happen. “We want the government to announce minimum price of Rs 35 per litre for cow milk and Rs 60 per litre for the buffalo milk so that the farmers can deal with the rising cost of production and make some profit as well,” Navale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dairy-farmers-demand-higher-procurement-price/articleshow/85187174.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Revellers at waterfalls throw caution to the wind||HYDERABAD: Friendship Day revelry turned tragic for three youngsters who drowned in the backwaters of Sriram Sagar Project in Nizamabad on August 1. In Mulugu district, two others were swept away in the swirling waters of Bogatha waterfalls on the same day. The three friends had gone to the picnic spot to celebrate Friendship Day when one of them, 19-year-old Shiva, fell into the water and struggled to come out. His friends — Rahul (19) and Uday (20) — tried to rescue him by jumping into the water. But, all three of them were washed away and their bodies were recovered on August 2. Similarly, two persons — Munigeli Naresh (24) and Ravi Kumar Chari (30) — were swept away in Bogatha waterfalls and their bodies were fished out a day later. These are not isolated incidents. Instances of people flocking to picnic spots, water bodies, waterfalls and riverbanks and taking selfies close to the water have seen a jump of late, and casualties have also gone up. Police said a person ventures into the water first, loses balance, raises an alarm, gets washed away, while others jump into the water to rescue him or her. In a majority of such cases, not only the person is at great risk but those trying to rescue him or her are also swept away, police said. “If only precautions are taken, lives would not be lost. While visiting water bodies or waterfalls or crossing surging streams, people must be very alert and not take unnecessary risks as it is difficult to tackle water flow,” said Boath town inspector Mudavath Nylu said. Bogatha waterfalls is a favourite destination during the monsoon for revellers because of its scenic locales. Last year, an engineering student drowned in Kuntala waterfalls, which is close to Bogatha waterfalls. A visit to the Pushkar ghat at Pochampad in Nizamabad turned tragic for a family in April this year. Six persons drowned in the mishap. One of the persons in the group who went deep into the water was drowning when others noticed him and tried to rescue him. Three girls — Zumaira (10), Mashera (14) and Miraj Begum (16) — met a watery grave in Alisagar during an outing in November last year. The girls were taking a selfie when one of them slipped into the water. Two others also fell and they were washed away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revellers-at-waterfalls-throw-caution-to-the-wind/articleshow/85195888.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Jaipur Met office said for coming week, the weather would mainly remain dry in the state and mercury is likely to take an upward swing. No major rainfall activity is expected across the state at least till Sunday.

The DMK MLA also ensured that the substandard rice was taken back and the woman was provided better quality rice. Selvaraj left the ration shop after issuing a stern warning to the staff, giving a pleasant surprise to the elderly woman as well as the public who thronged the outlet. It was when Selvaraj, who visited KVR Nagar at Karuvampalayam, was heading to the corporation school to inspect the construction of new classroom buildings, 70-year-old Kanniammal, a resident of the locality, intercepted his car. She had earlier come to know that the MLA was visiting the place. As a puzzled Selvaraj sought to know the grievance of the sexagenarian, Kanniammal began pouring out complaints against the staff of the local public distribution system (PDS) outlet. “There are lots of violations in the shop. All commodities are not supplied and the staff abuse us. You should come and warn them,” she told the MLA. Selvaraj asked Kanniammal to get inside his car and drove straight to the ration shop. At the shop, the shocked staff attempted to deny the charges. But Kanniammal stood her ground and repeated her charges once again. She said the staff would intimidate her every time she questioned them about denying products to cardholders. Selvaraj warned the staff against disrespecting the public and directed them to supply all commodities to the cardholders. “If there is a complaint again, the issue will be taken up with superior officers and action would be taken,” he warned them. The ruling party MLA then personally supervised that the staff give Kanniammal all the commodities she was eligible for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mla-ensures-fair-deal-for-woman-70-at-ration-shop/articleshow/85193874.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Local AAI officials said such approvals are discussed in the monthly board meetings. Chief secretary Vini Mahajan, during a visit to the city on August 7, had said the international airport construction would be completed by January to improve the air connectivity of the industrial city, also known as Manchester of India, besides bringing in investment and jobs.PWD officials said around April, they had got the estimate for the temporary terminal building and internal roads at Aitiana, near Halwara Airport, and since then they have been awaiting approval from AAI so that they could float tenders.PWD superintending engineer (roads and building wing) Rakesh Garg said they have sent proposal for construction of terminal building, a temporary one that may be used for other purposes later, and roads, including parking and apron (where planes are parked), to the AAI and were waiting for a nod, after which tenders would be floated. After allotment of work, construction would start. PWD officials said while the estimate for construction of the building was around Rs 43 crore, that for roads and related works was around Rs 20 crore. They said after the work has been allotted, construction would be completed by January. A local AAI officer said such proposals were taken up at monthly board meetings and PWD should get the approval soon. He added that they were willing to shift the operations from Sahnewal Airport to Halwara, as they have been facing constraints like low visibility and shorter runway. The PWD superintending engineer said the work of approach road (executed by the Punjab Mandi board) and boundary wall has been completed. PWD officials said about 2,300-metre boundary wall, with a height of 10 feet and 2 feet wire on top, has been constructed at a cost of Rs 3 crore.Meanwhile, residents are awaiting the start of the airport. “The project will benefit Ludhiana in many ways and the business community will gain maximum from it. We need not travel to Amritsar or Mohali. Our clients from the country and abroad can come directly to Ludhiana. As of now, we have flights from Sahnewal to Delhi, but these get cancelled sometimes,” said Kulpreet Malhotra, a cycle exporter from Model Town. He said the authorities should get the airport operational as early as possible.State-of-the-art terminal complexAAI officials said the airport terminal complex will be state-of-the-art with latest equipment, including common user interface terminal (Cute) system, inland baggage, face recognition system for walk through identification facility for passengers, among others. AAI officials had said as against the capacity of 72-seater ATR flight at Sahnewal, the Halwara airport will cater to 172 Boeing flight. The airport building will have three terminals, including international, domestic and cargo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/tender-for-roads-not-issued-as-authorities-await-nod-from-aai/articleshow/85189293.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Chandigarh||Cabinet rejig talk: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh may meet Sonia Gandhi today||CHANDIGARH: Amid talk of changes in the Punjab cabinet at the fag-end of the Congress regime, chief minister Amarinder Singh is likely to meet party president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi on Tuesday. It will be his first meeting with Sonia after Navjot Singh Sidhu’s elevation as the Punjab Congress president on July 18. Earlier, ruling out an immediate Cabinet reshuffle, Amarinder had said that he would discuss the matter with the Congress president during his next visit to the national capital. Sources said Amarinder will reach Delhi on Tuesday and may meet Sonia if there is a confirmation of the meeting. The next Assembly elections are due in Punjab in February 2022 and presently the cabinet berth vacated by Sidhu is available. While there has been talk of balancing the representation to various communities, especially dalit MLAs, in the cabinet, whether Amarinder would want to replace ministers who did not stand by him during the recent internal turmoil in the state unit has been a point of speculation. It will be closely watched if ministers who openly backed Sidhu will continue to be in the cabinet. At the same time, at least four ministers have faced allegations of misusing their positions by the opposition parties in recent months. The AICC appointed three-member panel too had earlier hinted at changes in both the organizational structure and the government after taking feedback from more than 150 Congress leaders from Punjab. "There has been talk of changes in the cabinet every few months, but it never happened for various reasons. Many of the aspirants, especially the younger lot of MLAs, were hopeful of cornering a cabinet berth. However, where the cabinet rejig was delayed, the state unit too has still not been reconstituted ahead of the next elections. The chief minister may want to reward MLAs who stood by him during the infighting," said a party leader. "It would be seen if the party still feels the need to have a dalit deputy CM, even after appointing four working presidents. Otherwise, a cabinet berth for such a short duration would hold no charm for any of the senior MLAs. The party high command is unlikely to spark off another controversy with a major reshuffle and may want to fill only the vacant position," said a party MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cabinet-rejig-talk-cm-may-meet-sonia-today/articleshow/85193885.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In a 1st, top cop spells transfer rules with lower-rung in mind||MUMBAI: For the first time in the history of the Mumbai Police, commissioner Hemant Nagrale has drafted an ambitious transfer policy, keeping in mind the lower-rung of police personnel — from police constable to assistant police inspector. Nagrale has made it clear that if a police personnel in the rank of constable to assistant police inspector is due for retirement in one year, then he will not be shifted in the reshuffle and if he is due for retirement in two years, all-out efforts will be made to grant him posting of his choice. Tenure in most polluted Wadala, Yellow gate, Shivaji Nagar and Deonar police stations will be of three years against the normal tenure of five years. Nagrale has come out with a comprehensive transfer policy for the lower-rung of police personnel, assuming that he will be in service for nearly 30 to 35 years. Significantly, the highlight of the policy is that no police personnel will be able to monopolise his posting. In the recent past, it was found that quite a large number of police personnel ensured that they are not shunted out of the prime branch. In the recent past, Nagrale had shunted out all such police personnel who had completed more than two decades in one branch. Nagrale has defined ‘executive’ and ‘non-executive’ branches. Accordingly, all police stations, cybercrime branch and crime branch will be considered ‘executive’ branch, while the remaining assignments will be considered as ‘non-executive’ branches. As per the new policy, once a person is inducted in the Mumbai police, mandatorily he will have to work in the local arms division for five years. Once his assignment in local arms is complete, he will be considered for appointment in a police station or any other branch, depending on his request, administrative need and availability of post. The additional commissioner of police will decide the posting of the constable either in the police station or any other branch. It will be for a maximum period of 10 years, of which five years will be in police station in one zone and remaining five years in another zone. While granting posting in crime branch, it will be ensured that he has not worked in the crime branch previously. After working for 10 years in police stations and five years in crime branch, he will be appointed in non-executive branch for five years and then again he will be considered for executive assignment. If a police personnel is facing departmental probe or is involved in any kind of criminal case, he will not be considered for executive assignment. Tenure in the coastal security branch will be for three years, in the Sewree, Wadala, Yellow gate, Shivaji Nagar and Deonar too the tenure will be three years in view of large-scale pollution in these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-a-1st-top-cop-spells-transfer-rules-with-lower-rung-in-mind/articleshow/85195514.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The deceased, Prabhakar Vidhate of Shelgaon Khurd village, was rushed to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) where he died while undergoing treatment. Phulambri police have registered a case of accidental death and initiated a probe. Citing preliminary findings, police maintained the brothers were marginal farmers and had outstanding loan from a bank and a private money lender. The irregular rainfall this year dented their hopes of getting a bumper produce and repaying their outstanding loans. Prabhakar was also under tremendous stress after his younger brother’s demise. “The brothers had decided to cultivate sugarcane for quickly clearing all the debts, but the untimely death of the younger brother pushed the elder one into depression,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-ends-life-by-suicide-in-phulambri/articleshow/85187285.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||PCC chief seeks action on STF report on drugs||Chandigarh: Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu is back at hitting out at his own party’s state government led by chief minister Amarinder Singh. On Monday, he alleged that there had been a delay in acting on a report prepared by the Punjab Police special task force (STF) on drugs. He said if the sealed report was not made public, he would move a resolution in the next assembly session. He also sought to know action taken against SAD leader and Majitha MLA Bikram Singh Majithia. In a thread posted on Twitter, Sidhu said it was in February 2018 that the STF headed by ADGP Harpreet Sidhu had filed a “status report” in the Punjab and Haryana high court, which showed investigations into “statements and evidence recorded by ED that were submitted before the court in the case of Majithia and others involvement in drug trafficking”. “What investigation had Punjab Police done? What action had the Punjab government taken? Must be brought into the public domain. Since submission of reports, what further action did the state take in 2.5 years ? The government must make itself accountable to the public with complete transparency,” he added. He tweeted that he had held a press conference that year, asking the state government to immediately act upon the information shared by STF with the court, after investigating into “incriminating evidence produced before the court by Enforcement Directorate”. The high court had asked the Punjab government to proceed as per law on the STF report. Sidhu said in another tweet: “On May 23, 2018, the government filed before the court an opinion-cum-status report that still awaits the light of day in a sealed envelope. After 2.5 years of delay, how much more the people of Punjab should wait?” Sidhu added: “No substantial order has been passed by Hon’ble Court in 2.5 years on this matter that impacts lives of Punjab’s youth. Govt must move a plea for preponement of opening of sealed reports to the earliest taking case against Majithia to a logical conclusion, punishing the guilty. Punishing culprits behind drug trade is Congress’s priority under an 18-point agenda. What is the action taken on Majithia?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pcc-chief-seeks-action-on-stf-report-on-drugs/articleshow/85193911.cms||---
---||Delhi||Doctors at Delhi’s Apollo Hospital remove tumour bigger than size of baby’s heart in rare surgery||NEW DELHI: In a rare surgery, doctors at Delhi’s Apollo Hospital recently removed a tumour that was attached to the surface of the heart of a newborn. It was bigger than the baby's heart itself, doctors said. Dr Rajesh Sharma, senior paediatric cardiac surgeon at Apollo, said it took them nearly two hours to remove the tumour. “The heart has a surrounding membrane called pericardium. This tumour was within the pericardium and was attached to the aorta. We had to be very careful while operating on the two-day-old baby and see no surrounding organs and tissues were damaged,” said Sharma. The mother, a resident of Noida, was in the 20th week of pregnancy when the tumour was detected in the foetus. Operating on the foetus could have increased the risks, so the doctors decided to wait till after delivery to surgically remove the tumour. At birth, the baby weighed a normal 3.2kg, but had trouble breathing. He was immediately intubated and put on a ventilator. A CT angio showed a giant intra-pericardial tumour that was pushing the heart to the left and compressing the lung. The baby’s condition was precarious and, therefore, an immediate surgery was planned. “The tumour was so big that the child’s heart wasn’t visible. Also, any attempt to remove the tumour would cause a fall in the blood pressure. We had to put the child on a heart-lung machine to remove the tumour in one piece,” Sharma said. An intra-pericardial teratoma arising from the heart of a foetus is an "exceedingly rare tumour". A major concern with such a tumour is the life-threatening pressure that it exerts on the foetus' heart and lungs, the hospital authorities said. Dr Ashutosh Marwah, paediatric cardiology surgeon at Apollo, added that there have been no significant deleterious effects of the tumour on the lungs or heart. “Though the tumour removal is supposed to be curative in most cases, in this rare case the baby will need regular follow-up with tumour marker levels and echocardiographic examinations.” For now, the baby has shown good recovery and has been discharged in a healthy condition, the doctors said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doctors-remove-tumour-bigger-than-size-of-babys-heart-in-rare-surgery/articleshow/85221536.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

When the villagers realized that the camp was not taking place, they blocked Kovilpalayam Road near Kottayampalayam bus stand, brining traffic to a sudden halt. When alerted, health officials and the Kovilpalayam police rushed to the spot and held talks with the agitating villagers, who were pacified and sent back to their houses with a promise to organize the vaccination drive in the coming days.Among the protesters were many MGNREGA workers who were insisting on getting inoculated, stating they were prone to contract the virus given the nature of their work.The health staffer said some anti-social elements had circulated a message on WhatsApp stating that a vaccination camp would be held in the village on Monday. “It created utter chaos. We have asked police to take appropriate action against the people who spread the false message to avoid such incidents in the future.”He said vaccination camps weren’t held in rural areas on the day.S Rajathi, one of the villagers, said she was waiting for more than a month to get inoculated.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Oppn slams govt over rehab, RKI||Thiruvananthapuram: As the memories of Pettimudy disaster were revived on its first anniversary last Friday, the opposition attacked the government in the assembly on Monday alleging a lukewarm approach on the rehabilitation and rebuilding process, specifically citing the slow progress of the much-touted Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RKI). The opposition alleged that the government was diverting funds provided by the World Bank for undertaking rebuilding initiatives. Seeking the leave for adjournment motion on this subject, Kalpetta MLA T Siddique said that the rehabilitation and compensation for those who lost their lives and property in Pettimudy, Kavalappara and Puthumala are yet to be completed. Responding to the allegations, revenue minister K Rajan listed the activities undertaken by the government even beyond what the Centre’s guidelines said during such calamities. He said that the state has been offering more than twice the compensation amount as recommended by the Centre’s guidelines in such disasters. He said that the compensation for 46 families of the 66 who lost their lives in Pettimudy have been disbursed, and the remaining 20 will be completed this week itself. He said that the delay in disbursement of compensations of those remaining in these disasters are due to issues in their necessary records. Opposition leader V D Satheesan, however, said that it is unfortunate that the revenue minister whose department is responsible for rectifying the records is making such excuses. He said that the opposition is not claiming that the government has not done anything for the victims, but whatever has begun has not been completed. Citing a reply by the revenue minister himself in the assembly, he said that there are 2,557 persons in Kozhikode alone, yet to receive financial assistance announced by the government. “The opposition is not politicizing these matters, but it is our responsibility to raise them here. The basic step to be taken under risk mitigation during such calamities is to relocate people residing in such calamity-prone areas, which itself has not been done,” he said. He slammed the government’s RKI citing that even though necessary funds are being earmarked every year in the budget, not a single rupee is being spent for programmes under RKI. He said that Rs 1,000 crore is being earmarked every year for RKI in the budget, but the expenditure is nil. In addition, the state received Rs 1,779.58 crore as the first tranche from the World Bank for RKI. The government has since 2018 cleared administrative sanction for projects only worth Rs 7,405.10 crore of which only Rs 460.92 crore has been spent, he said. At the same time, crores of rupees have been spent on conducting conclaves, rent for hiring an office for RKI, furnishing them and appointing consultants, the opposition leader said. He further charged that Keralites world over contributed more than Rs 5,000 crore towards CMDRF and the government diverted all these funds for other purposes, delaying the rehabilitation, rebuild and compensation. The opposition later staged a walk-out after speaker M B Rajesh refused permission for adjournment motion on the basis of the reply by the revenue minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-slams-govt-over-rehab-rki/articleshow/85191788.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Ahead of festive season, veggie & fruits prices bite into middle-class budget||BHOPAL: Since the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic, prices of essential commodities have been rising and fruits and vegetables are no exception. But ahead of the festival season, their steep prices have started affecting the family budgets, deeply. Even as mangoes flooded the fruit markets in the summer this season, their prices seldom came down below Rs 90 per Kg. Summer vegetables like gilki and bhindi were selling for Rs 80 per Kg. As of now, lauki, kaddu and baigan at Rs 40 per Kg are some of the cheapest vegetables available; cheapest of the lot, however, is potatoes for Rs 20 per Kg. Pointing to consistent rainfall over the past few days, Vegetable sellers claim that vegetable prices will rise further in the next few days as vegetables will start rotting with fields marooned. So, parval, shimla mirch and even bhindi could touch Rs 100 per Kg mark in the next few days. “Right from our childhood, we have seen a bumper mango crop one year and far lesser yield next year. Supply of mangoes in the market this summer suggested it was the year of bumper crop, but prices of mangoes remained high till the end of the season. Year before last, we had bought mangoes for Rs 40 per Kg. Like everything else, mangoes, too, have become far dearer. For months, apples have been selling for Rs 200 per Kg or more,” said Vinod Shrivastava, who said eating fruits and vegetables is the best solution to a person's health problems. But, how does one get to eat enough of fruits/vegetables at the prices they are available? "Ever since, doctors, media and dieticians started recommending protein-rich diet to people to develop greater immunity following outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic, prices of pulses and vegetables have gone up considerably. I bought beans for Rs 250 per Kg. How do you expect a common man and his family to have a healthy diet when prices of everything are so high,” said Rakesh Kochar, a marketing executive for an electric company. President of Bittan Market Sabji Vyapari Mahasangh, Hariom Khatik, however, said that vegetables were cheap till recently, but their prices have started going up now and in next few days, they would spike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ahead-of-festive-season-veggie-fruits-prices-bite-into-middle-class-budget/articleshow/85191769.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

---||Kolhapur||‘Set up backward classes panel with Maratha members’||Kolhapur: The members of Sakal Maratha Samaj from Kollhapur, on Monday, demanded that the state government set up a state backward classes commission with 30% Maratha representatives and grant the reservation to the Maratha community under the other backward class (OBC) category. Representatives of the Maratha community gathered in the city to discuss the future of the Maratha reservation issue. The Supreme Court has already cancelled the reservation granted to the community by state government by forming a separate category. Baba Indulkar, the convenor of the Sakal Maratha Samaj, Kolhapur, said, “We reiterate our demand to include Marathas under OBC. The state government should constitute a backward classes commission with 30% Maratha representatives in it. The commission should study the need for reservation for Marathas and submit the report to the government in six months. We are writing to the government in detail about our demands.” The legal experts attending the meeting of community representatives said if the Maratha community gets a reservation under OBC, it will test on legal grounds. Indulkar, who is also a lawyer, said, “If the Marathas are put under OBC, then the limit of 50% reservations put by SC in Indira Sawhney case will not be breached. The SC had stayed Maratha reservation as it surpassed the 50% limit. We believe that Maratha leaders and leaders across the political spectrum fear to make the demand of putting Maratha under OBC for their vote bank politics. But there is no other way to get justice for the community,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/set-up-backward-classes-panel-with-maratha-members/articleshow/85187361.cms||---

---||Madurai||Overage man can’t get job on compassionate grounds, says Madras high court||MADURAI: Taking into account that there was no provision for granting age relaxation for compassionate appointment as per Tamil Nadu Municipal Service Rules, 1970, the Madras high court has dismissed a plea moved by a man seeking compassionate appointment following his father’s death. The court was hearing the petition filed by K Ravi. The petitioner’s father who was working as an employee at Aruppukottai municipality in Virudhunagar district died during service in 2015. Though the petitioner submitted an application seeking compassionate appointment, the authorities had rejected the same in 2016, on the ground that he had crossed the maximum age limit fixed for appointment by direct recruitment on compassionate grounds. Ravi’s counsel submitted that the petitioner belongs to scheduled tribe community and he was eligible for age relaxation. He submitted that as per the Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Service Rules, maximum age limit is not applicable to the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe candidates. Objecting the contentions of the petitioner, the standing counsel appearing for the municipality, submitted that as per Tamil Nadu Municipal Service Rules, the maximum age limit for appointment by direct recruitment on compassionate grounds, shall be 30 years in respect of sons or the unmarried daughters and 40 years in respect of wife or husband of the municipal employee. Taking cognizance of the submissions, justice D Krishnakumar observed that the rules is applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case and there is no provision for granting age relaxation for compassionate appointment. Unless there is age relaxation in the statute, the court cannot traverse the period prescribed by the authority. In view of the settled legal position, this court is of the view that the contention of the petitioner for age relaxation is liable to be rejected, observed the judge while dismissing his petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-relaxation-in-age-for-compassionate-appointment/articleshow/85193934.cms||---

The suspect, who is a Class IV employee, was caught red-handed while inoculating industrial workers in a rented room. The incident brought to light the alleged racket of creating ‘artificial vaccine shortage’ to make money. The accused has been identified as Ganesh Dhurude. Dhurude used to charge each worker Rs 300. He used to take them to a rented room and personally administer the vaccine dose from vials illegally lifted from Shahjapur vaccination centre. Police seized 10 vials fromhis bag.Shiv Sena’s youth wing leader Rajendra Janjal, who played a key role in busting the alleged racket, said it has been in operation for the past two months. Some people are taking advantage of the industrial workers’ desperation to get inoculated, he said. It must be noted that the industrial houses have made it mandatory for the workers to get inoculated.Senior police officers have expressed doubts about the racket being run single-handedly by a lower-rung employee without the knowledge and consent of senior health officials. Police have detained one more health worker, but his role is yet to be ascertained.MIDC Waluj inspector Madhukar Sawant told TOI: “On the complaint lodged by the district health officer, we are in the process of registering a case of criminal breach of trust and cheating.” The officer said there are allegations that the suspect would create an artificial shortage at the vaccination centre in Waluj industrial area. The suspect used to assure the workers that he would get them the shots. He used to collect their Aadhaar cards, get them registered online and collect the inoculation certificates. In return, the accused collected money from the beneficiaries.Sawant said: “If other health department officials are found to be involved, they will face sections under the Prevention of Corruption Act, and other sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act.”The health department has ordered an independent inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/one-nabbed-for-inoculating-workers-using-stolen-vax-vials/articleshow/85187410.cms||Mohammed Akhef

He said the investigation should go deeper to ascertain the involvement of senior officers of the food and supply department. These directions were issued by Justice Gill to the chief director-cum-DGP, Vigilance Bureau B K Uppal, after the food and supply department marked the case for probe by the bureau. The embezzled wheat was meant for distribution under the National Food Security Act to the needy. The Central Vigilance Committee of the state food and supplies department from Chandigarh is undertaking a special physical verification of Pungrain wheat stocks at Jandiala Guru after it came to light that inspector Jasdev is absconding. As per the preliminary report, 1.84 lakh bags (50 kg jute and 30 kg polypropylene) pertaining to wheat crop of 2018-19, 2020-21 and 2021-22 were found to be short. Their cost is approximately Rs 20 crore. District food and supply officer Amarinder Singh and assistant food and supply officer Arshdeep Singh at Jandiala Guru have already been placed under suspension and departmental proceedings against them have started. Departmental proceedings have also been initiated against Amritsar district food and supply controller Raj Rishi Mehra and his predecessor Jasjit Kaur for supervisory lapses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cvc-probe-roots-of-wheat-bungling-senior-officials-role/articleshow/85193957.cms||---

Others started screaming but the driver could not apply the brakes and before others could have moved to protect themselves, the truck crushed them,” said deputy superintendent of police K J Chaudhari. Parmar, 24, was arrested after an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and rash driving was registered against him. The offence was lodged based on the complaint given by Viram’s relative Hira Rathod, who was also sleeping in one of the houses, but escaped with minor injuries. Following the accident, chief minister Vijay Rupani announced an ex-gratia of Rs four lakh each for the kin of the eight victims. He also asked the Amreli district collector to provide immediate help and submit a probe report of the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/8-killed-in-sleep-as-truck-rams-into-huts-in-amreli/articleshow/85189439.cms||---

Though the family had not lodged a complaint of his missing, it was looking for him. The Uttar Pradesh (UP)-based family got its son back after a gap of two years due to the proactive roles of a Unique Identification Authority of India’s (UIDAI) Aadhaar Seva Kendra (ASK) manager and a superintendent of the children home. Jayanth, alias Shivam Chauhan, was rescued by railway police in August 2019 from Nagpur railway station. It’s learnt that hearing and speech-impaired Chauhan was unable to communicate through sign language, as he never went to special schools to learn it. The boy was sheltered at the government’s home, where the authorities tried to communicate with him through different means and through experts, but nothing worked out. As he could not reveal his name, the boy was rechristened as ‘Jayant’. It was later learnt that Jayant had a suffered a fall on the sixth day after his birth, which likely left him with the disabilities for the rest of the life. Jayant’s repatriation process met with a major roadblock due to the pandemic. The shelter home authorities had made some efforts prior to that, but nothing succeeded. Superintendent Vinod Daberao said his final attempt to ascertain the identity and home address of the boy was through Aadhaar verification. “We had initially contacted a local Aadhaar centre but could not find out any details. Finally, we approached Captain Anil Marathe of UIDAI’s ASK to help establish the boy’s identity,” he said. Ex-serviceman Marathe, who had last month helped a boy reunite with his family after more than a decade through Aadhaar verification, said he got a confirmation from UIDAI’s Bengaluru office that Jayant’s Aadhaar card was made somewhere, but had to take permission from the regional office for further processing. “We had some official correspondence with the regional office of UIDAI in Mumbai from where the password for opening the Aadhaar card was sent to us,” said Marathe, adding that the boy’s Aadhaar card had been created in 2016. Marathe said the Aadhaar card revealed that Jayant’s real name was Shivam Chauhan and that he was from Itauri Bazaar, within the limits of Sonikpur police station in UP. Daberao said Sonikpur police were alerted about Jayant and asked to help contact his family. “His father came to Nagpur on August 2 and took the boy along the following day,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/aadhaar-helps-hearing-speech-impaired-teen-reunite-with-family-after-two-years/articleshow/85191827.cms||Soumitra Bose

As water in Seep river recedes, people who fled to relief camps have started to return home, wading through the slush. Once at home, they are coming to terms with the reality and magnitude of the devastation. Most villagers who have returned sit under plastic sheets over the rubble of their houses helplessly staring at the heap of stones and bricks of what once used to be their home. With sunset, most of the villages go pitched dark as electricity is yet to be restored. There is sludge all around and rains have yet not stopped. The weather office still predicts heavy rainfall in the region. The administration is providing plastic sheets & food packets for immediate reliefA heartbroken Ramlal Prajapati stands before a pile of rubble near Manpur village, about 15 km away from the district headquarters. His wife and two children sit nearby, trying to figure out how to start their life again. “ Nothing is left after the floods”, he told the relief workers reaching out to people like him, on Monday. “ The PM Awas scheme collapsed as it submerged in the flood waters. All the belongings were washed away. No clothes, no beds, no food - we have nothing left with us”. There are as many as 50 such villages including Soikala Mewada and Kotra, where people are facing similar dilemma. Akram Khan , a social worker who reached Manpur village along with his team members, said, “ As we navigated through the muddy waters, we had to cross knee-deep sludge.” The administration is providing plastic sheets and food packets for immediate relief, but people are worried about their dwelling and future. New district collector Shivam Verma said , “Initial survey report suggests 15,000 families were hit by the floods in about 100 revenue villages. For immediate relief, food packets are being distributed. No one would be left out.” Gradually compensation for houses, cattle loss and crop loss will also be provided, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/flood-battered-sheopur-villages-turn-to-rubble/articleshow/85191806.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

He said that the government is duty-bound to ensure all facilities for the doctors to discharge their duties. He instructed all those concerned to ensure that there is CCTV surveillance in the out-patient department and casualties. This should be ensured in both private hospitals as well. In hospitals where there are police aid posts, the CCTV system should be linked to such aid-posts. While appointing security officers in out-patient and casualties, retired ex-military personnel should be employed. This does not mean that those who are serving at present should be removed. He instructed that the trouble makers should be arrested immediately in such incidents. In large hospitals like the medical colleges, the services of state industrial security force (SISF) should be utilized. This should be enforced when the contract with the existing security agencies gets over. He said that the security personnel should also be given adequate training. The meeting was attended by health minister Veena George, chief secretary V P Joy, additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) T K Jose, state police chief Anil Kant, principal secretary (health and family welfare) Rajan Khobragade, ADGP (intelligence) T K Vinod Kumar and ADGP (law and order) Vijay Sakhare.

The variant has been classified as ‘Variant of Concern’ by the Centre because of the increased transmissibility and stronger binding to receptors of lung cells.One 60-year-old man from the Waluj area in Aurangabad, who had tested Covid positive on July 2, was infected with the Delta-plus variant. A 70-year-old man from Aziz Pura area of Beed district was found to be carrying the same variant after testing positive on June 4, the authorities said.While the patient from Aurangabad has already recovered and is maintaining good health, the patient from Beed died on July 6 even after recovering from Covid. He was in hospital for 10 days for Covid treatment, it was said.Dr Swapnil Lale, the deputy director of health for Aurangabad division, on Monday said the samples of Covid patients collected for genome sequencing on a random basis revealed the presence of the Delta-plus variant. “The health teams have been deployed for contact-tracing and Covid testing of close contacts of the patient. As per early information, he (the Aurangabad patient) had not undergone vaccination prior to contracting the infection,” he said.Beed district health officer Dr Rauf Shaikh said the patient with Delta-plus variant was cured and the cause of his death is yet to be ascertained.“Being a densely-populated locality, we have initiated health survey in the Aziz Pura area to identify citizens with possible symptoms of Covid-19. A rigorous drive involving contact-tracing and Covid testing has been ordered in the area concerned and its adjoining places,” he said.Beed district, which is struggling to contain the number of fresh cases, had the highest number of active cases (1,827 ) among eight districts of Marathwada till Sunday.Downplaying fears associated with the detection of the Delta-plus variant in Marathwada, health authorities said Covid-appropriate behaviour along with vaccination can reduce the infection of any virus strain.“Following the basics such as physical distancing, washing of hands, wearing good quality masks and vaccination can check the spread of Covid. People should not become complacent during any stage of the pandemic, failing which resurgence of another Covid wave is imminent,” Lale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/one-delta-case-each-found-in-aurangabad-beed-dists/articleshow/85187482.cms||Prasad Joshi

Confusing the world’s smallest cat for a street cat, they clicked selfies and kept the rare species with them. “The children uploaded the picture on their WhatsApp groups. We received a call that a leopard cub had been found. When we reached the spot, we realized it was a spotted cat. Our team patrolled the area and later released the animal. However, we didn't find any kittens,” said Mukesh Kumar, a forest department staff at Masuda. It was a rare sighting as this cat does not have a large population. “This species was spotted for the first time and we have informed our seniors," said the forest staff. After examining the picture, experts confirmed that it was a rusty spotted cat. Anil Roger, a wildlife enthusiast said, “The cat is listed as ‘near threatened’ on the IUCN Red List. The forest department should find if there are any more kittens and reunite them with the mother.” Experts claimed that the species is found only in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. It was last spotted in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) during the lockdown and in Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) around three years back. This member of the cat family prefers dense vegetation and rocky areas. The elusive rusty spotted cat, found in just three Asian countries, was gifted to Europe decades ago by Sri Lanka. The smallest cat found in European countries is the direct descendants of the ones that were gifted to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/rare-rusty-spotted-cat-found-in-ajmer-village/articleshow/85198121.cms||---

If residents have got complacent, then the authorities should get strict in enforcing the rules.”Another resident, who did not wish to be named, said, “Earlier, the authorities would issue challans to the violators, but nowadays there are no checks. At times, cops entrusted with enforcing the pandemic guidelines are seen without a mask. If people disregard rules, then the authorities should get cracking.”The district administration authorities, however, said guidelines would be enforced strictly.Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said, “Field staff as well as the police will be directed to implement Covid rules in view of the threat of the third wave.” “People should realize that by not following norms, they are not only putting themselves at risk of contracting the virus, but others also,” said Dr Saroj Aggarwal, president of Ludhiana IMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/residents-distance-themselves-from-mask-despite-third-wave-warning/articleshow/85189365.cms||Shariq Majeed

Chief minister M K Stalin should make clear the reason behind the move and ensure that those who want to become cardholders are allowed,” he said.On May 15, Aavin reduced Rs 3 per litre on its all varieties of milk.

While it has come out clearly in Sultanpur Lodhi, where a group of party volunteers have announced to contest on their own and to launch a campaign on Tuesday, it is learnt that trouble is brewing at other places also. From Sultanpur Lodhi, the party appointed Sajjan Singh Cheema as constituency in-charge, which actually means perspective candidate. Cheema was party candidate in 2017 also but had later joined SAD. He returned to AAP a couple of months back and was appointed constituency in-charge soon after. AAP Youth Wing state secretary Angrej Singh and a group of volunteers say the party has again rewarded a person who left them after losing the 2017 elections. “Volunteers who remained with the party during the thick and thin and worked hard to reach out the the people way back in 2013 are being ignored. This is happening at other places also and we have decided to challenge such imposition and injustice with volunteers,” he said while speaking to TOI on Monday. Angrej said the group would pay obeisance at Gurdwara Ber Sahib at Sultanpur Lodhi before launching their campaign. “I shall contest the election, come what may,” he said, while adding that he has been with the party since 2013 and worked in every election at ground level. Angrej and others who accompanied him on Friday when they announced to contest the election and opposed Cheema’s candidature are still part of the party. Enquiries from other constituencies revealed that barring one or two places, problem is brewing at places where those who joined the party recently have been announced constituency in-charges they are already campaigning through small meetings. Sources said that some of the AAP leaders who can be potential contenders have been called to the party’s state office for “feedback” and counselling. There have been quite a few posts on social media on ‘parachute’ candidates causing heart burn among old party cadres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ticket-trouble-in-aap-youth-wing-leader-rebels-in-sultanpur-lodhi/articleshow/85194001.cms||IP Singh

Girish Navase, the president of the association, said the sale was picking up ever since the relaxations on the curbs were announced and the shops were allowed to function till 8 pm. “People are now able to spend more time at the shops and select their choice of jewellery. The increase in the time limits has helped the jewellers and the customers, whose number is increasing day by day,” Navase said. The business of the association members is above Rs 10 crore per day, when the shops close at 8 pm. “It was below the 10-crore mark. The marked difference is for several reasons like the prices of gold and silver dropping and more people buying gold,” he said. The rise in the footfall of customers is in the evening. Earlier, due to restrictions, the customers would avoid visiting the shops for reasons like overcrowding. “With the increase in duration, the customers now find time to spend at the shops along with family members,” said Akshay Deolalkar. “What brings me to the shops is getting the feel of the yellow metal and the fascinating designs. Online shopping offered a limited choice. I can experience the jewellery. During the lockdown, I waited for this moment,” said Amrita Kulkarni, an employee in a private company. Rakesh Kamble, said, “There was a medical emergency in my family and I had to sell some of my gold jewellery.

---||Delhi||4 sent to judicial custody as probe at a nascent stage||New Delhi: A Delhi court sent lawyer and former BJP spokesperson Ashwani Upadhyay and three others to judicial custody for two days on Tuesday for the alleged slogans raised against a minority community at Jantar Mantar on August 8. Metropolitan magistrate Tanvi Khurana remanded Upadhyay, Preet Singh, Vinod Sharma and Deepak Kumar in judicial custody, saying the investigation was at a nascent stage and the possibility of the arrested tampering with evidence couldn’t be ruled out. The court also sent Deepak Singh Hindu and Vineet Bajpai into police custody for a day. Additional public prosecutor Atul Srivastava argued in court that the deputy commissioner of police, New Delhi, had received an email from Upadhyay seeking permission for a gathering of 50-60 persons at Jantar Mantar. He claimed that despite police denying permission, Upadhyay, with a “pre-determined” mindset, reached the venue, organised the gathering and raised slogans. The public prosecutor alleged that Upadhyay was very “aggressive”. He argued that the custody of the accused, either of the police or judicial, was necessary to unearth the hidden agenda behind mobilising the crowd and to identify the others involved. Srivastava said, “At the time when Parliament is in session, Independence Day is round the corner and the country is still struggling with the pandemic, the accused called a huge gathering, did not follow Covid-19 protocols and shouted slogans spreading communal hatred.” He also pointed out that the incident was captured by several cameras and the videos had gone viral, further spreading religious enmity. Advocate Ashwani Dubey, appearing for Upadhyay, said his client had the reputation for being a man who had filed more than 100 public interest petitions for bring in social reforms in the country. He claimed that Upadhyay was not the trustee of Save India Foundation, which had organised Sunday’s programme. The lawyer maintained, “Upadhyay left Jantar Mantar at 12 noon and the sloganeering happened at 5pm. He was not even present there… He is co-operating in the investigation and soon after he received a call at midnight, he reached the police station at 2am. Since then, he is not being allowed to take his phone calls. He has neither been provided a copy of the FIR filed against him nor has he been allowed to meet his family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-sent-to-judicial-custody-as-probe-at-a-nascent-stage/articleshow/85221671.cms||Usha Das
---||Madurai||Demand to boost infra in Madurai||Madurai: Even as the white paper on the state’s economy has been released by finance minister and Madurai Central MLA P T R Palanivel Thiaga Rajan that shows a heavy deficit and the burden on each family, hopes are riding high on the minister to give a boost to infrastructure in Madurai in the revised budget to be presented on August 13. In a pre-budget memorandum to Rajan and commercial taxes minister P Moorthy, the Tamilnadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry has pressed for implementation of eight different infrastructure projects in Madurai that will benefit a cross section of the populace. This includes introducing metro rail services and a bus port in the city.Chamber president N Jegatheesan said that Madurai with a population of more than 25 lakh is the second most affected by traffic crisis in the state after Chennai. Increasing number of vehicles day-by-day, lack of adequate wide roads and necessary flyovers are attributed as reasons for the traffic congestion. Introduction of metro rail project will greatly help to overcome the problem.While metro rail has been announced in Coimbatore, non-announcement for Madurai is a great disappointment to the people in southern districts of Tamil Nadu. The chamber said that it is possible to extend the same to Madurai as the Union government would sanction if the state approves to cover 50% of the total cost incurred in a city with a population of more than 10 lakh.The trade body said that the proposal to set up bus ports in Salem, Coimbatore and Madurai were simultaneously made by the Union government and added that it is learnt that sanction was accorded for the two other cities. Work has commenced to establish the port at Rs 1,600 crore in Salem. Stating that the district administration identified a site at Karadikal, near AIIMS, as suitable for the project, they pressed for expedition of the project.Jegatheesan said that the state government should allot adequate funds for interlinking of rivers within Tamil Nadu in a phased manner, starting with this budget. This includes the 256km-long canal to link Cauvery river with Vaigai from Mayanoor in Karur district. This should be prioritised considering the immense benefits the mega scheme would help the common man enjoy.The chamber also pressed for expediting construction of AIIMS that has not seen major development but for construction of the compound wall more than two-and-a-half-years after the foundation stone was laid by the Prime Minister on January 27, 2019.

Confusing the world’s smallest cat for a street cat, they clicked selfies and kept the rare species with them. “The children uploaded the picture on their WhatsApp groups. We received a call that a leopard cub had been found. When we reached the spot, we realized it was a spotted cat. Our team patrolled the area and later released the animal. However, we didn't find any kittens,” said Mukesh Kumar, a forest department staff at Masuda. It was a rare sighting as this cat does not have a large population. “This species was spotted for the first time and we have informed our seniors," said the forest staff. After examining the picture, experts confirmed that it was a rusty spotted cat. Anil Roger, a wildlife enthusiast said, “The cat is listed as ‘near threatened’ on the IUCN Red List. The forest department should find if there are any more kittens and reunite them with the mother.” Experts claimed that the species is found only in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. It was last spotted in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) during the lockdown and in Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) around three years back. This member of the cat family prefers dense vegetation and rocky areas. The elusive rusty spotted cat, found in just three Asian countries, was gifted to Europe decades ago by Sri Lanka. The smallest cat found in European countries is the direct descendants of the ones that were gifted to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rare-rusty-spotted-cat-found-in-ajmer-village/articleshow/85194000.cms||---

Hookah lounges have been mushrooming in the city in the recent years, and has become a popular hangout spot for youngsters — especially college students and also schoolchildren. These lounges are becoming breeding ground for drug peddlers. Almost all such hookah lounges operating in the city flout the Supreme Court guidelines and little has been done to rein in them. The hookah lounges are operated as restaurants and hence they come under the jurisdiction of Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but most of the time it is police that act against such offenders. The FDA provides licenses only for operating restaurants and serving food items. It doesn’t provide a license to operate hookah lounges. But there are clear guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in this regard and most of the restaurants operating in the city are violating them. It is observed, these hookah lounges violate the norms repeatedly, but owners or managers walk away with a minor penalty. The restaurant raided on Sunday night, was raided six days ago on August 3 as well. At that time too the managers – Anuj Saxena and Harjeet Singh— were found serving liquor illegally to their customers. Shahpura police had regisitered a case against three accused, including the two restaurant managers and a customer. On Sunday night too, managers Anuj and Harjeet were serving tobacco hookahs to customers. Police seized the hookahs and registered a case against six accused including managers Anuj and Harjeet along with four customers— Jay Pandagre, Abhishek Lodhi, Manish Pawar and Arpit Verma. The accused were booked under relevant sections of The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act. FDA inspector Dharmendra said that no license is issued for running hookah lounge. He said that a ‘Tobacco Cell’ at NHM and drug inspectors monitor hookah lounges. ASP (Crime Branch) Gopal Singh Dhakad admitted that many students visit the hookah lounges at restaurants. He said there are no clear guidelines specifically for hookah lounges. Police act against them based on information of any illegal activity. He said that there is a need for the excise department and FDA to conduct regular inspections at these spots and monitor their activities. Police will help the departments in joint action, he said. Counsel of café and lounge vyapari association, advocate Ravikant Patidar said that all the hookah lounges in the city have separate smoking zones wherein they comply with the guidelines laid down by Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/hookah-lounges-operate-as-restaurants-in-violation-of-sc-norms-6-held-in-fresh-raid/articleshow/85191853.cms||Sudeept Mishra

Addressing a press conference, Bhatia said he had no personal opposition to Grewal but merits of ticket distribution were on his (Bhatia’s) side. “Grewal can be fielded from any reserve constituency. Earlier also, he contested from Kartarpur (reserve) constituency as AAP candidate. I have been working for the party for the last 40 years and I deserve to be candidate while Grewal joined only in 2019,” he said. Bhatia said he had asked senior party leaders to reconsider the decision after which he and his supporters would decide next course of action. Grewal comes from the Balmiki community and Akali Dal has fielded him from the general seat, apparently to strike a balance between the two biggest scheduled caste communities – Adi-dharmi/Ravidasia and Mazhabi Sikhs/Balmikis, besides attracting Balmiki voters at other seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-too-faces-rebellion-over-new-seat-in-charge/articleshow/85194033.cms||---

The war-like situation was created in the village past Sunday midnight. Remanan P N, 71, a Gulf returnee, was attacked with a sword injuring his hand. His hand was fractured after being hit by an iron rod. His pregnant daughter-in-law fell unconscious after being assaulted when she tried to prevent him from being attacked and her three-year-old daughter is yet to recover from the shock. Police said that Reji, first accused, and Udayakumar, the second accused, both CPM workers, were arrested based on the family’s complaint. Cases have been charged against 30 individuals, including Sanju, under IPC sections 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 145 (rioting) and Explosives act. Police have recovered a sword from the scene. According to Reshmi S Remanan, daughter of the injured person, the family members woke up in the middle of the night after hearing sounds of trees being axed and the compound wall being demolished. The family bought the property 30 years ago and there was a dispute over providing road access to a few houses. “Based on a court order, land for a four-feet wide road was given 15 years ago. But now, they want another road passing through the middle of our property,” she said. Meanwhile, Sanju said that he had gone to the place only after local residents informed him about the violence. “I arrived there in the presence of the police. I had urged the trouble makers to retract. I have no connection with the incident,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/case-against-cpm-activists-for-midnight-attack-on-family/articleshow/85191979.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC: Hurling ‘love’ chit at married woman is outraging of modesty||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court has ruled that throwing a chit at a married woman for professing love amounts to outraging her modesty. It slapped a Rs 90,000 fine on the 54-year-old accused from Akola, of which Rs 85,000 is to be paid to the survivor as compensation.While upholding the conviction order pronounced by the Akola sessions court, the HC added that the modesty of a woman is her “most precious jewel” and there cannot be a “straitjacket formula to ascertain whether it’s outraged.”“The complainant is a married woman of 45 years age. The very act of throwing a chit on her person which professes love for her, and which contains poetic verses, albeit extremely, is sufficient to outrage her modesty,” Justice Rohit Deo held.The judge added that he had no reason to disbelieve the woman’s evidence that the petitioner threw a chit at her containing objectionable material. “No fault can be found with concurrent finding that the accused outraged her modesty. Her testimony that he used to flirt, make gestures like pouting of lips, and on occasions used to hit her with small pebbles, is confidence-inspiring.”The incident happened on October 3, 2011, when the petitioner, owner of a neighbouring grocery shop, approached the woman when she was washing utensils and tried to hand over a chit. After she refused to accept it, he threw it at her and left muttering “I love you.” The next day, he made obscene gestures and warned her not to disclose the chit’s contents.After she lodged a complaint, the sessions court convicted the man under Sections 354, 509 and 506 of IPC and sentenced him to two years of rigorous imprisonment on June 21, 2018. He was also slapped a Rs 40,000 fine, of which Rs 35,000 was to be paid to the woman as compensation.The man challenged the verdict by filing a criminal revision application contending that the survivor had lodged a false complaint as she had purchased groceries on credit from his shop and was not inclined to pay the amount.While striking down his conviction under Section 506, Deo observed that he deserved a chance to reform and set off his remaining period of sentence. “The petitioner has already undergone 45 days of incarceration. Considering the date of the incident, as the provisions of law stood then, there was no minimum sentence provided for offence punishable under Section 354. It is only by the 2013 amendment that a minimum sentence is provided.”The judge, however, enhanced the fine amount to Rs 90,000 and told the petitioner to deposit it in trial court within 15 days. “He shall file an affidavit of compliance in the registry. The trial magistrate shall ensure that the survivor is made aware of this judgment and the enhanced fine is duly paid to her. If due to death or any other reason, she is not available, then it should be paid to her legal heirs,” the judge said, before disposing of the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-hurling-love-chit-at-married-woman-is-outraging-of-modesty/articleshow/85191947.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Pointing out that the DMK is in power, he termed the report unnecessary as it could have been debated in the assembly.The Thirumangalam MLA made the remark while addressing party functionaries at a consultative meeting at the Amma temple shortly after the report was released by finance minister R B Udhayakumar on Monday. “They register cases against us if we ask them to fulfil their election promise of reducing fuel price,” he said.“People have started debating if the white paper report is the start to fulfil election promises or to put a full stop to escape from fulfilling poll assurances,” he said. Commenting on the report, he said that the AIADMK government created infrastructure such as roads and water connection to villages when they were in power from 2011 and helped the state recover from power crisis during the previous DMK government.The former minister highlighted people welfare measures including freebies given away by their government and attributed them as the expenses incurred during their 10-year tenure. He listed out that their government distributed 52 lakh laptops free of cost to students, 20 kgs of free rice every month to 2 crore families, free gold for weddings of girls from economically deprived families and cattle for the rural populace.“Our government allocated Rs 4,200 crore for old age pension for 35 lakh beneficiaries, against Rs 1,200 crore allotted by the DMK government for a mere 12 lakh beneficiaries,” he said, adding there are many such welfare schemes of the AIADMK government that were well received by the people. Udhayakumar said that the AIADMK has fulfilled all the assurances they made in the 2011 elections.He accused the DMK of misleading the people with 505 election assurances including Rs 1,000 for women every month. Had the AIADMK come to power, Edappadi Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam would have fulfilled their promise of Rs 1,500 per month and free washing machine for every household, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/white-paper-attempt-to-evade-poll-promises/articleshow/85194023.cms||---

The Congress leader said that Savarkar participated in the freedom struggle and went to jail, adding that the Hindu ideologue later became an informer for the British to be released from the prison. He said Savarkar received a pension from the British to be an informer. “We do not deny that Savarkar ji participated in the freedom struggle. But the kind of ideology he had, the kind of work he was carrying out and the kind of beliefs he had, if you read these in the history, you will find that he used to talk of a Hindu Rashtra,” said Dotasra. “There was no harm if he talked of a Hindu Rashtra as our country was not independent and our Constitution had not been adopted then. But once the country became independent and the Constitution adopted, people of all castes and religions were accepted. The RSS and the BJP used his ideology to hatch a conspiracy and pitched countrymen against each other. We are opposed to this,” he said. ‘Cong stalwarts fought for country’s freedom’He was addressing Congress cadre at the PCC headquarters on the August Kranti Diwas organised to felicitate local freedom fighters. “Nobody is denying that Savarkar ji went to jail. But after going to jail, he pleaded before the British, not once but four times, to get released in lieu of turning useful to them. The kind of information he used to give to the British is recorded in history,” the PCC president said. Dotasra claimed that when Congress stalwarts were fighting for the country’s freedom, only one or two RSS men were seen participating in those struggles. "Today, the RSS and BJP, whose contribution to the freedom struggle is zero, place Savarkar ji in the front and divide people into Hindus and Muslims. They impose their ideology on the country’s Hindu majority and want to be in power by pitching brother against brother," Dotasra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/savarkars-hindu-rashtra-demand-justified-during-british-rule-dotasra/articleshow/85194046.cms||---

While the government asked doctors to resume work without conditions, the doctors showed their resolve by returning honours given to them for exemplary Covid duty on Monday. Reiterating the stand of the state government, deputy CM Nitin Patel, who holds charge of health and family welfare, on Monday said the protest and strike are unreasonable. “It’s an attempt to cause inconvenience to patients. I request the doctors to end the protest without any conditions and join duty at the designated rural areas,” said Patel. OPD patients at Asarwa Civil HospitalHe added that the government would talk to the doctors on reasonable issues, but coercing the government through a strike is not the right approach. “First join duty, and then we’ll talk. The doctors are no longer students, as they have completed their course. Thus, they should vacate the hostels, and join CHCs or district/taluka level hospitals assigned to them,” said the deputy CM. Patel said the state government has powers under the Epidemic Diseases Act to get them to work. The perks given to the doctors were due to the extraordinary conditions, and cannot be extended. On the other hand, more than 400 resident doctors remained on strike in the city and staged a protest at BJ Medical College. “We were felicitated as ‘Corona Warriors’ by the same government. To mark our protest, four doctors who had got special commendation gave the certificate and honours back to the dean (PG courses) on Monday,” said a member of the Junior Doctors Association (JDA). “We believe that what we are demanding is right, and must be given to us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/end-protests-unconditionally-dycm/articleshow/85192335.cms||---

Discord, disharmony and suspicion in the name of religion has to stop. This is a secular country and secularism implies tolerance for the other religion. This country also provides for freedom of expression to its citizens, which, in turn, implies lending an ear to the other point of view,” said a livid first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu on Monday. The court also restrained the PIL-petitioner S Sridharan, an advocate, from filing any PILs for 5 years without the prior permission of the bench concerned. “Even the Constitution permits the oath of office to be taken either in the name of God or in the name of the Constitution,” the bench pointed out. “It does not appear that any religion teaches narrow-mindedness or requires followers of another faith to be hurt or injured,” the judges said, and dismissed the plea. Citing a news article, the PIL-petitioner said Stalin would head the advisory committee of the HR&CE department, and added: “As per Section 10 of the Act, professing Hindu religion is a qualification one must meet to serve the Hindu temples at all levels and they will be allowed to continue to render their service only as they continue their faith in Hindu religion.” The purpose of the condition is to restrain the authority acting under the act from applying the temple properties and funds in connection with activities which are against Hindu faith, he added. Noting that every person in any capacity in furtherance of the act should be Hindu by birth, should have faith in Hindu religion the petitioner submitted that the rules are equally applicable to the members of the advisory committee also.“Stalin heading the committee is a rude shock to crores of Hindu public like me in the state since he is a proclaimed atheist, non-believer of Hindu gods and does not practice Hindu religion,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-bar-on-cm-chairing-temple-panel-meets-hc/articleshow/85194056.cms||---

Teachers go to the homes of students to teach lessons and this has been most effective. These announcements from the school education department to give activities for children on a regular basis will be useful in streamlining learning,” said M Porchelvan, district secretary, Tamizhaga Arambapalli Asiriyar Koottani, Madurai. At the same time, teachers are apprehensive of uniform reach to all students. “Almost all government schools had created WhatsApp groups for students. Teachers were sharing small activities and worksheets but the response was very minimal. Further, less than 30% of students had proper access to smartphones,” said the headmaster of a government primary school. Even ‘Kalvi Tholaikatchi’ has limited reach and now government school teachers are being asked to ensure children watch the programmes. The headmaster of a government middle school said that though teachers are putting efforts to reach out to students and give them activities and homework and even repeatedly insist on watching ‘Kalvi Tholaikatchi’ lessons, as long as teachers are unable to monitor children, getting them to learn will be tough. “Parents are now going to work and cannot monitor the children. In such cases, simply asking children to watch Kalvi Tholaikatchi or giving them homework will not be effective. Even if teachers go to homes of children to teach, the hours they spend will not be the same. A routine is needed. Ideally, school reopening is the need of the hour,” said L Balakrishnan, a math teacher at a government middle school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bridging-learning-gap-for-students-still-an-uphill-task/articleshow/85194050.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

---||Chandigarh||In Punjab, AAP workers say party giving priority to leaders from SAD, Cong||Bathinda/Chandigarh: Volunteers of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) from a number of assembly constituencies have accused their own party of giving prominence to leaders switching sides from Congress or Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) instead of rewarding old and loyal party workers. A number of party workers from four assembly constituencies reached Chandigarh on Monday to lodge a protest with the leader of opposition in the state assembly, Harpal Singh Cheema. Party workers also launched a campaign, “Chalo Chandigarh,” seeking party tickets for “honest and loyal workers” instead of those coming to AAP from other parties. A few days ago, the party had appointed constituency in-charges for nine assembly segments. Rajinder Singh, a party worker, said, “The party had appointed nine ‘Halka incharge’ out of whom four are former Congressmen and three former Akalis. Last week, we had given a letter to the party in this regard, following which I was suspended for three months. We are loyal to the party and not going anywhere.” Pradeep Dhawan, who too has been suspended for a year, said the decision to appoint turncoats had upset the volunteers of the party. Party worker Binder Singh said, “We have been working for the party from 2013 but now the party has made a leader who joined from Akali Dal the constituency in-charge. We want the party to give respect to its old and loyal workers instead of reposing faith in leaders coming from other parties or the party will have to pay heavy price for this.” Another worker, Jagmel Singh said they had raised their concerns with senior leaders and hoped that these would be heeded. In the poster prepared for “Chalo Chandigarh,” workers from Rampura Phool, Ludhiana North, Ludhiana East, Dharmkot, Sultanpur Lodhi, Sardulgarh, Lambi have been asked to reach Chandigarh on Monday.WWhen contacted, LoP Harpal Singh Cheema said, “It is not in my knowledge that some party workers reached my residence in Chandigarh to lodge protest. Harchand Singh Barsat might know about it.” AAP Punjab general secretary Harchand Singh Barsat said only two volunteers were suspended for indiscipline as they were cautioned against anti-party activities on social media instead of talking to the party. “If any volunteer has any grouse, the party leadership is willing to resolve those. If leaders from other parties have a clean image, they should be welcome in the party,” he said. Barsat added, “Workers from Sardulgarh, Ludhiana, Jagraon and Ghanaur had come to meet Harpal Singh Cheema but as he was not there, I met them. I assured that everyone will would be given regard.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-punjab-aap-workers-say-party-giving-priority-to-leaders-from-sad-cong/articleshow/85194085.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Pune||Pune: Schools ready for in-person classes from next Monday||PUNE: The relaxations announced for commercial establishments have put schools in line for preparations to reopen for standards VIII to XII in the city and for standards from V to VIII in rural areas from August 16. Villages had low positivity rates and academic sessions have been successfully held so far in rural areas for standards VIII to XII since a month. Heads of schools said there was positive feedback from parents who wanted to send their children to school and were looking forward to the reopening. Principal Shubha Kale said their survey of parents got a 60% positive response. “We are hoping that the remaining 40% would also agree once classes start rolling. We have begun preparations at our end,” she said. Kshitij Bhor, a Std VIII student of Ashoka Madhyamik Vidyalaya in Manjari, said they have received the school’s notification about reopening and his parents had consented. “This is the best decision by the government as we are not gaining much from online teaching as 80% of the studies is self-study,” he added. Schools have started to chalk out a new timetable for offline classes and the stress at the moment will be on practicals and hands-on training sessions. Vishwas Dahanukar, administration head at the Cosmopolitan Education Society that runs nine schools across Maharashtra, said their staff has sprung into action with respect to the hygiene and other safety norms that the schools need to follow for reopening the schools. “At the same time, we are also seeking opinions from parents and counselling them about the reopening plans,” he added. The students have spent almost two academic years with virtual classes as a result of the school shutdowns due to Covid-19. Academicians have said the top 10% of the students could at the most cope with all changes that the pandemic brought in the education system. The remaining have found it difficult in some aspect or the other to deal with online classes. Principal of the Orbis School, Nalini Samuel, said there are bound to be learning gaps which would have crept in due to the lack of classroom interaction. “Some children who are shy by nature would not be comfortable speaking up in an online class and therefore a teacher may not be able to pick up on a lack of learning or understanding of a certain concept until it shows up in an assessment. That would mean an extra effort on the part of the teachers to plug these gaps and reinforce concepts when we get back to physical school,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/schools-ready-for-in-person-classes-from-next-monday/articleshow/85192008.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The girl, however, had then managed to escape and go to the police, which saw four other children who were kidnapped by the same gang being rescued by the cops and the criminals arrested. The girl was taken to a shelter in Ajmer, but authorities failed to find her parents for many years. Now, a new team, constituted a few months back, has tracked them down and handed over their daughter to them on Monday. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, told TOI, “The child was kidnapped from a wedding seven years ago by a gang who brought her to Nagaur’s Gotan. While in captivity, she realised that there were four other children with her and the culprits were planning to take them to Bikaner to push them into begging. However, she escaped and reached the cops who rescued the other children and caught the gang based on her information.” The gang members were arrested and sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment, but the girl’s parents could not be found. “The girl stayed in the children's shelter in Ajmer and gradually the search for her parents also faded into the background. I met her a few months ago and she told me about her case, following which I wrote to the district police who formed a team of five members. The parents were finally traced and after their daughter also recognised them. They had a tearful but happy reunion. The parents had almost given up hope of ever seeing their daughter again," Beniwal said. The parents told officials that the girl was their eldest child and, despite complaints to the police, their attempts to find their daughter were futile. The family from Bihar has been residing in Gujarat for many years. Recently, the state children's commission had reunited a teenager from Punjab with his family after a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/girl-kidnapped-for-begging-from-guj-reunited-with-family-after-7-yrs/articleshow/85194082.cms||Yeshika Budhwar
---||Nagpur||‘Super-75’: A ray of hope for NMC students to crack competitive exams||Nagpur: Ayesha Sheikh, a meritorious student from a Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)-run school, has gained optimism to achieve her dream of becoming a doctor thanks to mayor Dayashankar Tiwari’s ‘Super-75’ project. Ayesha’s father is a cushion maker and mother a housewife. Though she was always intelligent, Ayesha felt that her dream of becoming a doctor was far-fetched. “I knew that without the help of coaching classes it would not be possible to crack the entrance exam for admission into medicine,” she said. She gained confidence after being selected in Super-75, said Ayesha, a student of NMC’s Jaitala Secondary School. The mayor’s efforts have given a ray of hope to Ayesha and 74 other students to clear the entrance tests for various competitive exams like medical science (NEET), engineering (JEE) and national defence academy (NDA). To mark the 75th year of independence, NMC will organise various programmes throughout the year under 'Azadi-75'. On Monday, to mark the August Kranti Divas, NMC announced the selection of Super-75 students at a function organized at NMC’s Town Hall in Mahal. Thirty students from NMC schools will be prepared for JEE and 45 for NDA and NEET. The Association of Coaching Institutes in Nagpur has shown readiness to provide free coaching to these students. About 850 students of class VIII had appeared for the entrance tests conducted by the association. The 75 best performing students have been selected. The association’s executive member Jayant Ganvir has assured all possible help. “This initiative will be continued every year and in the future these students will earn a name for themselves, their families and their city in the field they choose. The initiative will change the perspective of citizens towards students from NMC-run schools,” Tiwari said. Another student Nirmal Mate, who scored highest marks in the entrance test organized by the coaching institutes, said he would fulfil his dream of becoming a scientist through the Super-75 project. Nirmal, whose father is a mason, studies in NMC’s Jaitala Secondary School. Similar was the opinion of Sundaram Mishra, a student of Dr Ram Manohar Lohiya Secondary School. His father runs a roadside eatery and he has a dream to join the armed forces. He was selected for the special coaching for the defence academy entrance exam. Ruling party leader Avinash Thakre, corporators Parinita Fuke and Dilip Diwe among others were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/super-75-a-ray-of-hope-for-nmc-students-to-crack-competitive-exams/articleshow/85192000.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

He used to be irregular on duty and would go out to get drug consignments. When he was out with other accused to bring contraband, he was shown present at the police station.Additional deputy commissioner of police-I Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said, “During checking it was found that earlier too ASI Rajinderpal had been absent for three to four days. On August 4, he worked double shift and on August 5 he said his wife was unwell and he has to get her admitted to a hospital. Since he had done a double shift, he was not marked absent the next day.”“However, the involvement of cops in drug peddling is a matter of concern. It is important to keep a check on those who often remain absent. All the SHOs have been asked to keep a tab on the staff and report to the senior officials if any of them is often absent. However, if a cop leaves the duty citing urgent work or an emergency in the family, we cannot stop them,” the ADCP added. The STF had arrested ASI Rajinderpal, his cousin Daljeet Kaur Babli and accomplice Pawanjit Singh with 350kg poppy husk in Samrala when they were returning from Madhya Pradesh after procuring the contraband. When an STF official stopped the SUV of ASI Rajinderpal, who was in uniform, the later tried to convince him against checking his vehicle. Earlier also, the cop had used his uniform while procuring and supplying drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/shos-directed-to-keep-check-on-irregular-cops/articleshow/85189417.cms||Payal Dhawan

The 20-30 people had congregated near a bank on Parliament Street and were to proceed to the protest site from there. Following a call for the march on Twitter, police barricaded the approaches to Jantar Mantar. “The farmers' protest had been specially permitted by Delhi Disaster Management Authority, but after it ended on Monday, no other gathering has been allowed at Jantar Mantar,” explained a police officer. Before the protesters could organise themselves, the public announcement system blared that Section 144 CrPC prohibiting public assembly was in place at Jantar Mantar and no demonstrations would be permitted. The cops also instructed the protesters to maintain social distancing before packing them into buses. The detained protesters were later let off. Ahtesham Qadri, 24, had come from Janakpuri with his friends for the event. He said “For some time now, people have been giving speeches and raising slogans against religious minorities. We have no problem with any religion and, in fact, the beauty of our country is that we all are different flowers growing from the same pot. But the kind of sloganeering that took place on Sunday shows the mentality of some people and everyone should condemn such things.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/protesters-gathered-against-hate-run-into-police-wall/articleshow/85221748.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Earlier, the death toll was 70. Dr Prashant Khaire, the resident medical officer, said the situation is now gradually improving, and the number of active cases are reducing slowly. The treatment of mucormycosis is long process and hence the recovery takes some time, however, the rate of fresh cases being reported has dropped. “The treatment for mucormycosis patients runs for a minimum of 15 days to more than four months at a stretch. The recovery appears to be slow and the active cases count fails to reduce fast,” said Khaire. Speaking on the rate of fresh cases being detected, he said when four cases were reported daily, then it was at its peak but now one case is recorded in 15 to 20 days on average.The number of cases has dropped with the decline in the number of Covid patients and those in critical conditions. Of the total 747 patients suffering from mucormycosis in Nashik district, 613 have fully recovered so far. As many as 482 patients have undergone surgeries, which include removal of eyes, nasal portion and others.Of the 55 active patients of mucormycosis, 25 are undergoing treatment in Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) limits, 17 have been admitted to SMBT Medical College, Igatpuri, 11 are in Dr Vasantrao Pawar Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Nashik, and two patients in General Hospital, Malegaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-of-active-mucormycosis-cases-drops-to-55-in-nashik/articleshow/85187630.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Lakhs of devotees come to take darshan of Lord Shiva from outside the temple or circumambulate around Brahmagiri mountain on foot. Trimbakeshwar, 30 kms from Nashik city, is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas in the country. Every year, during the month of Shravan, lakhs of people visit this holy town. Devotees take a 20-km or 40-km detour around the Brahmagiri mountain by foot as part of the worship of Lord Shiva during the Shravan Somvar. Though the maximum rush of people is on the third Shravan Somvar for the circumambulation of Brahmagiri, the other Mondays also witnesses huge rush.Inspector Sandeep Randive of the Trimbakeshwar police station said, “Heavy bandobast was maintained all over the Trimbakeshwar town to ensure that there is no rush of devotees. Owing to the heavy bandobast, devotees also did not turn up.” However, taking into account the possibility of rush in the Trimbakeshwar town on the Shravan Somvars, incident commander and sub divisional officer of Igatpuri-Trimbakeshwar sub division Tejas Chavan also issued prohibitory orders under Section 144 (2) of the CRPC against gathering of people from every Sunday 8 pm till Tuesday 6 am till August 31.The prohibitory orders would be in force in the temple area in Trimbakeshwar, Kushavart Teerth area, Brahmagiri circumambulation route and other religious places in the temple town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/strict-bandobast-at-trimbak-prohibitory-orders-in-place/articleshow/85187605.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Kolkata||Test tube baby pioneer gets West Bengal govt recognition 4 decades after death||KOLKATA: Forty years after his death, the pioneer of test tube baby, Subhash Mukhopadhay, finally gets recognition from the state. The Mamata Banerjee government issued an order on Friday to name the NRS Boys Hostel after this ex-teacher of physiology, install his bust on the campus and preserve the room used by him. On June 19, 1981, the architect of the world’s second and India’s first test tube baby had ended his life in his Southern Avenue flat. Mukhopadhyay’s life (or death) inspired filmmaker Tapan Sinha to make “Ek Doctor Ki Maut”. Now, two months after his 40th death anniversary, the state health department has issued the notification, saying that it has adhered to the proposal by the ex-students of NRS Medical College and Hospital in naming the boys’ hostel after Mukhopadhay and installing his half bust on the campus and a plaque in the room where he stayed. Between 1967-1975, Mukhopadhay worked as a lecturer, reader and professor at NRS Hospital. The Indian scientific community keeps referring to him as the country’s lost opportunity. On October 3, 1978, barely two months after the birth of the world’s first IVF baby, Marie Louise Brown, India, too, had produced its own —Durga, alias Kanupriya Agarwal. While Brown’s creator, Robert G Edwards, professor emeritus, University of Cambridge, is hailed as the father of IVF and got the Nobel Prize, Mukhopadhyay had to face an inquiry in December 1978, before ending his life on June 19, 1981, after the government refused to recognize his feat. Members of the Indian Society of Assisted Reproduction (ISAR), which has initiated a movement for his recognition, said the acknowledgement is “too little too late.” Gautam Khastgir, chairperson, ISAR’s Bengal chapter and head, Birth Inspire Foundation, said, “From 2015, we started celebrating Kanupriya (Durga) Agarwal’s birthday here in Kolkata to reiterate Dr Mukherjee’s story, lest people forget. We shall continue our stirs until he gets honours due to him for his pioneering research that dramatically changed infertility treatment across the globe. His IVF methodology is followed now rather than that of Edwards.” The reproductive medicine expert, who has been raising the issue since 2000, added, “Southern Avenue should be christened as Subhas Mukhopadhyay Sarani.” TOI in 2019 reported how cryobiologist Sunit Mukherjee — Mukhopadhay’s associate in his path breaking research — tried in vain to save the Subhas Mukherjee Memorial Reproductive Biology Research Centre. The unit in Behala is now locked after Sunit’s death in January, 2020. Instrumental in getting Mukhopadhyay’s name included in Dictionary of Medical Biography, Sunit had brought IVF specialist T C Anand Kumar, who was till then known as the “creator of India’s first test-tube baby”, to Mukhopadhay’s lab. He made him go through the scientist’s handwritten notes and acknowledge that by the time Kumar’s “Harsha” was born in Mumbai, Subhas’s “Durga” was already eight-year-old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/test-tube-baby-pioneer-gets-state-recognition-4-decades-after-death/articleshow/85192042.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Delhi||SDMC to develop 2 plastic-free model wards in each of 4 zones||New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to develop two plastic-free model wards in each zone where 100% processing, segregation and recycling of plastic waste is to be carried out. The selected wards include Defence Colony and Andrews Ganj under Central Zone, Safdarjung and GK-1 in South Zone, Punjabi Bagh and Rajouri Garden in West Zone and Dwarka sectors 36 and 38. A senior municipal official said that a phase-wise plan had been made for phasing out single-use plastic. Delhi leads the country in terms of plastic waste generation. The city generates over 690 metric tonnes (MT) of plastic waste per day while Mumbai produces 408 MT/day and Kolkata 426 MT/day. “The deputy commissioners concerned have been directed to create single-use plastic-free markets in these zones with the provision of jute bag corners. Each zone will have to declare five key markets as single-use plastic-free markets,” the official said. “A three-phase campaign has been planned. During the first phase, an awareness campaign will be carried out. In the second phase, seizure of single-use plastic material will be carried out and in the third phase, NGT challans will be issued to all the defaulters,” the official explained. The five single-use plastic-free markets under Central Zone will be Lajpat Nagar Central Market, Nehru Place, Sunder Nagar, New Friends Colony and Defence Colony Market. “Under South Zone, M and N Block markets in GK-1, Green Park, C Block Vasant Vihar and Aurobindo Market have been identified, while in West Zone, Punjabi Bagh, Janakpuri, Tagore Garden, Subhash Nagar and Rajouri Garden markets will be developed as plastic-free model markets. In Najafgarh Zone, markets of Dwarka sectors 8, 9, 11, 12 and 23 will be made plastic-free,” the official added. Officials say plastic waste segregation will also be carried out at dhalao level by setting up a material recovery facility. “Initially, only eight out of 104 wards under SDMC will be turned into model wards,” the official stated. The south corporation is signing MOUs with malls, commercial spaces and hotels to declare them as ‘single-use plastic-free zones’. An official said that United Nations Development Programme had agreed to set up four model plastic waste processing and recycling centres in south Delhi areas—one in each administrative zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-to-develop-2-plastic-free-model-wards-in-each-of-4-zones/articleshow/85221798.cms||Paras Singh

The remaining work will be completed by August 15, said officials.The road development agency has so far surveyed 655 hectares of the 695 hectares of land required for the project. It couldn’t carry out the survey in four villages — two each in Bhor and Mulshi tehsils — due to opposition by the villagers. “The protesting villagers have sought a change in the ring road alignment. The matter has been placed before the district administration, which is likely to hold a meeting with the villagers and local politicians,” said MSRDC executive engineer Sandeep Patil. “Village-wise drawings of the ring road are being prepared based on the land survey. Drawings of 33 villages will be prepared soon,” he added.“The valuation of the land will be done based on ready reckoner rates. Besides, we will also value properties included on the land. So, farmers will get monetary compensation pertaining to each of their properties,” said Patil. As per the procedure, the MSRDC will sign legal agreement with each farmer before disbursing compensation. “Our endeavour is to complete all administrative work by February 2022,” Patil added.“Land survey is the toughest task for any project. It was done in a very smooth manner with a single police complaint. Barring small protests at two villages in Bhor tehsil, we did not face any issue in 33 villages,” Patil said.The western ring road will start from Urse toll plaza in Maval tehsil. Then it will pass through Mulshi, Haveli tehsils before connecting Mumbai-Bangalore highway at Bhor tehsil. Patil said that they were in the process of commencing land survey for eastern ring road as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/western-ring-road-land-survey-work-to-be-completed-by-aug-15-officials/articleshow/85192058.cms||Sandip Dighe

The number of Covid cases in the district is reducing and the district had only 28 positive cases on Monday. Jalgaon collector Abhijeet Raut said that two of the patients were from Jalgaon city, while four others were from rural areas. He added that active surveillance will be conducted in each of the villages where the patients were found. “This is the second time that district has found the delta plus variant cases. The seven cases detected in the month of June were all fine. In the current scenario, one of the six was asymptomatic in nature, while five others had very mild symptoms. None of them were vaccinated before the infection,” Raut said. The health teams visited the patients who were detected with the variant and said that these citizens were aged between 17 – 60 years and were positive for the infection in the months of June and July. The health of the ‘patients’ and their families was fine. Officials sad that they would be doing contact tracing of all these patients to check whom they came in contact with during the period and thereafter to figure out if any of contacts had the infection. District civil surgeon N S Chavan said that all the patients have recovered from the infection and none required hospitalization, nor oxygen during their course of treatment. Jalgaon addtional district collector Rahul Patil has issued prohibitory orders saying that not more than four people can come together for any purpose.

Not only had the government withdrawn their special pay allowance, but the amount paid for the previous two months was recovered. With the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission benefits a special monthly allowance for medical teachers at government colleges was paid under the head ‘non-practising allowance’. As medical college teachers are barred from private practice, an allowance is paid to them as compensation. These allowances were in the range of Rs 10,000 to Rs 35,000 per month based on seniority and experience. More than 100 faculty members have been affected, said a source aware of the matter. Some of the faculty members raised the issue and made representations to the state government. The Gujarat Medical Teachers’ Association has also written to the state government in this regard. “The special pay according to the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations was introduced for about two months. Now, the government has suddenly decided not only to stop it but also roll it back with retrospective effect. We have raised this issue and asked the government to restore the salaries according to the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations,” said Dr Rajnish Patel, president of Gujarat Medical Teachers’ Association (GMTA). A state government official said the file for approval of ‘non-practising allowance’ was yet to receive the stamp of approval from the government and was hence rolled back. Earlier this year, teachers of six government-run medical colleges threatened to go on strike if their demands were not met. The demands of the medical teachers included higher non-practising allowance in lines with the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations and the abolition of contract appointments. The protests were called off after the government promised to meet their demands, said sources in GMTA. The association had also demanded that medical college teachers be allowed to start private practice after 10 years of regular service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-revokes-special-pay-for-docs-recovers-amount-paid/articleshow/85192088.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Pune||Pune: After business setback for 15 months, bus operators hope for better days||PUNE: Gajanan Jadhav, a school van operator, has a fleet of buses and vans which he employed to ferry school children. After schools shut down for physical classes last year, Jadhav has seen the worst. His vans and buses were grounded for nearly 15 months and he has had to spend a lot of money on maintenance. There came a time when he had exhausted his resources to pay the monthly bank loan instalments taken for the vehicles. He could retain 60% of the owned vehicles but had to let go the rest as he could not take on the financial burden. But, there is some hope for Jadhav now. “Now that the government has announced the reopening for schools, I hope that the classes continue and parents trust us to ferry their children safely following all the appropriate norms. This reopening is not going to mend all that we have lost, but at least I can keep my vehicles instead of selling them,” he said. Private school bus and van operators have had no business in the last 15-18 months and they were unable to use their vehicles for other commercial purposes since it was coloured as per school bus norms, had the speed controller and other guidelines that they had to follow. Kiran Pawar, another school bus operator from Wadgaonsheri, who ferries children of The Bishop’s School Kalyaninagar and St Arnold’s School said the reopening announcement will revive some business. “Our vehicles have also started to have problems since they were stationed at one place all the time for many months. We just hope that the schools reopen and there would be no break in future,” he added. Another bus operator from Vishrantwadi, Vishal Raut, said parents have started calling them. “We assured them of following all the safety norms,” he added. Van operator Manoj Gupta had to start a vegetable stall in Yerawada. “I am the breadwinner and initially we suffered a lot. I had paid off all the loans for my van so I could turn it into a vegetable stall to earn a living. I will go back to ferrying school children now,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/after-business-setback-for-15-months-bus-operators-hope-for-better-days/articleshow/85192023.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Nagpur||OCW penalty waiver: Arya files plaint against ex-mayors, others||Nagpur: Former corporator and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Vedprakash Arya on Monday filed a police complaint against former mayors Sandip Joshi and Nanda Jichkar, ex-deputy mayor Deepraj Pardikar, ex-water works committee chairman Vijay Zalke and former standing committee chairman Virendra Kukreja for allegedly waiving off Rs92 crore penalty towards private operator Orange City Water Private (OCW) Limited. In a complaint filed with Sadar police station and a memorandum submitted to the DCP (zone-II) Vinita Sahu, Arya demanded registration of offence against all of them under sections 403, 406 and 409 of the IPC. The decision to waive off the penalty was taken at a board meeting of Nagpur Environment Services Limited, a special purpose vehicle formed for implementation of 24x7 water supply project, on February 15, 2019. In the past too, Arya had made several complaints, including those filed with former state home minister Anil Deshmukh and water resources minister Jayant Patil. The NCP state vice-president claimed that all the terms and conditions of the contract were framed to benefit the private firm. “Since 2012, NMC has incurred a loss of Rs722.23 crore,” he said. Arya claimed that it has been a loss-making deal for the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) since 2012 when appointed it OCWL to launch the 24x7 water supply. Till 2010-2011 the NMC managed the city’s water supply, it made a profit of Rs3 crore. According to him, until 2011-12, NMC used to do billing of 187.89 MLD. But when it entrusted the work to OCW, it paid for 250 MLD for five years. It was also mentioned in the agreement. The audit objection also mentioned OCW earned profit of Rs26.25 crore between 2012 and 2014, Arya stated in the complaint. The complaint mentioned that the auditor general also exposed that OCW had levied 150% extra charges on NESL for installing meters and valves. “The private firm had purchased meters, valves, pipes, saddles etc at Rs1,494.79 per connection, while it reportedly collected Rs3,484.20 per connection from NESL,” said Arya and demanded a detailed investigation into the audit objection. According to Arya, OCW was supposed to replace the old meters with new and implement the 24x7 project in five years between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2017. He said that OCW failed to achieve the target and the NMC revised the deadline till 2022. For the delay in completing the work, a penalty of Rs54 crore was imposed on OCW for failing to replace the old meters and Rs38 crore as interest on fine. However, in the NESL board meeting it was waived off under one-time settlement scheme, he said. Sandip Joshi was not available for comments. DCP Sahu said that a police inspector from Sadar police station has been asked to verify the facts of Arya’s complaint. “Once we verify the allegations levelled by Arya, further course of action will be initiated,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ocw-penalty-waiver-arya-files-plaint-against-ex-mayors-others/articleshow/85192040.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The festival is being held every year since 2017, barring 2020 due to Covid-19. With the situation on Covid front easing, both the districts resumed the festival this year. Organizers, supported by the government’s agriculture department, said naturally grown vegetables are best immunity boosters. Lots of edible plants grow in forests, farm binds and by the roadside wherever small patch of soil is available especially during monsoon. They are called wild vegetables or Raan Bhaji. “These plants are still part of our traditional diet. These wild vegetables grow naturally without any chemical manure, pesticides and are rich with micronutrients and medicinal properties,” said Hindurao Chavan, agriculture superintendent of Bhandara district. Tribals and women attached to self-help groups not only bring these vegetables from the forests and villages, but also share the special recipes with the visitors. “Bhandara district is rich in natural resources. We have organized this festival in Bhandara, Mohadi, Tumsar, Paoni, Sakoli, Lakhni, and Lakhandur,” said Chavan. In Nagpur, the festival opened on the premises of Sarpanch Bhavan where divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare and collector Vimala R also paid visit on the very first day. “These wild vegetables could be tastier and more nutritious than the vegetables usually available in market. These can be grown at home garden too. For urbanites, these vegetables can offer a break from the monotony of everyday meal,” said agriculture development officer Vandana Bhele. The divisional commissioner appreciated the way organizers had displayed medicinal properties and health benefits of these vegetables. “I hope this initiative will introduce the treasure of wild vegetables to young city generation,” she said. SOME WILD BENEFITS Cassia tora, known as tarota bhaji locally, is regarded for being effective against asthma and pain brought on by monsoon chills Khaparkhuti (Boerhaavia diffusa) is a soft, succulent creeper that tastes like spinach, but better source of iron Kena (Commelina benghalensis) a soft herb is rich source of protein that can be consumed wholly Kukurda bhaji (Celosia argentea) is cooked with a handful of Indian sorrel leaves and is a rich source of phosphorus Takal (Wild/ Sickle Senna), Kusa ( zucchini), Katwal (spiny gourd), Mataru, Chiwal, Bhui-Awal, Umbar, Kawath and much more are at display and sale||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/learn-to-feast-on-wild-veggies-in-concrete-jungles/articleshow/85192099.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Delhi||Delhi: North corporation to rebuild staff quarters as commercial spaces||NEW DELHI: Taking note of the slow progress in the redevelopment of its staff colony on Bungalow Road at Kamla Nagar, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to initiate the process afresh on its own this month-end. In 2019, the civic body had hired a consultant for inviting online tenders on its behalf, but couldn’t get the desired results. A fresh proposal would now be placed in the standing committee meeting at the end of the month for permission to invite bids and allocate tenders for redeveloping the residential quarters into commercial spaces on an area measuring 12,640 square metres. “We had hired the consultancy firm for planning and implementation of all tasks, including hiring agencies for comprehensive designing, making a master plan for converting the staff colony into offices or commercial complex, facilitating pre- and post-construction approvals from local authorities, etc. The tentative area to be developed was around 20,000 square metres,” said a senior north corporation official. The official added that as they failed to see much progress, a decision was taken to start the tendering process on their own after receiving an approval from the deliberative wing. The project included construction of a commercial complex with a provision for shops, offices and basement parking. The minimum bidding price was expected to be Rs 495 crore. In addition to this, lease amount and property tax would be earned from the complex every year. “Some of the staff quarters are still occupied. We have planned to accommodate these people to the quarters at Shalimar Bagh and other places once work starts. Regarding the number of floors in the commercial complex, the building bylaws would be taken into consideration for deciding the height of the building,” said the official. North corporation had got the land use of the site changed from Delhi Development Authority. In 2012, a project was conceived for redevelopment of the staff quarters at Kamla Nagar, Azadpur and Minto Road. The project was mentioned in the financial budget every year, but work could not start for various reasons. “The staff quarters at Kamla Market are only a couple of storeys high. The old buildings have become decrepit. By replacing them with a modern commercial complex, we seek to utilise the space as well as increase the revenue for the civic body,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-to-rebuild-staff-quarters-as-commercial-spaces/articleshow/85221849.cms||Vibha Sharma

The accused, Amitabh Bose and Divyendu Vardhan, allegedly siphoned off around Rs 50 lakh from the victims, said the police. Some of the victims had gone to the civic body’s headquarters on SN Banerjee Road on Monday with the appointment letters with KMC letterheads that turned out to be fake. The civic volunteers on duty raised an alarm, following which KMC officials informed the police about the matter. Cops, with the help of KMC officials, laid a trap to catch the accused, one of whom was convinced into coming there. “We took him to various departments in KMC but none recognised him. On being questioned, he said that his associate was standing near Grand Hotel. We also nabbed him. It seems that the accused had been running the racket for a long time and the role of insiders in the fraud cannot be ruled out,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/two-held-for-running-fake-kmc-job-racket/articleshow/85192093.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

In a Facebook post on Monday, Moyeen Ali said that he won’t encourage those who are trying to fish in troubled waters and he would work together to strengthen the party. He expressed hope that all things will settle down and his prime focus now was to take care of the health of his father Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal. Recently, IUML high-power committee had refrained from taking disciplinary action against Moyeen Ali, though it did not support his public outburst. It was decided that further action on the issue will be taken in consultation with Hyderali Shihab Thangal. Salam denies irregularities in Chandrika daily Meanwhile, IUML state general secretary PMA Salam refuted allegations of financial irregularities in the party’s mouthpiece Chandrika. Addressing the media at League House in Kozhikode on Monday, he said funds that were collected by the party for the daily were used for the intended purpose. “There are no financial irregularities in Chandrika daily. It is facing a financial crisis just like other newspapers due to the pandemic," he added. He said that party supremo Hyderali Shihab Thangal had asked Moyeen Ali to settle the financial liabilities in the daily and it was done with the knowledge of the party leadership. “That was for a period of one month from March, but he couldn’t settle the issues. That doesn’t mean he can intervene in all issues of the organization or go public via news conferences. If he wants to do more things, then he has to get permission from the party and the leadership,” he said. He reiterated that CPM was behind the controversy and claimed that the party had fielded KT Jaleel to rake up the matter as it was wary on seeing 15 Muslim organizations rallying behind IUML to uphold the rights of the community. Salam said that the allegation by Moyeen Ali that Hyderali Shihab Thangal had to be hospitalised due to mental strain over the issue was false. Salam asked the government to remove Muharram from the ‘Onam Muharram Fair’ to be inaugurated by CM Pinarayi Vijayan on Aug 11 as Muharram was not a festival to be celebrated like Onam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/no-personal-hostility-says-ali/articleshow/85192171.cms||---

The runway re-carpeting work is currently on at the airport. “The 12-hour operation at the airport may end in October or may get slightly extended. It all depends on how the contractor of the Indian Air Force (IAF) completes the main runway resurfacing. An early completion of the project is not expected due to the problems caused by the pandemic,” an airport official told TOI. Work on the lone runway of the airport started in October last year and the runway is shut from 8pm to 8am. The curtailed operation hours were to remain in force until October this year. However, the total closure of the runway, scheduled for 15 days during April end to early May, was postponed for allowing transport of Covishield vaccine from the airport. “The total closure of the runway is expected right after the monsoon. We might be looking at October or November. However, it is the IAF which will decide. There could be more changes, but we haven’t been informed about any fresh dates relating to runway closure till now,” the official added. The Pune airport is primarily a defence airbase belonging to the IAF and the Airport Authority of India uses it as a civil enclave. Before the runway re-carpeting started, the airport used to have continuous flights, except between 6am and 8.30am on weekdays to allow for Sukhoi aircraft sorties. “Many projects, including that of the AAI, have got delayed due to the pandemic. The lack of labour force due to the lockdown has been the main reason,” another official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/runway-may-remain-shut-from-8pm-for-longer-period/articleshow/85192103.cms||Joy Sengupta

The complainant had made the allegations as an adult in 2018, claiming that the alleged sexual assault took place between 2016 and 2017 when she was a minor and was employed by the accused at his factory. “Adult complainant has made belated allegations, which are not supported by any independent witness or by her own mother. There is reason for the complainant to falsely implicate the accused,” the court observed. It further said that the accused was initially opposed to her sister’s marriage with the businessman’s son. While the complainant’s sister did not depose, her mother was a prosecution witness. However, she did not say anything about the alleged assault. “The mother did not depose that her daughter was...raped by the accused. On the contrary she deposed that she did not know what happened with her daughter when she was working in the factory…In the cross-examination, the mother deposed that she contacted the accused on phone and they talked in good terms with each other,” the court said. The court also pointed out that no mother would remain silent if her minor daughter was repeatedly subjected to sexual assault by her other daughter’s father-in-law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-3-years-in-jail-bizman-acquitted-in-pocso-case/articleshow/85192190.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The central agency is trying to find how Deb had managed to organise the fake vaccination camps and the officials said that they would question eight other persons arrested in connection with the case. This will also include Deb as the court has given its nod and the jail requisition is ready for him. The ED had earlier sought permission from the court to question him and contacted Kolkata Police to share some evidence with them. Shaw, a resident of Tangra Road, who had introduced Deb to the North City College principal and helped in conducting the fake vaccination camp, hoped to get a job at the KMC on the recommendation of Deb. The SIT had earlier said Shaw was one of the employees of Debanjan. The special investigation team has so far revealed that Deb opened a fake bank account with a private bank, naming it as WBFinCorp, in a bid to make it resemble the state finance department-run West Bengal Finance Corporation (WBFC). Deb had opened this account at least a couple of years ago and used it every month to pay his 14 employees.

---||Nagpur||No sight of justice for custodial death of physically challenged victim||NAGPUR: Family members of the alleged custodial death victim, physically challenged Manoj Thaokar, along with east Nagpur MLA Krishna Khopde, met CP Amitesh Kumar on Monday seeking justice. Thaokar was rushed to a private hospital from Pardi police station where he was declared dead on July 7. The case is now being probed by the state criminal investigation department (CID) which is yet to take any decision regarding registration of offence even after a month has elapsed. As per a source in the state CID, the probe agency is now waiting for the chemical analysis report from the regional forensic science laboratory (RFSL) to reach a conclusion regarding the cause of death. Despite repeated reminders, RFSL authorities are likely to take some more time to submit their reports. Based on the RFSL report, the state CID is likely to seek further clarifications on the cause of Thaokar’s death from forensic experts of government medical college and hospital who kept their opinion ‘reserved’ after the post-mortem. The case so far has been registered as an accidental death. The state CID may register an offence under the Indian penal code (IPC) for culpable homicide not amounting to murder based on RFSL’s findings and expert opinion of the forensic department of GMCH. Thaokar, who was on a scooter, was intercepted under dramatic circumstances while trying to flee, ignoring the police’s gesture to stop at the nakabandi near Pardi naka. An officer was injured while trying to nab Thaokar. Thaokar was brought to Pardi police station where he collapsed after two hours. While police have claimed there were no tough measures taken against Thaokar, his family and other eye-witnesses contradicted this view, stating he was thrashed at the nakabandi point and also at the police station which caused his death. After the incident, CP Kumar suspended an officer and two constables from Pardi police station. A case of accidental death too was registered at Pardi police station. The case was later handed over to the state CID. The family has claimed that till date no help has arrived from the government except the Rs three lakh promised by BJP leaders who visited their residence. “We have not received any communication from the government,” Manoj’s younger brother Vinod said. MLA Khopde said he had made an appeal before the CP to ensure the victim’s wife was assisted with a job. “No ministers from the incumbent government visited the affected family,” said Khopde. “CP has promised to send a proposal to the government for a job for the wife of the victim,” he said. Khopde also assured to take up the case with the state CID as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-sight-of-justice-for-custodial-death-of-physically-challenged-victim/articleshow/85192156.cms||Soumitra Bose

During a live entrepreneurship interaction on Tueaday, Agarwal addressed students of classes IX to XII and also answered their questions about the challenges he had faced while setting up OYO Rooms. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia told Agarwal about the curriculum and the seed money, prompting Agarwal to acclaim the seed money project. “My own journey was similar. I tried several different entrepreneurial projects before I started OYO. I first started a business to sell train tickets at a time when smartphones didn’t exist and then a business to brand milk.” He told students, “A young kid has many opportunities during this time, in this generation. The benefit of technology is unparalleled, and one can make good use of it. You can research on whatever you want, you can start a YouTube channel and make educational videos. There is a lot that can be done and there is no limit to ideas.” Agarwal said he had always known that he wanted to do something of his own. “I started early by identifying the problem and looked at solutions that were hands-on and scalable. Hard work and perseverance are the only way to establish something and I knew I had to keep on trying.” The most important consideration while starting a venture, he added, is to recognise that problem solving can only be done by involving the people around you, the stakeholders and the community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/budding-entrepreneurs-get-boost-from-govt-initiative/articleshow/85221911.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Low birth rate of Christians a concern: KCBC||Kochi: Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council (KCBC) on Monday said that it was a matter of grave concern that the birth rate among Christians is falling drastically so much so that it could even risk the very existence of the community. The remark was made in a statement detailing the decisions taken in KCBC’s monsoon summit held from August 2 to 6. “Christians who formed 24.6% of Kerala’s population in the 1950s are now reduced to 17.2%. Christians have become the community with the least birth rate, at 1.8%. It is in this backdrop that various dioceses came forward with projects to support families with more children. It is hopeful to see that those who tried to spread false narratives on these projects, are correcting themselves now,” KCBC said in the statement. KCBC said that countries like China and various developed nations having very low birth rate are now forced to rethink on their policies due to its negative effects. It was not logical to consider population reduction as the only solution for social crises which arise due to improper development policies, the statement said. As per the statement, discussions were also held on topics including Protection of Life, alleged anti-Christian trend in cultural and media sector, Fr Stan Swamy’s death and on reports of demolition of churches. Although the minority scholarship issue came up for discussion in the summit, KCBC did not mention it in the statement. KCBC had earlier welcomed the government decision to rejig the minority scholarship ratio as per population. KCBC also demanded that the government should immediately intervene to construct breakwaters to protect coastal areas like Chellanam which are prone to erosion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/low-birth-rate-of-christians-a-concern-kcbc/articleshow/85192269.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Senior inspector forcibly retired, but she says it’s due next year||MUMBAI: The Mumbai Police has forcibly retired senior inspector Gulab Patil of Dharavi police station citing that she was due for retirement last year, but continued to remain in service due to an “administrative error”. Patil, however, claimed that she is due for retirement in March 2022. She has forwarded her service sheet to the state director general of police for review. According to the Mumbai Police, the administrative error came to light in May when the department wanted to send Patil’s service sheet to the DGP’s office as she was due for promotion to the rank of assistant commissioner of police (ACP), but could not find it. Police officers have two records—a service sheet and a gradation list. The service sheet is sent to the DGP’s office whenever an officer is due for promotion. “We wanted to send Patil’s service sheet to the DGP, but it was not traceable,” said Rajkumar Watkar, joint commissioner of police (administration). “So, we started digging and after a long time found her records from the state intelligence department office, where she was earlier posted. According to the records, she was supposed to retire in March 2020. Hence, an administrative decision was taken and she was asked to retire on July 31,” he added. On August 1, senior inspector Vijay Mane took charge of Dharavi police station. But Patil insisted that it was a case of technical error. “I have found my records and have submitted them to the DGP’s office. According to the service sheet, now I am due for promotion to the rank of ACP now and for retirement in 2022,” she told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sr-inspector-forcibly-retired-but-she-says-its-due-next-yr/articleshow/85192407.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Covid pushed 220-kg youth under scalpel||AHMEDABAD: Hiren Padhariya, 33, a native of Gadhada now settled in Godhra, weighed 220kg. “I worked at an eating joint for seven years. I had to leave the job as my obesity was coming in the way of my duties. I could not walk for long, could not get up without help or climb stairs,” Hiren recounted. The turning point came when he contracted Covid in April. “I was hospitalized for over a month and a half. I felt as if someone had put stones on my chest. I could barely move. While I was aware of the issues with obesity, this was the final push that readied me to go under the knife,” said Hiren, who was among 30 patients who underwent bariatric surgery to reduce weight at KD Hospital as part of an awareness initiative. The surgeries were performed in 24 hours as part of CSR activity by Nobesity, KD Hospital and a few other donors. Dr Manish Khaitan, director of Nobesity and senior consultant of bariatric surgery at KD Hospital, said the patients had body mass index (BMI) ranging from 40 to 70, and the age group was 35 to 65 years. Dr Adit Desai, managing director of KD Hospital, said the objective of these surgeries is to raise awareness among the community to acknowledge obesity as a lifestyle disease. “Of the total patients, about 40% had a history of Covid-19. Moreover, we have seen a steady rise in bariatric surgeries after the second wave as many got aware of the danger of being overweight,” said Dr Khaitan. “A CDC report of 72,491 hospitalized adults with Covid-19 revealed that 50.2% of them were obese and 28.3% were overweight, meaning three-fourths of admitted patients had weight issues.” Experts at KD Hospital said the special camp was organized as part of the awareness drive. “Obesity can get life-threatening as it can cause cardiac issues, diabetes, hypertension, some cancers and even stroke. In the majority of cases, obesity is associated with lifestyle disorders,” said Dr Khaitan. Two methods, longer follow-ups to ensure patients remain in shape The team members said they either use the gastric sleeve – also known as stomach stapling – or gastric bypass, based on patient profile. They also undergo psychological counselling and hormone therapy. The hunger is not just in stomach, but also in mind, said experts. The procedure doesn’t allow patients to go back to their older ways – there are restrictions on food intake and lifestyle changes involved. The patients must undergo follow-ups for several years to prevent relapse, said experts. The patients are trained to go for a smaller number of helpings and to control compulsive eating. After pandemic, Gujarat reported higher food intake, overweight population Two recent studies based in Gujarat carried out by the food and nutrition departments of two universities show that the pandemic proved to be a bane for many as they drastically reduced physical activity and increased food intake. A survey covering 400 respondents indicated that more than half of the respondents had BMIs of over 25, considered to be overweight. Experts said that for those with a BMI over 40, it becomes difficult to reduce weight by natural means. The only way out is to ensure a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and sustained physical activity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-pushed-220-kg-youth-under-scalpel/articleshow/85192321.cms||---
---||Kochi||Russian ‘catas-trophe’ avoided||Idukki: A cat held up at Delhi airport for not having a Covid negative certificate has been reunited with its owner in Idukki after about a week. Ginju the cat which arrived with Dr Yadukrishna from Russia on July 30 was supposed to be loaded on to a plane to Kochi with him but was stopped at security for not showing a Covid negative certificate. Yadukrishna was forced to take the connecting flight to Kerala the next day leaving Ginju with the customs officials who shifted the pet to a care centre. After reaching Kerala Yadukrishna contacted the agency which demanded Rs 1 lakh from him for getting the pet tested. Though he was advised by relatives and friends to forget about the cat, Yadukrishna sought the help of a lawyer who negotiated with the agency and brought down the fees to Rs 5,000. Finally, the cat was sent in a cargo plane after it underwent a Covid test and arrived safely in Kochi airport on Saturday. “Russia is a pet-friendly country and I did not face any hurdles while I was leaving for India,” says Yadukrishna, an MMBS student at Crimea Federal University in Crimea near Moscow. He says he befriended the cat and started feeding her after finding her one day in his hostel room. When his roommate returned to India during the start of the pandemic, caring for the pet fell upon him. He started forming an unbreakable bond with Ginju who provided him companionship and consistency in the uncertain times of the pandemic. “It became impossible for me to leave him in Russia. For the last one year I had spent most of my time with him. He played with me and slept with me and helped me through the coronavirus crisis. That is why I decided to bring him home with me,” says Yadukrishna. “The customs officials said they will not release the cat without a Covid negative certificate. My connecting flight was at 2pm the same day and I did not have enough time to procure one. The officials shifted the cat to a care centre. I had to send an authorization letter to my friend in Delhi who took over the cat and sent him on a cargo flight,” says Yadukrishna. “Though the unforeseen events created some anxious moments I am relieved now. Ginju is now part of our home,” says Yadukrishna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/russian-catas-trophe-avoided/articleshow/85177524.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Nagpur||Academics question need for Std XI CET||NAGPUR: Academics are questioning the need for Std X CET, considering that over 40% seats were vacant in the 2020-21 session. Vacant Std XI seats in Nagpur and other places in Maharashtra is not a new phenomenon but considering the almost 100% pass rate this year, there was a concern over availability of seats. But senior academics say all passouts will be ‘easily’ absorbed. An academic, who is closely involved with the Centralized Admission Process (CAP), said, “Look at last year’s SSC passing rate. It’s a staggering 94.6% for our district. But even with this record breaking number of students passing, we have almost half of our Std XI seats lying vacant.” Another junior college principal said, “But will we be able to have enough for the 2021-22 session, considering that the pass rate is above 99%? Yes, definitely. Even with almost 95% students passing, we had half the seats vacant. So there is enough scope to absorb these students.” These statistics have prompted senior academics to question the need for CET. A junior college principal said, “My problem is that the academic session is getting delayed. We could have started admissions now itself through CAP rather than taking such a long and circuitous route.” An education official said that the government wanted to have a level playing ground for everyone for the XI admissions. “In our state board junior colleges, students from other boards also flock in high numbers. If their overall scores are higher than our kids, then it won’t be fair as everything this year has been done on internal assessments. With CET, we can still have a fairly transparent method of judging applicants,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/academics-question-need-for-std-xi-cet/articleshow/85192265.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Kochi||Catholic Church to conduct campaign against MTP Act today||Kochi: Archbishop of Verapoly Mar Joseph Kalathiparambil on Monday said that life should be protected from the time it forms in the womb till it is naturally lost. He was speaking at a prayer ceremony held in connection with the observation of the ‘Day of Protection of Life’ in Kerala Catholic Church on Tuesday. Earlier, the Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council (KCBC) had called for observing August 10, the 50th anniversary of implementing the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act in India as a ‘Day of Protection of Life’. KCBC, in a statement issued following its monsoon summit, also said that the Catholic Church’s stand was that human life should be respected from the time of conception. “Protection of Life is the responsibility of the society. Catholic Church always takes the initiative to respect human life, and it upholds its significance,” archbishop Kalathiparambil said. The family commission of the KCBC has called for various Pro-life activities to be held in parishes across the state. The commission has said in a statement that through abortions, crores of infants were ‘killed’ in the past 50 years. The commission also said that activities will be held in all 32 Catholic dioceses in the state as part of the observation of ‘Day of Protection of Life’. “The programmes suggested by the commission include conducting masses for the infants who were ‘killed’, digital blackout, ringing the death knell for two minutes, holding memorials etc. The day would be observed under the leadership of the Pro-Life committee in every diocese,” KCBC said. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act of 1971 is a law that empowers every Indian woman with the right to consent to the termination of pregnancy if it involves a risk to her mental health, among other reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/catholic-church-to-conduct-campaign-against-mtp-act-today/articleshow/85192328.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘As a child, parents told me of their role for ‘Quit India’ & time they spent in jail’||MUMBAI: Seventy-nine years after the historic Quit India movement when Mahatma Gandhi gave the call of ‘Karo ya maro’ (Do or die), Mumbai-based social worker and activist, Dr Nandini Kulkarni (68) recalls how her parents — D P Karmarkar and Shantabai Karmarkar –– had participated in the freedom movement and were jailed at Dharwad. She has photos and documents of the Quit India days which show her parents at the forefront. Quite a few of these documents which had been carefully preserved at her Malad home were destroyed in the 26/7 deluge of 2005. “My father, Dattatray P Karmarkar, was 40 years old during the launch of August Kranti in 1942, my mother was 22. They were impressed by Bapu’s ‘Do or die’ call. In 1943, when my mother was sent to jail in Dharwad, her first child went along behind bars; but the child died after her release a year later. The way my father was brought from Bombay to Dharwad to be arrested is an interesting story,” said Dr Kulkarni, who works for animal welfare and cancer awareness. A senior police officer during British Raj, Narayanrao Kamte, (whose grandson Ashok Kamte, an IPS officer, was slain during the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack near Cama Hospital) was tasked with bringing freedom fighter Karmarkar from Bombay to Dharwad by train. “As my father [Karmarkar] was a popular lawyer and leading freedom fighter, a mob had gathered at Dharwad railway station... Police officer, Kamte realised things could turn violent and asked his men to get off one station before Dharwadwith Karmarkar. Kamte was a gentleman who never harassed freedom fighters while doing his duty,” said Dr Kulkarni. “My parents used to tell us how messages scribbled on paper were secretly sent out using the common milkmen and other travelling salesmen to deliver them, without raising suspicion,” said Dr Kulkarni. Dr Kulkarni added: “Looking back at the past eight decades, I feel India has progressed, but I feel that a lot more work needs to be done.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-as-a-child-parents-told-me-of-their-role-for-quit-india-time-they-spent-in-jail/articleshow/85194307.cms||Vijay Singh
---||India||After loan scam, fraudsters from China now bring investment apps||HYDERABAD: Chinese fraudsters, infamous for their loan apps, are back in business. They have now floated investment apps through their former employees and duped people. Over 80 investment fraud cases have been registered in the past few months in Hyderabad alone. Police arrested two Indians last week who were working for the Chinese racketeers based abroad. The latest modus operandi is to send bulk SMSes to people offering part-time work-from-home opportunities with an MNC with an assured daily earning of between Rs 1,000 and Rs 3,000, Cyberabad ACP K Balakrishna Reddy said. "A click on the link in the SMS leads the victim to get in touch with the fraudsters, who will ask them to register on a website or an app through Telegram. Then, the victim is asked to pay a small amount, which will double within one or two days. Once the victim invests a bigger amount, the fraudsters stop payment," Hyderabad ACP KVM Prasad said. From the 50 complaints received, police tracked down two bank account holders from Hyderabad - A Srinivasa Rao (45), an accountant, and N Vijaya Krishna (37). Police said Rao told them he had worked at a private company operated by two Chinese whom he knew as Michel and Jollie. "He claims they shut the business in January and left," police said. "Like in loan app cases, the investment sites and apps have similar interfaces. So the Chinese fraudsters, whose original names we are yet to identify, are behind this fraud," police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-loan-scam-fraudsters-from-china-now-bring-investment-apps/articleshow/85197131.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Doctors opt for pre-term delivery to save pregnant Covid patients||MUMBAI: Sunita Kumbalkar, a 30-year-old police constable, tested positive for Covid-19 in the 31st week of her pregnancy and had to be hospitalized for breathlessness and low oxygen saturation levels. Kumbalkar’s lungs were deteriorating and she was put on a non-invasive ventilator. Aggressive treatment for Covid posed multiple challenges due to her pregnancy. The treating doctors at Apollo Hospital in Belapur, where she was admitted, thereafter took a decision to go for pre-term delivery to save her life. Kumbalkar underwent an emergency Caesarean section and delivered a baby girl. As the patient could not be kept on a ventilator for a long period, a tracheostomy (an opening created at the front of the neck to insert a tube in the windpipe to help breathing) was done on her. Subsequently, her condition improved and her oxygen requirement drastically reduced. With a roller-coaster health graph, she was eventually discharged after almost a month in hospital. Today, both mother and baby are well. Kumbalkar is not the only instance of severely Covid-affected pregnant mothers who had to undergo pre-term delivery in the second wave of the pandemic. Several pregnant mothers were admitted to hospitals with severe lung involvement in their third trimester of pregnancy and were asked to go for pre-term delivery for better Covid treatment. Dr Vandana Gawdi, the gynaecologist who was treating Kumbalkar, said, “We came across six high risk cases.” Infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Srivastava said he has come across similar cases. “Mother’s safety is paramount, so whatever needs to be done to see to it gets done,” he said. Dr V A Sajit Babu, a pulmonologist at a private hospital, said, “We give Remdesivir to Covid-positive pregnant women with informed consent but we are cautious about administering drugs like Tocilizumab, as there are apprehensions about possible effects on the baby.” He added they opted for pre-term delivery in a swine flu patient, with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), who was on the ventilator. Paediatrician Dr Ashok Gawdi said, “During the second wave of Covid-19, there was an increase in pregnant mothers coming in with severe lung involvement. In cases with worsening oxygen saturation and imminent need for putting a mother on a ventilator, decisions were taken to deliver prematurely.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-doctors-opt-for-pre-term-delivery-to-save-pregnant-covid-patients/articleshow/85189408.cms||Sanjeev Devasia
---||Nagpur||Greens, wildlife buffs miffed over coal block in Gondkhairi||NAGPUR: At a time when human-animal is at its peak in the Vidarbha region due to shrinking wildlife habitats claiming 37 lives, allotment of coal block to Adani Power Maharashtra Limited (APML) in Gondkhairi, 20km from the city, has ruffled the feathers of environmentalists and wildlife conservationists. On August 4, Adani won bid for Gondkhairi coal block to extract 1 MTPA of coal for Rs122.83 crores. Greens have been critical about the allotment as 112 hectares of rich open mixed forest land, equivalent to 277 football fields is part of the block and will be diverted for mining. Wildlife conservationists, who have been fighting to mitigate conflict and save wildlife and forests in the region, have flayed BJP’s government doublespeak about promoting renewable energy on one hand and allotting coal blocks in wildlife-rich pockets on the other. In 2008, the coal block was allotted for underground mining to a joint venture of three parties but mining was never done perhaps due to coal allocation scam. In the 13 years, Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 has been amended and corridors and buffer zones for tiger reserves have been notified. The tiger number in Maharashtra in 2008 was 131 and has jumped to 312 as per the in 2018 as per the ‘Status of Tigers, Co-predators & Prey India’. In 2014, Bor was declared a tiger reserve and since then there is a jump in tiger numbers with the spillover population dispersing to Kalmeshwar range. “There are resident tigers in the Kalmeshwar range and the said forest patch in the coal block is being used by big cats. There is also the presence of Schedule animals in the area. In September 2019, a tiger had ventured into Fetri from Kalmeshwar from the said forest patches. Not only this, an area adjoining the coal block also has forest which will be affected due to mining,” said a section of RFOs who worked in Kalmeshwar. “The department should vary if it is a corridor. Even if it is not, tigers must be using such patches and may require such forest areas for survival. In a similar proposal in the Pandharkawda division, the PCCF had formed an expert committee to take a call. This project should also be treated on similar lines. Such projects fragment tiger habitats causing conflict,” says ex-honorary wildlife warden Jaydeep Das. “It’s quite amazing that when the entire world is moving away from coal, and the impact of climate change is staring us in the face, Adani is not only bidding for new coal mines in India but is even going ahead with their coal mine in Australia, supposedly one of biggest coal mines in the world,” says environmentalist Debi Goenka. “It is also now evident that none of the power stations in India, including the Tiroda power plant operated by Adani, is able to comply with the provisions of the fly ash notification. Allowing to mine the coal from Gondkhairi close to Nagpur is not only going to aggravate these problems but will also add to the pollution,” Goenka adds. Sudhir Paliwal, convenor, Vidarbha Environment Action Group (VEAG), said, “Even as mining will be done underground, it will cause acid mine drainage due to sulfur content of coal. It will contaminate surface and groundwater with oil, tan and grease mixing in water and will also destroy Surabardi lake.” “In Murpaar near Chimur, the underground coal mine by WCL has caused water scarcity thereby depriving farmers of drinking water and irrigation. All the village wells have gone dry. High pollution is expected as most of the mined coal will be transported in open trucks,” said Paliwal. However, even as the coal block has been allotted, deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Bharat Singh Hada said, “In case of forest land diversion, the company will have to submit a formal proposal online under FCA with the state nodal officer. It will then come to me for critical review and only after site visits and surveys a decision will be taken. As of now, no proposal has been submitted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/greens-wildlife-buffs-miffed-over-coal-block-in-gondkhairi/articleshow/85189900.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man attempts to hang daughter to get estranged wife back, held||MUMBAI: To get his estranged wife to return to live with him, a Malad man allegedly tried to murder their minor daughter and clicked photographs of “the scene” to send over to his wife. Neighbours intervened in the nick of time and rescued the 13-year-old girl while her father was trying to hang her from a ceiling fan. Ajay Gaud, the accused, has been arrested. Police said Gaud, who is in his 30s, works as a painter with a media company. He has four children. Around two years ago, his wife, Puja, moved out of their home in Malad’s Kurar village after frequent fights. She later told the police that her husband used to beat her up. She took the children with her and moved to her hometown in UP. “Gaud started to live with his father, his brother and brother’s family. But he would call up Puja often and ask her to return home. The two would fight over the phone. Puja had made it clear that she would never return to live with him,” a police officer said. About a month and a half ago, Gaud brought his two elder children—a 13-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy—to Mumbai to pursue online education. The children would speak to their mother over the phone which he did not like. As a result, the children too suffered beatings. On Saturday, Gaud tied a dupatta to the ceiling fan of his house and slipped the other end around his eldest daughter’s neck. He then got her to climb an overturned bucket and insisted she jump off so she would get strangled with the dupatta and die.  He had started clicking photos of his daughter standing over the bucket with the intention to send them to Puja and get her to return to Mumbai. His plan was to pass off the murder as a suicide. “He threatened his daughter that he would start the ceiling fan and she would lose her life anyway if she did not jump off the bucket. The girl raised an alarm which alerted neighbours. They rushed to her aid and brought her down. A local resident called up the police control room,” said senior inspector Prakash Bele, Kurar police. Before this, Gaud had put his son to sleep, then covered his body with a white sheet, lit up incense sticks and taken photos to send to his wife, to pretend their son had died by suicide too. Later, Gaud’s brother, Suchit, registered a police complaint against him. Gaud was produced before a magistrate court. — Nitasha Natu||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-attempts-to-hang-daughter-to-get-estranged-wife-back-held/articleshow/85188870.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan & Kamal Nath cross swords on ‘tribal day’||BHOPAL: Noisy scenes were seen in the Madhya Pradesh assembly on Monday with Congress criticizing the BJP government for not giving a holiday on ‘tribals’ day’, and BJP accusing Congress of playing into the hands of an “international conspiracy” of conversion of tribals. The ruckus in the House spilled on to the streets as Congress workers marched to gherao the assembly. Police dispersed them with a lathicharge. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said BJP has all along worked for tribal welfare and announced a government holiday on November 15, the birth anniversary of tribal freedom fighter Birsa Munda. Leader of Opposition Kamal Nath drummed up support for the Congress cause by playing a dholak outside the assembly. Speaking to reporters, Nath said, “This is tremendous humiliation of the tribal population. Tribals are not hungry for contracts and commissions; they only long for respect. Our government had declared a holiday on August 9 and sent money to every block to celebrate it. Today is International Tribal Day, not just for Madhya Pradesh. It has now become tribal humiliation day. I paid homage in the House for the death of International Day of World’s Indigenous Peoples, which this government has done.” Chouhan hit back by saying: “I condemn Kamal Nath ji and Congress for spreading confusion and insulting the departed leaders in the House. Congress is playing politics in the name of tribals and insulted tradition by shedding crocodile tears,” said Chouhan. “November 15 will be celebrated as ‘Janajatiya Gaurav Divas’ (Tribal Pride Day). It will be a holiday and we will run a special campaign on tribal culture, tradition, employment and values in the entire state,” he added. BJP state president VD Sharma argued that August 9 has nothing to do with the history of tribals. “International Day of World Indigenous People is observed on August 9. This is the idea of international forces who want to promote conversion and break India’s tribal society. Congress is becoming a participant in this conspiracy. It wants to forget the contribution of tribal brothers in Indian history,” said Sharma. Earlier in the day, the House witnessed uproar as Congress legislators raised slogans and trooped into the well, demanding a public holiday on ‘Tribals’ Day’. “BJP government has changed ‘Adivasi Samman Diwas’ into ‘Adivasi Apmaan Diwas’,” said Nath. Chouhan countered that it was BJP that built cenotaphs of tribal heroes like Rani Durgavati, Tantya Bhil, Bhima Nayak and Shankar Shah. “When the Congress government was in power for 10 years, Digvijaya Singh did not fill the recruitment backlog. Now they talk about the backlog. The posts remained vacant only because of the Congress government. BJP wants to ask the LoP, which act have you implemented? How much work did you do on the Fifth Schedule? Now shedding only tears to spread confusion," Chouhan said. The BJP government opened ashram-schools and hostels in villages for tribals and is paying the fees for tribal children who study in private engineering and medical colleges, the CM said. Congress took its protest to the streets. After the House was adjourned for the day, Congress workers led by MLAs Jaivardhan Singh and Kamleshwar Patel marched to gherao the assembly. Police resorted to lathicharge. Jaivardhan and Patel were arrested briefly. The duo said Congress believes in fighting for the rights of tribals, deprived classes, farmers and working class. They alleged atrocities are being committed against tribals in the BJP regime. “BJP will never bring tribals into the mainstream,” the two former ministers said. In the afternoon, the state Congress held a function to observe August 9 as both International Day of World’s Indigenous Peoples and anniversary of the Quit India Movement. Nath addressed the gathering and reminded that it was on August 9 that Quit India Movement started and Azad Hind Fauj was founded. In the morning, Nath had met Governor Mangu Bhai Patel with CLP members and discussed the state’s tribal affairs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shivraj-nath-cross-swords-in-assembly-on-tribal-day/articleshow/85192405.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Gang rivalry leads to firing at goon in morning attack||NAGPUR: An ongoing gang rivalry led to firing in which a goon was injured after a bullet pierced his right leg in an early morning attack near Geetanjali Talkies in the wee hours of Monday. The attack has kept cops on their toes but the perpetrators are yet to be nabbed. The cops now face a tricky challenge as the place where the shootout took place does not have any CCTV cameras. The car of the perpetrators can be seen from another camera at a distance. Despite the injury, the victim and his aides chased away their rivals by counter attacking with bricks and stones. It’s learnt that Mohsin Ahmed alias Mohsin Akola, who has criminal records, had come to Geetanjali Square to accompany his close aide Raja to his residence at Bhaldarpura. Ahmed was also accompanied by Rojan, another friend. The trio was returning from Taj Bagh. Police said Ahmed’s elder brother Danish Haji too is a dreaded criminal. Mushtafik alias Mushfik, having several offences against him, including kidnapping at Sadar police station, along with his four other accomplices, including Altaf Mirza, had intercepted Ahmed’s car before firing a bullet at him. As Mushtafik was readying for a repeat fire, he and his accomplice, Mirza, were attacked by the injured Ahmed and his aides who started raining stones and bricks at their rivals before forcing them to flee. It’s learnt that Mushtafik was insulted and threatened in court by Ahmed and his aide Wasim Dosa last week. Mushtafeek’s aide Awez Memon had assaulted Dosa in the past which triggered a fierce rivalry between the two groups. Last year, Ahmed was threatened and assaulted by his rivals at Maskasath during the lockdown. Ahmed’s close aide, Wasim Cheera, had fired bullets in the air at Maskasath before ransacking several vehicles in the locality. Tehsil police have registered a case of attempt to murder against Mushtafeek, Mirza and others. “The perpetrators would be nabbed soon,” said Zonal DCP Lohit Matani. Sources also stated that Ahmed was nabbed last year while engaging in some illegal activities but released shortly under questionable circumstances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gang-rivalry-leads-to-firing-at-goon-in-morning-attack/articleshow/85189966.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Mumbai||NIA submits draft charges against 15 accused in Elgar Parishad case||MUMBAI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Mond-ay submitted before a special court draft charges against 15 acc-used in the Elgar Parishad case. The accused were earlier booked for charges relating to sedition and terror activities. The court will now hear arguments on the draft charges from both the prosecution and the defence and then decide what charges, if any, are to be framed against them. “The draft charges are as good as opening the prosecution's case. Now I have to hear them on which sections are attracted or not...” the court said. The NIA has alleged that the December 31, 2017, Elgar Parishad at Shaniwarwada, Pune, was funded by the banned CPI (Maoist) as part of a conspiracy to create unrest. The agency alleged that provocative speeches by Kabir Kala Manch activists led to the January 1, 2018, caste clashes at Koregaon-Bhima. While 16 activists were arrested, Jesuit priest and tribal rights activist, Fr Stan Swamy (84), who was lodged at Taloja jail since his arrest on October 8, died in hospital last month. The prosecution on Monday filed a copy of his detailed death report. Poet-activist Varavara Rao is out on bail. The NIA had earlier submitted that during investigations, it was found that senior leaders of CPI (Maoist) were in contact with the Elgar organisers and the arrested accused. It further alleged that the accused “conspired to further the ideology of CPI (Maoist) and abetted violence, brought into hatred and incited disaffection towards the government…and promoted enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, caste and community.” The NIA had invoked charg-es under the IPC relating to sedition, criminal conspiracy, abetment of an offence punishable with death or life term if offence not committed, waging or atte-mpting to wage war or abetting waging of war, against the gove-rnment, promoting enmity between groups on ground of religion, race, etc, destruction of ev-idence and statements conducting public mischief. They were also booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Once charges are framed, accused have to apprise the cou-rt if they plead guilty or not. If it’s the latter, a trial will start ag-ainst them. In the interim, they can move discharge pleas. During Monday’s hearing, the defence sought a copy of the discharge plea submitted by special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty. The prosecution said the charges were based on the evidence in the chargesheet already submitted. The defence reiterated its plea for cloned copies of all the electronic evidence gathered in the case. Meanwhile, accused Ramesh Gaichor and Sagar Gorkhe have moved the court seeking bail. The court noted that a report had been received from Taloja jail superintendent about alleged misconduct by Gaic-hor and co-accused Sudhir Dhawale and Arun Ferreira. Accused Anand Teltumbde’s lawyer told the court that he was yet to be taken for his medical tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nia-submits-draft-charges-against-15-accused-in-elgar-parishad-case/articleshow/85192449.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: NCP too says MVA allies to fight civic polls separately||MUMBAI: A month after state Congress president Nana Patole declared that the Congress would contest the forthcoming civic and zilla parishad elections on its own, the Sharad Pawar-led NCP too said on Monday that though the MVA government comprises three parties, the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will contest the local elections separately. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik said that while the MVA government has three parties, no party is in a mood to contest the civic and zilla parishad elections jointly. “The MVA has three constituents, and we (Sena, NCP and Congress) are not in a mood to contest the elections independently. After the results are out, we will decide the course of action to keep the BJP out of power. Even if we contest the elections separately, the MVA will remain intact,” Malik said. Malik said the possibility of the MVA constituents putting up common candidates against the BJP is ruled out. But since, in several districts, there is no presence of the BJP, the NCP, Congress and Sena will not hesitate to put up candidates against each other. “In several zilla parishads and municipal corporations, BJP may not put up its candidates, so the constituents of MVA will contest the elections against each other,” he said. Malik pointed out that in several districts and municipal corporations, the MVA allies will take a decision on an alliance depending on local conditions. “Take the case of Kolhapur. I will not be surprised if it witnesses a triangular contest between the Sena, Congress and NCP, since the BJP does not exist there. A similar situation exists in several corporations and zilla parishads,” he added. A month ago, when Patole had said that Congress will contest all ensuing polls independently, he had been at the receiving end of criticism, with his critics saying that it was not the policy of the AICC and that he did not have the backing of the Congress high command, particularly Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. All India Congress Committee general secretary H K Patil, who is in charge of Maharashtra, too had distanced himself from Patole’s statement, saying it was too early to talk on alliances for the 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly elections. Even senior state cabinet members had distanced themselves from Patole’s statements. The only politician who came out in support of Patole was Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap, who made it clear that Congress had the organizational strength to contest the elections independently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncp-too-says-mva-allies-to-fight-civic-polls-separately/articleshow/85192495.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Over 200-300 workers, drones, three boats, rescue teams from DRF, fire services and GHMC were pressed into service to trace the body of Ananthaiah in the manholes and nearby water bodies. Ananthaiah along with another worker Shiva had died due to asphyxiation while taking up drain desilting work at Padmavathi Colony last Tuesday. While the body of Shiva was traced soon after the incident, Ananthaiah’s body was found after almost a week as it was swept away in the overflowing stormwater drain. The decomposed body was found floating in a manhole more than 10 feet down. Ananthaiah’s family, who were waiting at the spot to receive his body after the search team traced it, were seen wailing inconsolably. “We had also called a team from Coimbatore to send a camera into the stormwater drain. But the body was traced by our DRF and GHMC search teams before the team from Coimbatore was pressed into service this morning (Monday),” said LB Nagar MLA D Sudheer Reddy. Earlier, taking serious note of the lapses which lead to the death of the two workers, the state government had suspended an assistant engineer and a work inspector, and terminated one outsourcing worker overseeing the civic works in the area. The government also transferred two senior officials from the GHMC to the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation and Jagtial municipality with immediate effect. On Saturday, Hyderabad mayor Vijayalaxmi Gadwal along with LB Nagar MLA D Sudheer Reddy handed over ex gratia of 10 lakh each to the families of the two deceased workers and an extra ex gratia of 2 lakh each was also released from the mayor’s fund for the kin. The mayor also promised 2BHK houses to the family members of both workers. The contractor, who was held responsible for not following the rules, has also provided 5 lakh each to the two families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-6-days-body-of-worker-who-died-in-drain-found/articleshow/85195578.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid-19: 80% of July samples had Delta variant in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, which led to a massive number of viral infections during the second Covid-19 wave, remains the dominant strain in circulation in the national capital.  It has been detected in at least 80% of the samples sent for genome sequencing by Delhi government in the last three months. In July, data shared by the health department at a meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) showed that the Delta variant was detected in 83.3% of the samples sent for genome sequencing. In May and June, the variant was found in 81.7% and 88.6% of the samples, respectively. In April, it was found in 53.9% of the samples. The other “variant of concern” detected in samples sent by Delhi government to National Centre for Disease Control for genome sequencing was Alpha. “The second wave of the pandemic hasn’t ended yet. The dominance of the Delta variant among the samples is proof of this. This variant is still in circulation. We are seeing fewer cases in Delhi because many people have been exposed to it already,” said Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council, adding that the dominance of the Delta variant was a major reason behind daily cases being high across the country. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is a sub-lineage of the Kappa variant (B.1.617), which was first detected in Maharashtra in October 2020. It has now spread to several parts of the world. Scientists said Delta was not just highly transmissible compared to other variants, but it also had a higher viral load as well as vaccination breakthrough rate. In a study published recently, top scientists from NCDC, CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology and Academy for Scientific and Innovative Research noted, “…prior infections, high seropositivity and partial vaccination are insufficient impediments to its spread.” The study concluded, “Strong public health measures will be needed globally for its containment.” Dr Gupta, who is also a DDMA member, said wearing a mask, social distancing and maintaining hand hygiene were a must to prevent disease spread. Also, vaccination rates had to go up. “A third wave of the pandemic may or may not come. It will depend on further mutation in the novel coronavirus and its transmissibility,” he added. Mutations or viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has been seen mostly in immune-compromised patients, like those suffering from cancer, TB and HIV, with persistent infection. In an article published in New England Journal of Medicine, top US scientists argued that heightened precautions should be taken to avert the transmission of Covid-19 to immune-compromised patients in hospital settings to reduce this risk. “Such patients should be prioritised for immunisation not only to protect them from SARS-CoV-2, but also to mitigate persistent infections,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/80-of-july-samples-had-delta-variant/articleshow/85192468.cms||---

Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) play a key role in the last-mile delivery of social health schemes, especially in rural or urban low incomes neighborhoods. After reaching Nagpur, the members joined a larger group at Samvidhan Square, where Citu leaders talked about both the central and state issues. Rajendra Sathe, district president of Citu’s Asha Gatpravartak Karmachari Union said, “For a long time, Asha workers have been fighting for their rights but the state government does not seem keen on fulfilling their demands. While there are multiple issues related to them, giving proper compensation to Asha workers is the most important one. These women are the real frontline workers and have played a crucial role in monitoring Covid-19 patients who are recovering at home.” Jyoti Undersahate, an Asha worker and also city head of the same union, said, “From August 17, we are starting a “mobile waapis karo” (return the mobile) agitation. We will return the mobiles in which the government has given us an app to track delivery of health services. The app is in English and many of our members aren’t able to understand it, due to which mistakes happen. Since we are in Maharashtra, this app must be in Marathi.”Citu leaders said they included the farmers issue in today's protest to show their support for the agitation being spearheaded by farmers in the North. Asha workers have been demanding a minimum monthly remuneration of Rs18,000 from the currently under Rs10,000 they get. Their union has also demanded that government reimburse their additional expenses like mobile bill, stationery charges as they have multiple paperwork to handle. Sathe said, “Also our workers must be kept away from any form of Covid-19 testing work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citu-protests-against-insufficient-compensation-to-asha-workers/articleshow/85190014.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

KTR, along with AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, municipal administration principal secretary Arvind Kumar and other senior officials held a review meeting on various ongoing and proposed works for development in the Old City. KTR specifically reviewed the progress of construction works of flyovers and roads under Strategic Road and Nala Development Programmes (SRDP and SNDP), double bedroom houses, reservoirs, laying new pipelines, among others, in various Assembly constituencies in the Old City. The minister told officials and contractors to discuss with him in case of any hurdles in execution of these works. Focus should be on completing all the works as per schedule, he added. Asaduddin Owaisi, who took out time from the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament to attend the review meeting, told TOI that it was a successful meeting as KTR made it clear that laxity will not be tolerated. Owaisi thanked KTR for holding the meeting and said the discussion was mostly on the works that were already sanctioned but there was slow progress on it. “We discussed speeding up nala widening works which was stopped after the floods. Widening of numerous roads in the old city, Charminar Pedestrianisation Project, construction of flyovers would be speeded up,” he said. The beautification of Mir Alam Tank including a musical fountain and Murghi Chowk, and construction of a five-kilometre flyover from Zoo Park to Aramghar cross roads was also discussed. The contractors were told to complete the 2-BHK housing project at Farooqnagar and Jangammet. It was also proposed to lay a new sewer line in Karwan Assembly constituency. “Karwan needs a new sewer system completely in the constituency. The highest number of sewer-related complaints to Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board are from Karwan,” Owaisi said. Owaisi also made it clear that the meeting did not have any political significance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ktr-reviews-infra-works-in-old-city-with-owaisi/articleshow/85195580.cms||Roushan Ali

They sang songs, staged street plays against the “unacceptable” rules of the state government in the name of Covid-19 restrictions. Senior theatre activist Virendra Ganvir said, “What is the point in allowing theatrical activity with the limit of 50 audience members? We need at least 50% occupancy of the theatre venues to make the performance viable.” He added, “Present rules allow for either 50% capacity or 50 people, whichever is lowest. Obviously, the number 50 will be lower as there is no venue in the city smaller than that.” Veteran theatre activist, stage and film actor Madhu Joshi also appealed to the state government to allow theatrical activity. “Why ban theatre — which is the most disciplined activity — and allow political gatherings and government functions where hundreds of people come together,” he asked. Charudatta Jichkar, who coordinated this agitation to mark August Kranti Diwas, said, “Its not just about artistes or singers. We had producers, writers, booking clerks, managers, labourers, door keepers, distributors, instrumentalists, light men, make-up artists, spot boys and the entire ecosystem that runs on theatre and cultural activities agitating today. We are running out of patience now. The government should come up with a proper plan for us.” The latest order issued late Sunday night by NMC did not allow theatre activity with 50% capacity of venue. Theatre season generally begins in August and continues till February-March. For amateur theatre artistes, the state-level drama competition is the main event which was cancelled last year. They are waiting for the activity to resume.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/want-theatre-resumption-with-50-capacity-artistes/articleshow/85190030.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Delhi||Delhi: Schools gear up to bring back 10th, 12th students||NEW DELHI: Resuming school for students of Class X and XII in Delhi is not just a question of opening the school gates. There is a lot to be done and the institutions have got down to the nitty-gritty. The vaccination status of teachers and students aged 18+ years has to be determined, the consent of parents for their children to come to school has to be acquired and timetables complying with Covid-appropriate protocols have to be prepared. The Directorate of Education (DoE) ordered on Monday that the consent of the parents was a must, especially because many parents aren’t too keen on their children going to schools at this time. On Sunday, Delhi Disaster Management Authority said that schools could reopen for practicals, project work, admissions and counselling from August 9. Most schools did not resume on Monday, though some government institutions called students in batches for counselling and admission processes. Jyoti Arora, principal, Mount Abu Public School, said, “We will take at least a week’s time for preparations. I have collected the important data on the vaccination status of the teachers and have asked them to work out schedules for calling the students to school.” At The Indian School, principal Tania Joshi was categorical that only vaccinated teachers would be allowed to report to work. “We have the experience of January when board students were allowed to come to school for practicals and projects. We will follow the same steps, dividing students into groups of 10-15 and holding two or three class sessions while calling Class X and XII children on alternate days,” said Joshi. Government schools too will be able to resume classes only after some days. “The circular came late on Monday, so we will have a meeting on Tuesday to prepare the timetable,” said Sunil Kumar Joon, teacher at Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School, Ghitorni. “We need parental consent, so we will send them Google forms. The children can get the physical forms when they come to school.” However, many parents are apprehensive about their children going to school. Pooja Jain, mother of Class XII student at Manav Sthali School, Rajendra Nagar, said, “The second wave has just diminished and vaccination for children hasn’t happened yet, so I am little concerned.” Another parent, Munish Tamang, whose daughter studies in Class X at Springdales School, Dhaula Kuan, similarly said, “I will not send my daughter because I don’t feel safe. People in their age group haven’t been given the jab yet.” Delhi Parents’ Association conducted a survey on social media platforms and found that over 79% parents did not want school opened just yet. “Contrary to government figures, the responses we got shows parents do want schools to resume,” claimed Aprajita Gautam, member of the association. In contrast, the government claims that around 33,000 stakeholders have written in, with 58% wanting resumption of classes. Deepa Kakkar, parent of a student at The Srijan School, Model Town, was of the view that gradual reopening of schools was good for the children. “My daughter was in the first batch of students in January to attend the practical classes before the board exams,” she reported. “It was really helpful for her. The school held an orientation on Covid dos and don’ts,” said Kakkar, a member of the parents’ association of the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/schools-gear-up-to-bring-back-10th-12th-students/articleshow/85192501.cms||Shradha Chettri

It’s not only losses for the businesses, but salaries of a number of staffers have been halved as those providing ancillary services are also in dire straits.“Single-screen theatres are already in bad shape and the pandemic has made it worse. Even if the curbs go, it’s not likely that all the theatres would be able to resume the show soon after,” said Sanjay Surana, former honorary secretary of Central Cine Circuit Association.Surana, who runs theatres like Sudama, Liberty and Kamal in the city apart from cinema halls in Jalgaon and Bhusawal, said smaller the city, worse is the condition.“If theatres cannot run due to Covid, there is no relaxation in taxes also. Maharashtra has the highest property tax for theatres, which is linked to the seating capacity. There is no relaxation even if there is no business. Other overheads like power bills also continue. Staff engaged for house-keeping and security need to be given full salary,” he said.Surana said the theatre industry demands that cinema halls should be allowed to operate with 50% capacity, at least.Those running marriage venues like lawns and halls also want relaxation on the number of guests to be allowed. As against a limit of 50 persons attending a marriage, it is expected to be taken to 100 at least.“With 50 guests, it is not feasible to cater services to any event. Even those taking services offer to pay less, but then the overheads are the same, no matter if there are only 50 guests,” said Vijay Talmale of Marriage Lawns and Mangal Karyalaya Association.Marriage events are an industry in itself. A number of other service providers depend on a wedding event. The curbs have affected each of them, said Talmale.Dipen Agrawal, secretary of Sarkar Jagaon, Vanijya Bachao campaign demanding easing of curbs, said, “We have been impressing upon the administration to abide by its own order prescribing the level of risks and allow activities accordingly.Agrawal said, “Even otherwise, there is enough interaction among people. If infection is not spreading under the current circumstances, there seems to be no risk in allowing restaurants and movie halls to operate also,”Restaurateurs are expecting a good rush as food joints can operate till 10pm now, thought at half capacity.Dilip Kamdar, who runs Naivedhyam restaurant, said, “When the joints where allowed to operate for brief period till June 4, it was seen footfalls were good indeed. It is expected that customers may come back in good numbers as the restaurants operate till 10pm.”Sanjay Gupta of ITDC’s Hotel Ashok said the response will be seen in the coming days. “If some may find it safe to eat in a restaurant, others may still prefer to eat home food. As owners, we are making efforts for safety of both the staff and guests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/easing-of-curbs-revives-hopes-but-not-enough-as-show-must-go-on-bizmen/articleshow/85190049.cms||Shishir Arya

The matter came to light on Saturday when the teacher, identified as Arun Rathod, was caught in embarrassing situation with the girl on the school premises. Soon, a mob gathered at the spot and beat Rathod black and blue. On getting information, Yavatmal rural police station officer Kishor Junghare reached the spot and took the injured Rathod into custody. He was rushed to local Government Medical College and Hospital where he is undergoing treatment. According to villagers, Rathod used to call the girl to the school every day on the pretext of special classes though all educational institutes in the state were closed due to Covid pandemic. The teacher has been exploiting the girl for the last 3 years, the villagers alleged. Rathod had lured the girl with promise to ensure good marks for her in SSC and help her become a doctor apart from assuring to marry her after she turns 18, the villagers claimed, adding the teacher is already married. Police have registered a criminal offence under Section 376 of IPC and provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Junghare told TOI, “We have registered an offence and the culprit will be arrested immediately on his discharge from the hospital.” Meanwhile, president of Rahul Gandhi Vichar Manch Dr Meenakshi Sawalkar condemned the barbaric incident and demanded stringent action against the accused. “I have written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in this regard and would meet education minister Varsha Gaikwad at Mumbai and demand capital punishment for the culprit,” she said.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Job loss during pandemic led many to beg||NEW DELHI: A comprehensive socio-economic analysis of the state of those found begging on the streets of the national capital has described more than half of those surveyed (52%) as “new entrants” who have taken up begging during the past five years and around 40% as old-timers. Only 8% have been begging since birth. While most of those surveyed in the capital were forced to take up begging largely due to poverty, unemployment, illiteracy and factors like old age, disability and illness, focused group discussions across districts found that several who have lost their jobs or livelihood due to the Covid-19 pandemic were also forced into begging. TimesViewThis study reaffirms that the lower middle class and the impoverished have been the worst hit by Covid-19. That 52% of the beggars are new entrants means the economic situation is indeed grim and distressing. That 60% of them are 18-59 years old also means that joblessness is sharply on the rise. Economic policies as well as relief measures need to be framed keeping such harsh realities in mind.The study revealed that not all those surveyed were full-time into begging and that the other odd jobs they did clearly do not pay them enough to make both ends meet. One-fifth of those found begging in the streets were engaged in some part-time work such as working as a casual labourer — in construction projects and factories — ragpicker, domestic help, street vendor and rickshaw-puller. Some of them had petty businesses or were working in lowly-paid and temporary jobs. One-fourth of them reported that their family members were also involved in begging at some other locations in Delhi. A majority (65%) of the 20,719-plus beggars surveyed earned less than Rs 200 per day, 23% earned Rs 200-500 a day, and 12% per cent received alms in kind. Half (55%) of them were homeless or shelter-less while the rest (45%) resided either in slums or in jhuggi jhopdi (JJ) colonies. The study conducted by Institute for Human Development (IHD) between February and April this year was commissioned by the Delhi government as part of the social justice ministry’s pilot in 10 cities to develop a comprehensive rehabilitation plan for beggars. Institute for Human Development recently submitted the final draft report to the social welfare department, which is now examining it. Those forced to take up begging due to loss of work during the pandemic include certain categories such as women involved in domestic work, temporary workers in hotels, drivers and security guards. Professor Alakh Sharma, director of Institute for Human Development, said that going by the focused group discussions, it is estimated that 50-60% of 3,273 beggars who have taken up begging in the past one year must have done so because of loss of jobs during the pandemic. One of the case studies, that’s part of the Institute for Human Development report, reflects the challenges faced by many. A man from south India, identified as Baba Khan, has an MBA degree and was employed before the lockdown. “He got laid off by his company and faced a dire financial crisis. Unable to pay his rent and other expenses, he entered into a state of extreme depression and even tried committing suicide. His neighbours saved him and got him admitted to a hospital in Delhi. He was not able to pay the hospital bills and was thrown out of the hospital as well. He now stays in the vicinity of R K Puram Metro station and survives on alms he receives from people,” it is stated. The survey shows that those found begging were highly concentrated at religious places, streets or footpaths, traffic signals and market areas. The educational profiles of beggars show that while 70% of them were illiterate, around 22% had studied up to the primary level and 8% have secondary and above level of education. Around 67% of the beggars were migrants, mainly from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Going beyond the number of beggars surveyed, the report pitches the actual estimates of those involved in begging at 28,000, taking into account the fact that due to the pandemic, many of those involved in begging at certain locations had moved to a different place or had returned to their village. “We are examining the report. The findings will form the basis of an action plan that will be prepared for enabling effective rehabilitation of those engaged in beggary and also to protect high-risk groups by linking them to the various schemes of the government,” special secretary-cum-director, social welfare, Delhi government, Rashmi Singh told TOI. Skill and vocational programmes for those staying at shelters for the homeless in collaboration with Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) is one measure in the works. The IHD study noted that in focused group discussions, largely, everyone accepted that there has been a drop in their daily income during the Covid pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/job-loss-during-pandemic-led-many-to-beg/articleshow/85192546.cms||Ambika Pandit

Physical reopening of schools is done as per the education department orders, and so far only rural schools have been allowed to open.A city junior college principal said, “Coaching institutes cater to the same age group as ours. In fact, they are our students only who go there. So, it does not make sense that we are asking the same set of children to go for coaching but not attend schools.”Academics say the loss will be of students who are from commerce and arts stream. Purshottam Panchbhai, a senior academic, said, “Majority of science students attend coaching institutes in which even the board exam curriculum gets covered. For commerce, majority of students do not attend tuitions and for arts, it’s very rare. It’s these two groups that will suffer the most as physical classes are not operating.”For high schools too, academics feel that some decision can be taken. Ashnarayan Tiwari, a senior academic, said, “The education and health departments can hold a review and issue guidelines for reopening of high schools in city. Even though we live in an urban area and internet connectivity is much better, there are many students who can’t access online classes due to financial reasons. So, all these aspects will have to be considered and a decision needs to be taken by the authorities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/start-city-high-schools-jr-colleges-too-academics/articleshow/85190063.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

A report in this regard was filed by the investigating officer at Sultan Bathery First Class Magistrate court. Sultan Bathery deputy SP VV Benny said that the tribesmen and marginal farmers were being removed from the list of accused after finding that they had no role in the illegal felling of trees. Police said in the report that rosewood trees were felled from the lands of the said persons by Augustin brothers and other accused by deceiving them. It was found during the investigation that the other accused had prepared the application forms for felling of trees on behalf of the tribesmen by misusing the controversial revenue department order. The investigation team had found that even the application forms bore the handwriting of other accused. There were a total of 74 accused in the case. Cases have been registered against the accused under IPC section involving theft, destruction of public property etc. Meanwhile, the court, on Monday, granted three days custody of key accused Roji Augustin and his driver Vinish to the forest department. NT Sajan transferred Meanwhile, conservator of forest (social forestry) in Kozhikode, NT Sajan, who allegedly tried to mislead the investigation in Muttil tree felling case as per a departmental report, was transferred as conservator of forest (social forestry) in Kollam.

But exactly a year later, the number of flamingos at Kuda, 35 km from the famed ‘Flamingo City’, has drastically reduced to just about 800 from a staggering 3.5 lakh. Forest officials and experts both attribute this massive fall to poor rainfall this monsoon. Talking to TOI, Anita Karan, chief conservator of forest, Kutch circle said, “In August 2020, around 3.5 lakh flamingos were seen and they had made around 1.5 lakh nests at Kuda site. In August 2019 too, good breeding was observed and around one lakh of nests were seen. This year, however, their numbers have fallen due significantly less rainfall.” According to official data, as on August 8, 2021, Kutch district received just 31.74% of its average annual rainfall compared to 105.60% in the same period last year. Majority of the birds seen breeding last year at Kuda, which falls in Greater Rann of Kutch (GRK), were Lesser Flamingos species. According to bird watchers and forest officials, the situation is similar everywhere in the district. Kutch has been witnessing good rainfall since 2015 which consistently led to flamingos thronging here. Anda Beyt, known as Flamingo City in GRK, is preferred by Greater Flamingos for nesting and LRK mostly has Lesser Flamingos. In the Flamingo City, about 65,000 nests are observed every year, but according to the forest department, the numbers this year are negligible. Uday Vora, a retired forest officer who has been observing these birds, said, “Last year, the birds started laying eggs on August 3. They carry mud for making nest mounds in their beaks but this is possible only when the ground is wet.” Some rivers from north Gujarat and Saurashtra also tail into the desert of Kutch which floods LRK and GRK, especially when there is excessive rain. The birds breed in this sweet water. The water levels are so high that forest department teams have to use boats.According to experts, flamingos are very sensitive and if their nest is distubed, they abandon the eggs. The hatching percentage is between 60-80% in Kutch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/scanty-rains-flamingos-desert-kutch/articleshow/85188121.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The victim, Chenna Kesavulu, used to run his own news channel on YouTube. Both accused have been arrested. About a month ago, Kesavulu had run a series of reports on his channel on the alleged nexus between the main accused, Venkata Subbaiah — a constable of Nandyal II town police station — and matka gamblers and tobacco smugglers. Subsequently, a departmental inquiry was ordered against Subbaiah. Based on the probe report, the constable was suspended about two weeks ago. Infuriated over his suspension, Subbaiah conspired to eliminate Kesavulu. On Sunday night, he called the journalist to a small eatery at an isolated area on the pretext of solving their differences. When Kesavulu reached the spot, Subbaiah and his brother Nani stabbed him multiple times with a screwdriver. As people started approaching the spot on hearing Kesavulu’s cries for help, the attacker duo fled. The profusely bleeding reporter died on the way to a hospital. Several journalist organisations condemned the attack and demanded stringent punishment for the culprits. DGP Gautam Sawang ordered Kurnool SP Ch Sudheer Kumar Reddy to conduct an impartial probe and arrest the guilty. Later in the evening, DSP N Ramanji Naik, who is the investigation officer in the case, informed that both Subbaiah and his brother have been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/suspended-cop-brother-stab-scribe-to-death-in-nandyal/articleshow/85195602.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Since only visitors who have taken both doses of the vaccine were allowed entry into the malls, many in the 18-45 year age group could not visit their favourite haunts with most of them waiting for their second shot. Children and teenagers, who are still out of the vaccination ambit, could not accompany their parents to the malls. The game zones, which would always be full of chatter before the pandemic, were silent. Security staffers checked the final vaccination certificates on the patrons’ smartphones before granting them entry. “We were not allowed to enter the mall as we did not get our second dose. It is due in September,” said Suvarna Kharche, a 30-year-old visitor at Pavillion mall, Senapati Bapat Road. Akansha Agarwal (29), who got fully vaccinated last week and visited Amanora, said, “There was hardly any crowd, but many shops were closed too. But it was a good experience to sit and have a snack at the food court after a long time. Hopefully, all the brand stores will reopen in the next few days and the usual buzz will return.” Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, chief operating officer of Amanora Mall, Magarpatta, said, “We are happy to reopen, though the footfall was much less than we had expected. But more importantly, the staffers were very happy to return to work.” He added, “The Shopping Centre Association of India has written a letter to the PMC to reconsider the guidelines and allow entry of visitors in the 14-45 age group who have taken the first dose of vaccination. The rule of catering to only the fully vaccinated customers does not apply to other shops and markets, but malls have to turn away a large portion of our clientele due to this regulation.” Vikas Ladhe, centre head of SGS Mall in Camp, said, “We are retraining our staffers and collating their vaccination data to ensure that the mall is safe for all. Apart from the main mall entrance, the security staffers will check the vaccination status of the visitors at the roadside entrances of retailers with their phones. Visitors can also carry printouts of the fully vaccinated certificates. They will also have to produce their Aadhaar card for verification.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/malls-reopen-but-only-for-patrons-with-full-vax-cover-operators-expect-ease-in-riders/articleshow/85192576.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

BMC has proposed appointment of a new agency for three years. The total cost will come to around Rs 3.15 crore for the project. This will the first time BMC is appointing an agency for road safety audits. The Opposition criticised BMC over the cost of the plan. “The agency will submit detailed reports on traffic and pedestrian movement, and measures to be taken to enhance road safety. Flow of traffic and people will be analysed and detailed reports will be submitted on accident-prone spots in the city,” said a senior civic official. BMC officials said 39 ‘black spots’ or accident-prone spots were identified by BMC. Many accidents are due to poor road design. Officials said they would take the help of auditors to eliminate design flaws that cause accidents. Alterations in road design will also be recommended by the auditors. BMC officials said they had received responses from four firms. “They all quoted rates ranging from Rs21,000-29,000 per km. We picked three agencies for Rs20,000 per km. The road length is 454km in the city, 352km in eastern suburbs and 770km in western suburbs. So, BMC will spend around Rs 3.15 crore on the project,” said an official. The Opposition said BMC must not spend Rs20,000 per km. “Road safety auditors may give the best advice, but it will be practically impossible to follow the advice and implement the changes. BMC must not spend so much on auditors. This will again end up like the appointment of auditors for road work, where auditors were allegedly involved in a scam. BMC should conduct a pilot project for few roads and then appoint a citywide agency,” said Congress corporator Asif Zakaria. In 2015, BMC had decided to do away with third-party auditors for monitoring road work after 10 employees of two firms were found to be involved in the multi-crore road repair scam. In 2019, a Supreme Court committee issued guidelines for road safety. Public works department (PWD) of the state government will identify accident-prone zones or black spots on the national highways for the first time. If possible, red blinkers should also be introduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-plans-private-road-safety-auditors-in-rs-3cr-project/articleshow/85192620.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Delhi||Delhi generated 11 tonnes less biomedical waste in June||NEW DELHI: A new report of Central Pollution Control Board says that Covid-related biomedical waste generation in Delhi reduced from 18.79 tonnes per day (TPD) in May to 7.68 tonnes per day in June due to a reduction in Covid-19 cases. The generation of Covid waste in June was the highest in Kerala at 23.71 TPD while Delhi ranked seventh in the country. The city currently has two common biomedical waste treatment plant facilities (CBWTFs) that are involved in treatment and disposal of biomedical waste. “The generation of Covid waste rose till May 10 this year as there were more patients. However, with a dip in total Covid cases, the quantity of Covid waste also reduced,” said an official. The report said that as per the information submitted by State Pollution Control Boards and Pollution Control Committees and daily data received from COVID19BWM Tracking App, the average quantity of Covid-related biomedical waste generation during June this year was about 164 TPD in the country. While it was 203 TPD till May 10 this year. According to the CPCB report, Kerala produced maximum Covid-related biomedical waste in June, followed by Tamil Nadu at 26.04 TPD. Andaman and Nicobar at 0.003 TPD and Lakshadweep at 0.01 TPD produced the lowest amount of Covid waste in June. “Till June, 193 out of 198 CBWTFs started using the tracking app and around 13,000 generators of Covid-19 waste have registered on the app,” said the report. Delhi currently has two CBWTFs. One of them is in west Delhi’s Nilothi with an installed capacity of 28.8 tonnes per day and another in an industrial area near GT Karnal Road with an installed capacity of 34 TPD for treatment of waste. Of these, the plant at Nilothi is currently operational on lease extension. Delhi Pollution Control Committee had earlier invited expression of interest for setting additional two CBWTFs in the capital but the body later scrapped the tendering process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-generated-11-tonnes-less-biomedical-waste-in-june/articleshow/85192606.cms||---

T R Sunilkumar, former secretary of the bank and son of Thaivalappil Ramakrishnan of Thaliyakkonm near Irinjalakuda, was taken into custody at 4:40pm from Parappur Road area near Amala Hospital in Thrissur, said sources in the probe team. There are reports that he had surrendered before the police, but the probe team insisted that they had taken him into custody. The absconding Sunilkumar was the secretary of the bank for the last 21 years, and he was hiding at different places after the case was registered. He will be produced before the court on Tuesday, sources said. A manhunt is on in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka for remaining five accused, sources added. Three of the accused have filed anticipatory bail applications at the principal district and sessions court here. The accused M Biju Kareem, who was the manager and C K Jilse, a bank accountant, and Reji Anilkumar, an accountant at the supermarket being run by the bank, filed the bail application soon after the fraud was exposed last month. The bail application had come up for hearing on July 21 and the prosecution was asked to file their responses, which was filed on August 6. The petitions have now been reserved for orders on Tuesday. The probe team was facing criticisms from Congress and BJP for the delay in the arrest of the accused in the fraud. Congress and BJP leaders were alleging that the probe team was trying to protect the fraudsters because of their links with CPM. However, the probe team expressed confidence that the remaining five will also be nabbed soon. They denied reports that one of the accused had gone abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/key-accused-in-co-op-bank-fraud-case-nabbed/articleshow/85192659.cms||T Ramavarman

Many families were able to take their kids to gardens after months, as online classes meant they couldn’t head there in the mornings. “My sons love to go to the garden and play. Since it’s close to where we live, we would regularly go there in the evenings after they finish homework before the pandemic. Now that gardens are open in the evenings, they can have their outdoor playtime again,” Neelam Putani, a resident of Vithalrao Shivarkar Road, said. Vimannagar resident Sayantani Ghose said the turnout at Udaan Jaivividha Udyan came as a pleasant surprise. “While there were many people, they wore masks. People are following safety guidelines and social distancing this time,” Ghose said. Some gardens were abuzz with activity, while others —not maintained properly over the past few months — were void of visitors. For instance, Empress Botanical Garden had only have a few strays dogs which entered through broken fences. Rani Laxmibai Garden in Camp, in contrast, saw parents and children having fun on a Monday evening. “Every time we passed by this place, my daughter would ask when the garden would open — she likes to get on the rides. We want to make the most of her childhood, as we don’t really know if there will be a lockdown again. I took off from work a little early to bring her here,” said George Phillip, a local resident. Amandeep Sharma, from Kalyaninagar, had taken to jogging in the morning instead of his preferred evening run. “I like to listen to music and jog in the evening to clear my head after work. Seeing children playing, residents hanging out gives me hope of a return to normalcy,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gardens-buzz-with-activity-in-the-evening/articleshow/85192660.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

He, however, pointed out that these plans will hinge on the bidding process of the Centre’s Advanced Chemistry Cell Production-Linked Incentive (ACCPLI) scheme. This would be under which the Centre's plans to dole out incentives worth over Rs 18,000 crore for setting up gigafactories with a cumulative capacity of 50 GWh. The bidding process is expected to take place by the end of this financial year, he said, adding that post bidding it would take around two years to start manufacturing cells at the gigafactory. The company will also decide on the location of the factory based on the overall incentives offered by the Centre as well as various states that have rolled out EV policies. Overall, in the new energy business, the maker of conventional lead acid batteries will tap opportunities on the mobility as well as energy storage front. It plans to accelerate the pace of technology development by way of partnerships and acquisitions in areas such as data analytics and charging networks, among others, Samudrala said. “There are a lot of new battery applications that are coming up, be it grid-scale energy storage or home storage and it is not necessary that single lithium ion technology will be dominant in all spaces,” said Vikramadithya Gourineni, ED, ARBL. On the recent buzz about the company mulling shifting its base from Andhra Pradesh, Samudrala said: “We are committed to our existing investments based on how the market is evolving and will be taking decisions on investments based on size, scale and location. The management is not in a position to make any comment on the recent buzz.” ARBL posted a net profit of Rs 647 crore on revenues of Rs 7,150 crore for FY21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eye-on-ev-segment-amara-raja-plans-1bn-gigafactory/articleshow/85195603.cms||Swati Rathor

The stay was issued after considering a petition that alleged that the government took the decision without collecting any quantified data. In the appeal, the government argues that Christian Nadar community was included in an existing list for modifying the OBC category and that the Supreme Court had held that until a decision is taken by the President on existing lists, the lists are saved. Christian Nadars were already included in the Union government’s Central List of OBCs and the single bench failed to take note of this, state has contended. However, the single bench order had said that the SC judgment means that the lists of OBCs currently operational would continue to hold until the President publishes a comprehensive list. Such a directive was issued so that a vacuum is not created until the President specifies the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/christian-nadars-govt-files-appeal/articleshow/85192686.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘House panel reports hardly discussed’||Thiruvananthapuram: The reports prepared by the assembly committee are hardly being discussed by the assembly and in the last more than one decade, just two such reports have been discussed by the assembly which is unfortunate, speaker M B Rajesh ruled on Monday. Giving his ruling on the basis of a point of order raised by MLA M K Muneer, the speaker said that on the basis of the recommendations of an ad-hoc committee in 2009, a new rule (205B) was inserted in the rules of procedures for the functioning of the legislative assembly. This rule was inserted to provide provisions for discussion of the reports prepared by the assembly committees. However, this has not been utilized as the number of days on which the assembly has been convening has reduced and the government business being listed have to be completed in a time-bound manner, the speaker said. He said that a coordinated effort has to be taken so that in upcoming assembly sessions, this rule has to be utilized and reports are discussed in the assembly, he ruled. Raising the matter, Muneer said that the assembly should utilize one hour a week to discuss matters of public importance that are part of assembly committee reports, as per rule 205B. But this is not being done, he pointed out. Ruling front MLA U Prathibha had also raised the same matter as a point of order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/house-panel-reports-hardly-discussed/articleshow/85192750.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In their latest avatar they have floated investment apps through their former employees and duped people. Over 80 investment fraud cases have been registered in the past few months in Hyderabad alone. So far police have arrested two Indians last week who were working for Chinese racketeers based abroad. The latest modus operandi is to send bulk SMSes to people offering part-time work-fromhome opportunities with an MNC with an assured daily earning of between Rs 1,000 and Rs 3,000, Cyberabad ACP K Balakrishna Reddy said. “A click on the link in the SMS leads the victim to get in touch with the fraudsters, who instead of offering a job directly, will lure them to register on a website or an app through the Telegram app. Once registered on the app, the victim is initially asked to pay a small amount, which will double in a span of one or two days. Once the victim invests a bigger amount, the fraudsters stop payment,” Hyderabad ACP (Cyber Crime) KVM Prasad said. Of 50 complaints received about the investment fraud, police had managed to track down two bank account holders — A Srinivasa Rao (45), an accountant from Srinagar Colony, and his friend N Vijaya Krishna (37) from Nallakunta. The police said Srinivasa Rao told them that he had worked for two Chinese nationals whom he knew as Michel and Jollie. “Srinivasa Rao was an accountant at a Madhapur-based private company operated by two Chinese nationals. Rao claims that he was unaware of what his employers did. They shut the business in January 2021 and left,” police said. Rao claimed that a few months ago his former employers got in touch with him and made him register private companies along with the co-accused and open bank accounts in the names of the companies. “Rao and Vijaya Krishna provided internet banking details of their newly-opened accounts to the Chinese. Rao claimed that he was offered a Rs 15,000 monthly salary plus commission,” an investigator said. With regard to the only case solved in the city, the police had identified 10 bank accounts, of which two were operated by the two arrested Indians and the remaining accounts were in other states. The police wrote to the banks seeking details of the accounts and asking them to freeze the accounts. “We have observed that from an account Rs 36 lakh was transferred to other accounts in a single day.,” the police said. With the accused confessing that the Chinese were behind the investment fraud, police now believe that the fraudsters, who were involved in the loan app cases, were also behind the app-based investment schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chinese-app-crooks-back-in-biz-with-investment-scams/articleshow/85195609.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The directorate of health services administered the second dose to 4,170 persons on Monday, pushing the fully vaccinated count to 25.2% of the adult population. State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar told TOI that the vaccination numbers are “satisfactory” but could be better. “There are several who tested positive for Covid-19 in the second wave but who haven’t completed 84 days yet,” he said. Over ten lakh persons — 89.8% of Goa’s eligible population of 11.9 lakh — have taken at least one dose of the vaccine, while 64.7% are partially-vaccinated. “We want to vaccinate the entire population as soon as possible. We hope to complete administering the second dose by December,” he said. The health department is yet to receive any communication regarding vaccination for foreigners. “This is expected very soon, after which we will begin vaccinating them,” he said. The state is also yet to receive any communication from the Centre on vaccination of children. There is also no information about Goa’s health services receiving any other vaccine besides Covishield, which it has been administering since vaccination began this year, he said. ‘Goa on way to being 100% vaccinated’A single person getting vaccinated is not only protecting oneself but their family too, said state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar. “This is the best time to get vaccinated, when cases are low,” Betodkar said, speaking at a programme in Margao on Monday. “We are close to 100%,” he said, adding that Goa is on its way to becoming the first state to be fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/25-of-eligible-popn-fully-vaxxed-66-partially/articleshow/85194633.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Hospital authorities confirmed that at least three are undergoing treatment at present but denied there was an outbreak.  SevenHills is a ‘Dedicated Covid Hospital’ and continues to admit more than 50 patients daily. Sources said that as many as 5-6 cases were reported from a single apartment of nurses about three weeks ago. Dr Balkrishna Adsul, dean of SevenHills, said that none of them had serious ailments and all could be diagnosed and treated on time. “Some of them have recovered and resumed work,” he said.

---||India||File probe report weekly: SC to CBI in judge death case||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday directed the CBI to file weekly probe status reports before the Jharkhand high court on investigations into the murder of Dhanbad additional district judge Uttam Anand but retained overall supervision into the case even as the court also focused its efforts on ensuring safe and secure environ for judicial officers across the states. A bench of CJ N V Ramana and Justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant expressed dissatisfaction over the 'status report' filed by the CBI into the July 28 incident at Dhanbad, where Anand was killed while out on a morning walk. The CJI-led bench said, "What is this status report? There is nothing in it except mentioning about the CBI officers going from one place to another." Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, said the two drivers in the autorickshaw which was involved in the incident have been taken into custody by the CBI soon after it took over the probe from Jharkhand police on August 5. "We are hopeful of cracking the case. At present it will be premature to reveal the directions or details of the probes," he said. The bench said, "Taking into account the gravity of the matter, we deem it appropriate to direct the CBI to file a report before the Jharkhand HC every week and we further request the CJ to monitor the investigation." Referring to the larger issue of ensuring a safe and secure working environment for the judicial officers, who face threats from gangsters and the high and mighty involved in criminal cases, the CJI-led bench directed all states to positively file their response to the important issue before August 17, the next date of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/file-probe-report-weekly-sc-to-cbi-in-judge-death-case/articleshow/85197179.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Velip has been following the SRI technique of paddy transplantation for the past five years, and is able to enhance the yield of her crop. She has also been credited with training other women farmers from her village and other talukas in the techniques, following which the technology was replicated by them. Besides lauding her work in the farm, Modi also complimented her for her Hindi-speaking skills despite belonging to Goa. He asked her how she knows to speak such good Hindi. “You must be watching a lot of Hindi films,” he said to her. She said she speaks Hindi, and has also taught Hindi to her daughter. He also enquired about her children. Every year, under the PM-Kisan scheme, a financial benefit of Rs 6,000 a year is provided to eligible beneficiary farmer families annually, payable in three equal 4-monthly installments of Rs 2,000 each. The funds on Monday were released as part of the ninth installment of the PM-Kisan yojana to farmers across India, wherein Velip was one of the beneficiaries. The fund is transferred directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. “Every time these funds are released, the PM interacts with the farmers. Velip was among the farmers from other states like Manipur, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, etc,” said Gauri Prabhudesai, the Sanguem zonal agriculture officer who helped identify Velip. The directorate of agriculture, through its ZAOs, had identified some of the most promising farmers in Goa that had success stories in the past year. Velip’s name was one the few names that were selected at random for the interaction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/netravali-woman-farmer-uses-tech-to-boost-farm-output-gets-pms-attention/articleshow/85194676.cms||Nida Sayed

A complaint was filed by the boy’s father, who runs a laundry service near Sadar Bazar, with police late on Sunday. According to the complaint filed by the boy’s father, the accused had introduced himself as Vijay. The incident occurred when the boy came out of Ramesh Chhaya School campus after attending a workshop there. The man lured the teenager with a promise to buy him a cricket ball and took him behind the medical college campus in civil hospital. Once in a secluded place, the man tied the boy's hands and allegedly sodomized him. He also threatened to kill the boy if he told about what happened to anybody. The traumatized boy returned home and told his parents about his ordeal. The parents approached the police and lodged a complaint against the unidentified person. Police said that they have checked CCTV footage from the spot where the incident occurred. They have found footage of the man talking to the boy.

The decision was, however, opposed by Aam Aadmi Party councillors, who alleged that the civic body has granted the NOCs without physical verification of the schools’ infrastructure and education facilities, thereby risking lives of children and staff. Earlier in February also, these councillors had raised objections after which the proposals related to 23 schools were put on hold. Councillor from Mukundpur Ajay Sharma stated that he had highlighted the condition of two schools in a meeting held in February after his visit to these places. “Their fire extinguisher was not operational and expired at one place and a huge basement was constructed below the school located in a congested lane with narrow entrances. There has been no change in the condition, but still the civic body granted it recognition certificate,” he said. Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain, meanwhile, said that he had asked the AAP councillors to give their objections in writing and specify the schools where they found the loopholes. “But I have not received anything so far. As far as the survey is concerned our zonal teams and then teams from the headquarter visit the sites,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-physical-check-but-pvt-schools-given-noc-says-aap/articleshow/85192800.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Pune||Administration to ramp up testing in Pune rural areas’ Covid hotspots||PUNE: The testing would be ramped up immediately in Covid-19 hotspots in the district’s rural areas, where the case positivity rate was 5.5% in the week ending on August 4. “Increased testing, surveillance and all Covid protocols would be ensured in these areas,” said Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh, adding that a block-wise analysis was conducted in the rural areas. According to the district health officials, nearly eight of the 13 talukas in the Pune rural areas have weekly positivity rate (WPR) of above 5%. State surveillance expert Dr Pradip Awate said the testing and surveillance activities should be intensified in these areas. Nearly 10,000 tests are conducted daily in the Pune’s rural areas. The district health officials are planning to scale it up further. “More mobile testing laboratories to collect swab samples have been deployed and shifts have been increased in laboratories. We are ensuring that all the hotspots are thoroughly covered,” said a district health official. The district health officer said, “The surveillance would be stepped up in these areas.” The Pune rural areas got some relaxations almost a month ago after the deputy chief minister, Ajit Pawar, announced level 3 restrictions. Ajit Pawar said if the positivity increased to 7%, the relief would be withdrawn. A district official said, “The deputy chief minister also said most people in the rural areas do not wear masks and violate norms. The police will be strict against the rule violators now.” State health minister Rajesh Tope recently said the relaxations in a district would hinge on weekly positivity and case doubling rates. These two norms and intensified vaccination was the way ahead with the state allowing relaxations in various sectors, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/admin-to-ramp-up-testing-in-rural-areas-covid-hotspots/articleshow/85192795.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Kochi||Pet dog licensing: Corp issues tenders for 4,000 microchips||Thiruvananthapuram: With the high court mandating pet licensing within six months, the city corporation has called for tenders to purchase microchip embedded radio frequency identification (RFID) tags for pet dog licensing in the city. Tenders have been called for the purchase of 4,000 microchip-RFID tags. Over 10,000 pet dogs were licensed in the city over the past three years. The HC had ordered in July that all owners of animals such as cattle and pets should obtain ownership license from the local body within six months. The order was issued following a suo motu public interest litigation registered by the HC after a dog named ‘Bruno’ was hit to death at Adimalathura. The court had directed the government and local bodies to take steps to register the ownership of animals with the local bodies concerned. In 2017, pet dog licensing and breeder registration were made mandatory in the city. As per the scheme, all the pet dogs were to be brought under the licensing system by which dog owners would have to take a license for rearing dogs by paying a fee of Rs 100. This license was to be renewed annually. Similarly, those who breed dogs on a commercial scale would have to apply for breeder registration. The fee was fixed at Rs 500. The breeder license fee would also have to be renewed annually, as per the plan. The corporation also introduced microchipping for stray dogs and pet dogs in the city as part of giving a unique ID to dogs. The dogs which undergo sterilization will be administered with anti-rabies vaccine and microchips will be inserted under their skin above the neck. The microchip carries a 15-digit identification number which will be added to the database of dogs in the city. The database will be maintained using a software developed by the Information Kerala Mission. While maintenance of database was conceived as part of the project, the software is still under development stage. The project was launched at a cost of Rs 3 crore. The city corporation had recruited five doctors and additional dog catchers for the successful conduct of the programme. The license was issued for the dogs after two doses of vaccination; primary and booster dozes. The 15-digit identification number in the microchip was meant to trace details of the dog and its owner. For registration, the dog breeder should enter his/ her details along with the details of the dog in the 12-point registration form. The project ran into trouble with vigilance inquiry being initiated on distribution of microchips. The corporation had earlier placed orders for 10,000 tags, which has now been reduced to 4,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pet-dog-licensing-corp-issues-tenders-for-4000-microchips/articleshow/85190477.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Goa||Goa: Congress appoints former Union minister P Chidambaram as poll observer||PANAJI: Congress on Monday appointed former Union finance minister P Chidambaram as senior election observer for Goa. The Rajya Sabha MP will also oversee the party’s election strategy for Goa, and steer deliberations over any probable alliance. AICC general secretary K C Venugopal informed state party president Girish Chodankar about Chidambaram’s appointment, and many Congress workers said that the high-profile appointment indicates the seriousness that its national president Sonia Gandhi, as well as former president Rahul Gandhi, have attached to Goa for the 2022 elections. Chidambaram has been appointed to “oversee election strategies and coordination for the upcoming assembly election in the state,” said Venugopal in the order. Elections to the 40-member Goa legislative assembly are due in February next year, but parties are not ruling out early elections in the state. The appointment of senior Congress leader P Chidambaram as senior election observer for Goa is a big boost for Congress in Goa to emerge victorious in the coming assembly elections. His experience and guidance will help motivate Congress functionaries to achieve victory in 2022,” said leader of opposition Digambar Kamat. Kamat said that Chidambaram’s appointment indicates the importance that the Congress high command has attached to Goa. In the 2017 Goa polls, Congress emerged as the single largest party, but failed to form the government due to poor coordination between the elected MLAs, AICC general secretary, Goa in-charge Digvijaya Singh, and the Congress central leadership. BJP seized the initiative and forged an alliance with Goa Forward Party, MGP and independent MLAs to form the government. “Chidambaram is a very senior Congress leader who has been appointed to oversee the coming assembly elections. He will come here, study the matter and he will give his feedback,” said Navelim MLA and former chief minister Luizinho Faleiro. Interestingly, Chidambaram’s appointment comes even as doubts continue over the role of Goa desk-in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao. According to Congress functionaries, Rao was asked to cancel his official appointments in Goa and head back to Bengaluru, and since then, there has been speculation that Rao will be replaced. There’s a buzz that former Kerala opposition leader Ramesh Chennitala could replace Rao. The doubts over the desk in-charge, along with the uncertainty about Chodankar’s continuity, have created a vacuum of sorts in Goa. “There is a lot of demand to remove the party head, and they may have decided that in the name of ‘election observer’ to send Chidambaram,” said a senior Congress functionary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-appoints-chidambaram-as-state-poll-observer/articleshow/85194730.cms||---

The women, as per their addresses, are from Sindhudurg district. No arrest has been made yet. The case was registered a month after Azad Maidan police, in a separate case, booked a Russian for allegedly submitting fake marriage documents to obtain an OCI card. In the fresh case, a special branch policeman lodged the complaint on August 4 for cheating, forgery and punishment for criminal breach of trust. Those named in the FIR as accused are UK national David Lincoln and his Indian wife, Daniel Akler, a Canadian and his Indian wife. “The women’s addresses are from Sindhudurg. Our team is collecting details about them,” said a police officer from Azad Maidan police. The offence took place between May 31, 2018 and August when the case was registered. The foreigners had submitted certificates showing they married Indian women while applying for OCI cards. They were issued the OCI cards in 2019. During scrutiny, police came across the documents submitted by Lincoln and Akler and found an age gap among the women and their husbands. When the marriage certificates were checked with the department concerned, police found that the original documents were not available with the department. Subsequently, an FIR was registered. A police team may go to Sindhudurg to probe the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-foreigners-booked-in-fake-docus-for-oci-cards-case/articleshow/85194814.cms||---

Chief minister Pramod Sawant and BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade, who will tour each constituency starting with the CM’s own domain of Sakhali, are expected to face a volley of questions from voters over the controversial Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill, 2021, and mismanagement of the Covid-19 situation in the state. “We cannot avoid such questions and will give the people exact answers,” Tanavade said. Both he and Sawant have already met with mandal presidents and general secretaries to review the organisation of work in each constituency. It has been decided that the two senior functionaries will start by visiting at least 24 constituencies. They are expected to spend a whole day in each and meet with grassroots organisations and people. After Sakhali, the duo will tour Quepem, Aldona, Cuncolim, Tivim, Curchorem, Dabolim, Pernem, Mormugao, Santa Cruz, Vasco and Cumbharjua. Thereafter, Sawant will visit Saligao, Sanvordem, Sanguem, Mandrem, Mayem, Bicholim, Siolim, Fatorda and Shiroda. Tanavade said the first phase of tours will be concluded before Ganesh Chaturthi next month and the second phase will resume soon after the festival. “We expect to cover all constituencies by October 31,” he said even as he declared that BJP had decided to contest the polls without forging any sort of alliance. When asked to comment on the appointment of senior Congress functionary P Chidambaram as senior AICC election observer for Goa to oversee poll strategies and coordinate for the fast-approaching elections, Tanavade said BJP never discusses appointments made by other parties. “We discuss only our strategies,” he said. The BJP state president also said that if Congress demands, the chief minister would order an inquiry into an audio recording, purportedly of a Congress spokesperson, criticising GPCC president Girish Chodankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-kicks-off-poll-campaign-to-visit-all-constituencies/articleshow/85194766.cms||---

Private hospitals — 20 in total — hold a capacity of nearly 256 metric tonnes. Officials said the increased capacity should be able to meet demand if a Covid surge, similar to the one in April, happens again. At the time, the district had a daily oxygen requirement of 363 metric tonnes during the peak. It’s currently at 125 metric tonnes. Besides storage capacity, the 19 government units now also have their own oxygen plants, which can produce 13,619 litres per minute (LPM). Health experts have said that self-sufficiency, with plants attached to hospitals, is the only way to ensure the state has enough oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-hospitals-in-district-can-store-over-300-mt-of-o2/articleshow/85192871.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Importance to BSP, independent MLAs in Ashok Gehlot-govt will cost Congress in 2023 polls, cautions ex-MP||JAIPUR: Former Congress MP Karan Singh Yadav has cautioned that the Congress may have to bear the brunt of Ashok Gehlot-government running on the support of Independents and BSP-turned-Congress MLAs. Yadav, 76, claims to have given this feedback to state’s AICC general secretary in-charge Ajay Maken. The Congress presently has 106 MLAs in the 200-member state assembly. Of these, six are BSP-turned-Congress MLAs. Chief minister Gehlot has been taking support from 13 independent MLAs, too, to keep his government well above the majority number, especially in the light of a past revolt by his former deputy Sachin Pilot and 18 Congress MLAs against his leadership. On the sidelines of a party function at the PCC headquarters on Monday, two-term ex-MP Yadav said chief minister Gehlot is constrained to take support of Independents and former BSP MLAs, but this has been weakening the Congress in areas represented by these 19 legislators. Yadav said that Congress candidates who lost the 2018 state election in these areas were not being heard by the Gehlot-government and, in such a situation, the ruling party will have to bear the brunt in the assembly elections to be held two-and-half years later. Yadav, who is also a two-term ex-MLA, lost the 2018 state election from Kishangarh Bas assembly constituency in Alwar district to BSP candidate Deepchand, who later joined Congress. Yadav claimed that Congress candidates who lost directly to BJP candidates were getting the same weightage as a sitting MLA, but those who lost to BSP candidates or Independents were not getting any attention. “Durru Miyan, R C Yadav and I went to Delhi and separately raised the party and our issues (before Maken). The way Independents and BSP-turned-Congress MLAs are getting importance in the government, we have become irrelevant. Our works are not being done even in municipal areas,” Yadav told reporters. He added, “CM Gehlot has his constraints, but Congress workers in these areas are being neglected. We went to Delhi to demand that some works of sitting BSP/Independent MLAs and some of ours be done. We have faith in CM Gehlot, but the party is definitely suffering.” In another development, Congress MLA Ved Prakash Solanki — a Sachin Pilot loyalist — claimed that Pilot was the most popular Congress leader after the Gandhis in the entire country. Solanki was addressing a press conference in Bharatpur on Monday. Hitting out at BJP leader A P Abdullakutty for his remark that Pilot may join the BJP in the future, Solanki said, “BJP has a Pilot phobia. Like his father, Pilot is a believer in Congress. BJP leaders are trying to defame him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/importance-to-bsp-ind-mlas-in-gehlot-govt-will-cost-cong-in-2023-polls-ex-mp/articleshow/85192858.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Fewer than 3% of adults till 45 years fully vaccinated in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The city’s young workforce will be at a disadvantage when local trains resume operations for the fully vaccinated from August 15 as fewer than 3% have got both their doses. Although vaccination for the 18-44 year olds was allowed nationally from May 1, a series of policy flip-flops meant vaccine availability was a problem. CM Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday the city had 19 lakh fully vaccinated people (see box) while announcing the decision on local trains. People from the 18-44 age group that is going to be the most mobile account for only 2.6% of the fully vaccinated. Immunisation for this group was mired in controversy from the start. The Centre, while opening vaccination for them from May 1, had put the onus of buying vaccines on the states. States, which were getting supplies from the Centre until then, went into a scramble to procure doses from manufacturers. Maharashtra could only manage a few lakh doses that lasted less than two weeks. Vaccination for the 18-44s briefly ran between May 1 and 12 before the state decided to prioritise the second dose for the 45-plus. The drive was suspended for the younger group till June 21, and only those who could afford paid shots got the doses at private centres. Epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said the decision to allow fully vaccinated people was right, but exceptions must be made for those who have taken the first dose and agree to wear a mask while travelling. “After all, it’s not their fault that they couldn’t get vaccinated or the time gap between two doses is 84 days,” he said. Also, the decision could have been taken with a notice of three to four weeks so that they had a chance to get vaccinated. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid task force, said the decision of allowing fully vaccinated people was a global yardstick. “We don’t know what percentage of people from which age group uses the local trains. But vaccination by definition means two doses. Hence, complete vaccination as a yardstick is a scientific decision. It should reasonably help to keep transmission in check in a local where there is crowding and congregation,” he said. Lahariya argued that in countries such as France and Italy, where full vaccination is necessary to enter stadiums, restaurants, there is no vaccine unavailability. “Here, if a person wants to get vaccinated tomorrow, he cannot,” he said. Officials said full vaccination in this age bracket will see a jump in 45 days. “Many got vaccinated in the private sector. They will be eligible for a second dose by the end of August and early September,” said one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fewer-than-3-of-adults-till-45-years-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/85192897.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The accused were earlier booked for charges relating to sedition and terror activities. The court will now hear arguments on the draft charges from both the prosecution and defence and then decide what charges, if any, are to be framed against them. "The draft charges are as good as opening the prosecution's case. Now we have to hear them on which sections are attracted or not..." the court stated. The NIA has alleged that the December 31, 2017, Elgar Parishad at Shaniwarwada, Pune, was funded by the banned CPI (Maoist) as part of a conspiracy to create unrest. The agency alleged that provocative speeches by Kabir Kala Manch activists led to the January 1, 2018, caste clashes at Koregaon Bhima. During Monday's hearing, the defence sought a copy of the discharge plea submitted by special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty. The prosecution said that the charges were based on the evidence in chargesheet already submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/elgar-case-nia-submits-draft-charges-against-15/articleshow/85197204.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Colleges too were shut, but he had to deposit fees for two kids. Now, the government announced an interest-free loan of Rs 50,000 for self-employed people like him affected by Covid, Babulal won’t be eligible for the loan because he does not fulfil the age criteria of 18-40. The Indira Gandhi Urban Credit Card scheme notified on last Saturday does excite many self-employed youth even as the government has set a target of 5 l lakh beneficiaries. A fruit vendor said he does not want to waste 2-3 days for a scheme that is not going to help him. “First, it is likely they will reject me because my earnings are between Rs 15000-20,000. Second, I have to start repaying from 4th month onwards. Additionally, I have to spend 2-3 days for the formalities that would be required. I don’t think it will be helpful for me. Rather, I will lose my daily income for a few days,” said Jagat Prajapat, a fruit vendor.Many said they were wary of the compliance that also includes repaying EMIs every month. “If I don’t repay on time, they may harass me. Only people will take the loans who are not afraid of defaults,” added Prajapat.Kamlesh Sharma, a vada pav seller, said that the monthly income cap of Rs 15,000 will render many ineligible. “I am ready to take the loan. But would be hard for me to prove that my income is less than 15000 a month. Who can live with Rs 15,000, especially if he has a kid or two? This cap should be increased,” said Sharma.Other said that if the repayment moratorium is increased to one year, they can think of taking the loan. “We are not sure if the Covid pandemic is over or not. If the third wave comes and again there are lockdowns, we cannot repay the installments,” said another roadside food vendor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/not-many-self-employed-warm-up-to-rs-50k-interest-free-loan/articleshow/85192895.cms||---

The child panel had asked the district child welfare committee to give suggestions to formulate the final draft, which will be issued this week. “Previously, it had been decided that schools would reopen as Covid cases had dipped, but that decision was changed though we started work on making the SOP in order to ensure that the children are safe when they go back to school. For the same, we had asked for suggestions and now we will start to compile them so that they can be adhered to”, said an official of the child panel. When the schools had reopened in January before the second wave hit Rajasthan, the state’s child commission officials had visited private and the government schools to inspect them in a bid to ensure that all Covid protocols are being followed and students are not at any risk. A report of the same was submitted to the commission’s chairperson. There is a possibility that the same would be done when the schools reopen yet again. According to the guidelines issued by the child panel in January, permission of parents is mandatory for allowing any student to attend school. If any parent is not interested in sending his ward, no pressure should be exerted on them by the school. Last time when the schools were reopened following the pandemic, the authorities had found that majority of the schools followed the SOP with only minor glitches coming to light. Officials claimed that once the schools reopen, they would be monitored though thee government is yet to take any decision on the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-panel-to-draft-sop-in-anticipation-of-schools-reopening/articleshow/85199761.cms||---

Those detained included former MLA Wamanrao Chatap and Vidarbha Rajya Andolan Samiti (VRAS) coordinator Ram Nevle and others. Displaying posters and banners demanding statehood for Vidarbha, the activists had launched an indefinite agitation at Vidarbha Chandika temple on Monday, coinciding with August Kranti Din (aka Quit India Movement Day) observed on August 9. Besides the statehood, the activists were also demanding reduction in power bills due to Covid-19 pandemic and protesting rising inflation, domestic gas and fuel price hikes. On Tuesday morning, a van from Tehsil police arrived at the spot and first picked Chatap. After Nevle, VRAS Mahila Aghadi president Ranjana Mamarde, Yuva Aghadi chief Mukesh Masurkar and other activists also reached the spot, they too were arrested and dragged into the van. According to the activists, the police launched a crackdown after arresting the top leaders and destroyed their banners and posters.

They reportedly asked him for his identity card, and snatched his accreditation card and mobile phone. The pictures were deleted and as more lawyers gathered around shouting at the photographer, police intervened and took Kumar to the station. Kerala Union of working Journalists (KUWJ) district president Suresh Vellimangalam who arrived at the scene following the incident was also reportedly confronted by the lawyers. Vellimangalam told the media that the incident could ruin the efforts being undertaken to tone down the long-standing issue between the media persons and the advocates. Kumar said that he took pictures from outside the court premises. A similar altercation had erupted on the court premises a few years ago and since then media persons have been facing an indirect ban from reporting on the court premises. Tension also mounted in front of Vanchiyoor police station as lawyers gathered around journalists passing threats and abuses. A protest gathering was organized by the journalists and photographers in front of the Secretariat later in the evening.

The incident happened at around 4.15 pm in the Lux Emperia complex, a building located opposite Anand Nagar Sevasadan and near to Red Cross Blood Bank in a densely populated area. The fire in the godown of Mayur Sales, which is into wholesale and retail business of firecrackers, spread not only on the upper floor where the crackers were stored but also engulfed the entire building and even spread to an adjacent building. Both the buildings are of three floors each. Although there were no reports of any injury or casualty, around seven two-wheelers and one four-wheeler that were parked adjacent to the building got damaged while shops in the same complex and an electronics showroom in the adjacent complex also got damaged. Fire fighters from Khambhat, Nadiad, Petlad and Vadodara apart from those from Anand rushed to the spot to douse the fire. A fireman received minor injuries on his head as pieces of glass fell upon him while he was trying to douse the fire. The smoke billowing out from the burning building could be seen from far away while loud noise of bursting of firecrackers reverberated through the area. “The noise was so loud that I faced temporary hearing loss,” an onlooker told TOI. Cops too had a hard time dispersing the crowd of onlookers and residents. “Luckily, there was nobody trapped inside the building. Our first move was to clear the traffic from the area to make way for the fire tenders. Since, the building facade was of glass, splinters were also coming down. We closed down the entire market area to ensure everyone’s safety,” said Ajit Rajian, Anand district superintendent of police. “Our teams asked everybody in the vicinity to keep buckets with water and fire equipment ready.” said Rajian. Although prima facie, an electric short circuit is said to be the reason behind the fire, prant officer J C Dalal said that a thorough investigation will be carried out. Sources said the wholesaler had permission to store the firecrackers but questions are being raised as to whether a surplus quantity of crackers was being stored in the godown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/huge-fire-at-cracker-godown-in-anand/articleshow/85188370.cms||---

But relatives of the beneficiary will have to ensure there's a family doctor present for the 30-minute post-jab monitoring,” said Suryakant Devkar, the PMC's immunisation chief. The civic body has been vaccinating residents of old-age homes and care facilities for over two months now.

It seems that the decision is driven by a political motive to change everything that is related to Gandhiji.”Gehlot said future generations will not forgive those who try to destroy the country's rich heritage, culture and traditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-seeks-modi-help-to-stop-demolishing-of-sabarmati-ashram/articleshow/85192879.cms||---

On Monday, Chiranjeevi wrote a letter to senior actor U V Krishnam Raju, who is the chairman of the MAA disciplinary committee, to take the initiative to hold elections without any delay. Pointing out that the term of the present body, which expired in March 2020, was extended till now as elections could not be held due to Covid crisis, Chiranjeevi said: “In recent times we have seen elections to the Bar council and for many other bodies.

The Saamna editorial stated that the Centre could have honoured Dhyan Chand even without insulting the sacrifice of former prime minister, the late Rajiv Gandhi, and termed it as a hatred politics. On August 6, Prime Minister Narendra Modi renamed the award as Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award, considered to be the country’s highest sporting honour. The newspaper stated, Indira Gandhi was killed by terrorists, Rajiv also lost his life in a terror attack. “There can be differences in political ideology. In democracy, there could be differences, however their sacrifice cannot be matter of ridiculing them who have contributed to take the country ahead,” stated Saamna. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-renaming-khel-ratna-award-not-peoples-but-political-game/articleshow/85194879.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune: Coverage rises in villages, 92% of senior citizens given first shot||PUNE: The rural areas of the district are currently leading in Covid vaccine coverage among the elderly. According to the district health office (DHO), more than 4.38 lakh senior citizens (60-plus group) have been given the first jab. With a target elderly population of 4.7 lakh, that means nearly 92% first-dose coverage. Second-jab coverage has also been impressive in the villages, with 2.45 lakh people now fully vaccinated. The vaccine drive for senior citizens started from March 1, across the district.  Additional district health officer, Abhay Tidke, said, “Earlier, there were many who were reluctant to get the shot. We tried awareness programmes, but hesitancy remained. Turnout improved after the second wave of Covid. Many finally realised the vaccines can save lives.” He said several special drives were conducted through March and April to reach senior citizens. “We also arranged free transport to take beneficiaries from their villages to nearby sites,” he said. Officials, however, said they are still concerned about the erratic supply of doses to the region. “We can cover the rest of 40,000 senior citizens if the supply of doses remains consistent,” Tidke said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/coverage-rises-in-villages-92-of-senior-citizens-given-1st-shot/articleshow/85192930.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Vadodara||BJP worker held for cheating in-law with false visa, job promises||VADODARA: A BJP worker was arrested on Monday for cheating his brother-in-law of Rs 5.6 lakh by promising him Canada’s visa to pursue his career and later a job in ONGC. The accused Chintan alias Chetan Patel was booked for cheating and forgery based on his brother-in-law Vivek Vasava’s complaint at Panigate police station. Vasava told police that Patel took Rs 5 lakh from his father in 2019 to initiate the process of getting a visa. Patel started the process despite the family’s refusal. But when there was no development, Vasava asked Patel to either give him the visa or return the money. After a verbal altercation a couple of times, Patel gave photocopies of the visa documents and told Vasava that he would give original papers soon. As Vasava did not have a passport, he questioned the authenticity of the visa, but Patel promised him that his passport would also come. For two years Patel only made false promises and in September last year, he gave Vasava a fake job offer letter from ONGC. In April, when other visa applicants started coming to his house asking for a refund of their money, the family realized that they too were cheated. When Patel’s wife Falguni asked him to return her brother’s money, he asked for Rs 1 lakh more which Vasava’s father gave. However, a few days later Patel returned only Rs 40,000. On pressurizing Patel to return the remaining amount too, he had an altercation with Falguni and asked her to return to her parents’ home. When Falguni returned, Vasava approached police and lodged a complaint. Police said that five other people have also given notice to Patel to return their money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bjp-worker-held-for-cheating-in-law-with-false-visa-job-promises/articleshow/85188384.cms||---

This means that 14% of the district’s adult population of 36 lakh has completed the two-dose course of the vaccine. It took almost seven months to achieve the feat after the mass immunisation campaign which was rolled out on January 16. Total 29,191 people, including 13,105 (45%) women, were jabbed on Monday at 83 government and 30 private booths across the district. Of these, 20,519 (70.5%) people took the first shot while 29.5% got the second. Recipients in the 18-44 years age bracket received 66.3% (19,316) of the shots while those aged between 45-59 years got 23.6% (6,897) jabs and elderlies 8.8% (2,568). Besides, 348 healthcare and frontline workers turned up to take their first or second dose. So far, the health department has administered a total 21.5 lakh doses in Lucknow. Of these, 10.4 lakh doses were used to inoculate over five lakh people with two shots, while 11.1 lakh have received one shot so far. Over the past week, nearly 5,400 beneficiaries of second dose were inoculated daily. Health department officials said the number was likely to increase further in coming days as more people who have taken the first dose would qualify for the second shot after completing the 6-12-week gap. Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said, “We are planning to run mega vaccination drives twice a week. For this purpose, the demand for extra vaccine shots has been sent to the state government. As soon as we get the supply, days for the mega drive will be fixed. Only one Covid case reported in LucknowOnly one Covid-19 case was recorded in the city for the second consecutive day. Such low numbers are being reported after a gap of 15 months. Four patients recovered in the last 24 hours while No death was reported.

---||Delhi||‘Excise policy undermines ban on liquor consumption in public’||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday sought response from the AAP government on BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma’s plea challenging the scheme of home delivery of liquor under the new Excise Policy of 2021. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice on the petition and listed it for further hearing on September 20. In the meantime, the high court also adjourned till August 27 other petitions challenging the new excise policy and granted time to Delhi government to bring on record its counter affidavit. Several petitions are pending before the court against the New Excise Policy. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Delhi government, informed the court that “Rs 10,000 crore has been earned by Delhi” amid the ongoing pandemic, due to the new excise policy and the revenue is higher than most states in India. In his petition, which challenges Rule 66(6) of the Delhi Excise (Amendment) Rules of 2021, Verma has submitted that the new policy was introduced at a time when the national capital was “still grappling with the deadly second wave (of Covid-19) and acute shortage of medicines and vaccinations”, and also overlooked the impact of bringing alcohol into households on domestic and child abuse. “The 2021 Amendment undermines the ban on consumption of liquor in public places by making it possible to deliver alcohol to public places... The rules enable the possibility of delivery of alcohol to hospitals and schools. It lacks any consideration to the safety of those delivering the liquor,” the petition said. It is also contended that home delivery of liquor was against Article 47 of the Constitution, which makes it the duty of the state to improve public health and make an endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption of intoxicating drinks. Last month, the court had refused to issue notice in the petition and directed the filing of fresh memo of parties after noticing that AAP had also been made a party to the challenge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/excise-policy-undermines-ban-on-liquor-consumption-in-public/articleshow/85192958.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state government on Sunday extended the state-level curfew till August 16, to control the spread of Covid-19 in Goa. However, there are no additional relaxations in the curfew order. There are six offshore casinos and dozens of onshore casinos operating in the state. It has been three months that the casinos have been shut in the state. The state government, in its last curfew order, had allowed bars and restaurants to continue operations till 11pm at 50% capacity. The state has continued to make mandatory a negative Covid RT-PCR report for those entering the state from Kerala. What remains closed in the revised curfew are casinos, auditoriums, river cruises, spa and massage parlors, cinema halls and multiplexes, educational and coaching institutions for students (except for examinations of students and holding competitive examinations with approval of the government).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-intention-to-restart-casinos-amid-covid-cm/articleshow/85194845.cms||---
---||Jaipur||JK Lon may get centre of excellence tag under Centrally sponsored scheme||JAIPUR: Covid has driven JK Lon Hospital, the biggest child-specialty government establishment, to strengthen its healthcare facilities and apply for getting the tag of Regional Centre of Excellence under a new scheme ‘India Covid-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package: Phase-II’ launched by the Centre. The scheme aims to accelerate the health system preparedness for immediate responsiveness for early prevention, detection and management, with focus on health infrastructure development including for paediatric care and with measurable outcomes.“We have strengthened our healthcare facilities while preparing for the third wave of Covid. We have started producing oxygen from one of our oxygen generation plants set up recently, while other such plants are in the pipeline and will soon become operational. All the 800 beds in the hospital will be connected with centralised oxygen pipeline. Besides, our bed capacity in ICUs will increase from 75 to 175 soon as 100 ICU beds will become functional within a month. Also, we are getting adequate number of ventilators and monitors soon,” said Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent, JK Lon Hospital. With improved healthcare facilities, JK Lon Hospital will apply to get the tag of Regional Centre of Excellence from the Centre. The Centre’s guidelines on the scheme advocated for creating paediatric units in all 736 districts and also to establish paediatric centre of excellence in each state/UT (either in medical colleges, state government hospitals or Central hospitals such as AIIMS etc) for providing Tele-ICU services, mentoring and technical hand-holding to the district paediatric units.When required, the hospital will be turned into dedicated Covid hospital for paediatric population if the third wave emerges. For the purpose, out of 800 beds, the child-speciality facility will dedicate its 600 beds for Covid paediatric patients. If situation demands turning the hospital into a dedicated Covid hospital, non-Covid patients will be shifted to government-run Gangauri Hospital and Satellite Hospital at Sethi Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jk-lon-may-get-centre-of-excellence-tag-under-centrally-sponsored-scheme/articleshow/85192928.cms||---
---||Chennai||Man who could string a song with ease||In the land of Dakshin, there was considerable confusion from the 1950s to the 1970s over the names of two Murthys — both were music directors whose music was steeped in classical music, both were almost of the same age, and both had worked for Tamil films. One was V Dakshinamurthy and the other S Dakshinamurthy. The Tamil film industry found its way out of the confusion by calling V Dakshinamurthy Malayalam Dakshinamurthy, as he worked in a number of Malayalam films, while S Dakshinamurthy was called ‘Telungu’ or Telugu Dakshinamurthy, as he worked more for Telugu films.The imprint of ‘Telugu’ Dakshinamurthy (1921-2012), who composed music for more than 135 films including 120 Telugu, on Tamil cinema with work in 12 films is indelible and gives the film industry much reason to celebrate the versatile musician and composer in his centenary year. Born in Pedakallepalli in Andhra Pradesh, to Krishna Brahma Shastry, a musician and teacher, and Annapurnamma, he was named Dakshinamurthy after his illustrious grandfather who was a disciple of saint-composer Thyagaraja. Taking to the musical lineage of his family from a young age, Susarla was tutored in music by his father. He also learned to play the violin. While Dakshinamurthy’s father was a strict disciplinarian, Dakshinamurthy nurtured a liking for popular culture as well.Once he skipped music classes and went to watch a movie. When he came home, his father beat him up. As is the case with many celebrities of the film world who left their houses at a young age due to differences at home, Dakshinamurthy picked up his violin and left the house. He went to Tenali where the Navaratri festival was on. There renowned violinist Veerasamy Naidu, father-in-law of actress Kanchanamala, spotted him standing with a violin in hand. Naidu asked Dakshinamurthy if he could play, and the young boy impressed the master. Dakshinamurthy went on to play the violin for the Navaratri festival. When the idol Devi was carried out on an elephant on the last day, young Dakshinamurthy too was given a prestigious seat on the elephant during the procession.Beemavarapu Narasimha Rao (BNR), one of the first music directors of Telugu films, who was also a singer and actor, heard of the exploits of a boy in Tenali and invited the 16-year-old to visit Chennai to play the violin in films. Soon, Dakshinamurthy began working as an assistant for BNR on the film ‘Bhakta Meera’.But his career in films saw a detour as he went into radio. He worked for HMV as a violinist for some of their albums. He later worked at All India Radio in Chennai from 1941-43, followed by a stint with AIR, Delhi. He gave up the radio job and decided to settle down in Chennai. It was after he joined music director C R Subbaraman’s orchestra that he never looked back. He got an opportunity to work for a Telugu film ‘Naradha Naradhi’ and in his second stint in films continued till his death. Dakshinamurthy assisted Subbaraman in the Telugu film ‘Laila Majnu’ which became a big hit, starring Nageswara Rao and Bhanumathi. Dakshinamurthy also sang for A Nageswara Rao in the film and in a few others like ‘Sri Lakshmamma Katha’.Dakshinamurthy then began making music for Modern Theatres production ‘Sarvaadhikari’ (1951) starring MGR, Anjali Devi, and sang a playback song for MGR. Always looking to innovate, he created an echo effect for the song "Kannaalan Varuvaar", a feat that technology enabled decades later.Dakshinamuthy became a regular for Modern Theatres in both Tamil and Telugu. Modern Theatres made the first colour film in Tamil, ‘Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum’ (1956), remade from Hindi, for which the musician-composer used all the Hindi tunes of the original, unafraid of appreciating another composer’s work. He even made Ghantasala sing for ‘Thangavelu’ (Ullaasa Ulagam). ‘Anbu Magan’ in 1961 was noted for a good P B Sreenivos song, "Kodukka Therindha Maname", and "Annam Pol Unnai". ‘Pangaaligal’ was his last film as music director in Tamil. Trichy Loganathan sang a memorable song in this film "Chinna Arumbu Malarum". P Susheela also sang a version of this song. His ease of working with different people was apparent as he also worked as a re-recordist and conductor for works such as ‘Jungle Moon Men’ (1955), and several others by Columbia Pictures in Hollywood. In Telugu, he was noted for his compositions in ‘Ilavelpu’, ‘Annapoorna’ and ‘Santhanam’ among others, and then there was a 13-year gap after which he gave the music for ‘Srimadvirat Parvam’. There was another gap of five years before he composed music for the NTR starrer ‘Shrimad Virat Veerabrahmendra Swami Charitra’ (1984), his last film, for which he also wrote the lyrics. Dakshinamurthy brought to the south, ace singer Lata Mangeshkar for the Telugu film ‘Santhanam’ in 1955. Her rendition of the Telugu song "Nidduraporaa Thammudaa..." as a lullaby is considered to be an all-time hit. Dakshinamurthy was particular about roping in Mangeshkar, but since she was busy and had only a few hours, she had to directly record the song without practice. Dakshinamurthy ensured the song was recorded in just a few hours, before the singer went back to Mumbai.In keeping with his urge to explore creatively, Dakshinamurthy ventured into film production with ‘Mohini Rukmangada’ (1960) and ‘Rama Sundari’ (1962). He developed diabetic retinopathy and lost vision in one eye in 1972 and in the other in 1987. He spent his last days in Chennai. The end came on February 9, 2012, at home, and not in a hospital as he wished.(The writer is president,Chennai 2000 Plus Trust)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-who-could-string-a-song-with-ease/articleshow/85192955.cms||---

The two accused Malay Patel, a resident of Viramgam, and Bharat Desai, who lives in Memnagar, have been out on bail since February and March this year, respectively. During the hearing last week, the accused moved an adjournment application stating that their lawyer N S Raval was busy with some death rituals. Two doctors, who are important witnesses of the case, were to be examined during the hearing. On getting the adjournment application, the court of additional district judge A J Kanani told the accused that the two doctors had come all the way from Vadodara city and the reason furnished for adjournment was not genuine. The court asked them to call their lawyer or any proxy advocate to cross-examine the two witnesses. However, when the lawyer did not appear even after waiting, the court closed the right of cross-examination. The court did not restrict its action to closing the right to cross-examination, but also referred to a 2001 notification of Gujarat high court regarding adjournment. The court noted that during the previous hearing in July it was fixed that the two doctors and a police officer will be examined in the next hearing and the summons were also issued, which the accused’s advocate was aware of. “Today, the witnesses are present in the court, but no sincerity, to cross-examination of the said witnesses has been shown by the accused or their advocate and when the provisions of section 309 CrPC (power to postpone or adjourn proceedings) were explained to the accused, the second accused (Desai) has shown his arrogance in the courtroom,” the court stated in its order. It also mentioned that sufficient time was granted to call the advocate, but nobody turned up. “The doctor witness was standing in the witness box for the cross-examination and such kind of conduct and situation are very painful and not at all justifiable,” the court said. Referring to the provisions of section 309 of CrPC and high court’s notification, the court cancelled the duo’s bail and ordered to take them into custody.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘SOPs for trains fine on paper but difficult to implement’||Mumbai:"Linking with Co-Win is important to weed out fake vaccination certificates. Also, since the certificate doesn't have a photo, this pass will require one to be uploaded,” said a senior official, speaking about the government’s proposed system to regulate train travel for those who have taken both vaccine shots. The QR code on the pass is to be verified using a mobile scanner by a ticket checker.The BMC’s plan is to supplement the government’s effort by setting up verification desks at ward offices and outside stations to check on vaccination certificates. “We had a meeting with state government officials. If the portal is not ready, we will set up verification desks outside railway stations. Citizens can come with their vaccination certificates and we will check if they are authentic on CoWin and stamp them. Once this is done, they can buy their railway tickets,” said a civic official. The state's decision to allow fully vaccinated persons to access public transport, especially local trains which are the city's lifeline, has been praised by a section of experts. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, epidemiologist and health systems expert, said allowing them to board suburban trains is a step in the right direction. “What’s the purpose of vaccination otherwise? If people are not allowed to go back to normal lives with the related precaution of masking, then why are we vaccinating even,” he said.According to him, the state must also make exemptions for those who have taken one shot. “If they have taken the first shot, it means they are most likely to go for the second one too,” he added.The opposition, especially the BJP, has however found flaws in the plan. It said the government was making the entry system for train travel a cumbersome process. Minister of state for railways Raosaheb Danve said the state should have consulted railways beforehand. Party spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said instead of using the established central Arogya Setu app, the state has chosen to create its own app, which will place hurdles before the working class.Some railway officials said the SOPs look fine on paper but are difficult to implement. Member of Zonal Rail Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) Shailesh Goyal said, “I was the first to come up with the suggestion but the state government and railways are not prepared with the technology or a field plan to stop non-vaccinated passengers from entering the station.”Viren Shah from the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said it is a welcome move and will only encourage more people to get vaccinated. "50% of people employed in retail sector in Mumbai have been fully vaccinated. And as far as hurdles to get a pass is concerned, we will help our employees," said Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sops-for-trains-fine-on-paper-but-difficult-to-implement/articleshow/85192986.cms||Bhavika Jain

The CBI further said the investigation is still under way and it is also seeking the support of Interpol and using channels of mutual legal assistance treaty to collect evidence from abroad. The Bapatla MP said: “The CBI has questioned me. I have told them I have respect for the judiciary.” He refused to comment further. Former central information commissioner Madabushi Sridhar said: “They would not have made such comments against the judiciary. Unless further probed, we cannot tell if it is a negligent remark or a conspiracy. Even if it is an abusive general remark, it would have to be avoided. There are several institutional remedies to challenge judgments.” He further said, “Abuse of social media will be detrimental to freedom of expression.” The arrests gained significance in the wake of the Supreme Court’s recent comments on the attacks on judges. The CBI had registered a case on November 11, 2020, against 16 accused and taken over the investigation of 12 FIRs from Andhra Pradesh CID. The AP high court issued orders in the case in 2020. The original FIRs were registered following a complaint lodged by the registrar general of high court. The case was registered under IPC sections of criminal intimidation, provoking enmity between groups and insult and public mischief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cbi-investigating-larger-conspiracy-against-judiciary/articleshow/85194900.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Chandigarh||HSSC paper leak: Answer key was arranged for Rs 1 crore, say police||Chandigarh: Investigations into the HSSC constable paper leak revealed that the answer key was arranged for Rs one crore and Rs 20 lakh had been paid to the person in advance. The rest was to be paid after collection from candidates. To reassure the gang about payment, the candidates and their relatives had given signed blank cheques to kingpins Ramesh, an academy owner from Kaithal and Narinder Singh, the person who arranged the key. This came to light during interrogation of six persons arrested by Kaithal police on Saturday. While continuing with investigations, Kaithal police arrested seven more persons on Sunday and Monday. They had dealt with candidates and passed on the keys. “In fact, it was Narinder who got the answer key on Friday. It is alleged that he had dealt with some people at the higher end for Rs one crore out of which he claimed to have paid Rs 20 lakh. This amount is subject to verification. Then Ramesh, the academy owner, started circulation of the answer key,’’ said Lokender Singh, SP Kaithal, who is personally monitoring the investigations. “Since they claimed to have less time for distribution of answer keys, some were provided keys through WhatsApp and some some were given hard copies. All this happened ahead of examinations,” the Kaithal SP added. Referring to the mode of payment, police said most of the candidates who had dealt with scamsters had given signed blank cheques and some had given assurances after getting sureties from middlemen about payment. They were supposed to make payment after the answer keys were found to be correct. In a related development, Ramesh, Sandeep and Narender have been remanded in nine-day police custody. Most of those arrested on Saturday were remanded in judicial custody. On Saturday, Kaithal, Hisar and Fatehabad police arrested 14 persons who were allegedly found to have been involved in leaking answer keys of written examinations conducted by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) for recruitment of constables in Haryana Police. Around 7.72 lakh candidates had applied for 5,500 vacancies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hssc-paper-leak-answer-key-was-arranged-for-rs-1-crore-say-police/articleshow/85192995.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Business||Skoda sees strong India sales in July||Pune: Czech automaker Skoda has said that its July sales in India increased by triple digits on strong bookings and interest in its new SUV range Kushaq. The firm looks to facelift its existing models in the country and introduce a new sedan by the end of 2021. Over the same month in 2020, Skoda’s India sales rose by 234%, standing at 3,080 cars sold. Sequentially, the jump was even higher, by a margin of 320%, with June seeing 734 units sold. Skoda’s new SUV offering Kushaq, priced at a mid-to-premium range, will be manufactured at Volkswagen-Skoda’s Chakan plant. The company has said that up to 95% of the production of the vehicle has been localized, which has helped the firm avoid supply and import difficulties over the past year due to the pandemic. “Kushaq was launched with the vision of substantially growing our volumes in India, and it is very encouraging to see our plan taking shape. Despite a challenging environment, we have managed to have a really successful launch, which is in line with our strategic focus and volume expectations,” said Zac Hollis, Skoda India’s brand director. Skoda said that it was pushing forward with facelift to other models in the Indian market, such as the Superb and the Rapid, and also designing and possibly launching a new sedan for the Indian market by the end of this year. The company will also launch a design contest for the car in August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/skoda-sees-strong-india-sales-in-july/articleshow/85193015.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Pune||Pune: Vaccine exchange plan lets private hospitals lend excess stock, get fresh doses in return||PUNE: The district authorities have now suggested a voluntary Covid vaccine “exchange programme” which lets private hospitals give their excess stock of doses to officials and get fresh vials in return. Officials said if private hospitals agree to participate in the programme, it can can kick off immediately. They said the hospitals can expect to start receiving fresh doses from September 1. The units will also be given a certificate that acknowledges receipt of stock. TimesViewThis is a win-win situation for the district administration and private hospitals. It's also a solution that can be replicated in other cities, where private hospitals have vaccine doses in stock but very few takers. This will ensure zero wastage of a precious resource that's currently in short supply. All stakeholders involved in this exchange should ensure it works out. The state government, too, should quickly lay down guidelines and approve the plan as soon as possible.Many private hospitals, due to a dip in turnout for paid jabs, currently have substantial reserves of Covid vaccines (mainly Covishield). Officials said the exchange programme would tap this unused stock and divert it immediately to civic centres before they expire. The private units will be given fresh stock in return. It’s a free initiative; the private hospitals will not be charged any money, officials said. Pune zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad, who is supporting the programme, said the plan will help regions that need immediate supply of vaccines boost coverage. Pvt hosps can exchange excess stock for fresh dosesPrasad said, “We are making a genuine request to private Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) to provide their excess doses to the district administration so that our special and routine vaccination drives can be expedited. There is no money involved and it’s all about helping each other. Such a transaction has been done before. A few months ago, Pune borrowed vaccines from Solapur district officials. This time, it will be from private CVCs.” Prasad estimated that private CVCs currently have more than 4.61 lakh doses in their reserves. It’s a quantity that could prove invaluable for the district, which now has thousands of people fast approaching the due date for a second jab. Sachin Edake, district immunisation officer with the zilla parishad, said the details of the exchange programme are being worked out and guidelines will soon be sought from the state government. “We'll start contacting the private CVCs once we get a go-ahead from the state government," he said. Healthcare experts, however, said the district administration will have to convince private units that the initiative will not lead to loss of money or doses. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said since the programme essentially involves borrowing of doses, private units may need some guarantees in return. He said, "If the district has not been getting a consistent supply of doses, where's the guarantee that there will be good supply in the future? If the situation continues, the purchases by private hospitals will be at risk."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vax-exchange-plan-lets-pvt-hosps-lend-excess-stock-get-fresh-doses-in-return/articleshow/85193028.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Pune pvt hosps can lend vaccines to dist admin||Pune: Private hospitals can lend their Covid vaccines to the administration, and in return the health department will give them doses from the fresh stock as per their needs from September 1. The district immunisation officer will provide a certificate stating that they have taken vaccines from the private hospitals. The hospitals can send their vaccines to the administration’s warehouse in Koregaon Park here or can contact the district immunization officer, to pick up directly from the hospitals. The officials urged the private hospitals to lend them the stock. The officials said private hospitals can prevent wastage of vaccines which are nearing expiry. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), Pune ZP, told TOI, “We are making a genuine request to private Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) to provide excess doses to the district administration so that our special and routine vaccination drives can be expedited. There is no money involved and will be purely based on borrowing and helping each other. We had borrowed vaccines from Solapur district few months back. This time, it will be from private CVCs.” Prasad said private CVCs have more than 4.61 lakh doses with them, which could boost the vaccination drive in the district. Sachin Edake, district immunisation officer, Pune ZP, told TOI, “We will work on the initiative and have asked the state government about possible guidelines. We will contact private CVCs once we get confirmation from the state government.” Experts from the medical community said the district administration will have to convince private hospitals that they will not lose out on money or doses. Sanjay Patil, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s hospital board of India, said the initiative involves borrowing and may not yield a favourable response until the hospitals are given an assurance that they will get their doses or at least money back. “If the district is not getting consistent doses now, what will be the guarantee that they will have a constant supply in future? In such a case, the hospitals’ doses will be at stake,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-pune-pvt-hosps-can-lend-vaccines-to-dist-admin/articleshow/85195047.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Locals also claimed that two persons, including a child, had died because of diarrhoea. Preliminary investigation revealed that the patients had either been affected by food poisoning or due to consumption of dirty water. Among the 10 children, seven are below 12 years of age while three were 12 years old. All the 10 children and the 35-year-old woman are responding well to treatment, said hospital authorities. “It seems to be an event of infection either due to food poisoning or dirty water intake. The children came with acute diarrhoea and gastroenteritis. They all are recovering well,” said hospital director Dr Subhash Sundriyal. News of children falling ill and being hospitalized sparked panic in the area. A team of medical officers under chief medical officer (CMO) Lucknow visited the area and hospital. On the CMO’s directions, three ambulances were deputed in the area for any emergency till the situation is brought under control. The medical officer in charge of the area and hospital’s chief medical superintendent were advised to be on alert for the next 48 hours and a medical team stationed in the area. The official press statement from the CMO office said, “Residents have informed that two patients lost their lives because of dirty water supply in the area. They have further informed that regular complaints were made to the water department to get the dirty water tested, start chlorination of water being supplied to the houses and to repair the broken pipelines.” However, when TOI contacted the water department, it said no complaint of dirty water was received from the area. “We received no such complaints regarding dirty water supply in Balu Adda area, however, I will inquire from the executive engineer of the area and resolve the problem, if any,” said secretary of Lucknow water department Ram Kailash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gi-infection-outbreak-10-kids-hospitalised/articleshow/85194919.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: After one tech fiasco, plan to screen passengers’ vax status raises doubts||MUMBAI: The state’s proposal to use technology to screen railway commuters on the basis of their vaccination status has generated a fair amount of scepticism as similar attempts in the past have been non-starters. In order to regulate travel on local trains, railways had asked the government to implement a colour code system, as on the Kolkata Metro. This proposal was considered when there were discussions held on allowing the general public to board trains as Covid-19 cases began to ebb after the first wave. The system used in the Kolkata Metro generates colour-coded e-passes that can be easily identified by officials. For example, those who book a 8-9am time slot may be issued yellow passes; during that time, those with a pass of a different colour pass are not allowed to board trains. However, no call was taken to implement this system in Mumbai. The state had also announced a QR code system so that only those in the ‘essential service’ categories like hospital staff, civic employees could travel. This was meant to be rolled out by July 30, 2020 and those registered for a QR code were to be allowed to buy train tickets. However, the system could not take off. Only a few thousands were issued the QR code. To avoid chaos, it was decided that all essential category passengers with valid ID cards would be eligible for travel during peak hours. A senior Central Railway official said, “Many people had begun preparing fake ID cards to book train tickets. And in the absence of a fool-proof system, it was difficult to identity the fake from the genuine. A large number of unauthorised passengers also began traveling with valid tickets.” CR touched a peak of almost 22 lakh commuters per day in February 2021, while WR registered around 18 lakh before the second wave forced the state government to introduce more curbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-one-tech-fiasco-plan-to-screen-passengers-vax-status-raises-doubts/articleshow/85193066.cms||Manthank Mehta

"The government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is implementing reservation policy rigorously for all categories including OBC, SC, ST and EWS. This is the reflection of the government's allegiance to provide due reservation for backward and EWS category students creating a new paradigm of social justice in our country," Pradhan said in reply to the discussion before Rajya Sabha passed the Central Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2021. The House also cleared the bill to bury retrospective taxation by returning the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021 after a brief discussion. The amendment bill was passed by Lok Sabha last week. The bill, moved by the education minister, is to set up a central university in UT of Ladakh. Pradhan said the government is committed to ensure all-round development of Leh, Ladakh and Kargil by establishing a quality institution for the academic welfare of the students in the region. Opposition parties, including Congress, DMK and TMC had walked out of the House to protest against listing of the bill in the supplementary business circulated just hours before the House took it up. Proceedings in the House were adjourned due to protests by the opposition over the Pegasus snooping row, farm laws and other issues.

The commission has so far served summonses to 1,153 witnesses and examined 718 of them, Tamil Nadu government told Madras high court on Monday. It has so far marked 1,126 exhibits. Tamil Nadu advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram filed a report explaining the commission proceedings, the actions taken by the state government based on its recommendations. “The commission could not proceed with the probe in view of Covid-19 lockdown from April to July 2020, September to October 2020 and May to June 2021. Since July 2021 the commission has been examining police personnel,” the report said. On June 25, the high court took strong exception to the National Human Rights Commission’s stand seeking closure of the probe initiated by the court suo motu. The first bench headed by Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee had directed the NHRC and the state government to submit the report of the probe conducted by the commissions. “It may not augur well for a civilised society governed by the constitutional principles that we have to merely throw money at the families of the victims and give closure to an incident of impossible brutality and excessive police action,” the court had observed. The directions were passed on a PIL moved by rights activist Henri Tiphagne seeking direction to the NHRC to reopen the probe and to furnish a report of the investigation. When the plea came up for further hearing on Monday, additional solicitor general R Sankaranarayanan filed the report of the NHRC in a sealed cover to the court. “We have sought copies of the documents filed by the petitioner. Once we receive them, we would take a stand on filing a counter affidavit,” he said. Recording the submissions, the court adjourned the hearing to September 13 for the NHRC to file a counter, if necessary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tuticorin-firing-panel-yet-to-hear-over-400-witnesses/articleshow/85193076.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Minister refutes charges of scam in Jal Jeevan Mission||Lucknow: UP Jal Shakti Minister Mahendra Singh refuted all charges of a scam in Jal Jeevan Mission as alleged by Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh and countered all the allegations. The minister said the allegation that a company blacklisted in eight states had been given contract to supply pipes for the mega water supply project was false since the UP government had not floated any tender for pipes in the past four years. “Our projects are being implemented on engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode. The company which gets the tender for project, makes purchases and the government does not interfere, but we do keep a check on quality,” he said. “None of the eight states where AAP claimed the company is blacklisted, have actually blacklisted it,” the minister said. The Himachal Pradesh government termed its work satisfactory while the Jammu and Kashmir government asked for some pipes to be changed, but did not blacklist it. The minister said, “AAP alleged a scam in work of Rs 1.20 lakh crore, while the work in Bundelkhand region is for Rs 15,000 crore only and the DPR is being prepared for the rest of the parts of state. They are alleging a scam of Rs 30,000 crore, but the government had till now spent only Rs 3,000 crore.” “The MP said our work is being done at 40% higher rate than Jal Nigam’s rates. The fact is, two schemes were started during SP regime and Jal Nigam had to implement them. Their per house connection rate was Rs 1.25 lakh, while our rate is Rs 50,000. Our government has already ordered an inquiry into the two SP schemes,” he said. “Similarly, AAP mentioned the letters of BJP MLAs in allegations saying the MLAs too had asked for investigation. However, the two MLAs had sought inquiry into matters during the SP regime and were not about the Jal Jivan Mission,” the minister added. AAP MP Sanjay Singh, who had alleged a scam of Rs 30,000 crore in Jal Jeevan Mission, responded to the minister’s claims and accused him of showing fake papers to mislead people. “I challenge the minister to debate with me on the documents I have. He tried to defend the pipe company by showing fake papers. I will raise the matter in Parliament on Tuesday. If this matter is not investigated by the CBI or high court-monitored SIT, I will file complaint with the Lokayukta and go to court,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/minister-refutes-charges-of-scam-in-jal-jeevan-mission/articleshow/85195010.cms||---
---||Chennai||Pondy univ’s waste water treatment tech out in the market||A low-cost eco-friendly self-propagating waste water treatment technology developed by researchers of Pondicherry University will soon hit the commercial market. A brainchild of former professor S A Abbasi in 2018, the technology christened ‘Shefrol’ (sheet-flow root-level reactor) was patented by the university. The university has granted non-exclusive rights to a Mumbai-based firm, Vision Earth Care, to commercialise the wastewater treatment technology for five years.The cost to set up a unit to treat wastewater of a few houses is a little more than `30,000 said Abbasi. "The unique feature of the technology is that it is six times less expensive than the next cheapest conventional technology, yet it is effective and efficient. It runs on solar energy and requires very little material inputs and maintenance," he said. The system has a reactor, which includes channels in which short-statured terrestrial, amphibious or aquatic weeds are packed to the capacity. "Wastewater is made to flow through the channels at a depth adequate to cover the plant roots that remove numerous pollutants in a single step. One of the biggest advantages is that the technology helps to remove pollutants in a single step in contrast to conventional technologies that need several units besides pumps, mixers, aerators or settlers. This reduces the cost," said Abbasi.The researchers have identified a suit of 20 weeds that are easily and freely available throughout the country. The technology can use one or more weeds to treat wastewater. "Another advantage is the weeds after stacking, grow and reproduce as they treat waste water. This makes the system self-propagating as no fertilization is involved. Hence the system has negligible maintenance cost or depreciation," he said.Abbasi said the Centre’s department of science and technology, department of biotechnology and the centre for development of advanced computing had independently conducted background checks and certified the technology ‘novel and patentable’. Several pilot plants were set up within the university campus and at the villages in Puducherry. "At present, plants based on this technology are being commissioned in Fareedpur and in Hariyawan near Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, under MGNREGA under the corporate social responsibility initiative of DCM Shriram," said Abbasi.Vice-chancellor Gurmeet Singh said, "The commercialisation of Shefrol technology will the pave way for similar public use of several other pollution control systems that have been developed and patented by researchers in the university."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pondy-univs-waste-water-treatment-tech-out-in-the-market/articleshow/85193047.cms||Bosco Dominique
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Spats with TTEs rise as unauthorised commuters throng local trains daily||MUMBAI: With Covid-related restrictions being relaxed, there has been a rise in altercations between Train Ticket Examiners (TTEs) and commuters travelling by local trains even though they are not authorised to board them under the lockdown rules. Only essential workers, including government staff, bank employees and those from the healthcare industry, are allowed to take trains now. “The number of commuters has jumped from 5 lakh to 15 lakh per day over the last month. Most of these are unauthorised travellers who risk getting caught but board anyway as they have families to feed. When they are caught, it leads to arguments and sometimes the spats can get ugly,” said a senior RPF official. An official from the commercial department of CR said: “Most of those unable to pay the fine are daily wage earners. It is a catch-22 situation for TTEs as they have been asked to be strict to curb unauthorised travel as it can lead to a spike in coronavirus cases.” Before the lockdown, altercation with TTEs was rare, with one incident perhaps in three-four months. The circumstances are fuelling the rage: daily wage workers need to go to job sites, private firms are open and so are restaurants, for instance, but none of their workers can take the train — the lifeline of Mumbai. Commuters complained road transport is time- consuming and costly. “I used to take my two-wheeler to office but my back pain was aggravated. I decided to take the train as a taxi is costly and the bus takes a lot of time to reach my workplace in Ghatkopar,” said Kalyan resident Ramesh Thakur. “Almost 90% of the IDs shown to us as proof are fake. In many cases, doctors have issued ID cards to their neighbours or relatives to show they are their employees. When they are caught, they feel embarrassed and begin to argue or drop names,” said a TTE with WR. Sometimes the spats turn really ugly. “In one such incident, the unauthorised woman travelling, when caught, accused the TTE of being a fake employee and began taking his pictures. She threatened to make them go viral,” said a railway official. Once an unauthorised passenger complained to her mother, who reached CSMT station to threaten the TTE. “Our union has received a large number of complaints from TTEs. We are going to approach the administration to seek a solution to this menace,” said the general secretary of National Railway Mazdoor Union (CR).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-spats-with-ttes-rise-as-unauthorised-commuters-throng-local-trains-daily/articleshow/85193082.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC raps govt over PASA again||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday once again raised questions on invocation of Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA) in cases of unauthorised procurement and distribution of remdesivir injections during the second wave of Covid-19. The court sought the government’s reply over uniformity in dealing with citizens over unauthorised procurement and distribution of remdesivir. The court was apparently upset over the Ahmedabad and Vadodara police commissionerates slapping PASA on people accused of selling fake remdesivir. This happened even after the high court made the Vadodara police commissioner decide not to invoke PASA against a doctor for illegal sale of remdesivir. The court repeatedly hinted at the distribution of 5,000 remdesivir injections in Surat while questioning the stringent measures against those found illegally dealing in remdesivir. Justice Paresh Upadhyay raised doubts over FIRs and invocation of PASA and termed it as tactics to divert people’s attention when they were angry at not getting medicine. The judge sought the state government’s reply on whether it wants to follow uniform action with regard to illegalities in procurement and distribution of remdesivir. While staying pre-detention order against one Nitesh Jani, who was arrested and lodged in jail for four months for sale of fake remdesivir injections, the court stressing on the need for a uniform policy said: “This may also lead to a question whether the state government is willing to resort to such stringent measures uniformly for all the accused/citizen in all cases, without being influenced by the position of the concerned person, where complaints have come for alleged illegalities in the procurement and distribution of remdesivir injections in unauthorised manner.” For the petitioner, the court questioned whether it was investigating from where the vials had come from. “If he says that 200 injections had come from Surat, will you reach there?” the judge questioned. The judge was critical of government’s stringent action against migrant labourers who were put behind bars for the rioting when they were stopped from going back to their native during the lockdown. “They had no money in their pocket, no food for their children and they just wanted to go back to their native and they were not allowed…They were jailed as offenders. I treated them as victims and not as offenders,” Justice Upadhyay said and added that it was the issue of remdesivir during the second wave of Covid-19. The judge wanted the government to look into people’s compulsion in procuring remdesivir. The court has sought government’s response on uniformity of invoking PASA for remdesivir distribution by September 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-raps-govt-over-pasa-again/articleshow/85193105.cms||---

Ayush, who comes from a middle class family, aims to become an aeronautical engineer and wants to serve at country’s premier institutes like Indian space research organization (ISRO) and Bhabha atomic research center. Aakash Patel, principal of Vidhyadhish Secondary & Higher Secondary School, from where Ayush studied till HSC said, “We are proud that our student has secured first rank. Ayush was confident of achieving the top ranks since the time he enrolled in our school in class 11. His success is surely a motivation for others. He has set an example for other students.” A student has to take three papers in JEE-Mains namely physics, chemistry and mathematics. Ayush was placed in 99.41 percentile in all the three papers. His father Dilip, who has studied only till class 10, owns a plastic yarn manufacturing factory in old Bhavnagar city area. “Ayush is a hardworking boy and he has been very good at studies since childhood. His dream is to get admission in IIT and we are supporting him in pursuing the dream,” Dilip said. Ayush, who enjoys playing cricket and watching television during his free time, said that it was difficult for him to do the preparation during the lockdown period. “This was the third phase in which I have achieved a good score. Now I am preparing for JEE advance and hoping to get admission in IIT.

"Our present daily ridership is around 21 lakh and we expect this to go beyond 25 lakh," said an official. The undertaking has drawn up plans to deploy more buses on feeder routes outside railway stations from August 15. The first day being a public holiday, it does not expect a rush, but it will deploy maximum numbers starting Monday outside stations on Central, Harbour and Western lines. BEST will curtail some routes along the north-south axis (parallel to railway lines) as commuters make a switch to local trains. "The point-to-point journeys from station to your office or place of work for last mile connectivity will be in demand. As of now, office-goers and workers will be among our daily commuters. Once colleges and schools restart, we will add more riders," an official from BEST’s traffic wing said. BEST had a ridership of around 35 lakh daily prior to the pandemic. "I am prepared to go by the suburban train to office as I am fully vaccinated, but the bus also plays an important role in my journey," said Dinesh Salian, a Kalyan resident whose office is at Nariman Point. He recalled how he would wait in queues outside CSMT to catch a bus for Nariman Point. BEST has been asked not to carry standees. So, unless it improves its frequency and deploys more buses on busy routes, it will not be able to cater to the rush. BEST plans to have inspectors outside bigger railway stations like CSMT, Churchgate, Kurla, etc to assess the crowd and use wireless systems to request the nearest depot or Wadala control room to send more buses to clear the rush.—Somit.Sen||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ridership-on-feeder-routes-may-see-spurt-by-4-5-lakh/articleshow/85193114.cms||Somit Sen

A departmental inquiry has been ordered against him for his comments that he made on an official WhatsApp group of the department over transfers of some officials. In one of his statements he went on to question certain decisions of the government which was construed as indiscipline. Additional chief secretary, home guards, Anil Kumar, confirming the suspension, said that some statements made by the DIG in the official WhatsApp group were found to be misleading and some even untrue. The home guard department works directly under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Kumar said that Shukla had raised questions over the recent transfer of officials in the department. “We have done all transfers as per laws. Those transferred were also asked to forward their choices before being transferred. All transfers were approved by the CM,” Kumar said and added that the officer had made comments that corruption has spread in the department and the transfers were done against the policy. “Contrary to media reports that 84-85 officers were supporting the DIG, no officer was in his support. The DIG also claimed himself to be general secretary of the home guards’ association, but when we spoke to other members of the association they had no objection to transfers. Besides, claims of the DIG were also found to be untrue,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dig-suspended-for-misleading-remarks-in-official-wa-group/articleshow/85195054.cms||---

The police have begun scanning CCTV footage to get some clues about the accused duo that fled on a motorbike. The incidents have again raised questions about the police patrolling in different areas of the city.

---||Hyderabad||Gastropod fossils at Telangana's Kawal tiger reserve to throw light on evolution, climate change||HYDERABAD: Gastropod fossils discovered in Ginnedhari Range of Kawal tiger reserve indicate that there was once a gigantic freshwater lake in the region millions of years ago and will throw light on evolution of species and climate change, experts said. “The fossils will also tell us about evolution, climate change and tell us about what was the composition of carbon dioxide, oxygen and other gases during that period and how it all changed,” Pranay Thodishetty, forest range officer, who first discovered the fossils said. Forest department officials and researchers who discovered the ancient site, which is now a cliff locally known as Goyena, said that the gastropod fossils in this region are from the Cretaceous Period and belonged to snails that lived 65 to 67 million years ago. Their existence was confirmed by well-known paleontologist and retired deputy director general of Geological Survey of India (GSI) Chakilam Venugopal Rao after examining the fossils collected from the cliff. “The fossil site was discovered during a field survey in July second week. The finding tells us that a lake which existed around 65 to 67 million years ago in this region was over-laid by lava, and thus these snails along with many other life forms got embedded in the mud, and in course of time got silicified, transforming them into fossils,” said Thodishetty. The gastropod fossils of snails were identified as Physa Tirpolensis, a special species of snails, which coil anti-clockwise. Researchers from Public Research Institute for History, Archaeology and Heritage (PRIHAH), a Hyderabad-based independent research organisation, said that similar gastropod fossils were discovered by Geological Survey of India official K Ayyasamy in Terpole village of Sangareddy district three decades ago. Hence, the gastropod belonging to Genus Physa got its name as Physa Tirpolensis. “On closely studying the fossils discovered in Kawal, it was found that the gastropods found here coil anti-clockwise, and the opening is on the left, which makes Physa a rare find. The species of snails which we commonly find in the present times coil in a clockwise direction with the opening on the right side,” explained MA Srinivasan, general secretary of PRIHAH. The team also discovered wood fossils in the region. Researchers said that there is also a possibility of finding micro-fossils of algae and other plants and animal life in the region. “It is because this region is filled with such ancient treasures, we are asking the government to establish a fossil park in the region. By doing that, all the different fossils can be preserved and displayed for further research. If we lose this fossil wealth, research may not be conducted in the future. Especially because this cliff is located deep inside the forest and not easily accessible,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gastropod-fossils-at-tiger-reserve-to-throw-light-on-evolution-climate-change/articleshow/85193110.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘71% of cases since mid-May of Delta variant’||AHMEDABAD: Analysis of 198 samples of Covid positive patients sent to Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) from mid-May to mid-July reveals that 142 or 71% of the cases had Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. The rest of the cases included 13% Kappa (B.1.617.1) and 7.5% Alpha (B.1.1.7) variants. The rest 8.5% included different variants including AY.3, B.1.1.354, B.1.617.3, B.1.214.2, B.1.36, B.1.1.409, B.1.1.306, B.1.36.8, B.1.1, and B.1 among others. The data was recently updated by the experts. Delta has been ruling the roost since the start of the second wave like several other Indian states, said experts. The number of Kappa cases came from Ahmedabad, Surat, Bharuch, and Sabarkantha. Likewise, Alpha variant cases were seen in Ahmedabad, Surat, and Bharuch, reveal the analysis. Ahmedabad and Surat – recording the maximum Covid-19 cases – showed the maximum variations. “There is no change in treatment protocol when it comes to different variants. The study however is important to understand the changing symptoms of the infection, virulence, mortality and infectivity. The variants also tell us about the possible route through which the virus may have entered the specific region,” said an Ahmedabad-based microbiologist. “There is a lot of interest in the variants also due to the fact that the third wave may be heralded by a possible new mutation.” Delta variant, first identified in India, was considered to be the force behind India’s massive second wave of the pandemic and high mortality. After the second wave, Gujarat — and India at large — have increased genomic sequencing of the confirmed cases manifold to get early signs of mutation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/71-of-cases-since-mid-may-of-delta-variant/articleshow/85193107.cms||Parth Shastri

The accused told his friend to call police and inform them about the murder after cooking up a story. The main accused, Anuj Kumar (22), started living with the victim after his girlfriend went to her hometown during the lockdown. When she returned, he wanted to get rid of his new girlfriend, so he hatched a plan with his friends to kill her. He stood guard while two of his friends strangled her. DCP (South) Atul Thakur said the three accused, Kumar, Ramzan Khan (32) and Naushad (21) have been arrested. “Anuj came in contact with the victim around two years ago. She eloped with him from her house in Uttam Nagar with the help of Ramzan. They started living together and also got married in a temple.” Kumar was also in a relationship with another girl, who was pressuring him for marriage. Kumar confided in Ramzan and Naushad and the trio hatched a conspiracy to kill the victim. “Naushad and Kumar took the victim to a jungle where Ramzan was already present. They then strangled her and left the body there. Later, Ramzan called the PCR stating that he was drinking in the jungle when he saw a woman being taken by two men on a motorcycle, who later killed her,” said Thakur. A probe revealed that the victim came on a black-coloured motorcycle with two men from Gaushala Road. Later, efforts were made to identify the body, but no clues were found. CCTV footage showed the two suspects taking her on a black Splendor motorcycle. The man who called police was also seen going on foot towards the spot. Later, when contradictions were noticed in the statements of the caller, Ramzan, he was interrogated at length. His mobile phone was also checked. He finally confessed that he knew the deceased. He disclosed that she was a live-in partner and possibly the wife of Kumar, who was living in Fatehpur Beri. The motorcycle used in the crime and the dupatta with which she was strangled have been seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-killed-by-lover-body-found-in-forest/articleshow/85193178.cms||---

However, when he lost Rs 7 lakh without getting the opportunity to meet even one woman, he realized he had been thoroughly duped. The New Ranip resident approached the cyber crime cell and filed a complaint against the accused. A team led by inspector M H Puwar apprehended Akash Lalwani, 21, and Jaimika Patel, 32, both residents of Vadodara, in connection with the case. The duo were caught with multiple financial documents, SIM cards and mobile phones. Patel told police that he got in touch with one Priyanka Patel through social media in March. After a few exchanges on chat, Priyanka claimed that she ran an escort company that had very high-profile women as clients. She said he could earn lakhs if was ready to date, meet and develop physical relationship with these women. “Patel agreed and, in a matter of three months, the accused got him to shell out Rs 7 lakh on one or the other pretext. After being unable to meet even one woman after forking over so much money, Patel got disillusioned and finally approached the police. He has a monthly salary of Rs 15,000, and had lost the money he had got from his mother,” said a city cybercell official. Puwar said, “We request citizens to approach the cyber cell if they have been duped using a similar modus operandi. They may have got the offer from social media profiles in the name of some other girl. The victims often do not approach police if the amount involved is not very big or if they do not want their family to know about the fraud.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lured-by-male-escort-job-new-ranip-man-loses-rs-7l/articleshow/85193126.cms||---

But she was appointed in position of her third choice in state tax department. In her place, a general category woman, who was much below her rank, was made a DySP, though the post was her second preference.GPSC told court that Solanki was denied her first choice because she had availed the benefit of age relaxation in the exams that were held in 2019. The court said, “The reason is absolutely ill-conceived, since there was no need for the petitioner to claim reservation as she was already satisfying the criteria of general category women candidate. The respondents have not produced any material to show that the petitioner had sought reservation. Hence, the reason for which she was denied appointment as per her first preference is illegal and perverse.”Solanki’s advocate Chetan Pandya said that the petitioner had secured 477.75 marks in the main written exam, whereas cut-off for general female candidate was 442.50. Thus, she had qualified for open category also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/high-court-orders-gpsc-to-appoint-sc-woman-as-dysp/articleshow/85193170.cms||---

While the HC suspended work in all courts on Monday as a mark of respect, the government accorded him a state funeral. The full court of the HC would now meet at 2pm on Tuesday to condole his demise. Known for his integrity and fearlessness as a lawyer for over 35 years, Justice Rao was elevated to the HC as a judge in 2017. The upright advocate was unanimously approved by the top judges for elevation to the HC. Prior to becoming a judge, he earned a name for his dogged fight in all causes that were entrusted to him. Notable among them was his stint with CBI as its special counsel at the high court. During his 7-year stint with CBI, he withstood pressures from several influential quarters to defend the CBI. While he had a ready smile during the hardest of times, he always stayed aloof lest someone questioned his motives. He used to often tell his friends that “those who were adversely affected by CBI actions will not allow me to live peacefully if they find any thing adverse in my life”. He kept the distance after becoming a judge too, addressing even familiar colleagues as “Mr Counsel”, said Prabhakar Rao Kadaru, senior lawyer of HC. “He always protected his spotless reputation. The only fear this fearless man had was of anyone trying to sully his spotless life,” Prabhakar said.

None of these colleges have applied for affiliation for the current academic year as they said that it is not viable to run the college anymore as they are neither getting fee reimbursement dues from the government nor are students paying the fee. “I have sold my college—name and permission, for 8 lakh. It is no more feasible to run the college,” said Janardhan D, who used to run a college in Maddur, Mahbubnagar district. He said that he and his partners still have another 8 lakh debt to clear. “If we get reimbursement amount from the state, at least we can clear our debts and move on,” he said, adding that he is now working as a motor mechanic for survival. Janardhan said that he along with his partners had started the college about six years ago for self-employment and added that at the time they sold the college they hardly had 50 students. Managements of several colleges said that their main source of income is reimbursement amount as a majority of students who join their college are those studying with the money released by the state in the form of scholarships and reimbursements. “Almost all colleges are facing financial problems during the pandemic. The fee amount we manage to collect is not even sufficient to clear rent and pay other bills,” said Durgeshwar Reddy, who runs a junior college in Sangareddy district. In the state, about 1,700 private colleges applied for affiliation this year. Of the total colleges, 985 are said to be budget colleges. The members of Telangana Private Junior College Managements Association (TPJMA) said that on an average a college spends about 3 lakh per month on rent, salaries, bills, among other expenses, and added that unless the state provides some support these colleges will not be able to survive. “Just like small-scale industries, the state and central government should extend support to private budget colleges as well as they provide human resource personnel to any industry. Hundreds of colleges are shutting down amid the pandemic and unless the government comes to our rescue, colleges and their staff will not be able to survive,” said Satish G, president, TPJMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/160-pvt-junior-colleges-shut-shopamid-pandemic-this-academic-yr/articleshow/85193140.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Parents claimed their children were not even being given extra time to complete the exam. They alleged that even when question paper was given late, invigilators were collecting them on time. “Till now, three exams have been completed. On day 1, the question paper was distributed 30 minutes late, on day 2 and today, the paper was late by an hour. Even then, the paper was collected exactly at 4pm,” a parent, who was waiting for his daughter outside an examination centre, said. Another parent, whose son was appearing for degree first year exam, said “Students are already under tremendous stress as they are appearing for exams amid the pandemic. To top it, there are made to sit for extra time in the examination hall, where there is no electricity for the major part of the examination.” Some students said that even basic facilities and social distancing norms were missing at examination centres. Osmania University controller of examination Sriram Venkatesh said that they were sending question paper late on purpose so that “it is not leaked”. “Exam duration remains unaffected as the lost time is compensated. If colleges are not compensating the lost time, they can approach the university,” he said, adding that students could also approach them if basic facilities were missing at an examination centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/degree-students-no-facilities-at-exam-centres/articleshow/85193173.cms||---

The MN College was founded in 1946. Old timers say that the sleepy town of Visnagar in Mehsana district was the only seat of learning for students from far-off places. While talking about the college’s prominence, many quote its founder principal, V K Gokak’s, words about there being no other college from Ajmer to Ahmedabad in those days.Students from places like Shirohi in Rajasthan, Patan, Mehsana, Idar and Himat Nagar took education at the college. The students used to stay at the hostels or at the Sayaji Ashram in the town. In absence of means of travel many used to ride horses to the college, old timers remember.Presently, though the college is fighting for existence. With the Gujarat government allocating funds in its budget for renovation of the M N College, many, including present principal Rajesh Modh, are hopeful that the institute will regain its old glory. Visanagar being a domain of the Gaekwad state it was necessary to get the approval of Vadodara state. Sheth Maneklal Nanchand, after whom the college is named, not only donated funds but also played a major role in the formation of the college.According to Modh, the college was set up on the model of MS University. Like many other institutions established in the British era, the M N college building too is inspired by European architecture. On visiting the college one may feel he is at M S University of Vadodara or University of Bombay or Wilson College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/visnagars-mn-college-with-rich-history-hopes-to-regain-lost-glory/articleshow/85188582.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Cluster system to be initiated in nine Hyderabad colleges||HYDERABAD: Starting this year, the Telangana higher education department will implement a cluster system in nine autonomous degree colleges in the city, helping students opt for courses available in other institutions within the cluster. The new cluster system is being introduced as a pilot project in Osmania University College for Women, Koti, Nizam College, Government City College, Government Degree College for Women, Begumpet, Raja Bahadur Venkat Rama Reddy Women’s College, St Ann’s College for Women, St Francis College for Women, Bhavan’s Degree College, Sainikpuri and Loyola Academy. To start with, the system will be implemented for second-year degree students in the identified colleges. The cluster system will facilitate mobility of students and faculty from one institution to the other. For instance, a bachelor of arts in history, economics and political science student of one institution can pursue a psychology or mass communication course being offered by another institution or vice-versa. Similarly, the teaching faculty can also be exchanged between the colleges in the cluster. “Credits allotted to a particular course will be transferred on completion. Apart from the mobility of students and faculty, the system will also facilitate pooling or sharing of resources such as library, infrastructure, best practices and other human resources,” said Papi Reddy, chairman, Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE), adding that students of an institution can get access to rich collection of books available in another institution. Likewise, the laboratory facilities will also be made available between the nine institutions. This new system will be executed between the institutions by entering into an agreement. The TSCHE has recently constituted three working committees with principals of these colleges -- one each on academics and credits transfer, infrastructure and sharing of resources and guidelines for implementation. The committees have been asked to study and prepare a timetable for offering courses and how courses and resources could be shared between the institutions. They have been asked to submit a report within 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cluster-system-to-be-initiated-in-9-city-colleges/articleshow/85193188.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Nationalist Congress Party to launch ‘Uttar Pradesh bachao’ campaign in all districts today||Lucknow: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) will launch its ‘samvidhaan bachao, UP bachao’ campaign on Tuesday. The state unit of the NCP will organise the campaign in every district. Office-bearers of the party will visit the districts to take part in the campaign. Talking to TOI here on Monday, state president of the party Umashankar Yadav said that besides staging a dharna the party workers will also hand over a memorandum to the district magistrate in every district. The Nationalist Congress Party in UP has decided to support the “main opposition party” (Samajwadi Party) in the state assembly elections next year. The decision is propelled by its strategy to check the BJP from coming to power in every state and uniting with the opposition. This is also a shift from the stand it took in the previous assembly elections in UP. It had contested the state assembly elections in 2017 and 2012 on its own. The NCP is organising the campaign to lay ground for itself in the state as it intends to contest the election and have some representation in the state assembly. “We have yet to work out a seat-sharing arrangement with the SP. We will make it known as soon as it gets decided,” said the state party president. “Anyone who raises a question against this (BJP) government gets harassed. We will expose activities of the BJP government,” Yadav said. The party plans to extend its outreach by meeting people in villages and remote regions and “exposing lies and anti-constitutional” activities of the BJP government in the state.  The Nationalist Congress Party has been present in UP since 2001.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ncp-to-launch-up-bachao-campaign-in-all-dists-today/articleshow/85195137.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad at sixth spot in vaccination drive as Bengaluru, Delhi march ahead||HYDERABAD: When it comes to vaccinating its registered beneficiaries, Hyderabad stands at the sixth position presently among seven top cities with 33.23 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines administered in the GHMC area. Bengaluru, Delhi, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata are ahead of Hyderabad in the vaccination process. Altogether, 18 lakh male beneficiaries, 15 lakh females and 482 transgenders have been vaccinated in the city. Of the 1.5 crore beneficiaries in the state, the GHMC area has 26 lakh registered beneficiaries for vaccination. Of these, 24.7 lakh have received the first dose, while only 8.6 lakh have received the second dose. The poor coverage of second doses in the city and rest of Telangana have been ascribed to low supply of vaccine doses. “There has been irregular and less than required allocation to the state since the beginning of the vaccination programme. This has affected the second doses and thrice so far, first doses had to be put on hold to prioritize second dose,” said an official from the state health department. “Even a fortnight ago, we were in a similar situation. This is basically due to poor planning and improper allocation to different states,” he added. In comparison, cities like Bengaluru have administered 60.9 lakh first doses, Mumbai has given 58.5 lakh jabs and Kolkata has 35.7 lakh beneficiaries receiving the first dose. When it comes to the second dose, Mumbai is leading, followed by Bengaluru and Kolkata. The number of Covishield doses administered are double the number of Covaxin doses in Hyderabad, according to the data from the CoWin portal. While a total of 22.6 lakh Covishield doses have been administered, the number of Covaxin doses administered stands at 10.3 lakh. The number of Covaxin doses are the third highest in Hyderabad compared to other cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-at-sixth-spot-in-vax-drive-as-bluru-delhi-march-ahead/articleshow/85193226.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Dehradun||Valley of flowers cut off after sole wooden bridge washed away in heavy rain, tourists asked to stay away||Dehradun: A wooden bridge near Dwaripul that provided connectivity to the Valley of Flowers in the Garhwal Himalayas was washed away after the water levels in Pushpawati and Dhriti Ganga rivers rose significantly following heavy rainfall on Sunday night. In view of the threat, tourists have been asked not to proceed towards the valley until the connectivity is fully restored. “A six-metre-long bridge was washed away due to heavy rainfall on Sunday night and the trek route near the glacier point was also blocked. Around 100 tourists were stopped from proceeding towards the Valley of Flowers,” said forest ranger Brij Mohan Bharti. Meanwhile, Amit Kanwar, the director of Valley of Flowers, told TOI that the blocked trek route has been repaired and will be opened for tourists from Tuesday morning. The overnight rainfall also triggered landslides in the hills. More than 120 roads, including the Badrinath and Yamunotri national highways were blocked. According to the district emergency operation centre, the Badrinath national highway was blocked at Chetrapal, Gulab Koti, and Lambagad areas due to recurring landslides. However, the highway was reopened for traffic by Monday evening. Similarly, the Yamunotri national highway was also opened for vehicular movements by Monday evening, according to the evening report of the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC). The Gangotri national highway, which was blocked near Nagun in Tehri district, was also cleared. However, 44 roads continued to remain blocked in Chamoli district, followed by 38 roads in Pauri Garhwal, and 10 roads each in Uttarkashi and Rudraprayag districts, according to the SEOC.

---||Dehradun||Rehab manager who ‘raped’ inmates held, centre ran sans docs, counsellors||Dehradun: The manager of a privately run drug rehab centre in Dehradun who allegedly raped inmates for several months after offering them “drugs of their choice” and threatening them with various forms of “punishment” was arrested on Monday. Police picked Vidyadutt Raturi, 48, from Rishikesh while his accomplice and the centre’s director, Vibha Singh, was arrested earlier on Saturday. Raturi’s arrest came even as more murky details emerged in the case. One of the survivors, who was among the four women who escaped last week and filed a police complaint, told TOI that two women inmates from Saharanpur had also been “sexually assaulted” by the manager. “They went home for Eid, but didn’t return,” said the 19-year-old woman. The woman added that no medical professional or counsellor visited the so-called rehabilitation centre. “No doctor ever wrote a prescription for us. The director decided which medicines to give us after an online search of our symptoms,” she said. It’s not clear which medicines were administered to patients and whether these included prescription-only drugs. The survivor was admitted to the centre in July and didn’t suspect anything amiss initially. “It was after a few days when I saw inmates using drugs that I found out what was really going on. In return for sexual favours, one could get cigarettes, cannabis, smack or drug of their choice. Those who refused were threatened and thrashed by the manager. Other women were also asked to beat those who resisted his advances,” she said. The rehab had 22 inmates — 17 men on the ground floor and five women on the first. Raturi — whose father is a retired class IV employee in the Indian Air Force — and Singh had opened the facility in February, a few months after they first met in a de-addiction centre in the city. Raturi was treated at the centre for alcohol abuse in 2018 and later started working there while Singh, who was also struggling with alcoholism, was admitted last year. “It’s during his employment at the centre that Raturi seemed to have realised that the rules governing such places were not very strict. So he and Vibha decided to open one themselves,” a police officer, who is part of the investigating team, told TOI. This is not Raturi’s first brush with the law. According to D S Rautela, station house officer, Clement Town, the accused had spent some time in jail in 2017 after he fled with a woman in Tehri district. “We are gathering more information about that case,” said Rautela, adding that inmates in the other centre where he worked will also be questioned. Raturi has been charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including section 376 (rape), 354 (assaulting or using force to any woman intending to outrage their modesty) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) while Singh has been booked under section 120 (party to a criminal conspiracy).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rehab-manager-who-raped-inmates-held-centre-ran-sans-docs-counsellors/articleshow/85188610.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||With a drop in testing over the weekend, fewer Covid-19 detections in Maharashtra & Mumbai||MUMBAI: Maharashtra and Mumbai reported a significant dip in daily detections in Covid cases on Monday. Maharashtra reported 4,505 new cases, the lowest in nearly six months, since February 16 (3,663). Mumbai reported 208 cases on Monday, lowest since April 2020 (183). Officials attributed the dip to a drop in testing over the weekend. Maharashtra conducted only 1.5 lakh tests on Sunday, as against over 2 lakh on weekdays. The state and city also reported a dip in fatalities. Maharashtra reported 63 deaths, of which three were in Mumbai. Cases in the state rose to 63.5 lakh and toll touched 1,34,064. Mumbai on Monday reported 7.3 lakh cases and 15,954 deaths. As per civic data of 4,000-odd active cases, 2,700 are symptomatic, while 1,400 are asymptomatic. Critical cases dropped to 475. Since the state has allowed relaxations, civic hospitals have been told to stay prepared for an increase in admissions. SevenHills Hospital dean Dr Balkrishna Adsul said their current occupancy was little over 400, out of the 1,850 beds. “We are ready. Besides adults, we created an-80 bed pediatric isolation ward and 20-bed paediatric ICU,” he said, adding that the hospital is admitting 40-50 patients daily. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said they plan to strengthen testing and augment daily numbers once local trains resume. The city’s positivity rate has been under 1%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-a-drop-in-testing-over-the-weekend-fewer-covid-19-detections-in-state-city/articleshow/85193228.cms||---

It’s the second robbery in two days in the eastern part of the city involving more than Rs 10 lakh cash. Investigators said that Raja, one of the two accused, is suspected to be involved in a murder case in Amraiwadi on Saturday night. According to a complaint filed with Kagdapith police by Anil Vaishya, a resident of Amraiwadi, he works with ITC Company at Jantanagar and is involved in collections and office work. “He was given Rs 16.29 lakh to deposit in a bank at Ghantakarna Market. A man stopped him near Khokhra and asked for his phone,” said a police official. “The call, however, did not connect and Anil left the spot. The same person again approached him at Anuvrat Circle and asked for his bag.” The official added: “At that time, Raja, considered to be a criminal in Amraiwadi whom Anil knew by face, came to the spot and threatened him with a knife and a revolver.” The duo pushed Anil, snatched his bag, and fled. Anil informed his office. “We have got CCTV footage of the incident, based on which a probe has been initiated. Multiple teams have been formed to nab the accused,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/angadia-staffer-robbed-of-rs-16l/articleshow/85193493.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||New-age cyber cons target high-profile: Ex-top cop, judicial officer among victims of online fraud||HYDERABAD: Cyber fraudsters are no longer targeting only gullible people with their bag of tricks as in a worrying trend high-profile people are also falling prey with disastrous consequences. A former director general of police, a top judicial officer and an educated NRI are among the fresh targets of cyber fraud, top police officials said. “Recently, while virtually addressing the IPS probationers in SVP National Police Academy (NPA), Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that women and children have been very vulnerable to cybercrime. But what we are observing now is that persons occupying high-profile positions are also becoming victims to online fraud,” said a top police officer. A few days ago, chairman and managing director of Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) G Raghuma Reddy lodged a complaint with Hyderabad cybercrime police claiming that sensitive information was taken from him by a fraudster. “The caller identified himself as an employee of a general insurance company and requested me to furnish details of PAN number and driving license number to get the claim of 4.5 lakh insurance amount,” Reddy told police in his complaint. Fearing that his credentials might be misused by the fraudsters, he further said: “I have furnished details of my driving licence number and PAN number thinking that the call is genuine. But after some time, I got suspicious and tried to call back on the same mobile number and it was switched off. When I checked the number through Truecaller, I found that it was fake.” Similarly, a retired director general of police rank officer recently lost nearly Rs 2.5 lakh after a caller who posed as a BSNL call centre executive asked him to update his Know Your Customer (KYC). The unidentified person made the former top cop download a remote accessing app on his phone. Subsequently, the hacker collected all the net banking details of the police officers and made four different banking transactions and withdrew money. Many of the victims who were conned in the recent times are residents of upmarket Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills and Madhapur, comprising top businessmen, techies and executives. A person of Indian origin who resides in the USA and Hyderabad, lost Rs 11.50 crore a few days ago. He was cheated by a few persons on the pretext of trading seed oil through import business. The victim, who is a doctor, had responded to an unsolicited email. He lodged a complaint with Hyderabad police as he was in the city. “The breach of customer details is one of the prime reasons for cyber frauds. Many victims fall prey to fraudsters since the fraudsters after accessing the breached data, give authentic details about the customer like policy details or banking information or similar information, while fooling the customer that it’s an authentic phone call. Trusting the caller, the victims share all the requested information,” assistant commissioner of police (cybercrime) KVM Prasad told TOI. He added that the new trend of luring people to download remote accessing apps is becoming a dangerous weapon. “Using the apps, the fraudster gets access to the victim’s mobile phone and siphons off money,” said Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-age-cyber-cons-target-high-profile/articleshow/85193236.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Delhi||Unsung Delhi hockey hub produces champs||NEW DELHI: On a rain-soaked Sunday afternoon, the nearly 82-year-old school building tucked in the heart of New Delhi looks even more colour-washed. What stands out, however, is a bright blue banner congratulating its former student for winning a medal at the Tokyo Olympics. The super alumnus is Sumit Kumar, midfielder in the Indian men’s hockey team that bagged the bronze at the Oi stadium on August 5. Who would have thought that an Olympic winner would start the victory run from an unheralded institution, the Union Academy Senior Secondary School in Raja Bazar, near Connaught Place, a run that would include winning the Junior World Cup in 2016 and an Olympic medal five years later? “Sumit has brought laurels to the school and above all for the country,” exulted school principal Manju Majumder. “Hockey is in the DNA of our school. As principal for 18 years, I can say with pride that the boys are equally effective in wielding the pen and the hockey stick.” Founded in 1934 in Shimla, the school moved to its present building in New Delhi in 1939. Its hockey legacy goes back many decades. The school team has won the All India Mohan Singh Hockey Tournament four times and the All India Nehru, SS Mota Singh, Aboo and the Cambridge hockey tournaments three times each, apart from other competitions. It considers the nearby Shivaji Stadium as its home ground. Kumar is the latest of several star alumni, including former India captain Vineet Kumar, former India coach Harendra Singh, Olympian Gagan Ajit Singh, former India player Manjeet Kullu, goalkeeper Sandeep Shokeen and many other national-level players. “The school has an atmosphere that is conducive for hockey. Our team, coached by Rajinder Singh (former India hockey coach), was the best in Delhi,” recalled Arjuna Awardee Gagan Ajit Singh. “The school was known for hockey when I moved to Delhi in the mid-1990s. It strikes a perfect balance between education and sports. The fact that the Shivaji Stadium is next door is a big bonus.” Mahesh Dayal, general secretary, Delhi Hockey Association, and a Union Academy alumnus, chuckled that students often bunked classes to watch a hockey match at the stadium. “The school usually provides most of the members of the Delhi hockey team,” Dayal said. He thanked “guru Hawa Singh Sir” for this. Septuagenarian Hawa Singh Bhardwaj, the physical education teacher, is hailed by students and teachers as the person who moulded champions from the school’s student body. Bhardwaj has known Kumar from the time he was just a boy. “At least 20 students have played for the national team. I remember Sumit from the time he was admitted in Class V,” the former national-level wrestler said. “I would reach the school by 8am and sprinkle the field with water before the students arrived. I left for home after 8pm following evening practice.” He had a spare bed in school for days when he was too late to return home to Nangal Thakran village. Accumulation of rainwater on the field was a problem that Bhardwaj fixed permanently with an opportunistic request when the underground Palika Bazar was being built in the late 1970s. “I requested New Delhi Municipal Council to give us the dug-up soil,” smiled Bhardwaj. “Truckloads arrived with earth to raise the height of our playfield.” Ever a coach, Bhardwaj has some tips for aspiring players. “A good hockey player needs not only good stamina, but also a strong heart and sharp intellect. I looked for these in budding players and trained them with passion,” he said. Tapan Roy, alumnus and chairman of the school’s governing body, fondly reminisced, “When I studied in the ’60s, the school emphasised educational excellence as much as extra-curricular activities. Everyone played football or hockey or joined the scouts and NCC.” He added, “Sumit Kumar’s achievement will motivate more students to aspire to excellence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unsung-city-hockey-hub-produces-champs/articleshow/85195200.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Bareilly||31-year-old double murder case: Three accomplices of Uttarakhand minister's husband get bail within a week||BAREILLY: Three accomplices of Giridhari Lal Sahu, the husband of Uttarakhand women and child development minister Rekha Arya, who were arrested on Friday and sent to jail in a 31-year-old double murder case, were granted bail by a sessions court here on Monday. A non-bailable warrant was issued against the trio — Badruddin, Naresh and Jagdish – and Arya’s husband in July for “not cooperating and deliberately delaying the court proceedings” in the double murder case. Eleven people, including Sahu, now 59, were accused of killing a Jain couple inside their Bareilly house in the presence of their three daughters on June 11, 1990. Four of the accused have died since then, while one person is on the run. Sahu, meanwhile, moved an application, pleading the district judge to transfer the case to any other court. “My client has moved an application before the district judge, pleading to transfer the case to any other court. He believes that he will not get justice in this court, which had issued the NBW against them incorrectly based on incomplete files,” defence counsel Anil Bhatnagar told TOI, adding that the court will take up the matter on August 18. The trio get bail upon furnishing two surety bonds of Rs 1 lakh each, while the NBW against Sahu is still in place. “The bail application of Badruddin, Naresh and Jagdish has been accepted by the court after furnishing two surety bonds of Rs 1 lakh each by two guarantors,” said Bhatnagar. The next date of hearing is August 20. The case was delayed several years as police put together another file. However, some important information still hasn’t been retrieved. “At that time, all case records were stored manually. We are still assembling everything again, but crucial documents are missing,” a police officer told TOI on condition of anonymity. Sahu, then a prominent member of the Samajwadi Party, had dozens of cases of land grabbing registered against him. He was also declared as a top history-sheeter in Bareilly and had been booked under the Gangster Act. Most of the cases against him were either withdrawn or he was acquitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/31-year-old-double-murder-case-three-accomplices-of-ukhand-ministers-husband-get-bail-within-a-week/articleshow/85188637.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Delhi||Seasonal strike: Hospitals in Delhi see spike in swine flu cases||NEW DELHI: Change in weather has led to a sharp rise in cases of viral illnesses other than Covid-19. The city hospitals said they were flooded with cases of seasonal influenza, and compared with last year, also witnessed a significant rise in cases of swine flu — also known as the H1N1 virus. “At least two patients confirmed positive for swine flu are admitted to our hospital,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonology and critical care, Apollo Hospital. He added that both patients came with high fever and breathing difficulty, which are also Covid-19 symptoms. “But tests showed they didn’t suffer from Covid. Therefore, we ran more tests and found that they had swine flu,” Dr Chawla said. Swine flu led to a pandemic in India in 2009. However, over the last few years, its cases have reduced significantly, and most people affected by it tend to recover without any serious complications, said Dr Rommel Tickko, director, internal medicine at Max Saket. “There has been a sudden surge in cases of seasonal influenza. Instances of swine flu have also gone up, but that’s quite usual for this time of the year. People rush to hospitals mostly because they fear that the symptoms could be caused due to Covid-19,” he added. According to Dr Atul Gogia, senior consultant, internal medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, of all the patients coming with complaints of high fever, cough, and chest congestion, 80% were cases of seasonal flu. “Around 20% cases are of swine flu,” he said. “Covid is still here, but other influenza viruses existing before have also not waned completely. We tell our patients not to panic and take all precautions,” said another doctor. Both Covid-19 and flu (also referred to as seasonal influenza) cause respiratory disease and are transmitted by contact, droplets, and fomites. Yet, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are a few differences between the two infections and how they spread. “Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms),” the WHO said, adding that, while the range of symptoms for the two viruses was similar, the fraction with severe disease appeared different. Covid-19 causes higher mortality compared to seasonal influenza.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/seasonal-strike-hospitals-see-spike-in-swine-flu-cases/articleshow/85195246.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh forced me to file complaint against Dawood Ibrahim, kin: Builder||MUMBAI: In a fresh allegation against former Mumbai commissioner of police Param Bir Singh, builder Shyam Sundar Agarwal has accused him of forcing to lodge a complaint against underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and his brothers Iqbal Kaskar and Anees Ibrahim. Kaskar was later arrested. The FIR lodged in October 2017 was one of the sensational cases supervised by Singh, then police commissioner of Thane. Agarwal, who is also the complainant against Singh in an FIR registered at Marine Drive police station, has written a 26-page complaint to state home minister Dilip Walse Patil and director general of police Sanjay Pandey. Agarwal has alleged that encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma called him to his office at the Thane anti-extortion cell (AEC) and threatened to book him under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) if he didn’t sign some documents. The next day, he learnt that he was made the complainant in the case against Dawood, his two brothers, Bharat Jain, Tony Lewis and others. Sharma was then heading the Thane AEC. Agarwal has claimed that this was done at the behest of his business partner-turned-rival Sanjay Punamia. Singh and Punamia are co-accused in the FIR lodged at Marine Drive police station. This was done to extort money, Agarwal said. The letter said, “It is extremely ironical that I am shown as partner of Chhota Shakeel in a Juhu case where Punamia alleged that Shakeel threatened him at my behest, whereas in the Thane case, I am shown as a complainant against the Dawood gang.’’ Agarwal said that Punamia with whom he had a civil dispute, with the help of Singh, had filed 17 FIRs against him. Of these 14 have been closed either by the investigating agency or by various courts for want of sufficient evidence. “Three FIRs are still pending which I am facing judiciously,” said Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/builder-param-bir-forced-me-to-file-plaint-against-dawood-kin-in-mumbai/articleshow/85195272.cms||Ahmed Ali

According to students, the fees for the July-December semester was increased even though classes are being conducted online. “The university should instead reduce the fees because we have classes online and every family has suffered financially during the Covid induced lockdown,” said a student who did not wish to be named. Another student said their complaint to the administration has fallen on deaf ears. “At first they did not respond to our grievances and now they are dodging the actual issue,” he said, adding that the university is also charging around Rs 10,000 for a three-day personality development class which will be conducted online. When queried about the issue, UPES vice-chancellor Sunil Rai said the university has already waived or refunded certain elements of the fee for its students. “We are also providing multiple scholarships to students whose families have been impacted by Covid-19,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/law-students-protest-fee-hike/articleshow/85188688.cms||Mohammad Anab

The programme saw the distribution of kisan credit cards (KCC) and rollout of the Mukhyamantri Pashudhan Yojana for the current fiscal year. Similar programmes were held simultaneously across all the 24 districts to mark the day. Speaking at the event, Soren said, “Today, we are rolling out various farmer-centric schemes to mark the special day and to dedicate the day in honour of our annadatas (food providers).” He added, “The term ‘Birsa Kisan’ will instill a sense of pride in the farmers. Jharkhand is the land of Birsa and several other warriors who laid down their lives for their community and for safeguarding tribal rights and resources and they played a key role in India’s freedom struggle. But much before the freedom struggle began, our forefathers were already struggling for the cause of our jal, jungle, jameen (land, forest and water). On the other hand, you (farmers) are the ones who feed us and hence, my government has decided to recognize you as Birsa Kisans to provide you with a distinct identity.” Expressing concern over many farmers shifting to other sources of incomes because of a host of challenges before them, Soren said that his government is working to revive the entire farming sector in the state. “The need of the hour is to address the farmers’ concerns and we are already working in this regard. For example, we are planning to set up a federation for market linkage of minor forest produce.” In another significant announcement, the CM said the government are soon going to provide eggs six days a week to schoolchildren “About 40% of the kids in the state are malnourished and we will give them eggs six days a week,” he said. Meanwhile, while explaining the origin behind the term ‘Birsa Kisan’, state agriculture department’s director Nisha Oraon said they are working on providing unique IDs to every farmer on the lines of a unique identification system (Aadhaar) to curb duplicity of farm schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/states-farmers-get-kisan-credit-cards/articleshow/85199391.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Amarjeet Singh, secretary of a transgenders’ outfit named Utthan here, said, “Transgenders earn their livelihood mostly by begging on trains and by performing at auspicious occasions like marriage, for example. But now with passenger trains’ not operating and weddings being postponed/cancelled because of the pandemic, there isn’t much to do to earn money. Now, even if people are people are getting married, they are doing it on a small-scale and we often don’t even get to know about them.” There are around 200 transgenders across the three districts in Kolhan division who are looking for help from the government, he added. The outfit has also requested for a permanent house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana for the transgenders, who are presently living in rented homes in the slums. “A pension scheme and a house under the awas yojana would give us a decent life and the community will feel empowered,” Singh said. He, however, expressed his gratitude to the respective administrative officials in the three districts for helping them in getting the Covid vaccine shot. “In Jamshedpur, the DC (Suraj Kumar) organised a vaccination camp exclusively for us last month,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lgbt-community-appeals-to-govt-for-monthly-pension/articleshow/85190455.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ranchi||Covid drives runaway man back home to Chatra after 35 years||Chatra: Fifty-five-year-old Jageshwar Paswan, who left his home in a fit of rage in his youth, has come back to his native village of Tulbul under Kanhachatti block in Chatra district after 35 years, only to find that his last rites were already performed and his parents dead. His younger sister had also moved to another village after getting married. When he returned home a couple of days ago, Jageshwar, now a married man with a son and daughter, found himself a stranger in his own village and home. His property was looked after by his cousins and are happy to give it back to him after he identified himself. Recalling his youth, Jageshwar said he left home as a 20-year-old in 1986 after he was scolded by his parents. He said, “After leaving home, I went to Delhi and started working in a brick kiln there. The owner of the kiln made me work as a bonded labourer for five years. Later, I got married to my wife, Reena, who was also working there. After the kiln shut down, we started working in a roadside dhaba in Delhi.” Jageshwar said he was leading a happy life but started facing financial problems after the nationwide lockdown was enforced last year. “I read in newspapers that migrant labourers were returning to their native places after they were not able to find work anymore. I, too, decided to return to Tulbul in the hope of meeting my parents and sister and find a job,” Jageshwar said. His neighbours were surprised to see Jageshwar, his wife Reena, son Ravi Paswan and daughter Radha Kumari when they reached the village on Saturday, After he identified himself, they were then taken to his parents’ house. His cousins said they were happy to see them after giving up all hopes for a long time. His cousins also said that presuming Jageshwar was dead, they had performed his last rites with an effigy. On why he did not return all these years, Jageshwar said: “It was my decision to leave the village in my youth but I am pained to know that my parents are dead. I will not leave the village again and will continue to stay here. What I have lost will not come back, but I can compensate for that by living here with my family.” A villager, Subodh Paswan, said: “We had even forgotten him as 35 years is a long time. But we are happy to know that he is alive and has a family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/covid-drives-runaway-man-back-home-to-chatra-after-35-years/articleshow/85191975.cms||---

The special court here was hearing the case online and the defence lawyers were supposed to start their arguments. The case (RC47A/1996), the last of the fodder scam case in Jharkhand, relates to fraudulent withdrawals amounting to Rs 139.35 crore from the Doranda treasury in undivided Bihar in between 1990-91 and 1994-95. Lalu’s lawyer Prabhat Kumar said, “We have filed a petition before the court for an offline hearing. There are voluminous documents in the case. It is not possible to carry out online arguments under the circumstances. The court has sought a reply from the prosecution on our plea. The decision on the petition is likely in the next hearing scheduled on Wednesday.” Sanjay Kumar, who is representing other accused persons in the case, added, “It would be very difficult to display a large number of documents and also communicate our argument online.” Kumar added that Lalu along with 110 people was accused in the three-decade-old case and some of the accused had died. The defence sides have produced a total of 27 witnesses. The prosecution has completed its arguments against the accused on Saturday. It produced 575 witnesses and 15 boxes of documents before the court. The prosecution argued that the illegal withdrawals were done in the name of procuring fodder and medicines and produced fake receipts. It may be noted here that there were five cases related to the fodder scam against Lalu and others in Jharkhand. Lalu has been convicted in four of them and is currently out on bail in those cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/offline-hearing-sought-in-fodder-scam-case/articleshow/85191559.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The park officials, however, justified the wall. The Jharkhand Assembly’s General Purpose Committee members led by Independent legislator Saryu Rai during their visit to the tiger reserve on Sunday took cognizance of this wall and raised a volley of questions on its construction. The environmentalists believe that the wall will harm the wildlife. Their contention is that this wall will be especially harmful for elephants. D.S. Srivastav, a well-known elephant expert said the construction of the wall belies all logic. He said, “It is a criminal waste of government money. Funds to the tune of Rs 86 lakh were spent on it. It should be recovered from the officer concerned who gave orders for its construction.” Deputy director, North division of the tiger reserve, Kumar Ashish, on the other hand, defended the wall. “The wall will save deer from getting killed by dogs. The wall willl stop street dogs from entering the park.” Rai told TOI, “We too want to know why this wall has been built. We know that state highway 9 runs through the park and his wall will further fragment the park. We just want to know from PTR the advantages of the multilakh-rupee wall in the compartment 2 of the park. I will write to the Comptroller and Auditor General for a special audit of the PTR. People reserve the right to know if government money given to the PTR has been judiciously spent or not.” Rai said he has been told of silviculture in the PTR which too needs to be looked into if its necessary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/assembly-panel-frowns-on-rs-86l-wall-in-betla-park/articleshow/85190822.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Adivasis must resist getting divided on religious lines: Oraon||Ranchi: Jharkhand Congress president and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon on Monday urged all Adivasis to stay united, advising them not to be misled by anyone or any party which tries to define them by a particular religion. Addressing a ceremony organsied by the state party unit to felicitate tribal achievers/workers in different sectors on the occasion of World Indigenous Day, Oraon said, “Tribals are one and should remain united.” Without naming any party, he said, “For the past few years, we all know that a particular party is trying to divide tribals into different religious for votebank politics. At times, they equate them with Sanatan and at other times, with Sarna and so on. In states like Karnataka and Jammu and Kashmir, many tribals are Muslims. But once you are born a tribal, you will always be a tribal. So Adivasis must resist getting divided on religious lines.” Oraon’s warning is perhaps a pointer to the BJP which often accuses missionaries of converting tribals into Christianity stating that tribals, followers of Sarna, are disciples of Sanatan (Hindu). He also appealed to the tribals to be vigilant and aware of their rights to jal (water), jangal (forest) and zameen (land). “It was the Congress-led UPA government which brought the Forest Rights Act, PESA law among others to safeguard the rights of tribals and forest dwellers. The coalition government in the state is working in the direction of proper implementation of those laws in toto,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/adivasis-must-resist-getting-divided-on-religious-lines-oraon/articleshow/85190489.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Red Lionfish (Pterois), mostly found in the Indo-Pacific region, is a species of venomous sea fish and is not consumed by locals here. It has ornate pectoral fins and fin rays that are venomous, bearing a sting that produces a sharp pain that can last for some time. Fishermen are wary of the fish. “The lionfish, which we found off Cacra coast on Sunday, is different from the one we caught last year. This one is mostly red. The other one also had blue and white bands,” fisherman Sanjay Pereira said. Lionfish, also called zebrafish or butterfly cod, are not uncommon and stray into nets once in a while. On Sunday, Yogesh Satondekar, a Siridao-based fisherman, hauled up one in his catch in Zuari river, off Vasco. “I found this fish for the first time, made inquiries with a fisheries scientist, and released it after clicking a photo,” he said. Fisheries surveys have indicated their presence in coral reefs. “From our experience, this fish is rare in estuaries, but we have recorded them at Grande Island during underwater surveys,” fisheries scientist, Indian council of agricultural research (ICAR), Old Goa, G B Sreekanth said. Like many other colourful fish found in coral reefs near Grande island, lionfish have high ornamental value.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/red-lionfish-caught-in-zuari-captures-interest-of-locals/articleshow/85193455.cms||Paul Fernandes

While the driver told police that he had to veer the bus to the side as some cattle appeared in front of it, Ponda PI Mohan Gaude said the police are investigating the accidentPassengers Dhanashri Naik, 30, from Adpai, and Negan Sawant, 52, from Quepem were injured. Lady bus conductor Sushma Gaude, 45, from Khandola, Marcel, was also hurt. Naik has been admitted to the GMC, Bambolim, while the other two were discharged from the Ponda sub-district hospital. The bus had left from the KTC depot at Panaji in the morning and was on its way to Ponda. At 7.10am, the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing it to skid off the road, hitting a wall and electric pole by the road at the Apewal-Priol junction. The accident report shared by the KTC stated that the front windscreen, bumper and carapace of the bus was damaged. Local residents have attributed the reason behind the accident to the narrow road.

---||India||At 7.7 crore, traffic challans up four times in 23 months||NEW DELHI: The number of challans for traffic rule violations has increased by almost four times to 7.7 crore in the past 23 months after the amended Motor Vehicle Act came into force in 2019 compared to the same previous corresponding period. Nearly 29% of these challans were issued only in Delhi despite it being a UT while Tamil Nadu had the maximum share of 32.5% of such challans in the past 23 months. The data, submitted to the Rajya Sabha on Monday by Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari in response to a starred question, shows that only 1.9 crore challans were issued between August 2017 and August 2019 before the amended law was notified by the Centre. All states have implemented the new provisions with higher fines for traffic violations. The detailed analysis of the data shows that 1.5 crore challans or notices were issued to violators in Tamil Nadu during these 23 months, which was almost 24 times more than than the challans issued during the same period between 2017 to 2019. In the case of Delhi, the number of traffic challans issued during the past 23 months was 2.2 crore, which is four times more than the challans issued during the corresponding period in 2017-19. The total number of vehicles in Delhi is equal to the combined number of vehicles registered in Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. Uttar Pradesh also saw an increase in the number of such challans from 44.3 lakh to 1.5 crore after the new MV law was enforced. However, there are states such as Gujarat and Haryana where the number of challans reduced. Former DGP and chairman of road safety authority in Telangana T Krishna Prasad said, “It was expected that the number of challans would increase after the new law came into force. Had there been no lockdown and restriction on traffic movement, the numbers would have been bigger. We can see a spike in challans in states and cities where technology is being used to catch the violators. We must shift from policemen-driven enforcement to technologydriven enforcement.” Gadkari said the increase in number of challans is due to installation of cameras and speed gun-based automatic violation detection system. He said this was almost negligible before the implementation of the amended law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-7-7-crore-traffic-challans-up-four-times-in-23-months/articleshow/85197256.cms||Dipak K Dash

Of the 20 police constables who applied, 14 have cleared the physical test. Upon conclusion of the final selection round, the constables will be sent to the National Security Guards (NSG) training centre at Haryana for three months. “Fourteen of the 20 applicants cleared a proficiency test that included running 5km in 25 minutes and 100m in 15 seconds, doing pull-ups, chin-ups and shuttle-running,” a senior police officer said. The ATS presently has 90 commandos. The senior officer said that after the police department had decided to cancel its earlier decision to induct 35 personnel who were being trained at the police training centre, it had called for applications from police constables who sought to join the ATS. Subsequently, 20 constables showed interest. Pointing out that Goa receives frequent terror alerts as it is an international tourist destination, the officer said that augmenting the squad’s strength would help cover the entire state in the event of any terror-related issues. Meanwhile, the ATS conducted an 8-km run test for its commandos from Dona Paula to the GRP camp at Altinho. All commandos completed the run in good time and without injury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-commandos-for-ats-of-goa-police/articleshow/85193590.cms||---

Ranjib Sarma, chairman of the Sitajakhala Milk Cooperative Society, said the milkmen have decided to donate 15 paise from every litre of milk sold to Sitajakhala Higher Secondary School to run its higher secondary section (class 11 and 12) till it is ‘provincialised’ (taken over by the government). “The high school section (class 6 to 10) was provincialised in 1986. However, the higher secondary level is still operating in venture mode and facing acute financial issues. The school has not received any funds from the government to run the higher secondary level,” he added. Sarma said most of the students are children of milkmen. “The situation of the school has compelled parents to take this step. This will help the school as well as secure the academic future of the students,” he added. The cooperative society has recently handed over a cheque for Rs 1 lakh to the school and has urged the state government to run vocational courses in agriculture. Headmaster of the educational institute Uttam Deka appealed to the government to come forward and support it in its endeavour to impart quality education to children of the Gobha tribal belt in Morigaon. “We are thankful to Sitajakhala Milk Cooperative Society for helping us with the financial aid. This initiative will go a long way in sustaining the school,” he added. Sarma said the society faced tremendous hardship during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/milkmen-in-assam-come-to-fund-starved-schools-rescue/articleshow/85197344.cms||Mukut Das
---||Nagpur||Std XI classes begin in rural, admissions yet to start in Nagpur||NAGPUR: In a role reversal of sorts, state board junior colleges in city are envious of their rural counterparts as Std XI classes in physical mode have started there in full swing, while in urban areas even the admission process has not started. This is because seats in city’s junior colleges are allotted through online centralized admission process (CAP), which is yet to start across Maharashtra. Outside city limits, admissions are done the traditional way with students approaching colleges directly. Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association (VJUCTA), said, “All this mess has been created because of state education department’s insistence on a common entrance test (CET) for Std XI. Now our CAP is linked with CET and that’s why we are stuck.” The CET is scheduled for August 21, following which it will take a few days for results to come. Only after this can the admission process begin in city. Gavhankar, who is principal of Raosaheb Thawre Junior College near Ajni, says city students are losing out on academics due to the delay. Another junior college principal agreed saying, “Parents are flocking the colleges either outside city limits or students are taking admission in CBSE Std XI in city. Why would any academically brilliant kid want to waste time waiting for city colleges to start admissions? Such students, who are mostly enrolled with coaching institutes, have already shifted to rural colleges where attendance is not mandatory.” VJUCTA has now written to school education minister Varsha Gaikwad demanding that the CET be scrapped. Gavhankar said, “At least 20,000 junior college seats will be vacant this year again, hence there is no need for CET. We have written to officials and the minister reminding them that their duty is to make things easy for students, not complicate it.” A senior junior college teacher said many parents feel rural colleges are operating only because they have permission while those in city don’t. “Even if city colleges get permission from tomorrow, we can’t start XI classes because admissions are yet to begin,” she said. So while rural colleges have started with physical classes, academics feel in city classes may begin only in September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/std-xi-classes-begin-in-ruraladmissions-yet-to-start-in-city/articleshow/85191855.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Nagpur circle comprises Gadchiroli, Gondia, Wardha, Nagpur and Bhandara. There may be over 100 field staff in these divisions. Sources said all the divisions have planted at least 8 lakh saplings this monsoon season. Now there will be no staff to protect these plantations. As reported by TOI on August 6, SFD joint director Surendra Wadhai and RFOs were at the loggerheads over allegations of irregularities in pre-plantation operation (PPO) work in their ranges. The Forest Rangers Association Maharashtra (FRAM) has submitted a memorandum to PCCF (HoFF) and SFD PCCF, Pune, about the mass leave decision from August 9, demanding removal of Wadhai. Wadhai said, “I’ve not received any leave application. As per my knowledge, foresters and forest guards have not gone on strike.” A section of DFOs said, “The strike will affect payment of wages to van majoors, many of whom have not been paid for the last four months. Of the Rs12 crore towards wages, only Rs3 crore has been released till now.” Forest union leader Ajay Patil has reiterated that if no decision is taken by the state government in the matter, the staff will start a chain hunger strike from August 18. Meanwhile, Indrajeet Baraskar, state secretary of Maharashtra Forest Guard-Foresters Sanghatana, said, “Members of our association will not be part of the mass leave agitation. Those who have gone on protest leave should wait for the report of the committee to be out.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/social-forestry-rfos-go-on-mass-leave/articleshow/85191903.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||BJP netas, Jorgewar make streets their political battleground||Chandrapur: Allegation and counter allegations flying between independent MLA Kishor Jorgewar and office bearers of BJP-ruled Chandrapur Municipal Corporation (CMC) since the last few days turned into a full face-off on the streets on Monday. BJP leaders, with massive support from activists, took to the streets unannounced to counter the pre-declared agitation of Jorgewar on Monday afternoon even as both sides had no permission due to Covid restrictions. Both the sides openly violated the physical distancing norms. Police department deployed a massive force and rounded up protestors of both the sides. The confrontation between Jorgewar and BJP netas had begun a few days ago after the former announced agitation against the alleged corruption in CMC. Jorgewar, through his organization Young Chanda Brigade, particularly targeted mayor Rakhi Kancharlawar of BJP for spending Rs70,000 on obtaining special registration no. ‘1111’ for the new car procured by CMC during the pandemic. Jorgewar had even erected hoardings across the city to highlight the issue. In a counter-attack, BJP made a video clip detailing alleged inefficiency of Jorgewar and his failure in keeping multiple promises made to the public during the election campaign. On Monday, Jorgewar planned an agitation at 1pm before the CMC building at Gandhi Chowk. Hundreds of BJP workers led by Kancharlawar and district president Devrao Bhongle reached there at 12 noon and staged a protest flaying Jorgewar for “deceiving” the people with promises of providing 200 units free electricity. Later, Jorgewar and his supporters staged agitation at the square and alleged corruptions in the civic body. SDPO Sheelwant Nandedkar claimed that no permission was granted to both the sides for the agitations. “Leaders and activists of both the sides have been arrested and offence is being registered for violation of pandemic norms and Epidemic Diseases Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-netas-jorgewar-make-streets-their-political-battleground/articleshow/85192004.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Business||SC upholds CCI probe into Amazon, Flipkart||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday green-lighted the investigation ordered by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) into alleged anti-competition agreements entered into by e-commerce majors Amazon and Flipkart and censured the dominant online retailers for opposing and attempting to stall the inquiry into complaints ordered on January 13 last year. Lengthy arguments by senior advocates Gopal Subramanian and A M Singhvi, appearing for Flipkart and Amazon respectively, had little impact on a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant, which dismissed their petitions without even calling upon solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was eager to argue the dire necessity of investigations into the flagged issues by the director general of CCI. The two senior advocates strained to drive home the point that the SC judgments, as interpreted by the Bombay high court, mandated the CCI to arrive at a preliminary conclusion on complaints alleging anti-competition agreements prior to ordering an investigation. They said the CCI faltered by ordering a probe without recording a prima facie conclusion about its necessity. The CJI-led bench rejected the plea, saying some high courts having a misunderstanding of the SC judgments will not detain the apex court and force it to entertain petitions against orders directing investigation. “It is an administrative decision which at the best will result in the filing of an investigation report by the DG,” the bench said. Rejection of this argument would have a far-reaching impact on the e-commerce sector, which has a few dominant players that are slowly squeezing out smaller players. “We expect e-commerce majors like Amazon and Flipkart to volunteer such investigation to remove apprehensions about their alleged anticompetition agreements. Surprisingly, you are objecting to mere inquiry. You have to submit to the process and face investigation,” the SC said. Upholding the June 11 decision of the Karnataka HC, Justices Ramana, Saran and Kant said, “Having carefully perused the material available on record, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned orders passed by the high court of Karnataka dismissing the writ appeals of the petitioners. The special leave petitions are, accordingly, dismissed.” Singhvi informed the court that time to reply to the notice issued by the CCI director general is expiring on August 9 and requested for an extension. The SC granted four more weeks to Amazon and Flipkart to file their responses before the DG and said, “It is made clear that no further extension of time would be granted for the purpose.” Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh and Confederation of All India Traders had complained to the CCI that the e-commerce majors are adopting anti-competitive measures to kill the small traders and MSMEs. The CCI had found that Amazon and Flipkart had launched 45 and 65 smartphones respectively on their platforms and said that exclusive agreements and deep discounting raised potential competition concerns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sc-upholds-cci-probe-into-amazon-flipkart/articleshow/85197369.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Jathedar seeks strict action against anyone promoting Hindu-Sikh enmity||KURUKSHETRA: Taking notice of the complaint filed by Haryana Sikh Parivar (HSP), acting jathedar of Akal Takht Giani Harpreet Singh has asked the Haryana government to keep the “so-called organisations like Dev Sena and people like Guni Parkash in control” and demanded strict action against them for promoting enmity between Hindu and Sikh communities. Talking to media at Amritsar, Giani Harpreet Singh on Monday said, “In the recent past, a convention was held by farmers in Kurukshetra, Haryana, in which, Sikhs had also participated in large number. Some mischievous elements while wearing ‘gatras’ (belt used to carry kirpan) (and kirpans) attempted to disrupt the event there. At that time, Sikh youths of Haryana caught the mischievous elements, but the Haryana government or administration did not take any action against them. It resulted that those elements lodged a complaint against the Sikhs (with Kurukshetra SP for looting cash and their kirpans).” “Secondly, by releasing a video, they (elements) threatened that they will reach Kurukshetra again while wearing gatras (kirpans) on August 21. A so-called Dev Sena organisation is committing these mischievous acts. Haryana government should keep this jathebandi (organisation) in control as it is disturbing the (peaceful) environment of Haryana state and also hurting the Sikh sentiments,” said Giani Harpreet Singh. The acting jathedar said Dev Sena has been working to create a rift between Hindu and Sikh communities and attempting to break the mutual understanding between them. He asked the Haryana government to “control this organisation (Dev Sena) and punish the culprits by registering cases against them. In case, if any untoward incident takes place in Kurukshetra (on August 21), then its responsibility will solely be on Haryana government and administration. These elements will not be allowed to succeed in anyway and they will be stopped from committing their mischiefs. Their motive is to hurt the Sikh sentiments by committing such mischiefs and to tease Sikhs.” Talking about derogatory remarks by BKU (Mann) Haryana state president Guni Parkash against Gurnam Singh Charuni, the acting jathedar said, “A person (Guni) uttered derogatory remarks against the turban and kes (hair) of Gurnam Singh Charuni. That person uttered these words not only for Charuni, but the entire Sikh community. Haryana government should take strict action against him (Guni) and lodge him in jail.” Jathedar said that these type of incidents hurt the Sikh sentiments and these cannot be tolerated at any cost. He said it is a well-planned conspiracy to hurt the Sikh sentiments and disturb the harmony between Hindus and Sikhs in Haryana who are living together peacefully for long.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jathedar-seeks-strict-action-against-anyone-promoting-hindu-sikh-enmity/articleshow/85195628.cms||---

Heated arguments ensued between ruling and opposition legislators. As a mark of protest, Congress legislators raised slogans inside the House. Amid the din, leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri was heard saying that one-sided decisions cannot be taken. Mukesh Agnihotri said provisions like zero hour are needed to raise issues in the state assembly. He declared that till the time provisions like zero hour were made, the opposition could not be stopped from raising issues in the House. During the protest by opposition legislators, Parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj objected to the statement of the leader of opposition towards the chair and demanded an apology. He pointed out that the leader of opposition had been suspended from the House earlier too and that the opposition had stopped the vehicle of the governor and faced consequences. Later, speaker Vipin Singh Parmar allowed BJP MLA Narender Thakur and Congress MLA Dhani Ram Shandil to raise their issues. Narender Thakur sought clarification from the revenue minister about a question related to disaster management. Shandil raised the issue of “Divyangs” not being allowed to meet the chief minister, besides some other issues. Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said that under point of order, raising issues that were not important was not right. He also said that seeking clarification on questions which had been answered during question hour and raising two to three issues together was not appropriate. He said permission could not be granted to raise such issues till provisions for zero hour or a similar arrangement was made. The speaker asked the opposition to clarify who led the group before raising issues in the House. From the ruling side, it was the chief minister putting forth the viewpoint his side but this was not the same with the opposition, he said. He said that from ruling side it is chief minister Jai Ram Thakur who puts the view points of ruling side in the House, while from opposition this is not happening. Earlier, during question hour, issue of regularising services of teachers appointed under school management committees (SMC) was raised in the state assembly on Monday by Congress MLA Vinay Kumar. He sought clarification from the government on the policy to regularise these teachers. Urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj, while replying on behalf of the education minister said that the government was serious about framing a policy for SMC teachers. He said that in the current financial year, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had increased the salary of SMC teachers by Rs 500 per month. He said that issue of regularisation of SMC teachers was being examined in light of the Supreme Court judgment of November 24 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/ruckus-in-himachal-assembly-over-questions-in-house/articleshow/85195632.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||On Punjab prod, transport min to review land compensation norms jab||Chandigarh:To ease the process of land acquisition, the parliamentary standing committee on transport has urged the central transport ministry to review the existing provisions for calculating the amount of compensation to be paid to landowners. The panel, in a report ‘Role of Highways in Nation Building’ tabled in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, made this recommendation after Punjab government pointed out the ‘discrepancies’ in the process of determination of value of the land acquired for road projects, which is at the core of delays faced in these projects. Punjab called for the need to rationalise the procedure for determination of the market value of land so that it is more realistic and closer to actual market rates. The projects for laying two-lane national highways are assigned to the state governments. The chief engineer (National Highways), Punjab public works department (PWD), maintained that the market value of land to be acquired is calculated on the basis of collector rate prevailing in the area. The chief engineer contended that the price determined by using the method does not represent the actual market rate of the land, leading to low compensation. To get a fair price of their land and for enhancement of the compensation amount, the owner’s resort to arbitration and court cases. The legal procedure goes on for years, causing harassment to landowners and financial loss to the government. Agreeing with Punjab’s assertion, the committee submitted: "Such discrepancy would invariably cause dissatisfaction among the landowners and the ensuing delays on account of arbitration and legal procedures cost the public exchequer a lot of money due to project cost overruns." The committee further recommended: "Ministry may review the accuracy of the provisions in determining the amount of compensation to be paid to landowners, as compared to the actual market value of the land. If substantial differences are noticed in the compensation value and the market value in many instances, the ministry may come up with a suitable mechanism for determining a fair value for the land to be acquired." As per the data shared in Lok Sabha last month, as many as 29 projects with the state public works department (PWD) are running behind schedule. ONGOING TUSSLE The farmers in Punjab are up in arms against low compensation being awarded for their agricultural land and houses to be acquired for the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway. Besides low compensation, the farmers are also complaining that the proposed expressway would split their land into two, leading to an accessibility problem. The expressway will connect Delhi with Amritsar in Punjab and Katra in Jammu and Kashmir. It will reduce Delhi-Amritsar travel time from 8 hours to 4 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/on-punjab-prod-transport-min-to-review-land-compensation-norms-jab/articleshow/85195633.cms||Vinod Kumar

He took note of the state’s fall from a revenue surplus of Rs 1,760 crore in 2012-13 to a deficit of Rs 61,320 crore in 2020-21. The state needs to shun the business-as-usual approach and adopt radical reforms, he said, especially in sectors such as power, water supply and transport. “The budget that I will be presenting this Friday will be practically for six months. Hence one cannot say how many changes could be included in this exercise. Going forward, bitter medicine will be rightly delivered for vested interests who exploited the state’s revenues for their personal benefit. Through prudent steps, we are confident of righting the wrongs of the AIADMK government and fulfilling all the poll promises made by our chief minister in this five-year term,” the minister said. Pointing out that motor vehicle taxes and other charges, levied as fixed costs, have remained unchanged for 15 years, Thiaga Rajan questioned the uniform approach towards the rich and the poor while levying property tax that was last revised in 2008. Water charges too need a relook, he indicated, where large consumers would have to pay higher taxes. It would also hold true for electricity, with the need to prevent big consumers benefiting more from subsidised charges. The accumulated debt of the power and transport sector PSUs stood at Rs 1.99 lakh crore as on March 31, 2021, while the accumulated losses of the two water boards amount to Rs 5,282.57 crore at the end of last financial year. Experts saw the white paper as a prelude to big reforms. “It makes a case for an increase in property tax and rationalisation of electricity and transport subsidies. The latter may be difficult to achieve given that the state aims to be a major player in manufacturing and use of electric vehicles. An increase in the running cost of e-vehicles may adversely impact adoption,” said Vidya Mahambare, economics professor at Great Lakes Institute of Management. The focus is now on the first budget by the DMK government on Friday, after it came back to power after a decade. “Fiscal transformation will happen if the will of those in power is shown by stopping schemes like free power and lax fiscal management. I believe the will exists, as the last para states Go TN!” tweeted Gopal Srinivasan, chairman of TVS Capital Funds. The current levels of fiscal deficit are unsustainable because the share of revenue deficit in fiscal deficit exceeds 50% or more since 2017-18. Though in most years, since 2013-14, the fiscal deficit was maintained within the prescribed 3% limit, it was adhered to only by postponing certain items of expenditure, he said. The rising revenue deficit-driven fiscal deficits are funded mainly by borrowing, which sharply increased the total (visible) debt outstanding to a little more than Rs 5.70 lakh crore on March 31, 2022, amounting to around Rs 70,000 on every citizen of the state and nearly Rs 2.64 lakh on every family living in Tamil Nadu. The growing gap between the fiscal deficit and the net public debt each year has been covered by transactions in the public account and drawdowns of cash balances. Total government guarantees nearly doubled to more than ₹91,800 crore in 2020-21, which means a large contingent liability and fiscal risk for the state. In 2019-20, Tamil Nadu had the third highest guarantees outstanding among all states, behind Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the states going through division pangs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tns-finances-deep-in-red-dmk-govt-pushes-for-radical-reforms/articleshow/85193234.cms||D Govardan

After all, 13 of 157 students who scored 625 out of 625 are from this school. Of the nearly 15,000 schools whose students wrote the exam, the Agalagurki school accounted for the highest number of maximum scorers. In all, 152 of its students wrote the exam. The school has four students in second place, two in third, ten in fourth and five in fifth spot. “It’s a great moment,” said principal Mohan Kumar DC. “The government announced changes in the exam pattern towards the end of the academic year. We divided students into groups based on performance. Each teacher was assigned 15 students. They called them daily, gave exams, assessed them and gave feedback immediately,” he said. “Closer to the exam, we called students to the campus in small groups,” he added. The students are from rural and urban backgrounds as well as various financial backgrounds. The school has only English medium education. “We understood their background and handheld them accordingly,” Kumar said. “Though we’ve had second and third ranks earlier, we’re scoring first ranks for the first time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-13-students-score-625-out-of-625-in-chikkaballapura-school/articleshow/85197551.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Goa||Avoid celebrations, cautions govt||PANAJI: Although Covid-19 cases are low, state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar had cautioned of a possible rise if people stop observing Covid-appropriate behaviour. He even advised against holding and attending family-related gatherings. “What will trouble us are gatherings — especially the celebratory kind — where you wish others, shake hands and hug, like birthday parties and weddings. We must stay away from these at least for a while longer,” he said, delivering his keynote address at the World Tribal Day programme, in Margao. Despite Goa seeing an average of 100 new infections, it’s not yet time to give up Covid-appropriate behaviour, he said. “We have to continue because if we look back at February 2021, we had come down to 30 cases per day with nil deaths. It took us a month’s time to touch 1,000 cases and another 15 days to cross 4,000 new infections each day. Deaths even crossed 70,” Betodkar said. The state epidemiologist advised people not to stay in denial whenever they experience symptoms or came in contact with a positive person or had a doubt that they could be Covid-19 positive. “Please test as soon as you can,” he said. “I don’t’ think we will have another wave with the Delta variant unless we have a new mutation. If not, we will have a mild wave in September only if we continue with all Covid appropriate behaviour,” Betodkar said, adding that the Delta variant was responsible for the second wave. Although outbreaks started in urban areas — Margao, Panaji, Ponda, Vasco — it didn’t take long for them to spread to villages. It is possible we will have to live with Covid as the new normal, just as we do with malaria and dengue, Betodkar said. The state is well prepared to tackle a third wave with adequate beds and paediatric beds he said, adding that each one has a responsibility to prevent a third wave and not only the government. “The entire pandemic cannot be taken care of by the government. We all have to do our part,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/avoid-celebrations-cautions-govt/articleshow/85193256.cms||---

Even with the addition of cases from these states, it is unlikely that the case count will cross 28,859, which makes the day’s count the lowest since March 16. The dip in cases is most likely linked with lower testing on the weekends. Even when compared with the cases reported on the same day last week, nearly all states reported a decline. Compared to last Monday, cases declined by 935 in Kerala, while the dip was 364 for Maharashtra. Similarly, cases declined by over a 100 in Meghalaya, Mizoram, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The only state that reported a significant rise in cases is Himachal Pradesh, where the count rose by almost 100 as compared to last week. Among states, Kerala led the list on Monday with 13,049 cases, followed by Maharashtra (4,505). Apart from these two, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka were the only other states that reported over a 1,000 fresh cases. The count was between 500 to 1000 for West Bengal and Odisha while Manipur, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Jammu & Kashmir reported between 100 to 500 cases. The country reported 300 covid deaths on Monday, of which 105 were reported from Kerala, while the toll was 68, 24 and 23 for Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu respectively.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Agriculture sector is growing, but at a snail’s pace||CHENNAI: Even as the state finances went through rough weather for more than a decade, agricultural sector provided some saving grace, registering steady growth in the past 15 years, but it is nothing great to rejoice, says the white paper on state finances released by finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Monday. He went on to say that industrial growth rate dipped between 2011 and 2016 and later climbed in the past five years. Services sector, on the other hand, has been steadily declining from 11.23% to 7.44% and later to 6.03%. The sectoral growth pattern reveals that overall, the services and secondary sectors recorded higher growth rates than the primary sector. Between 2006-2007 and 2010-2011, agriculture sector grew at 4.07% per annum, whereas in the next five years it grew at 5.24%. The growth rate increased to 5.86% in the past five years. Still, given that the primary sector continues to provide bulk of the employment, unless policy correctives are introduced, growth in TN would not be inclusive, he said. The sharpest decline in the annual growth rate was in the industrial sector. The average annual growth rate dropped from 10.30% in 2006-11 to 5.49% in the period 2011-16 before accelerating to 8.17% in the next five years. The services sector, likewise, decelerated sharply from a 11.23% growth in the period from 2006--11 to 7.44% in 2011-16 and further to 6.03% in the period 2016-20. Slowdown in the performance of industrial and services sectors in recent years is an area of concern. This skewed pattern of growth has meant that the two larger sectors of the economy failed to fire and grow rapidly enough. It also implies that TN could lose ground to other major states unless the trends are quickly reversed. The share of Tamil Nadu’s agricultural sector in the gross state domestic product (GSDP) was 23% in 1981-1993. It declined to 11.87% in 2004-2005 and further to 7.76% in 2013-14. But employment in the sector reduced by only 10% - from 54% to 44% between 1981 and 2010. Even today, 42% of TN’s workers are either farmers or farm workers. In rural areas, more than 58% of households depend on agriculture for livelihood. The NSSO data survey (2011-2012) says more than 20% of TN farmers live below the poverty line. Between 2011 and 2013, the gross area sown reduced by 12.7%, says a recent Nabard report. Lack of proper understanding of the agricultural and horticultural sectors and reluctance on the part of the government to look at long-term solutions are reasons for farmers’ sufferings, experts feel. It should first create infrastructure to store excess run-off into the sea. Tamil Nadu rivers, water experts estimate, waste more than 700tmcft of water as run-off every year. One tmcft of water, at present, helps the state cultivate 2,000 hectares of land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-agriculture-sector-is-growing-but-at-a-snails-pace/articleshow/85197561.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Tripura attack on Abhishek on Amit Shah’s orders, says West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday alleged it was on Union home minister Amit Shah’s instructions that Trinamool national general-secretary and MP Abhishek Banerjee and other party functionaries were attacked in Tripura, adding that Abhishek’s life was in danger. After meeting injured party workers Sudip Raha and Jaya Dutta at SSKM Hospital, she believed the Tripura CM “would not have dared to do such things on his own,” adding she refused to be cowed down by the attacks. Referring to the attack on Abhishek’s convoy last Monday, she said he got saved because he was in a bulletproof car. “Otherwise, his head would have been smashed in the attack,” she said, alleging that Abhishek was trailed by five “goondas” when he flies. “They are even sending instructions not to issue tickets to Abhishek whenever he plans to fly, and not to give him helicopters on hire to him,” she added. The two injured TMC youth leaders were ferried to SSKM’s Woodburn ward on Sunday night after Saturday’s attack after being flown into Kolkata by Abhishek. “I condemn the way the Trinamool youth leaders had been treated in Tripura,” the CM said. “Sudip, a Presidency University student, has head injuries and Jaya’s face has swollen from shrapnel injury. She is a CU student. The student community should protest this. Stones were pelted at them, shots were fired and their cars ransacked. All this happened in front of the police.... They were not provided any treatment, not even given a glass of water to drink. Even Trinamool leaders who went to the police station were not given any water to drink. They were beaten and arrested. This is a draconian regime in Tripura.” The CM said that even after the 12 TMC functionaries were granted bail, there was an attempt to “involve them in fresh cases.” Education and law minister of Tripura Ratan Lal Nath rejected the allegations outright and accused TMC of conspiring to disturb the state’s law and order. “Trinamool’s conspiracy is premised on its agenda to fetch 6% votes to seek the tag of a national party from being a regional one,” Nath said. He accused TMC of not speaking anything against the Left government. “Today, when the BJP is in power, the TMC has conspired to create turmoil in the state and help the Left parties so that they return to power. The language and behaviour of the TMC leaders is against the ethics of democracy,” he said. The Bengal CM said that Tripura and Bengal “were not different,” adding, “People of Tripura come to Bengal for treatment and we provide all kinds of help. We love Tripura and the people of Tripura will protest this attack. “Neither the media, nor Tripura government employees are allowed to speak. We will win in Tripura soon.” Trinamool MPs staged a protest at the foot of the Gandhi statue in the Parliament complex in Delhi to protest against the attack on their functionaries. Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay said democracy had been murdered in Tripura. Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said: “We are protesting inside Parliament and outside to protest against the fascist attack. We will again increase our activities in Tripura. If we are attacked, we will demonstrate democratically.” Bengal BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya, in response, said: “The BJP doesn’t lack political acumen that it would attack a non-entity like TMC to give it importance in Tripura politics.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tripura-attack-on-abhishek-on-shahs-orders-says-mamata/articleshow/85194907.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘No nod’: Cops halt BJP’s torch rallies||Kolkata: The state BJP unit’s “save Bengal” campaign hit a roadblock on its very first day on Monday as police stopped party leaders and workers in Kolkata from conducting rallies. At least 17 party workers were arrested after they tried to proceed despite the police stopping them. BJP’s eight-day campaign against the state government started with party workers holding torch rallies. In Kolkata, party workers led by Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar started from the Muralidhar Sen Lane office. The rally was stopped by police for not having required permission. A scuffle between cops and BJP workers ensued when the latter tried to break the barricade. BJP workers then sat on a dharna on the road. BJP leader Meena Devi Purohit, who was present at the Muralidhar Sen Lane rally, said: “We wanted to conduct the agitation programme peacefully. Every political party in the country has the right to take out rallies. What they did today was undemocratic.” Majumdar said: “A total of 180 persons died of post-poll violence in Bengal and this situation cannot be compared with any other state. Ironically, they are trying to compare the situation with Tripura. Our workers have taken out rallies protesting against post-poll violence and mismanagement in vaccination.” Police arrested seven persons in north Kolkata for violating Covid norms and blocking the road. In south Kolkata’s Bhowanipore, 10 were arrested after they tried to hold a torch rally. “They are attacking Abhishek Banerjee’s convoy in Tripura and taking out rallies in Kolkata. West Bengal got saved after people defeated them,” Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim said. In Siliguri, Bengal BJP vice-president Raju Banerjee was arrested after the party attempted to take out a rally. The state party unit’s general secretary, Sayantan Basu, led a rally in Howrah while vice-president Pratap Banerjee led a Malda rally. Meanwhile, leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari attended two programmes to commemorate World Tribal Day. “The central government is trying to open one Ekalavya School in each district in West Bengal. Trinamool workers, on the other hand, are killing our brothers like Kishor Mandi. None of the assailants have been arrested so far,” Adhikari said at an event at Jamboni in Jhargram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-nod-cops-halt-bjps-torch-rallies/articleshow/85195037.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Vaccine trial participants in Kolkata set to get CoWin certificates or real jabs||KOLKATA: Volunteers who were part of two clinical trials of Covid vaccines in the city — starting December 2020 — will finally start receiving either CoWin-generated vaccine certificates or vaccine shots, depending on whether they had received real shots or placebos during trials. The trials on around 1,100 participants were “double-blinded”, which means they were — in accordance with global standard testing practice — kept in the dark about whether they had received actual vaccines or placebos. Later, those who received actual vaccines received certificates from the respective institutes, in the “unblinding” process. The problem was, while CoWin-generated vaccination certificates have become mandatory for several outdoor activities, the trial certificates are not. Two weeks ago, the Union health ministry had asked the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to compile the data of unblinded participants. But even though the process — to either give out real vaccines or certificates to trial participants — has been started, several participants feel let down. In the absence of a certificate, something as simple as entering a park is impossible, let alone air travel. “People like me rushed in to participate in the trial so that scientists could assess the efficacy and safety of vaccines,” said Saptarshi Bhose, a credit risk management professional. “I am happy I did it. But why couldn’t a system be developed for faster certification, since it has become mandatory for entering public places?” Bhose, along with his wife Rai, had participated in the phase-III clinical trial of Covaxin at Kolkata’s NICED that began in December 2020. In the unblinding process, Saptarshi was informed that he got both doses of the real vaccine, but Rai had been given a placebo. Soumya Sarathi Ganguly, a student of chemical and molecular biology at IIT Kharagpur, said it was frustrating because vaccination certificates are mandatory for entering public places. “I just have a certificate from the hospital, saying I participated in the clinical trial, which people would not recognise,” he told TOI. Ganguly participated in the Sputnik V trial at Peerlesss Hospital. Senior clinical trial specialist Santanu Tripathi said he hoped a way would soon be found to expedite the process. “We are getting a lot of anxious calls from our trial volunteers, some of whom need to travel abroad. We should recognize their gesture and ensure that they get their rightful vaccination certificate within a stipulated time,” said Peerlesss Hospital clinical research and academics director Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, who was the principal investigator for the Sputnik V trial. The Union health ministry had earlier said that physical certificates provided by trial-conducting hospitals would suffice. The ministry will now provide a template to ICMR for compiling vaccination data for unblinded participants. This data is expected to be captured in CoWin for generating vaccination certificates. “I am hopeful of ICMR coming out with something definite soon. By the time the clinical trial in which I am participating gets over, a system should be in place,” said Suman Das, a participant of a vaccine trial currently underway in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-trial-participants-in-kol-set-to-get-cowin-certs-or-real-jabs/articleshow/85194966.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Bengaluru||Slight rise in Covid cases in Karnataka over two consecutive weeks||BENGALURU: After having consistently and significantly decreased for 11 straight weeks, fresh Covid-19 cases are beginning to see an increase in Karnataka, albeit only slightly. Week-on-week data for deaths shows the numbers are stable, but as has been witnessed in the past, deaths only increase a couple of weeks after a rise in cases are reported. And, as the state prepares for another wave of infections that some experts say is imminent, the change in weekly pattern comes as an early warning. However, the third wave is widely expected to be less severe than the deadly second wave that swept through Karnataka in April and May. Analysis of data for the past 13 weeks from May 9 to August 7 shows weekly cases have increased by around 2% in each of the past two weeks compared to the weeks preceding them. This is after a consistent dip in cases since the week ending May 8. While the first week of August saw 11,803 cases, the week before that had registered 11,568 cases, an increase from 11,317 cases between July 18 and 24. In the same period, the state reported 211, 210 and 231 deaths, respectively. With more than 29 lakh cases and nearly 37,000 deaths, Karnataka has the third highest number of infections and second highest number of deaths in the country. Government officials pointed out that one reason for the increase in weekly cases could be the spillover from neighbouring states, especially with travel restrictions being lifted. Health commissioner Dr KV Trilok Chandra, said the government has been responding adequately to the situation on the ground, as reflected in measures put in place, especially in border districts. V Ravi, senior virologist and member of the state’s Covid Technical Advisory Committee, said: “There’s nothing alarming until such time when cases start to double. That said, we cannot ignore the increasing cases, which is why we advised restrictions in border districts. That will be reviewed again at the end of the week based on the ground situation.” Chandra added that vaccination has been increased in villages and towns within 10km of borders with Kerala and Maharashtra and that the overall inoculation drive in the state has also been progressing well. Aside from restrictions, the government, as part of its strategy to contain the spread, has also been testing aggressively, although some states/UTs like Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir are doing more tests per million than Karnataka. Between August 1 and 8, the state conducted 2,232 tests per million daily on an average with more than 11.9 lakh tests being carried out during this period. While this compares much better than the monthly average tests done in July, June and May, it has to be seen if the state can continue testing as many people every day for the rest of August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/slight-rise-in-covid-cases-in-karnataka-over-two-consecutive-weeks/articleshow/85197590.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||India||Teachers plant paddy, send farmers for jabs||JABALPUR: Vaccine ke liye kuchh bhi karega. Schoolteachers roped in by the Madhya Pradesh health department to motivate people to take the jab transplanted paddy for farmers and farm labourers in Dindori district after the beneficiaries said they would be able to go to the vaccine centre only after they are done with their work. The seedlings of hope were transplanted at Manikpur village in Shahpur, 380km east of Bhopal, on August 7. The teachers, doing their usual get-the-vaccine rounds, arrived at a vaccination booth in the village to find it empty. According to their records, at least 33 people were due for their second dose and there were many others who needed to be motivated to take their first shot. “Till 1pm, there was no vaccination. We got worried. We then found that everyone was in the paddy fields,” said primary teacher G R Jharia. The teachers rolled up their trousers and salwars and walked into the muddy fields to talk to the farmers. “We tried to convince them that they should get themselves vaccinated. They said they could get the vaccine some other day, but the season won’t wait. The weather is favourable now for transplantation. If it changes, their crop will be ruined,” Jharia added. It was a compelling argument. Most of the teachers grew up in villages and knew exactly why the farmers were willing to risk Covid in their race to catch the clouds. They had a quick discussion on the ‘bund’ and decided to trade places. “We proposed that we, teachers, would work in the fields while they went to get themselves vaccinated. We immediately began helping the farmers,” he said. By evening, all 33 farmers had got their second dose, and the field ‘lesson’ had got to those yet to take the shot. Chief medical and health officer Ramesh Marawi lauded the teachers and said: “This is sowing season, so our teams are doing everything they can to get people vaccinated, like reaching villages before people leave for their farms, or waiting for them to return from the fields to get the jabs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/teachers-plant-paddy-send-farmers-for-jabs/articleshow/85197607.cms||Siddharth Pandey
---||Kolkata||BJP man’s wife gang-raped in Howrah; law will take its course, says TMC||HOWRAH: Two among five persons accused of raping the wife of a BJP supporter at Bainan village in Howrah’s Amta on Saturday were arrested on Sunday night. The 34-year-old woman, who is speech impaired, is being treated at Uluberia subdivisional hospital. The gang leaders — Qutubuddin Mullick and Debashis Rana — allegedly owe allegiance to the ruling Trinamool Congress. State minister and Howrah district Trinamool president Arup Ray neither denied nor confirmed the gang rape allegation or the allegiance of the accused, but said the administration was looking into the incident. “Such an incident, if true, will be dealt with strongly. The law will take its own course and the guilty will not be spared. That said, the BJP has the habit of making baseless allegations. We hope it acts as strongly in states governed by it,” Ray said. The FIR says the attack happened when the woman — who lost her ability to speak three months ago following a cerebral stroke — was at home with her minor son and her husband was away in Kolkata. Mullick, alleged to be the Trinamool’s area president, and “TMC worker” Rana, along with three others, barged in when she answered a knock on the door around midnight. The son woke up on Sunday morning to find her tied up near his father’s bike. He phoned his father who in turn informed the police. “Trinamool leaders Qutubuddin Mullick, his brother Joynal and Debashis Rana masterminded the attack on my wife while I was away from home,” the complainant said, adding that his family had been a target since the BJP got a lead at Bainan booth during the assembly polls. “It is a political vendetta. We are not safe.” Police confirmed the two arrests and said the accused had been remanded in their custody for six days. Cops have sought a medical report of the woman and will “record statements of persons acquainted with the case”. Bengal BJP leaders, meanwhile, took to Twitter to highlight “the atrocities on women” in the state. “Khela hocche (the game is on). TMC is playing with the pride of women! Woman gang-raped because she was supporting the opposition party! This is how women and democracy suffers under the TMC rule. Is this the fate of Bengal?” read a tweet.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru sees 47% increase in containment zones in past 10 days||BENGALURU: Karnataka’s capital has seen a sharp rise in the number of containment zones (MCZs) in the past 10 days. On July 29, the city had 108 micro containment zones, but that figure rose to 159 — a 47% rise — by August 8. Mahadevapura zone alone has 42 active MCZs, the highest, followed by east (35), Bommanahalli (24) and south and Yelahanka (20 each). While west zone has nine MCZs, Rajarajeshwari Nagar has the least at six. But Gaurav Gupta, BBMP chief commissioner, said the number of containment zones should not be a cause of concern as they are like watchtowers or surveillance points. “What matters is the total number of cases. That’s what we need to be vigilant about,” he said. Randeep D, special commissioner (health), BBMP, attributed the huge number of MCZs in Mahadevapura to its floating population. On the steady increase in the number of MCZs, Randeep said it is because reporting and tracking has vastly improved. “Since we have transparently begun declaring containment zones on public forums, people are cautious,” he said. BBMP authorities say post Unlock, people are commuting from one city to another and congregations are taking place. “In most positive cases we have seen since June, the severity of infection is less which could be due to vaccine. Vaccination status among people who test positive is being collated,” said BBMP officials. Dr BK Vijendra, chief health officer, BBMP, said a majority of people testing positive have travel history. “They are not necessarily from Kerala and Maharashtra but from other states too. If three persons test positive from a small place, say a building, we declare it a containment zone to prevent transmission,” said Dr Vijendra. Daily cases in Bengaluru have been hovering around the 300-500 mark. “We don’t expect a significant reduction in cases in view of lockdown restrictions being lifted and interstate travel being permitted,” said Randeep. While the test positivity rate in the state was 1.3% from August 1 to 7, in Bengaluru Urban district inclusive of BBMP, it was 0.8 %. The highest test positivity rate was in Dakshina Kannada with 5.2 %. “Although cases in Bengaluru are not decreasing, the situation in the city is not like that of Dakshina Kannada where a surge is being seen,” said Dr Vijendra. Health department to vaccinate parents of class 9 & 10 students on priority:Ahead of reopening schools for classes 9 and 10, the state health and family department has prioritized Covid-19 vaccination for parents and guardians of these students. The department has also sought data of students’ parents who have already taken the shot. In a circular issued on Monday, Jawaid Akhtar, additional principal secretary, health and family welfare department, directed all districts to provide a list of parents of students in classes 9 and 10 in schools in their jurisdiction who have been vaccinated. District administrations have been instructed to collect the data through the education department. If parents are not vaccinated as yet, measures must to be taken to innoculate them at the earliest, the circular read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-sees-47-increase-in-containment-zones-in-past-10-days/articleshow/85197665.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, the farm front which is speaheading protests against the three agro-market laws passed last year, also observed the 78th anniversary of Quit India Movement. The protesters sad they were observing the anniversary as an “anti-imperial forces day”. The Kisan Sansad was manned by women on the last day. Before ending the sansad, protesters passed a self-styled no-confidence motion against Narendra Modi government. They had moved the motion last Friday. Kisan Sansad held 13 sittings, including two by women, from July 22. Debates were organised for 78 hours and 60 amendments were made on issues related to agriculture. “Kisan Sansad has showcased farmers’ discipline and how well-versed they are about the farm laws; now, central ministers must not ask what is black in these laws as farmers have debated it point by point, clause by clause and pointed out the shortcomings in the laws and how these are anti-farmer, anti-people,” said woman protester Amrit Kaur from Punjab farm group BKU (Sidhupur). It was stated that it was the impact of peoples’ whip issued by Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) to MPs from opposition parties that the Parliament was not allowed to function since July 19, but in comparison farmers ran its parliament smoothly. The protesting farmers now have decided to observe Independence Day on August 15 as Azadi Sangram Diwas across the country, said SKM. Farmers will not move towards Delhi on that day, but will put up the Tricolour on their tractors, bikes and will remember the sacrifices made by freedom fighters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/kisan-sansad-concludes-with-no-trust-motion-against-centre/articleshow/85195464.cms||---
---||India||‘Sea levels in Asia have risen faster than global average’||Senior scientist from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and one of the lead authors of the IPCC sixth assessment report (AR6), Swapna Panickal, explained to Vishwa Mohan the findings and their implications for India. Excerpts from the interview:What are the key messages of the report?• It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change, making extreme climate events, including heat waves, heavy rainfall, and droughts, more frequent and severe. The report provides new estimates of the chances of crossing the global warming level of 1.5°C in the next (two) decades, and finds that unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, limiting warming to close to 1.5°C or even 2°C will be beyond reach. What kind of climatic conditions this report could foresee for India in particular and south Asia in general?• Heat extremes have increased while cold extremes have decreased (compared to 1850-1900 over the Asian region), and these trends will continue (in south Asia, including India) over the coming decades. Both annual and summer monsoon precipitation will increase, with enhanced interannual variability. The surface of the Indian Ocean has warmed faster than the global average.As a result, the relative sea level will continue to rise in this century. Sea levels around Asia have risen faster than the global average, with coastal area loss and shoreline retreat. What kind of messages do the authors of this report would like to convey to the countries ahead of COP26?• Climate change is already affecting every region on Earth, in multiple ways. The changes we experience will increase with further warming. There’s no going back from some changes in the climate system. However, some changes could be slowed and others could be stopped by limiting warming. To limit global warming, strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in GHG are necessary. This would not only reduce the consequences of climate change but also improve air quality. How far has the Indian model helped the scientists reach any conclusions?• A major highlight from India comes from the inclusion of the IITM Earth System Model (IITM-ESM) climate projections in the IPCC AR6 report — the first from India. The climate model projections from IITM-ESM are used along with other models for the assessment of climate change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sea-levels-in-asia-have-risen-faster-than-global-average/articleshow/85197306.cms||Vishwa Mohan

He asked Charuni not to be “part of the conspiracy hatched by the Badals.” He went on to give a religious angle to the issue. Daduwal released a video, in which he said, “I want to say to Gurnam Singh Charuni not to be a person who works on the directions of the Badals. As he is struggling for farmers in Kisan Morcha, I respect him (Charuni) and I also respect him for his seniority in age. Badals wanted to stop my way of dharam prachar as the way Haryana Committee (HSGMC) is working in Haryana.” He added, “Badals’ men found a new man, Gurnam Singh Charuni, who is threatening to stop our gurdwara management and works of dharam prachar and boycott. If Charuni has any misunderstanding, he can talk to me or let me know. I can also visit him for a discussion.” Talking about the cases registered against farmers during protests against the three agri-marketing laws, Daduwal said, “All the cases registered against the farmers in Haryana should be cancelled by Haryana and the Centre governments.” He also advised Charuni to speak with restraint. “He should take care of his words while making statements as a responsible person who is leading a sangharsh (agitation) and speak very responsibly. He should refrain from making statements after getting misled by the Badals.” On Sunday, Charuni had asked Baljit Singh Daduwal to apologise within seven days or face a boycott. On July 31, farmers opposed BJP leader Vijay Sampla in Sirsa when he was going to meet Daduwal at Dadu village in Sirsa. Later, Sirsa police booked about 700 people, including farmers at Kalanwali police station. Sources said that BKU Haryana (Charuni) was seeing Daduwal as colluding with BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/daduwal-asks-charuni-not-to-be-part-of-badal-conspiracy/articleshow/85195477.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Pay more if you use more to drag state out of red||CHENNAI: Property owners, large consumers of water and electricity as well as those planning to buy high-end automobiles and two-wheelers should get ready to pay more and help the state to pull itself out of the high debt burden. Simply put, every citizen of the state has Rs 70,000 hanging over his/her head as their share of the state’s debt and it is Rs 2.64 lakh for every family. Presenting the white paper on state’s finance in Chennai on Monday, finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan dropped sufficient hints on the need to distinguish between the rich and the poor, high-end and low-end consumers. On Friday, he will present the state’s revised budget, the first by the recently elected DMK government, and it could hold clues to what the government plans to do. On Monday, Thiaga Rajan said the motor vehicle tax in Tamil Nadu had not been revised in the past 15 years and the average revenue from a vehicle in the state is substantially lower than in Karnataka and Kerala. The rationalization of electricity tax is also overdue, he said. The deteriorating financial situation of the PSUs has resulted in them no longer being able to borrow funds without a state guarantee. With the accumulated debt of the power sector and transport sector PSUs alone at close to ₹2 lakh crore, there is urgent need to revise tariffs. At least for large consumers, if not for all. “We have to ensure the needy get their essential commodities. But there is a lack of mechanism to prevent the rich from getting the same benefits. When this government paid ₹4,000 as Covid aid to the rice card holders, I am sure even the rich or those who did not need that also benefited, while some got diverted. It is high time we adopted a data-based approach to fine tune deliveries to the targeted segments,” he said. The state power utility’s average cost of supply works out to ₹9.06 per unit, whereas the average rate of realization is ₹6.7 per unit in 2020-21, leaving a shortfall of ₹2.36 per unit. High cost power purchases and lack of progress in own generation units in the past decade have pushed up the cost of power. While Tangedco’s share in supply to industries has declined, the higher power tariff makes the state uncompetitive. While the TWAD Board’s operational costs are ₹20.81 per kl, it recovers just ₹10.42 from urban local bodies and ₹8.11 from rural local bodies. The operational cost of CMWSSB is around ₹36.58 per kl, while the cost recovery is only ₹14.08 per kl. “Such operating losses are neither sustainable nor effective in terms of aiding social justice and inclusive growth, due to leakages, misdirection and/or misappropriation,” the minister said. Pointing out that the property taxes have not been revisited since 2008, he wondered at the rationale behind the approach to uniformly tax someone who lives in a prime residential area in the city and a lower income family living in elsewhere in a small tenement. “Some of the corrective measures which need to be taken are well known. For further measures, the process of consulting experts and stakeholders is already ongoing,” Thiaga Rajan said, while citing the case of the recently formed Chief Minister’s Global Economic Advisory Council.

Air Water had acquired the stake from promoters in 2013. The promoters of Ellenbarrie though did not disclose the deal valuation but there was an indication that it was not less than the enterprise value of Rs 360 crore at which the deal was struck in 2013 between Ellenbarrie promoters and Air Water in 2013. After the buy back, promoters will have 99% stake in the company while the rest 1% would be with public. “Ellenbarrie Industrial Gases is now the largest 100% Indian-owned industrial and medical gas company, in a space dominated by multinational companies. With the onset of COVID 19, we have quickly repositioned ourselves not only in terms of enhancing capabilities in terms of Medical Oxygen, but also providing solutions in terms of Centralised Gas pipeline Systems and hospital equipment critical to Covid treatment,” said Varun Agarwal, executive director, Ellenbarrie Industrial Gases. The company now has a revenue of over Rs 250 crore. According to him, the company also commenced work on a major expansion of 600 MT per day at an investment of Rs 250 crore located in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh. This plant is expected to go online in the second half of 2022 and will cater to its growing clientele in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. The company has further increased its manufacturing portfolio by adding a high-purity Hydrogen plant in Uluberia, West Bengal. After the AP plant, the company will have capacity of 1,200 tonne per day. Currently, it has a capacity of 600 TPD with 300 TPD capacity in Bengal. Earlier, in 2013, the Agarwala family had sold 51% stake to Air Water Inc. and this buyback marks an exit of the Japanese company from Ellenbarrie. Ellenbarrie has retired all its borrowings and remains a debt-free company with production facilities at Kalyani, Uluberia, Kharagpur and Panagarh in West Bengal and Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad in South India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ellenbarrie-promoters-buy-back-51-cos-stake-from-air-water/articleshow/85191958.cms||---

The PM said the amount disbursed on Monday would help farmers in the ongoing sowing season and elaborated on how the corpus of Rs one lakh crore for the agriculture infrastructure fund would help in creating a suitable ecosystem of growth in the farm sector. Noting that his government has made the “biggest ever purchase” from farmers at minimum support price (MSP), he said in an address through video-conferencing: “With this, about Rs 1,70,000 crore have reached directly into the accounts of rice farmers and about Rs 85,000 crore have gone directly into the account of wheat farmers.” He also said India has reached among the top-10 countries of the world in terms of agricultural exports. Mentioning that he urged the farmers to increase the production of pulses due to shortage a few years ago, the Prime Minister said that as a result, there has been an increase of almost 50% in the production of pulses in the country in the last 6 years. Under the PM-Kisan scheme, a financial benefit of Rs 6,000 per year is provided to the eligible beneficiary farmer families in three equal instalments of Rs 2,000 each. The fund is transferred directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. So far, Rs 1.38 lakh crore have been transferred to farmer families since the launch of the scheme in February, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/small-farmers-top-priority-says-pm-transfers-rs-19-5k-cr/articleshow/85197752.cms||---

The DGP and another superintendent of police-rank officer appeared before the Villupuram chief judicial magistrate S Gopinathan on Monday to receive copies of the 400-word chargesheet. As counsel appearing of the officers sought time to study the chargesheet, the judge posted the case to August 16 for further hearing. The magistrate asked the two officers to appear before the court without fail for the next hearing. Madras high court has directed the CJM court to conclude the trial by December 20 this year. The chief judicial magistrate had on August 3 summoned the two officers, both under suspension following the sexual harassment complaint, to appear before him on Monday. The CB-CID police is probing the sexual harassment case initiated by a woman IPS officer against the then special DGP, who allegedly harassed her during the then chief minister’s visit to Pudukottai in March. The woman officer lodged a separate complaint to the then DGP JK Tripathy and demanded legal action against the two officers – the then special DGP for harassment, and the suspended SP for having tried to stop her from proceeding to Chennai and lodge complaint with the head of police force. The CB-CID filed the charge sheet before the magistrate court on July 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chargesheet-in-tamil-nadu-ips-officer-sexual-harassment-case/articleshow/85197756.cms||---

An applicant making a request for information shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the information or any other personal details except those that may be necessary for contacting him,” the commission has held. The commission held that the Haryana government nowhere made it mandatory till date that the provisions included in the rules notified in 2021 that to have information under RTI, one has to use the Form A performa and submit identity card and to give any other details as mentioned in the Form A. “The Form A given in Haryana Right to Information Rules, 2009 is substituted in the Haryana Right to Information (Amendment) Rules, 2021 and this Form A is a preferable proforma as per the rules notified in the year 2009 and the same is not made mandatory in the rules amended in the year 2021. Hence it is purely on the wish of a RTI applicant, whether to use the said Form A or not and whether to give an identity card or not,” held the SIC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-authority-can-force-rti-applicant-to-submit-id-panel/articleshow/85197760.cms||---

Though Singh did not name any discom, he was clearly referring to the Sanjeev Goenka group company CESC that has a monopoly on distribution in Kolkata. “Licence Raj has to go (in distribution) so that investors can come in. If no investment comes then we will be left in darkness. Why should consumers be denied the benefit of competition,” the minister said but emphasised that he was “aware” of the letter but had not seen it since it was addressed to the PM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/didi-opposing-power-bill-to-aid-pvt-firm-mantri/articleshow/85197788.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu set to add 1,650 MBBS seats in govt colleges||CHENNAI: The National Medical Commission has completed inspections in four of the 11 new medical colleges in the past 10 days, health minister Ma Subramanian said on Monday. Tamil Nadu will add 1,650 seats to the undergraduate seat matrix taking the tally to 5,200 MBBS seats across government medical colleges in the state if all 11 colleges get the sanction from the apex medical body. The committee completed its surprise inspection in Namakkal, Krishnagiri, Tiruppur and Dindigul and has made no adverse comment so far. “We are waiting for them to visit the remaining seven colleges within the next few days. These are surprise visits, so we don’t have any timelines,” he said. The panel of inspectors appointed by the apex medical body verifies the infrastructure and human resource facility required to admit students for the first year MBBS course in these newly-constructed colleges. The anatomy, physiology and biochemistry labs, library, hostels – required for first year students – are nearing completion, said director of medical education Dr Narayanababu R. The state has set aside nearly Rs 4,000 crore for construction of these buildings. With this most districts in the state will have at least one government medical college. Besides increasing the number of seats, these colleges will help us expand tertiary care to districts. The new medical colleges will help the health department provide quality training at an affordable cost and offer specialty and super specialty care to people living in the area free of cost. Most of these colleges will have 700-750 bed hospitals attached to these colleges that have all the facilities to offer quality care. “But these units don’t have the experience of facing an inspection,” he said. “Over the past few weeks, we asked existing medical colleges to mentor new colleges. For instance, a team from Salem Medical College trained doctors at the Namakkal medical colleges in carrying out paperwork. They conducted mock inspections to find faults and rectify errors,” Dr Narayanababu said. As part of the national mission to increase the number of medical colleges across the country, the Centre granted permission to TN for commencement of 11 new medical colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-set-to-add-1650-mbbs-seats-in-govt-colleges/articleshow/85193091.cms||---
---||India||Climate report a ‘clarion call’ for rich nations to cut emissions: India||NEW DELHI: With the IPCC report noting for urgent need to take more sustained action to save the world from the climate crisis, India on Monday termed its findings a “clarion call for the developed countries”, asking rich nations to go for immediate deep emission cuts, considering how their cumulative emissions have pushed the world to the current crisis. “The report reaffirms India’s position that historical cumulative emissions are the source of the current climate crisis,” said environment minister Bhupender Yadav while articulating the country’s position and response to the IPCC’s scientific findings. Underlining that India’s cumulative and per capita emissions are significantly low and far less than the fair share of global carbon budget, Yadav said, “The report is a clarion call for the developed countries to undertake deep emission cuts and decarbonisation of their economies.” His remarks assume significance in view of a global pitch from various stakeholders, including rich nations, to bring India along with China and others on a ‘net-zero’ emission trajectory sooner than later even as the country time and again reminded them of its track record of fulfilling all promises of climate actions under the Paris Agreement. Referring to the report, India in a statement flagged how developed countries have, in fact, usurped far more than their fair share of the global carbon budget. Noting that merely “reaching net-zero alone is not enough”, India said, “This has been amply borne out in the report. It vindicates India’s position that historical cumulative emissions are the source of the climate crisis that the world faces today.” The report noted that carbon dioxide has been and will continue to be the key cause of global warming under all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/climate-report-a-clarion-call-for-rich-nations-to-cut-emissions-india/articleshow/85197807.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Business||Amazon to end JV with Narayana Murthy's Catamaran||BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: Amazon India and the parent company of Cloudtail, the largest seller on the Amazon.in platform, will not continue with their seven-year-old joint venture when it comes up for renewal in May next year. The announcement by the US e-commerce giant came hours after the Supreme Court on Monday refused to halt antitrust probes against the country’s largest e-commerce players, Amazon and Flipkart. Cloudtail’s parent, Prione Business Services, is jointly owned by Catamaran, led by Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy and Amazon. Catamaran, which originally held 51% in the JV, raised its stake to 76% in 2019 following the government’s Press Note 2 notification a year earlier. The provisions in the note prohibited online marketplaces such as Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon from allowing their group companies to sell on the platforms. “The two partners today announced they have mutually decided to not continue their joint venture beyond the end of its current term,” Amazon and Catamaran said in a joint statement. Press Note 2 followed allegations by local trade bodies that large company-owned sellers on the ecommerce platforms - such as Cloudtail on Amazon and WS Retail on Flipkart - indulged in deep discounting and did a lion’s share of the business, while smaller sellers were becoming the victims of such anti-competitive practices. Last year, the country’s antitrust watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), also ordered a probe against Amazon and Flipkart, acting on complaints by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, a body representing small sellers. The companies moved the Supreme Court against the CCI probe, denying any wrongdoing. Amazon’s move to end its partnership with Catamaran comes as the industry grapples with tougher draft e-commerce rules released by the consumer affairs ministry in June that seek to regulate flash sales and rein in errant online marketplaces from manipulating search results on their platforms to promote certain sellers. Amazon, which has stakes in other vendors on its platform such as Appario Retail, a JV with the Patni Group, did not disclose the reason for its ending the partnership with Catamaran. Praveen Khandelwal, spokesperson for traders' body Confederation of All India Traders, however, said, “It is now a cover-up exercise by Mr Murthy. The fact that Amazon is violating the law and FDI policy through Cloudtail must have been known to Mr Murthy long before or even at the time of entering into an agreement with Amazon.” Cloudtail reported a 27.7% increase in its revenue to Rs 11,413 crore in 2020-21, compared to Rs 8,945 crore in the year before. Cloudtail paid about 9% (Rs 980 crore) of its revenue as a platform selling fee for the year ended March 2020, and about 4% in the year ended March 2018. While the jump in commission is significant, it is still less than the average commission of around 25% which independent third-party sellers pay to sell goods on the platform. Amit Agarwal, global senior VP and country head - Amazon India, said, “Amazon and Catamaran entered into a JV in the early days of e-commerce in India with a shared vision of transforming hundreds of thousands of small businesses in a fast-changing digital world, by providing online capabilities enabling them to access customers both in India and globally. We are humbled by how the JV exceeded its vision, helping online commerce evolve through the unrelenting efforts of hundreds of its employees, positively impacting over 4.3 million small businesses, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and contributing to India’s digital economy." M D Ranganath, president of Catamaran, said, “We are happy that Prione has leveraged global best practices for e-commerce in India, created jobs, and provided millions of Indian customers access to a wide selection of products from across the country by leveraging technology. As our JV with Amazon reaches the end of its tenure, I reflect on this successful partnership that introduced the power of digitisation and empowered hundreds of thousands of SMBs across big and small towns. We would like to thank Amazon for the partnership that leaves behind a strong legacy of shaping e-commerce in India.” Watch Amazon to end seven-year-old JV with Narayana Murthy's Catamaran||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amazon-to-end-jv-with-murthy-firm/articleshow/85197875.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
