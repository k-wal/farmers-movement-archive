---||Bengaluru||The recent gang-rape incident in Mysuru is a black spot on our heritage city: Artist Rahul Manohar||On Sunday, Mysurueans gathered around an old dilapitated building located at Dewan's Road to look at this monochrome mural which put the spotlight on the horrific Mysuru gang rape case which has shocked the nation. This piece of a 25-year-old artist Rahul Manohara, is far from his usual upbeat work that has been about hope for the future. “This incident is a black spot on our heritage city and hence I just chose the colour black to add voice to my vision," says Rahul. What was even more interesting was the choice of the location. Speaking about why he chose this old building as a canvas to emote his vision, he says, "I compared the wall to our system. Our system and the way the law works is old. It is not stable and is crumbling, hence I picked a spot that got that statement across." His work not just puts the spotlight on the incident, but also demands justice for the victim and as it suggests that the government must hang those accused. On a closer look one can also see horns on the sides of the letter 'Rape'. "Rape is certainly the work of a devil and hence I added the horns to the letter. The angel at the side denotes the innocent girl who had to go through this ordeal," he adds. Hoping his work would get authorities to make stricter laws and that justice would be delivered sooner in such cases, Rahul feels that his murals on social issues could be a positive way to spread awareness and connect with citizens.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/the-recent-gang-rape-incident-in-mysuru-is-a-black-spot-on-our-heritage-city-artist-rahul-manohar/articleshow/85765576.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty

Vigilant Armymen detected the intruders by effectively utilising an integrated surveillance grid. On being challenged by our troops, the terrorists opened fire and a fierce gunfight ensued in which one terrorist was killed,” Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said. The body of the slain terrorist was later recovered from the encounter site along with an AK-47 rifle. On July 7, the Army had foiled a similar infiltration bid and killed one terrorist along the LoC in Nowshera sector besides recovering a cache of arms and ammunition including an AK-47 rifle and hand grenades.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/infiltration-bid-foiled-along-loc-in-poonch-one-terrorist-killed/articleshow/85779294.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

During a search operation, a BSF party found a rucksack hidden under bushes near the Zero Line, BSF spokesperson DIG S P S Sandhu said, adding: “The bag was opened with due precautions and 10 packets, each weighing approximately 1kg of heroin, were recovered.” Of late, regular inputs about narcotics smuggling were being received and BSF had enhanced surveillance of the area under its jurisdiction, which led to Monday’s contraband recovery, BSF IG (Jammu) N S Jamwal said. On June 23, BSF had foiled a similar drug smuggling attempt along the international border near Pansar in Kathua district and gunned down a Pakistani smuggler. As per BSF officials, 27kg heroin worth around Rs 135 crore in the international market, was seized during a subsequent search of the area. Last September, BSF had foiled a bid to smuggle arms, ammunition and narcotics into India in Arnia sector. During a search, 58 packets of suspected narcotics, two pistols, four magazines and other ammunition were recovered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bsf-foils-drug-smuggling-bid-in-jammu-and-kashmir-seizes-10kg-heroin/articleshow/85779377.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The insurgent group also expressed concern about Pakistan fencing its border (the Durand Line) with Afghanistan, saying that the Afghans had not agreed to it. Afghanistan crisis: Live updatesWithout announcing a date for government formation in the war-torn country, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said the group has been working on it on a war footing and would soon announce the implementation of a new system. He was speaking exclusively to a Pakistan-based Pashto TV station. He said that since taking control of the government they had started consultations with all stakeholders. "We frequently held negotiations with politicians, scholars, religious and former mujahideen leaders. We had also sent teams to the provinces to meet local leaders and scholars. All this effort was aimed at knowing the plans of others and getting inputs from all segments of society to bring in an inclusive system that would be acceptable to all," Mujahid said, adding that consultations on government formation were still underway.

In an interview with Geo News on Saturday, Mujahid said, "The issue of the TTP is one thatSeveral Taliban leaders, who had held meetings with Afghan leaders, including former president Hamid Karzai and Dr Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghan’s High Council for Reconciliation, in Kabul have left for Kandahar to brief Taliban chief Mullah Haibatullah Akhunzada on all developments that had taken place in the last two weeks. "The final decision in this regard will be made by the Taliban chief (Haibatullah Akhunzada)," Mujahid said. When asked about the group’s meeting in Moscow with the troika-plus, where the US, Russia, China and Pakistan had opposed the implementation of an Islamic emirate in Afghanistan, the Taliban chief spokesman said: "It is for the Afghans to decide on internal matters of the country. We (the Afghan nation) reserve the right to take decisions on whether to change the name of the country, bring in the new flag or keep the previous one, and to introduce a form of government. The world should not be concerned about it and should focus on issues related to them."

The presence of the Pakistan Taliban in Afghanistan has been one of the major issuesThe Taliban, since taking over Kabul, have been using the group’s white flag with religious inscriptions. They have been using it in official settings and displaying them on buildings. Several protests were held in Afghanistan over the flag controversy as the insurgent group had beaten up several people for carrying the national flag after the Taliban seized power. The fence has been built by Pakistan on the Durand Line, the 2,640-km land border it shares with Afghanistan. It passes through rugged mountains, densely forested valleys and narrow, rocky passages. The previous Afghan government had strongly opposed the project and several violent incidents had occurred between Pakistani and Afghan forces over the border dispute, resulting in a number of casualties. Pakistan had tried its best to convince the Taliban, during the insurgent group’s previous regime, to accept the Durand Line as a permanent border, but the group’s top leadership had been reluctant to agree.

The fencing has separated people and divided families. We want to create a secure and peaceful environment on the border so that there should not be any need to create barriers," Mujahid said. Mujahid added that the Taliban had already taken control of the three main gates of Kabul airport. "The final evacuation flights continue and charge of the airport will soon be handed over to us.

The US military shot down rockets aimed at Kabul airport by the Islamic State-Khorasan on Monday morning, a day after it said that one of its drones struck a vehicle full of explosives. The US has warned that more attacks, like the one last week outside the airport that killed nearly 200 people, are possible before it withdraws on Tuesday. The IS-K had also claimed responsibility for that bombing, which also killed US troops. US defence officials also acknowledged on Sunday evening the possibility that civilians may have been killed after Sunday's drone hit. Hours after the strike, at a family home in Kabul on Monday, survivors and neighbours said 10 people had been killed, including seven children, an aid worker for an American charity organisation and a contractor with the US military. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid condemned the US for failing to inform them before ordering the strike and described the action as unlawful. Samim, a 25-year-old journalism student, said the strike killed his father, his two brothers, four of his young cousins, his niece and his sister’s fiancé. Three of the dead were girls 2 years old or younger, he said, and his aunt and uncle lost all three of their children. "The American aircraft targeted us," he said. "I do not know what to say, they just cut my arms and broke my back, I cannot say anything more." A doctor at a nearby hospital said four bodies were taken there, two of them those of children. A senior US military official responded that the military was confident that no civilians had been in the targeted vehicle, but acknowledged that the detonation of the explosives in it could have caused "collateral damage". Video of the scene showed a tangle of metal barely recognisable as the remains of a vehicle, and just a few feet away, the charred, pockmarked wreck of another vehicle. Samim said his father had been pulling that SUV into their garage when the explosion hit. A US official said the rockets aimed at the airport were brought down by a counter-rocket system, and that there were no initial reports of casualties. The airport remained open, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational details. Afghan media said Monday's rocket attack was launched from the back of a vehicle. The Pajhwok news agency said several rockets struck different parts of the Afghan capital. "People are terrified and worried about the future, worried that the rocket launching might continue," said Farogh Danish, a Kabul resident near the wreckage of the car from which the rockets were launched. Even as violence gripped Kabul, the US was scrambling to prepare for its departure, including the evacuation of the 300 Americans who remain in the Afghan capital. The US is unlikely to keep diplomats in Afghanistan after its military departs, secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Sunday. Officials said they expected that the US would open a diplomatic mission for Afghanistan in a country elsewhere in the region, in part to continue helping the surge of expected refugees obtain necessary departure documents. That effort could be based in Pakistan or the UAE, an official said, given the large Afghan diaspora in both countries. One of those who died in Sunday’s US drone strike was Zemari Ahmadi, who worked for the charity organisation Nutrition and Education International, was on his way home from work after dropping off colleagues, according to relatives and colleagues interviewed in Kabul. As he pulled into the narrow street where he lived with his three brothers and their families, the children, seeing his white Toyota Corolla, ran outside to greet him. Some clambered aboard in the street, others gathered around as he pulled the car into the courtyard of their home. It was then that they say the drone struck. The missile hit the rear end of the Corolla in the narrow courtyard inside the walled family compound, blowing out doors, shattering windows and spraying shrapnel. Ahmadi and some of the children were killed inside his car; others were fatally wounded in adjacent rooms, family members said. An Afghan official confirmed that three of the dead children were transferred by ambulance from the home on Sunday. Ahmadi’s daughter Samia, 21, was inside when she was struck by the blast wave. "At first I thought it was the Taliban," she said. "But the Americans themselves did it." Samia said she staggered outside, choking, and saw the bodies of her siblings and relatives. "I saw the whole scene," she said. "There were burnt pieces of flesh everywhere." Among the dead was her fiancé, Ahmad Naser, 30, a former army officer and contractor with the US military who had come from Herat, in western Afghanistan, in the hopes of being evacuated from Kabul. Ahmadi was a technical engineer for the local office of Nutrition and Education International, an American nonprofit based in Pasadena, California. His neighbours and relatives insisted that the engineer and his family members, many of whom had worked for the Afghan security forces, had no connection to any terrorist group. They provided documents related to his long employment with the American charity, as well as Naser’s application for a special immigrant visa, based on his service as a guard at Camp Lawton, in Herat. "He was well-respected by his colleagues and compassionate towards the poor and needy," Steven Kwon, the president of NEI, said of Ahmadi in an email. He wrote that Ahmadi had just recently "prepared and delivered soy-based meals to hungry women and children at local refugee camps in Kabul".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/afghanistan-pullout-in-final-hours-us-shoots-down-5-rockets-aimed-at-airport/articleshow/85780941.cms||---

Russian R&D enterprise ‘Zvezda’, a subsidiary of Russian space agency Roscosmos, is manufacturing the spacesuits for the four gagannauts. The four IAF pilots, chosen for the human spaceflight mission, had earlier visited the Zvezda facility last September, where their anthropometric parameters were measured for designing their customised spacesuits. The company will also provide individual seats for the gagannauts and custom-made couch liners. The provisions for specialised training, spacesuits and space kits are as per a contract signed between Roscosmos subsidiary Glavkosmos and Isro’s Human Spaceflight Centre on March 11, 2020. The four gagganauts, who started their training in Russia in February last, which was stalled in between due to the pandemic, have in one year completed training on crew actions in the event of an abnormal descent module landing, in wooded and marshy areas in winter, on the water surface and in the steppe in summer, according to Glavkosmos. Currently, the chosen four are undergoing module-specific training in India. In another milestone linked to the Gaganyaan mission, Isro had on August 28 successfully conducted the first hot test of the system demonstration model of the Gaganyaan service module propulsion system for a duration of 450 seconds at its test facility Mahendragiri, Tamil Nadu. The system performance met the test objectives and there was a close match with the pre-test predictions. A series of hot tests have been planned to simulate various mission conditions as well as off-nominal conditions. Isro plans to launch its first unmanned Gaganyaan mission next year but the date for the final manned mission has not been decided yet as the pandemic has affected all mission-specific deadlines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/4-gagannauts-will-go-back-to-russia-for-trying-out-customised-spacesuits-for-gaganyaan-mission/articleshow/85781525.cms||Surendra Singh

They are assigned to do this job. We have heard and seen the audio and video (of the SDM instructing cops)...Rest, the DGP is probing the incident and the local administration, too, is doing the same. We shall act as and when the report comes to us,” Khattar told reporters in Chandigarh. At least 10 people were injured when police caned a group of farmers disrupting traffic on a highway in Haryana while proceeding to Karnal, where Khattar, state BJP president Om Prakash Dhankar and other party functionaries were attending an event. The farmers’ panchayat chaired by BKU (Charuni) national president Gurnam Singh Charuni at the Gharaunda grain market in Karnal demanded that Singh be suspended along with some other officials, including inspector Harjinder Singh, for allegedly targeting the protesters without provocation. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha made a similar demand. “We want FIRs to be registered against them. We also demand Rs 25 lakh in compensation and a government job for the kin of farmer Sushil Kajal, who died of injuries suffered in the lathicharge, and Rs 2 lakh to each injured farmer,” Charuni said. Farmers will indefinitely gherao the Karnal secretariat on September 7 if the government fails to act on the panchayat’s demand by September 6, he warned. While urging farmers to continue their protest against BJP-JJP leaders, Charuni also attacked Congress, saying the opposition party should have been out on the roads by now in protest against the Haryana government's “adamant attitude”. “Haryana farmers being attacked by cops and the civil administration cannot be tolerated anymore. The SKM either takes a strong decision or forgets Haryana farmers,” he said. In a statement later, SKM said, "It is utterly shocking that the CM is choosing to brush aside the barbaric and illegal instructions as only a wrong choice of words. It once again clearly reiterates what we have been saying that the Khattar government is at war with its own people.” A delegation led by Indian National Lok Dal state president Nafe Singh Rathee submitted a complaint to the Karnal SP, seeking FIRs against the SDM and other police officials who allegedly hit peaceful protesters "on their heads".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farmers-demand-action-against-sdm-manohar-lal-khattar-defends-strict-action/articleshow/85781801.cms||---
---||India||E-challans worth Rs 1,975 crore since Sept 2019||NEW DELHI: Eighteen states and UTs have collected approximately Rs 1,975 crore fines through e-challans for violations of traffic rules since September 2019 when the Motor Vehicle Act was amended with a sharp increase in penalties for offences. Uttar Pradesh has collected the maximum fine of Rs 545 crore, followed by Bihar with Rs 488 crore and Delhi Rs 244 crore during September 2019 and July 2021, according to government data. Haryana and Tamil Nadu come fourth and fifth in the list. In Delhi, fines collected from traffic rule violations were nearly Rs 175 crore, which is 71% of the total fines collected by the traffic police and transport department. Delhi tops among the states and UTs so far as total number of e-challans are concerned recording 2 crore such challans. Officials cited two reasons; high number of vehicles and more CCTV cameras on roads to record violations. Before 2019, very few states had gone for an e-challan system. The Centre pushed for electronic recording of violations of motor vehicle rules and issuing challans in states. The increased fines under the new law has resulted in collection of more penalty amounts, which the states can ustilise to improve IT-based enforcement and for road safety, sources said. “The fines collected should be used for creating a corpus for immediate release of compensation to road crash victims. When the insurance companies reimburse the compensation that can be put in the corpus. Second, this money should be used to buy equipment such as speed guns, alcometers and CCTV cameras for evidence-based challaning and prosecution. Most states lack these infrastructures,” said T Krishna Prasad, former DGP and chairman of road safety authority in Telangana. Currently the states utilise the fines collected from motor vehicle law related offences for other purposes, sources said. “Now they should use the penalty for better enforcement. These fines are not a means for revenue. But the aim is to build a system that proves to be a deterrent for violators,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/e-challans-worth-rs-1975-crore-since-sept-2019/articleshow/85782003.cms||Dipak K Dash

This was the harrowing experience of the families of 11 kids who had come to India from the Philippines for liver transplants between August last year and February this year. They finally managed to board the flight home last week after travel restrictions due to Covid-19 were eased. The youngest among the patients was one year old, while seven were aged between 13 months and 20 months. One was two-and-a-half years and the oldest was a 15-year-old boy. While waiting for the flight restrictions to be lifted, four of the kids even contracted Covid. Their families had to extend their stay in hotels and guesthouses in Delhi for several months after the kids had undergone their medical procedures. Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director and paediatric gastroenterologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said some of the parents had lost their jobs back home because they couldn’t report to work in time after being stuck in India. This caused financial difficulties for them, while other parents struggled during the extended stay with their children. “One of the children had moderate symptoms of Covid that required hospital admission. The other three recuperated from the viral illness in the hotel itself, but it was a worrisome time for us,” said Sibal. Dr Neerav Goyal, senior liver transplant surgeon at Apollo, said it was heartening to find that though they were on immunosuppressive therapy, the four kids infected by Covid did well. “It reinforces the observation that children do well in handling SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid,” he said. Dr Goyal explained that liver transplant surgery was necessary when patients had a high risk of dying from liver disease in the ensuing weeks or months. “Since Covid isn’t going away anytime soon, many of these patients are unlikely to have survived the period of the pandemic without the liver transplant. That is why the patients, despite several challenges, travelled to India,” he said. “Most of the children received the donor liver from their parents. One of the children received it from his elder brother.” Before the pandemic, Delhi hospitals regularly admitted hundreds of patients from countries like the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Uzbekistan, Kenya, Nigeria, Malaysia and the Middle East, where liver transplant isn’t readily accessible. The pandemic has prevented such patients from flying to India, with some too wary to take the risk, given India’s high incidence of infection, said doctors. “At Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, we treated numerous patients from the Philippines and south Asia in pre-Covid times,” said Sibal. “But after many countries were forced by the pandemic to impose restrictions on travel and movement, a lot of patients have been deprived of life-saving treatment in our country.” Now, with travel restrictions eased, the doctors hope for a change. Apollo recently admitted a fresh batch of children from the Philippines requiring liver transplant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stuck-in-india-for-up-to-a-year-11-filipino-kids-and-kin-return-home/articleshow/85782346.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Shringla chaired four meetings of the Security Council on Monday, a day before the end of India's presidency of the Council. Officials said India successfully steered discussions during its presidency on Afghanistan, Myanmar, Syria, Yemen, and the Middle East Peace Process. In the discussions on the Palestine issue, Shringla reiterated India’s "long standing and firm commitment" to the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine, within secure, recognized and mutually agreed borders, living side by side with Israel in peace and security. "We're concerned by recent escalation in Gaza Strip, which once again underscores the fragility of ceasefire and urgent need for addressing the underlying causes that have triggered the escalation," said Shringla. "I reaffirm India’s call for regular & predictable transfer of aid & other essential items to Gaza to ease humanitarian situation & facilitate early reconstruction, as well as for appropriate use of such aid," he added. The foreign secretary also noted that early commencement of direct peace negotiations was the best opportunity to resolve all final status issues and achieve a ‘two-state’ solution. He said the decision by Israel to increase number of work permits to Palestinians will help strengthen both economies. Shringla also chaired a meeting on Mali sanctions resolution that strongly condemned the activities in Mali and the Sahel region of ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida-linked terrorist organizations such as Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), IS in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), and Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-un-india-reiterates-2-state-solution-on-palestinian-issue/articleshow/85782577.cms||---
---||World||Biden: States hit hardest by Ida are resilient||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden has spoken with officials in states pounded by Hurricane Ida, detailing the federal effort to survey damage and ensure access to electricity, water and cell phone service.  The president said Monday that state officials should contact the White House if they need additional support - even though the effort is being led by FEMA.  "We'll get you what you need if we can," Biden said. "The people of Louisiana and Mississippi are resilient. But it's in moments like these where we can certainly see the power of government to respond to the needs of the people, if government's prepared and if they respond."  Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards' office said power company crews were doing a damage assessment of its power grid, but it appeared the damage was "catastrophic". Officials were estimating Monday that it could be weeks for full restoration in some areas. Christina Stephens, a spokesperson for the governor, said search and rescue was underway across many communities in southeast Louisiana, with particular high water problems in Lafitte, LaPlace, the west bank of Jefferson Parish and the Houma/Thibodaux areas. The state had more than 1,000 people conducting search and rescue operations, and many more local search and rescue operations were up and running as well. Stephens said only one death has been confirmed from Ida, but she cautioned that based on the widespread destruction: "We're going to have many more confirmed fatalities." Meanwhile, rescuers set out in hundreds of boats and helicopters to reach people trapped by floodwaters, and utility repair crews rushed in, after the furious Hurricane Ida swamped the Louisiana coast and ravaged the electrical grid in the sticky, late-summer heat.  New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell confirmed a driver drowned during Hurricane Ida, which may raise the storm's death toll to two. Earlier, a person was killed outside Baton Rouge amid the storm when a tree fell on a home, authorities said.  The name of either victim have yet to be released. Meanwhile, police in New Orleans said they have received numerous reports of stealing from stores and other businesses, and made several arrests, in the wake of Hurricane Ida.  "This will not be tolerated," police chief Shaun Ferguson said at a Monday briefing.  New Orleans police are working with the Louisiana National Guard to prevent thefts. Police are working 12-hour shifts, and it's "all hands on deck," Ferguson said.  The storm damaged power and water systems in many parts of Louisiana and made communication difficult. Power company officials say a giant tower that helps carry key overhead transmission lines over the Mississippi River to the New Orleans area withstood the force of Hurricane Katrina, but was destroyed by Ida. As of Monday morning, there were more than 888,000 power outages in Louisiana, with outages expected to increase as the storm moves through Mississippi. More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines were out of service Monday, along with 216 substations, according to the power provider, Entergy. Entergy said crews were assessing damage to help the company "get a better idea of what we're dealing with." "It would be premature to speculate at this time when power will be restored given the extent of the damage," the company said. Entergy has more than 11,000 workers ready to restore service, and expects that number to increase to 20,000, it said. The company is booking hotel rooms and preparing to move mobile sleeping units to house the thousands of workers in areas hard-hit by the storm. AT&T said Monday that it has set up a mobile tower at the Louisiana emergency preparedness and state police compound in Baton Rouge, to try and get cell service working for the governor's office and other first responders. On the other hand, the US health officials Monday declared public health emergencies for Louisiana and Mississippi, seeking to suspend government red tape that may get in the way of providing help to people affected by Hurricane Ida.  The emergency declaration by Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra puts a pause on certain payment rules and other requirements that could become an unwelcome distraction for hospitals and doctors trying to provide services under stressful conditions.  One example is a requirement that health care professionals be licensed in the state they provide care.  HHS has also staged an incident management team in Dallas to provide coordination of federal health and medical support after Ida passes through the region. Another team is providing support for people needing kidney dialysis.  People in emotional distress in affected areas can call 1-800-985-5990 for counseling help, or text TalkWithUs to 66746. Also Monday, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said it had activated its Hurricane Response Team as Hurricane Ida made its way through the Gulf. Based on data from offshore operator reports submitted as of late morning Monday, personnel have been evacuated from a total of 288 production platforms, 51.43 percent of the 560 manned platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Personnel have been evacuated from 11 rigs, equivalent to 100% of the 11 rigs of this type currently operating in the Gulf. Rigs can include several types of offshore drilling facilities. A total of seven dynamically positioned rigs have moved off location out of the storm's projected path, as a precaution. The U.S. Department of Energy says 96% of oil production and 94% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico are shut down due to Ida. The facilities will be inspected after the storm has passed. The service disruptions are not expected to immediately impact the availability of gasoline nationally, due to ample fuel reserves in the system, the department said.  The ports of New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Gramercy, and Morgan City in Louisiana and the Port of Pascagoula, Mississippi are all closed. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port has also suspended operations.  Authorities were also calculating just how much wind and rain Ida unleashed. Preliminary measurements on Monday showed a high of 15.7 inches of rain from Ida dropped in Slidell, Louisiana, through 9 am. local time.  New Orleans got nearly 14 inches of rain. From 5 to 11 inches of rain fell in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.  A ship at Port Fourchon measured 172 mph winds, while Venice, Louisiana, recorded a high of 128 mph winds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-states-hit-hardest-by-ida-are-resilient/articleshow/85782688.cms||---

Terror launchpads close to the border are active again and infiltration has picked up, with agencies warning that this could point to an attempt by Pakistan to use the developments in Afghanistan to its advantage. Read AlsoWhy more US drone strikes could worsen the situationNo certainty killing leaders stops terrorism, strikes may also destabilise Afghanistan further“This is in contrast with the almost nil infiltration seen in the initial months after the India-Pakistan ceasefire pact in February this year. Intelligence inputs a few days ago reported sighting of 21 terrorists at a launch pad near the LoC,” a source told TOI. Recruitment of local youths into terrorist ranks remains a concern, though it is less than last year. Around 87 J&K youths have joined terrorist outfits so far this year, down from the around 137 in the corresponding period last year. Afghanistan crisis: Live updates“The events in Afghanistan have created a buzz in the Valley, with a section eyeing it as a victory for Islamic forces. For terrorist outfits too, it is being touted as a morale booster,” said an intelligence officer. The assessment of security agencies is that while there is no immediate threat to J&K, Jaish and LeT are back to their old ways. Read AlsoPakistan based Jaish-e-Mohammad met Taliban leadership, Indian security agencies issue alertsNEW DELHI: The country's intelligence agencies have warned of a possible terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir after they got inputs regarding the movement of terrorists from across the border. A senior official said that the input was shared with the state intelligence and security agencies concernedInterestingly,while infiltration attempts have picked up, drone activity originating from Pakistan has seen a significant decline in the last one-and-a-half months. Just three attempts at dropping of arms by drones were reported in J&K, with new drone surveillance systems — sourced from DRDO and Army — installed at key points on the international border. Sources told TOI that as many as 102 terrorists were neutralised by counter-terror forces till August 28 this year, though casualties among security forces have been way lower. There were 3-4 fatalities among central police forces till early August this year, down from 15-16 in the corresponding period of 2020. Also four Army personnel were killed, down from 17-18 last year. Police casualties have, however, been higher at around 10-11 this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-world-focuses-on-afghanistan-pakistan-tries-to-step-up-terror-activities-in-kashmir/articleshow/85782773.cms||Bharti Jain

Yogi was speaking at the Krishnotsava 2021 programme in Mathura. He suggested that those engaged in liquor and meat trade may take up selling milk in order to revive the glory of Mathura, that was known for producing huge quantity of animal milk. The UP chief minister also prayed to Lord Krishna to eliminate Covid-19. “Every effort will be made to develop ‘brij bhumi’ and there will be no dearth of funds for this. We are looking at a blend of modern technology and the cultural and spiritual heritage for the development of the region,” he said. Yogi also complimented Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving a new direction to the country. He said places of faith neglected since long are being revived now. Cabinet ministers Laxmi Narain Chaudhary and Shrikant Sharma were also present on the occasion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/sale-of-meat-liquor-banned-in-mathura/articleshow/85782927.cms||---
---||India||Will foil any bid to fuel cross-border terror: Rajnath Singh||NEW DELHI: The government is taking steps to ensure `no anti-national force’ is allowed to fuel cross-border terrorism by taking advantage of the evolving situation in Afghanistan, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday, while slamming Pakistan for its policy of giving `death of thousand cuts’ to India. Delivering the Balramji Dass Tandon Memorial Lecture, organized by Panjab University through video-conferencing, Singh said the government has been “constantly monitoring” the developments in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover of the country. "What is happening in Afghanistan is raising new questions from the security point of view. Security of Indians is a cause of concern for the government. We also do not want anti-India forces to take advantage of the evolving Afghan situation for cross-border terrorism,” he said. “Our government is alert, and is capable of facing any kind of situation. We are always prepared to deal with threats arising from anywhere – air, land or water,” he added. The minister said Pakistan had resorted to building a nuclear arsenal and the strategy of “giving death by thousand cuts” to India after being defeated in the 1965 and 1971 wars. “They began to train and finance terrorists to target India,” he said, adding Pakistan had become the “nursery of terrorism” in the whole world after the 1980s. But India has taken effective steps to thwart all misadventures of Pakistan, whose model of terrorism is slowly collapsing. "I believe the remaining terrorism in Kashmir will also end. I have this belief because the strength and oxygen that the separatist forces used to get there due to Articles 370 and 35A are over now,” said Singh. Referring to India’s cross-border strikes on terror camps, he said, “The anti-India forces have understood that they are no longer in a position to do much in the Kashmir Valley, especially after the abrogation of Article 370. I want to assure you that no power in the world can separate J&K from India,” he said. Pakistan has understood that it will not make any significant gains from violations of ceasefire agreements. Referring to the fresh truce between the two DGMOs in February, he said, "We are in wait and watch mode because the trust deficit between both the nations is a major problem.” Turning to the continuing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh since April-May last year, he said the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had violated the agreed protocols between the two countries. “We cannot allow the Chinese PLA to act on the Line of Actual Control in a unilateral manner under any circumstances. We will never allow it. The Modi government has made it clear to our forces that any unilateral action on the LAC should not be ignored. That's what the Indian Army did that day in Galwan (on June 15 last year) and bravely confronted the PLA soldiers and forced them to retreat,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-foil-any-bid-to-fuel-cross-border-terror-rajnath-singh/articleshow/85782979.cms||---

A few families, however, are still at the gurdwara. This comes amid reports of Taliban spokesperson Zahebullah Mujahid saying that a group of 140 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus who were prevented from reaching the Kabul airport may be allowed to leave the country. A Kabul-based Sikh, who runs a cosmetics shop, said, “Nearly 40 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus run shops and busine- sses in Kabul. They have started returning to work. My brother has a wholesale business of medicines with Indian pharma firms and is back at work. Taliban commanders have assured us of safety and asked us to start work. So we have opened our shops for now.” An Afghan Hindu said they had opened shops but there was hardly any work. “We sit for some hours and return home as there are few customers. People are also afraid to come out of their homes,” he said. An owner of a cosmetics shop hoped “work could gain pace with time”. There is also a glimmer of hope for Hindus and Sikhs who were looking to travel to India. “There is a ray of hope that they will be able to come to India as Zahebullah Mujahid, the official spokesperson for Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, in an interview to Pajhwok Afghan News Agency, has conveyed the assent of his government for departure of Afghan Hindu and Sikh pilgrims to India with valid travel documents and assured his support,” Indian World Forum president Puneet Singh Chandhok told TOI. He said there should be some clarity by the end of this week on when Afghan Sikhs and Hindus would be able to leave for Delhi. “We have to wait for the situation at Kabul airport to normalise as the Taliban hand over the operations of the airport to Turkey and Qatar after the US leave,” he said. “Taliban representative Bilal Karimi assured us that the rights of the religious minorities would be protected.

JD(U)’s Nalanda MP Kaushlendra Kumar even offered his seat to Nitish so that he could contest the next Lok Sabha polls. He cited the example of Narendra Modi, saying he too was the chief minister of Gujarat before becoming the PM.

---||World||Ahead of Tuesday deadline, US completes withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan after 20-year war||WASHINGTON: The United States completed the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan, the Pentagon said on Monday, after a chaotic evacuation of thousands of Americans and Afghan allies to close out US involvement there after 20 years of conflict.  The operation came to an end before the Tuesday deadline set by President Joe Biden, who has drawn heavy criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for his handling of Afghanistan since the Taliban made rapid advances and took over Kabul earlier this month.  The withdrawal was announced by General Frank McKenzie, commander of the US Central Command, who told a Pentagon briefing that the chief US diplomat in Afghanistan, Ross Wilson, was on the last C-17 flight out.  Having failed to anticipate that the Taliban would so quickly conquer the country, Washington and its NATO allies were forced into a hasty exit. They leave behind thousands of Afghans who helped Western countries and might have qualified for evacuation.  McKenzie said the final flights also did not include some dozens of Americans who could not get to the airport.  "There's a lot of heartbreak associated with this departure. We did not get everybody out that we wanted to get out. But I think if we'd stayed another 10 days, we wouldn't have gotten everybody out," McKenzie told reporters.  More than 122,000 people have been airlifted out of Kabul since August 14, the day before the Taliban regained control of the country two decades after being removed from power by the US-led invasion in 2001.  The United States and its Western allies scrambled to save citizens of their own countries as well as translators, local embassy staff, civil rights activists, journalists and other Afghans vulnerable to reprisals.  The evacuations became even more perilous when a suicide bomb attack claimed by Islamic State - enemy of both the West and the Taliban - killed 13 US service members and scores of Afghans waiting by the airport gates last Thursday.  Biden promised after the bloody Kabul airport attack to hunt down the people responsible.  The departure took place after the US anti-missile defences intercepted rockets fired at Kabul's airport.  Two US officials said "core" diplomatic staff were among 6,000 Americans to have left.  A US official said initial reports did not indicate any American casualties from as many as five missiles fired on the airport. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks.  In recent days, Washington has warned of more attacks, while carrying out two air strikes. It said both hit Islamic State targets, one thwarting an attempted suicide bombing in Kabul on Sunday by destroying a car packed with explosives, but which Afghans said had struck civilians.  Tuesday's deadline for troops to leave was set by Biden, fulfilling an agreement reached with the Taliban by his predecessor, Donald Trump to end the United States' longest war.  The United States said on Saturday it had killed two Islamic State militants with a drone attack. On Sunday, the US officials said a drone strike killed a suicide car bomber suspected of preparing to attack the airport.  The Democratic president has stuck to his goal of ending America's longest war, saying the United States long ago achieved the objectives it set when the US-led invasion overthrew the Taliban in 2001, punishing them for harbouring al Qaeda militants who masterminded the September 11 attacks on the United States. Evacuations Most of the more than 20 allied countries involved in airlifting Afghans and their citizens out of Kabul said they had completed evacuations by Friday. Britain, closely involved in the war from the start, said on Saturday it had finished evacuations and withdrawn the last of its troops.  Thousands more Afghans have been left behind, however, and the chaotic scenes outside the airport for the past two weeks, where thousands thronged every day to try to get past the gates, were a bitter coda to the West's two-decade involvement in Afghanistan.  While the Taliban have sought to present a more moderate face to the world and erase memories of the harsh fundamentalist rule they practised in the 1990s, the desperation by many Afghans to flee the country showed clearly the fear inspired by the Islamist group.  Their seizure of the city on Aug. 15, after the Western-backed government collapsed without a fight and President Ashraf Ghani fled, completed a lightning campaign that saw them sweep up all the country's major cities in a week.  It is unclear whether the US pullout represents the end of American military involvement in Afghanistan - given Washington's interest in punishing Islamic State for the airport attack, and keeping the country from becoming a haven for militants.  Now in full control of the country, the Taliban must revive a war-shattered economy but without being able to count on the billions of dollars in foreign aid that flowed to the previous ruling elite and fed systemic corruption.  Cut off from some $9 billion in foreign reserves and missing thousands of educated specialists who have joined the exodus, the inexperienced new administration must deal with a collapse in the Afghani currency and rising food inflation.

Besides, new e-commerce specific product launches are planned to combat new gen products in the markets. “The idea is to give way for next generation and focus on high growth, innovation, e-commerce and combined synergies,” said the founder chairman of CavinKare CK Ranganathan. As part of the restructuring, Venkatesh Vijayaraghavan will be the group CEO for FMCG business, besides mentoring Amudha Ranganathan(daughter of CK Ranganathan) in her role as head of e-commerce initiatives. “Our e-commerce drive will be twin pronged, first act as a start up and play the game that way, viz no rules. While the second will combat mature players in the space,” said Ranganathan. “I would be wrong to say we have not been impacted by new gen companies. We will launch new brands only for the e-commerce segment before December,” he said. Amudha is a graduate from the University of Madras and has been handling the not for profit educational initiatives of the group. Manuranjith Ranganathan, who launched CK Bakery, a bakery chain across Chennai will now head retail initiatives, dairy, salons and animal hospitals. “There will be a special thrust on the dairy business,” Ranganathan said. While business roles have been divided, CK Ranganathan, for himself will continue to head the innovation at the group. “The purpose of the exercise is to achieve special thrust in growth areas and push the group to achieve revenues of Rs 5,000 crore from Rs 1,700 crore now,” he said. The revenues have been flat as Covid ravaged salon business and also impacted dairy business which took a hit as schools and colleges were closed due to the pandemic. The rough blueprint envisages increasing the number of pet hospitals from the present two to 100 in three years which will bring in a top line of Rs 500 crore. Increase the number of salons (GreenTrends and Limelite) to 1,000 from 400 and bakery to 600 in South India from 87 now. CavinKare decided to move out of working from offices last year and it has decided to be only on WFH mode.  “We don't see ourselves getting back to offices. Our present WFH will continue as it is beneficial. Productivity improvement coupled with talent hiring from across the country are the main reasons,” he added. At the group level, a decision to bring in gender equality has been taken. Across all functions, except sales roles, women will constitute 50% of the workforce. “We will achieve this over the next couple of years,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cavinkare-restructures-its-businesspromoters-son-daughter-gain-entry/articleshow/85779049.cms||---

Though the hospital has one specialist neonatal care unit, eight paediatricians,the increase in infant deaths due to lack of basic facilities has raised a lot of concern among people. Despite there being only one specialist in neonatal care, the government has not yet recruited specialists to CIMS Hospital which was started five years ago in the backward district to take care of newborns.Due to lack of expert medical attention, ventilator, incubators and other lifesaving equipment in MCH unit, the hospital authorities are referring the patients, particularly premature babies and complicated delivery cases, to hospitals in Mysuru and other places, according to sources. During 2020-21, district hospital recorded 1,167 deliveries. Of this, 838 patients were discharged after full recovery, while 229 cases were shifted to other hospitals and 36 deaths were recorded. Likewise, by the end of July this year, the district hospital had registered 418 cases. Of this, 301 cases were discharged after full recovery, 93 cases shifted to other hospitals and 19 deaths were reported. In all, the district witnessed deaths of 55 newborn babies.Speaking to TOI, CIMS director Dr Sanjeev said the district had registered an infant mortality rate of 3 % in 2020 against 4.5% in 2021. Infections, pneumonia, low birth weight, breathing defects were the major reasons for the spike in fatalities. “The CIMS has set up a 100-bed hospital at its Yedapura campus for children to tackle the third wave of Covid. Of these, 10 beds were fitted with a ventilator and other lifesaving facilities. Same beds and emergency treatment facilities to be used for MCH units once the cases decline,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/cnagar-dist-hospital-records-55-newborn-deaths-in-16-months/articleshow/85776123.cms||---

---||Patna||Paras meets Nitish, wants fair probe into Hajipur incident||PATNA: Union minister for food processing industries, Pashupati Kumar Paras, on Monday urged chief minister Nitish Kumar to conduct a fair investigation into the incident that happened during the visit to his Lok Sabha constituency Hajipur on August 23. Talking to reporters after calling on Nitish at 1, Aney Marg, Paras said he requested the CM to punish the offenders after a proper investigation. “What happened with me at Hajipur warranted a thorough investigation,” he asserted. During his maiden visit to his constituency after being inducted into the Narendra Modi cabinet, Paras was greeted with black flags and lubricant was thrown on him causing much embarrassment to him and his supporters. He, however, clarified that the complaint submitted to the police didn’t have the name of Jamui MP and his nephew Chirag Paswan, as mentioned in a section of media (not TOI). Chirag had earlier said Paras should request Nitish to order an investigation into the matter. The bitterness between Chirag and Paras is no more a secret. Altogether 11 people, including one Laxmi Devi, have been named in the FIR lodged with the Hajipur industrial police station in connection with the incident. Industrial police station SHO Santosh Kumar said three accused — Navin Kumar, Anil Paswan and Tribhuvan Paswan — have already been arrested and sent to jail. Other accused were reported to be absconding, he said. Responding to a query, the minister said he urged the CM to provide a government building in the state capital to open an office of his department. “The CM has assured of prompt action in this regard,” he said. Paras reiterated that he was committed to developing his constituency. He has also proposed to open a university somewhere between Hajipur and Muzaffarpur to impart education on courses related to food processing industries. When asked about the JD(U) leaders’ statements that Nitish possessed all qualities of becoming the Prime Minister, Paras said they all were part of the NDA at the Centre and whatever the decision is taken will be acceptable to him and his party. He, however, hastened to add that JD(U) leader KC Tyagi’s statement was self-explanatory that Nitish was not in the race for the coveted post. “Don't try to create a confusion on the contentious issues like Nitish is a PM material,” he said. Referring to Chirag's remarks that he was the national president of the LJP, Paras said the decision of the Election Commission of India will clear the mist. “Wait till the ECI’s decision comes,” he asserted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/paras-meets-nitish-wants-fair-probe-into-hajipur-incident/articleshow/85773795.cms||Ramashankar

For the first time in August, the city’s AQI was recorded at 38, which falls in “good” category, on Monday. On Sunday, the AQI in city was recorded at 84 as per the data available on Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) website. In August, there were 27 “satisfactory” AQI days, two “moderate” days and a “good” day in the city. The AQI in all areas having continuous ambient air quality monitoring station was ‘good’ on Monday – DRM office-Khagaul (30), Eco Park (32), S K Memorial Hall (34), Patna City (45) and BIT-Mesra (49). An AQI between 0-50 is considered “good”, 51-100 “satisfactory”, 101-200 “moderate”, 201-300 “poor”, 301-400 “very poor” and 401-500 “severe”. Above 500 is the “severe-plus or emergency” category. The “very poor” situation can cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. Naveen Kumar, an environmental scientist and analyst at Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), said the city witnessed good air day because of a smaller number of vehicles on the roads owing to Janmashtami and climatic conditions. “These are the two main reasons behind the fall in the AQI level of Patna. As far as the wind speed is concerned, it was same as yesterday. The air quality is expected to remain satisfactory for another few days due to favourable meteorological conditions,” he said. Kumar added, “Between October and January, the air quality would deteriorate to poor, very poor and even severe categories. Geographical location of Bihar is the main factor for poor air quality during winters. Other climatic factors like thermal inversion can lead to poor air quality.” The Air Quality Early Warning System of the ministry of earth sciences has predicted that the overall AQI of Patna would witness a slight rise on Wednesday due to climatic conditions. However, it will again see a drastic improvement on September 1 owing to change in direction of wind.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/sigh-of-relief-for-residents-as-patnas-aqi-turns-good/articleshow/85774595.cms||Faryal Rumi

The TTD administration recently started a trial run of ‘sampradaya bhojanam’, an initiative to serve traditional delicacies to devotees at a nominal price. After eight days of trial run which was supposed to end on September 2, TTD planned to replicate the model at all its big canteens. After the move drew criticism, with many alleging the temple body was planning to dilute the existing ‘anna prasadam’ free food system, Subba Reddy stepped in and said they are stopping the programme. “TTD officials introduced the new system with a noble intention, but without the consent of the board. We are scrapping it now. We will continue to provide anna prasadams to devotees free of cost,” he clarified.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/subba-reddy-nixes-ttds-food-biz-plan/articleshow/85776306.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Frontline staff of the Udumalpet forest range had found the carcass on Sunday evening. Bullet injuries were not found on the carcass, forest veterinary officer A Sukumar said. “The poachers had used an axe to remove the left tusk. Only experienced poachers can remove tusk like this,” he said. “The male elephant was about 35 years old and had died about five days ago. There were no external injuries on the carcass. We have collected samples for laboratory test and are waiting for the test result to ascertain the cause of death.” The veterinarian recovered four air-gun pellets lodged in the animal’s head. “But they were old and didn’t kill the elephant. It might have happened a few months ago or a year ago,” Sukumar added. ATR deputy director M G Ganesan and assistant conservator of forests Ganesh Ram inspected the carcass. “The right tusk of the elephant was damaged. It might have happened due to infighting. The remaining portion of the right tusk was intact,” Ganesan said. After the postmortem, the carcass was left in the forest for scavengers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/elephant-found-dead-in-atr-with-tusk-missing-probe-on/articleshow/85781065.cms||A Subburaj

The party has developed an exclusive app – ‘JD(U) Mulyankan’ – for the purpose. Sources said though the ‘JD(U) Mulyankan’ has so far not been officially launched, the party functionaries – from block to state level – have been asked to register themselves on the party’s app. The app has been developed by the JD(U) media cell at the suggestion of the party’s state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha. Sources said the JD(U)’s state-level office bearers, Lok Sabha constituency prabharis, district presidents, district-level chief spokespersons, Vidhan Sabha prabharis and block presidents have been asked to register themselves on the Mulyankan app. “Once the app is made fully operationalised, all these key functionaries will be asked to report their daily activities and also upload photos/reports about their activities on the app,” the party’s media cell state president Amardeep told TOI on Monday. He added these reports will be analysed by the party’s state office. Amardeep said the app would also be used as a digital platform for fast transmission of the party’s communication among its district and block level office-bearers. “Earlier, we used to send such urgent communication either through telephonic messages or different groups created by the party on an instant messaging app. Now, we will put such urgent communication in the app and it will automatically be delivered to all the registered members of the party,” he added. Amardeep said the app was developed by the JD(U) media cell under the guidance of the party’s former national president R C P Singh and state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha. He said soon after taking over as the JD(U)’s Bihar unit president, Kushwaha thought of developing a mechanism that could assess the performance of the party’s functionaries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/jdu-creates-app-to-assess-functionaries-performance/articleshow/85773706.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Business||Sensex, Nifty hit records on dovish US Fed comments||Mumbai: Strong buying in RIL and financial stocks helped the sensex rally by 765 points on Monday to settle the session at 56,890, its highest ever close, as global markets cheered a relatively dovish commentary from US Fed chairman Jerome Powell, made on Friday evening. On the NSE, the Nifty too rallied strongly to inch closer to the 17,000-point level as it added 226 points to end at a record level of 16,931. Sentiment was also boosted as the Indian rupee strengthened by another 42 paise to close at 73.27 to a dollar. According to a report by CARE Ratings, the comments by Powell at the Jackson Hole conference were taken positively by the market. At the annual symposium last week, the Fed chief said it could move away from pumping money into the economy by the end of the year, but raising rates would take some time. This boosted the markets and “all stock indices have gone up”, CARE report said. The report said less bond buying (popularly called quantitative easing, or QE) means fewer funds to circulate to emerging markets like India, which could be a worry once the magnitude of QE starts to come down. The spread of the Delta variant is a matter of concern for market players too, and mentioned at the Jackson Hole symposium. The global rally in stock markets also prompted foreign funds to increase their buying in India after turning a net seller in July and staying muted for most part of August. On Monday, net FPI buying was a little over Rs 1,200 crore, BSE data showed. In comparison, till Friday, net FPI buying in Indian stocks was just Rs 368 crore.Among the index stocks, Bharti Airtel rose over 4% after the company announced on Sunday a Rs 21,000-crore fund-raising, mainly to meet the cost of rolling out a 5G network. On the other hand, as the Indian rupee strengthened, IT stocks saw muted interest as, for the software exporters, a stronger rupee means lower export earnings in rupee terms, market players said. The rupee is at its strongest point since mid-June, market players said. As a result, of the four sensex stocks that ended lower among its 30 constituents, three were from the IT pack. Among the 19 sectoral indices on BSE, only IT and Teck closed in the red. The day’s rally also added about Rs 3.5 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with BSE’s market capitalisation now at almost Rs 250 lakh crore, or about $3.4 trillion. In the next few weeks, the market is likely to continue with its positive momentum on the back of the US Fed’s dovish statement, while attention will shift to an OPEC meeting too on Wednesday that could discuss a further output boost, a note from Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. Further, investors will keep a watch on India’s GDP data on Tuesday, auto sales numbers on Wednesday and the spread of the Delta variant that’s already reached a new high globally, market players said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-nifty-hit-records-on-dovish-us-fed-comments/articleshow/85783083.cms||---

Local authorities have been asked to send ambulances to bring patients to hospitals quickly. I have sought a report on this. Accountability will be sought if there is any evidence of negligence,” Yogi said. The state’s special teams will include senior health department officials, virologists and disease control scientists. The Centre is also sending its special teams. Both will survey Firozabad, Mathura and Mainpuri. “The purpose of the special teams’ visit is to study the nature of the virus and guide local officials on how to address the situation,” state director general (health) Dr Ved Vrat Singh said. Yogi visited Firozabad on Monday. He met patients at the Government Medical College, Firozabad, where, TOI had reported, two to three patients were seen sharing each bed. He also spoke with families of four who died of the viral fever. “Covid-19 has been controlled but effective effort must be continued to prevent the spread of communicable diseases,” he said. “There should be no carelessness. We will ensure adequate stocks of medicines and resources for the treatment of communicable diseases in all hospitals.” A longer recovery period for patients of this viral disease, up from 4-5 days to 10-12 days, had stretched hospital resources, TOI had reported. Firozabad MLA Manish Asija said the CM has ordered health surveillance to identify patients and admit them to hospitals on time. Additional director of health, AK Singh, said medical teams are going door-to-door to identify patients. “Civic body teams are carrying out special cleanliness drives in affected areas. Helpline numbers have been issued. All recent deaths from viral fever are being investigated,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/toi-impact-up-cm-orders-spl-teams-to-study-viral-fever-thats-killed-70-in-west-up/articleshow/85776173.cms||Deepak Lavania

The victim, Rituraj Kumar, was a Class XII student of a private school at Etwa Nagar in the district. He was a resident of Binodpur village under Singhaul police outpost in the district. Rituraj’s uncle Gopal Kumar said the boy had left for the school in the morning but did not reach there. “As Rituraj did not return home on time, we started searching for him. However, all our efforts turned futile,” he said. Gopal added a missing complaint was lodged with Singhaul police outpost. “Rituraj’s bicycle and schoolbag were recovered from the premises of the Begusarai railway station a day later. As family members grew suspicious, police detained a person for interrogation but freed him later,” Gopal said.

---||Patna||Janmashtami posters put up by Tej Pratap’s supporters spark row||PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap seems to be in a fickle state of mind. After removing his younger brother Tejashwi Prasad’s image from Janmashtami posters put up here on Sunday evening, Tej shared another poster on his social media account at night giving space to Tejashwi. Several posters of Tej, a devotee of Lord Krishna, were put up here on the occasion of Janmashtami. While these posters had images of his parents, Tejashwi, whom Tej often refers to as his Arjun, was missing. The moment these posters drew the attention of people, Tej tried to end the controversy by including Tejashwi in the poster on his social media accounts. Poster wars are not new in the RJD. Recently, a poster was put up by the Chhatra RJD in which Tej was projected prominently and Tejashwi was left out. The poster was changed within 24 hours with Tejashwi finally getting space. Aakash Yadav, who was the state president of the Chhatra RJD then, was replaced by Gagan Kumar later. Asked why Tej preferred to omit his brother’s photo first and then included it, RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagn said, “These posters have nothing to do with politics. Everyone is aware of the fact that Tej is the follower of Lord Krishna. He is also associated with Iskcon. These posters were put up by his supporters. However, some political leaders are trying to raise the matter just to divert the attention of the people from the real poster war going on in the JD(U). At the national council meeting of the JD(U), party president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh’s picture was missing from the poster.” Tej had publicly criticised party’s state president Jagadanand Singh and national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari recently. However, after returning to Patna from Delhi, he visited the party office on Saturday and sat in his father’s chamber for some time. Later he was taken to another room. Though Jagadanand was present in the office, he did not meet Tej.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/janmashtami-posters-put-up-by-tej-prataps-supporters-spark-row/articleshow/85774112.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Kolkata||Cops follow law, prosecute 50 of their own for flouting road rules||Kolkata: In the past three days, around 50 cops have been prosecuted for breaking traffic rules, including jumping signals, dangerous driving, over-speeding and not wearing helmet while riding two-wheelers. Most of them are constables and assistant sub-inspectors. Kolkata Police, though, stopped short of the action taken by Delhi Police against its errant men who have to pay twice the penalty if they violate traffic rules. The action against Kolkata cops by the traffic police follows a prod by the Lalbazar top brass and comes a few hours before Kolkata Police launches the traffic safety week. “The prosecutions send the message that the law is equal for all. There have been instances when citizens have uploaded videos and photographs on social media of cops breaking traffic rules. The violations include triple-riding, not wearing helmets and violating signals. This is embarrassing. We are here to set examples and not be cited as those breaking the law,” said an officer. Senior officers at Lalbazar said policemen who prosecute people for breaking the law will loose the moral authority to do so if they themselves flout the rules. “As a policeman, special power is vested on a person to prosecute someone. But if the policeman breaks the law himself, he loses the authority to enforce it,” said another officer. Sergeants said their work was simplified by orders from above. A month ago, during a crackdown on illegal parking, cops had found other policemen parking illegally. A civic volunteer who had a fake police sticker on his vehicle got involved in an accident, as did a policeman. On both instances, it was the men in uniform who were at fault. These incidents acted as a catalyst for us to act,” said an officer. Cops are also looking into allegations of police excesses on the road. On Monday, an inquiry was initiated after a biker claimed a traffic cop damaged his phone while prosecuting him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cops-follow-law-prosecute-50-of-their-own-for-flouting-road-rules/articleshow/85778286.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Patna||‘Nitish is PM material’ remark of JD(U) chief triggers debate||PATNA: A day after JD(U) chief Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan said Bihar CM Nitish Kumar is a PM material though he is not in the race for that post, his party’s parliamentary board president Upendra Kushwaha repeated this claim on Monday and said their intention was not to tease anyone (BJP). Lalan had made this statement in the JD(U) national council meeting in Patna on Sunday. JD(U) Nalanda MP Kaushlendra Kumar went a step further and offered Nitish to contest the next Lok Sabha polls from his seat. Kaushlendra even gave the example of Narendra Modi, saying he was also the Gujarat CM before becoming the PM. Nitish as Bihar CM for a long period has also proved his mettle. When asked whom would he prefer between Modi and Nitish as the next PM, Kaushlendra replied, “Definitely Nitish Ji.” While BJP said there was no vacancy for the PM’s post at present and the JD(U) leaders should not be daydreaming, the opposition leaders took a jibe at the NDA leaders’ statements. RJD said Nitish lacks the material of being even a CM while Congress asked him to prove that. When asked by the media about the JD(U) intention behind calling Nitish a PM material and whether they were trying to give any message to their alliance partner BJP, Kushwaha replied, “Over a month ago, I had said that Nitish Ji is a PM material. This is a fact and we are not trying to tell anything to tease anyone. If someone is getting teased, what can we do?” However, BJP cautioned its alliance partner on the issue. BJP’s state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel said the JD(U) leaders were actually showing a dream to Nitish and weakening his position. “People decide who will be the PM and everyone knows Modi’s popularity and people’s love for him. Also, our party is the biggest one in the country and had won 303 Lok Sabha seats. One thing I will like to make very clear is that there is no vacancy for this post in near future,” he said. Amidst this tussle in the NDA, RJD state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said, “Nitish, after joining hands with BJP, has lost even the qualities which a CM should have.” He was referring to the 2015 assembly elections which Nitish had won with RJD and Congress, but parting ways to form a new government with BJP in 2017. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra claimed that the NDA government will fall by the time UP election gets closer and there will be mid-term polls in Bihar. He also said only his party leader Rahul Gandhi is the alternative of Modi in the country. “How can someone working with PM Modi on his agenda will become his alternative. That too someone from the party like JD(U) which has no stature outside Bihar. Such statements show that all is not well between BJP and JD(U) and Nitish is looking for reasons to part ways with the BJP,” said Mishra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/nitish-is-pm-material-remark-of-jdu-chief-triggers-debate/articleshow/85773389.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The college, which imparts teaching in Arts , Science and Commerce streams at undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) level, has the sanctioned strength of 136 teachers, out of which at least 53 posts are vacant. According to college principal Prof Pravin Kumar, mathematics department has five sanctioned posts but no teacher. The department has 1,200 students at the Intermediate Science and 1540 at degree honours level. The department of English has five sanctioned posts, but has only one teacher, he said. Similarly, Hindi is a compulsory subject. The department has 10 sanctioned posts, but four teachers only. One of the teachers of Hindi department is to retire shortly, Kumar said, adding that the departments of Urdu, Persian, Pali and Bengali have no teachers. Prakrit department has four sanctioned posts, but one teacher. Besides, faculty crunch has also hit hard departments of physics, chemistry, botany and zoology. While physics department has two teachers against five sanctioned posts, departments of botany, chemistry and zoology have four, three and two teachers respectively, the principal said. According to PG head of commerce department, Prof Sanjeev Nath, there are 13 sanctioned posts of teachers, but only six are working. There are around 1300 students in ICom, 1924 in BCom and 113 at PG level in each semester, he said, adding the college is also running university PG classes as the PPU has no separate roof for that. The principal said the university had already been informed about faculty crunch in January last year. Departments like geography, psychology, history, ancient history, political science, Sanskrit, sociology and economics are facing shortage of teachers. “The college will find it difficult to hold classes smoothly in these subjects. The university should work out a contingency plan to appoint guest faculty at the earliest,” he said. When contacted , a PPU official said the university would soon start fresh appointment of guest faculty in each major subject.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/53-of-136-posts-of-teachers-lying-vacant-at-b-d-college/articleshow/85774710.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Business||ITAT: iPad not PC, can’t be depreciated at 60% rate||Mumbai: To you, your trusted iPad may be a handy computer. After all, in this work-from-home era, you use it to attend video-call meetings or even to draft a detailed email to a client, or to quickly look up your Powerpoint file before an important (albeit virtual) presentation. In short, this device packs a punch. But when it comes to claiming tax depreciation, things can get complicated as the rate for a computer is 60%, against the general 15%. Recently, the Amritsar bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) held that an iPad is a communication device and not a computer. Thus, it restricted the depreciation that Kohinoor Indian, a Jalandhar-based private company, could claim to 15% (further reducing it to 7.5% based on the date of purchase of the asset). This order, which was uploaded on a niche tax portal, has sparked a round of debate among tax professionals. Globeview Advisors founder Ameya Kunte said, “To avoid future litigation, the depreciation rates should be revised considering the reality of the post-Covid world.” The term computer is not defined under the Income Tax (I-T) Act. However, under the Information Technology (IT) Act, the bare function of composing and sending an email and receiving a reply qualifies an Apple iPad as a computer.Of course, an iPad also performs many other functions of a computer such as word processing, preparing spreadsheets & Powerpoint presentations, accessing the internet, etc. For those interested in the technicalities, under the IT Act, an electronic device that performs data processing through manipulation of electronic impulses qualifies as being a computer. The ITAT bench dived deep into various technicalities of a computer and an iPad. It finally concluded that an iPad is a communication and not a computing device as its main features are email, WhatsApp, Facetime, calls and entertainment (music, films). Even though it may discharge some of the functions of a computer, it is not a substitute for a computer or laptop. Lastly, Apple stores also do not sell iPads as a computer device but as a communication/entertainment device, observed the ITAT bench. Relying on various judicial decisions, the ITAT bench summed up that every taxing statute must be interpreted strictly. The benefit of ambiguity in case of an exemption (in this case a lower depreciation rate) must be strictly interpreted in favour of the revenue authorities. Thus, while the private company had treated an iPad as akin to a computer and claimed higher depreciation at 60%, this claim was denied and the ITAT ruled on a lower rate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/itat-ipad-not-pc-cant-be-depreciated-at-60-rate/articleshow/85783062.cms||---

A large number of people also celebrated the birth of Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu, in their houses with a view to protecting themselves from Covid-19. Janmashtami was the first festival celebrated in temples after the issuance of a fresh Unlock order on Wednesday last. The authorities, therefore, made sure that all the devotees adopted Covid-appropriate behaviour and wore face masks. The Naulakha Mandir in Danapur Cantonment area was decorated with flowers, leaves, and lights to mark the birth of Lord Krishna. He was also offered 56 types of delicacies at midnight. Seema Singh, a devotee, told this reporter, “I will see the ‘maha aarti’ after the temple’s main door opens at 7pm.” The Mahavir Mandir near the Patna Junction was also decked up on the occasion of Janmashtami. A temple employee, Akash, said, “We have dressed up Lord Krishna beautifully and will start the puja at 9pm.” A priest at a Danapur temple, Ram Dayal Mishra, pointed out, “Only a few devotees visited the temple in the morning. More people are expected to come here at night.” The Shiva temple on Gola Road also witnessed increased footfalls in the morning. “Everyone wore masks and entered the temple one by one,” a priest claimed. Neha Shweta, a resident of Patliputra Colony, said, “I am excited to attend the main puja at a nearby temple at 11:30pm.” Another devotee, Rana Pratap, loved watching kids dressed as Lord Krishna and Radha. He and his family, however, celebrated the festival at home.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/decked-up-temples-in-patna-attract-devotees/articleshow/85774826.cms||---

This is the seventh arrest within a week after the crime. A four-man armed gang had looted a jewellery shop in Vidyaranyapuram on the evening of August 23 and just as they were fleeing, they shot dead a a customer who was just outside the shop. The man who shot dead mason Chandru, 23, was arrested from West Bengal. He had shaved off his moustache after the crime to avoid being identified. Police identified him with the help of his wife from an airport. Soon after the crime, the group split and flew out to different parts of the country.The six were arrested from J&K and West Bengal, within four days after the crime.

---||Patna||JD(U) to focus on assembly polls in UP and Manipur||PATNA: A day after its crucial national council meeting where party’s top brass gave a clarion call for its expansion in other states, JD(U) on Monday decided to focus on the forthcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and Manipur in a bid to achieve the status of a ‘national party’. Though altogether five states -- Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand – are going to hold assembly polls in early 2022, the JD(U) leadership, as a part of electoral strategy, has decided to contest in Uttar Pradesh and Manipur only. Sources said the party’s top brass, including Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan and former president & Union steel minister RCP Singh gave a green signal for contesting the assembly polls in the two states. “We will prefer to make a pre-poll alliance with BJP in Uttar Pradesh, whereas we have so far decided to go solo in Manipur,” JD(U) national general secretary Afaque Ahmad Khan told TOI on Monday. JD(U)’s national secretary general K C Tyagi, who had earlier announced to contest 200 assembly seats in the BJP-ruled UP, has now changed his mind. Tyagi, who is also the JD(U) in-charge for UP, said, “JD(U)’s priority will be to form an electoral alliance with the BJP. If it does not happen, we will contest independently.” The JD(U) had not contested the UP assembly elections in 2017 despite massive preparations. Its then national president, Nitish Kumar, had addressed more than half a dozen pre-poll rallies in Kurmi-Kushwaha dominated areas in the run-up to the UP polls, but later decided not to contest as it was preparing to return to the NDA fold in Bihar. Khan said the party has decided to contest Manipur assembly polls with all its strength with a mission to achieve the status of the ‘state party’ in another northeastern state. Currently, the JD(U) has the status of ‘state party’ in Bihar and Arunachal Pradesh. It requires the ‘state party’ status in two more states to achieve its target of becoming a ‘national party.’ “It has also been decided to send the party’s national secretary, Ram Prit Mandal, to Manipur in the first week of September to assess the ground situation,” Khan told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/jdu-to-focus-on-assembly-polls-in-up-and-manipur/articleshow/85775171.cms||Madan Kumar

NOU vice-chancellor K C Sinha told the newspaper that admission in online mode is already going on since July 29, but keeping in view the ease of students and also due to unavailability of internet connectivity in rural areas, the admission facility is also being extended in offline mode. “The last date for online or offline admission to all NOU courses for the current session is September 30,” he said. The VC further pointed out that students need not come to the university headquarters in Patna alone for seeking admission. They can also secure admission at more than 220 study centres located in different parts of the state. NOU also runs a study centre for prisoners at Beur Central Jail at Patna. Prospectus and other details of courses are available at all the study centres, he added. NOU registrar Ghan Shyam Roy said the university has been admitting students to as many 105 study programmes, including courses 28 post-graduate courses, seven PG diploma courses, 27 degree courses and more than 25 certificate courses. There is no limitation of seats in all these courses as these are open to all eligible students possessing the required qualifications. NOU registrar (examinations) Neelam Kumari pointed out that women get 25% concession in fee at the time of admission. She said students can get themselves admitted to NOU directly at the university headquarters or any of the study centres after submitting the desired documents and course fee.

---||Business||No GST on hostel fees if less than Rs 1k per day||Mumbai: The Maharashtra bench of the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) has held that hostel fees charged to students will not attract goods and services tax (GST) where the rent per room is less than Rs 1,000 per day, per person. This will be subject to a ‘nil’ rate under Entry Number 14. Further, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has also clarified in its circular dated February 12, 2018 that, if the lodging fees are below this prescribed monetary limit, it will be exempt from GST. In this case, Ghodawat Eduserve, a Kolhapur-based entity, was providing commercial training and coaching services to students of standards 11 and 12. These students were appearing for the competitive IIT and other exams in the science stream. The hostel facilities provided were optional and were not part of the coaching fees. The hostel provided for basic residential facilities on a room-sharing basis, for a yearly sum of Rs 34,000, or approximately Rs 94 per day. The AAR had to dive deep into the meaning of ‘residential dwelling’, as this was not specifically covered under GST laws. The bench pointed out that food facility is not available at the hostel — it is provided at the mess. Nor could any guests such as family members stay along with the students. Thus, the criteria for ‘residential dwelling’ under the common parlance test is not satisfied and exemption under Entry Number 12 will not be available. However, the wider definition under Entry Number 14 helped the applicant entity. This covered services by a hotel, inn, guest-house, club or campsite “by whatever name called” for residential or lodging purposes, where the tariff was less than Rs 1,000 per day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-gst-on-hostel-fees-if-less-than-rs-1k-per-day/articleshow/85783060.cms||---

Based on the woman’s complaint and subsequent medical reports, the neighbour was arrested and remanded in police custody for four days. The survivor, who lost her parents, lives in the flat with her two elder brothers. Her family told police she mostly stayed at home and was under medication for a minor mental condition. The alleged incident took place between 6.30pm and 7.30pm on Saturday, when the woman’s brothers were away, said the police. According to the complaint lodged by one of the brothers, she was alone at home when the 32-year-old accused sneaked into their flat on finding the main door unlocked. When one of the brothers returned home around 7.30pm, he found the woman in a dishevelled state, room in a mess and Rs 2,000 kept in a drawer missing. When the brother questioned the woman, she reportedly told him about the torture, how the neighbour allegedly raped her and fled with the money. “According to the complainant, the youth raped his sister in their absence. Based on the complaint and the woman’s statement, we arrested the youth and charged him with rape under IPC Section 376,” said a senior officer at Bidhannagar City Police. According to a source, the woman and the accused knew each other and she told police that this was not the first time that he had forced himself on her. Following the complaint, a medical examination confirmed signs of intercourse, police said.

Singh said, “We will use ‘Teeka Express’ and mini buses for maximum coverage in the rural areas of Patna district.” Patna civil surgeon, Dr Vibha Kumari Singh, pointed out that instructions had been issued to all the medical officers to coordinate with each other for successful execution of the mega vaccination campaign. “An awareness drive has been conducted in all the panchayats to attract a large number of people to the vaccination centres,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/2-5l-people-in-patna-targeted-for-inoculation-today/articleshow/85774640.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Mumbai||‘Phygital learning’ key to return to schools: Experts||PUNE: Equitable access to schools when they reopen for in-person classes, increasing effective instruction time, preparing a school-readiness programme that focuses on socio-economic learning, identifying at what stage of learning the children are, and mobilising community volunteers were among the 10 important recommendations made by a panel of 16 educational institutions in Maharashtra. Their report titled ‘Make School Children Ready During and After the Pandemic’ suggested that adopting “phygital learning”, which includes the use of technology to deliver education along with coordinated teacher-parent interventions at home and in-person classroom instructions, would be the key to building back learning outcomes when schools reopen. The Central Square Foundation published the report and the recommendations made by the 16 organisations. The report titled ‘Rebuild Back Better’ said, “In India, 250 million children have been out of school for over 15 months. With barely 40% of children being able to access any form of digital learning, it is likely that learning for students enrolled in government and low-fee private schools has been minimal.” The impact of schools’ closure has been disproportionately heavy in primary grades where children are dependent on parents or older siblings for access to digital learning and were last on the priority list to return to school during the brief period when they operated physically in early 2021. The 16 organisations working in the education sector have collaboratively drawn on their learnings from the past year to develop a concerted strategy to rebuild the education system. As a collective, the organisations converged on critical challenges when children return to school. The report said thoughtful and urgent steps are needed to be taken to avoid irreversible damage to an entire generation of children who stand to lose an average of 3-5% of their lifetime earnings when they enter the workforce. “Over the last few months, the education sector, including government bodies and non-governmental organizations, and civil society organizations, have worked to investigate the stated problems and identify possible solutions,” the report added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/phygital-learning-key-to-return-to-schools-experts/articleshow/85776202.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Accused Subha Sarkar (28) was picked up from his home after the women lodged a complaint with the cops. The sisters and a friend of the younger one who was with them at the Kanjialpara complex are recuperating from their injuries. According to the victims, Subha Sarkar had stormed into their rented home around 2.30am on Sunday and began assaulting the trio with bare hands and a frying pan from the kitchen. “Sarkar kicked and slapped me and when my friend and elder sister came to my rescue, he and his friends attacked them as well. My sister was punched on her nose and she fell bleeding while my friend was dragged out of the flat while being kicked and punched. He suffered a fractured hand that needs surgery,” said the younger sister, a singer at a Baguiati bar. Police said the woman was in a relationship with Sarkar (28), a resident of Chingrihata, for the past year. However, their relationship had turned sour recently and she moved on. “He used to hit me and treat me badly. Hence, I told him that I no longer wished to stay with him. But he threatened me that he would not let me be with anyone else. He had also threatened to pour acid on me,” the 23-year-old woman said. The assault left the entire flat in a mess, with blood droplets dotting the place and the furniture ransacked. The men left the two women injured inside the flat and the other youth, Md Rizwan, writhing in pain on the ground floor of the building. He had to be hospitalized. Cops said they are still on the lookout for three accomplices of the accused and are questioning the security guards of the complex to know how they managed get inside.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ex-lover-assaults-woman-sister/articleshow/85778731.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Sinhala runaway hit ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ gets a Bengali folk touch||Kolkata: After Amitabh Bachchan and Parineeti Chopra, it’s musicians like Adarsh Ray, Ronit Basak, Anirban Sur, Keshab Dey and Tanmoy Saadhak who are smitten with the Sri Lankan hit ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ and are outdoing each other in releasing Bengali cover versions. Some of these covers have gone viral and the artistes are now planning second editions. The original Sinhala song was produced by Chamath Sangeeth in July 2020 and uploaded on YouTube on May 22 this year. The video, featuring Yohani de Silva and Satheeshan Rathnayaka, became an internet sensation, moving beyond the island nation to gain popularity even in Bengal’s backyard. Singer Iman Chakraborty describes it as a “refreshing song”. “In these difficult times, people have got a hummable and happy tune they are enjoying,” she said. That’s also a reason why it has appealed to the man on the street as well as celebrities, many of who including actors Oindrila Sen, Neel Bhattacharya, Madhumita Sarcar are making instagram reels using 15-30 seconds of it.  Actor Chandreyee Ghosh, who posted a reel, loves the song’s “rawness and innocence” that has been “sung straight from the heart”. “Technology hasn’t played a big role in its production. For me, this song is like a conversation with one’s own self,” she said. The last time the country witnessed such a phenomenon was a decade ago when Anirudh and Dhanush sang ‘Why this kolaveri di?’ in Tamil. Listeners didn’t understand the lyrics, and yet, connected with the song. Released in 2011, it has garnered over 289 million views on the official music label’s channel. ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ got 60 million views last week. Anirban Sur did a Bangla folk mash-upSur has done a Bangla folk mash-up, mixing the song with ‘Tomae hridmajhare rakhbo’, ‘Tomar ghore bosot kore’ and ‘Lal paharir deshe ja’ while Basak, better known as JJ RoNN in the Hip Hop-RnB circuit of Kolkata, has remixed it with Odisha’s ‘Rangabati’ song. Both Anirban and Ronit are 25-year-old musicians with their own YouTube channels who never attempted any cover version of ‘Kolaveri di’.  Basak said, “I don’t understand the lyrics but I love the catchy tune and the cute singer. So I wrote my own lyrics — ‘Tomar oi korun chokhe/Mon amar jeno geche bhesey, akashey’. Music producer Axation remade Chamath Sangeeth’s beat for my version.” Iman Chakraborty is pleasantly surprised that his cover has remixed the song with her ‘Rangabati’ number from ‘Gotro’. “There is no negativity in music and it’s good to know that my song has been remixed to create this new number,” she said. Ronit Basak better known as JJ RoNN in the Hip Hop RnB circuit of Kolkata has remixed it with Odisha’s ‘Rangabati’ songSur, however, understood the original lyrics and found a similarity with Bengal’s indigenous folk songs. “That’s why I punched it with our popular folk numbers, with lyrics like: ‘Ekjone chobi aake ek mone oh o mon/aar ekjone boshe boshe rong makhe oh o mon’,” he said. While he shot his video on a terrace, Basak went to Eco Park to shoot his mash-up. Anirban is planning to release a second edition of the cover next week where he will punch the song with ‘Tui shyam sayore naite jabi’, ‘Kada dili sada kapore’ and ‘Kemon boka montare’. Ronit’s video has already garnered 3.4 million views. “I will now remix it with ‘Lilabali’, ‘Noya daman’, ‘Ogo tomar akash duti chokhe’and ‘Faguner o mohonay’ and will include my rap too,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/sinhala-runaway-hit-manike-mage-hithe-gets-a-bengali-folk-touch/articleshow/85778962.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Martin Rohan Gomes, who works as a manager in a restaurant, was arrested. The condition of his mother, Jaya, is critical while his sister Ritu Rosemary is stable and out of danger. The accused’s wife, Koel, managed to escape, though she, too, was threatened. The accused’s father is the main bread earner in the family and works in Oman. According to cops, Gomes had been demanding money and his mother suspected he was going back to drugs. “Jaya had brought him home from rehab about a year ago. Of late, Gomes had become irritable and arguments had become common at home,” said neighbour Sharmila Mondal. On Monday, an argument broke out between Gomes and Koel around 5am. As it turned violent, Jaya and Ritu decided to stand by her, which escalated the confrontation. Around 5.30am, he picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed Jaya in the shoulder at least six times. When Ritu tried to intervene, she was stabbed in her stomach before being kicked. “We received information that Gomes was not opening the flat door despite neighbours knocking. By the time cops reached the spot, locals had broken in. We received a letter of complaint from Ritu and drew up a case of attempt to murder against Gomes,” said DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/24-yr-old-man-stabs-mom-sis-after-tiff-over-money/articleshow/85778796.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A senior officer associated with the investigation said on Monday that an EOU team has already joined the investigation. “The case will be transferred after completing the formalities in a day or two,” he revealed. The engineer posted in Darbhanga division has been booked under relevant sections of the Election Commission’s model code of conduct and Prevention of Corruption Act besides accumulating assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. An FIR was lodged against him on the statement of Phakuli police outpost SHO Uday Kumar Singh on Saturday after the recovery of Rs18 lakh from his vehicle when he was on way to Patna from Darbhanga. The interrogation of Anil and his driver Saroj Kumar Singh continued for the third consecutive day on Monday. Muzaffarpur additional SP (West) Syed Imran Masood said both the accused may be released on PR bond after interrogation. During investigation, it came to light that Anil had purchased two plots of land in Patna besides two flats at Jagdeo Path and Veterinary College road respectively. The market value of the purchased land was yet to be assessed. During search of his rented accommodation on Saturday night, the police had recovered Rs49 lakh. The investigation revealed that he also owned two luxury vehicles. A senior officer on the condition of anonymity said, “The scrutiny of the seized documents is being done. Further action will be taken after verification from the sub-registrars’ offices.” However, a silly mistake not to seize the driver’s mobile phone provided an opportunity to the engineer’s wife to shift the valuables from the flat in the state capital. The raiding team had to return empty-handed from the flat on Saturday. Meanwhile, the RWD is set to initiate departmental proceedings against Anil on the report sent by the Muzaffarpur police and authorities in Darbhanga. ‘Many people will be exposed’:The superintending engineer, Anil Kumar, told the interrogators on Monday that many people would be exposed if he opened his mouth. “Agar mein muh kholunga to bisphot ho jayega,” an investigating officer quoted Anil as saying. He, however, refused to disclose the names he was referring to.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/eou-to-take-up-darbhanga-engineers-cash-assets-case/articleshow/85776153.cms||Ramashankar

The state saved 3,430 million units of energy (0.295 million tonnes of oil equivalent) worth Rs 2,350 crore and saw a reduction of 1.38 million tonnes of CO2 in PAT cycle-2. According to the BEE, the AP industries achieved 0.205 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) savings in PAT cycle-1. The BEE is implementing the PAT scheme, a market-based compliance mechanism, to accelerate energy efficiency in large energy-intensive industries through certification of energy savings that could be traded. In order to recognise the progress made by the industries under the PAT cycle-II, the BEE organised an interactive national webinar with industries designated consumers (DCs) in the presence of secretary, union ministry of power, Alok Kumar. The secretary, MoP, released the Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts) to the DCs of PAT cycle-2 through a dedicated online portal, PATNET. Speaking on this occasion, Alok Kumar appreciated the pro-active industries in PAT cycle-2. He said their sustained efforts are clearly visible through the energy saving certificates which are considered another revenue stream. “Energy savings weigh as the best solution for sustainability through reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,” said Alok Kumar. Director general, BEE, Abhay Bakre, said energy efficiency through PAT would play a major role in improving energy security, economy, industrial productivity, jobs and access to energy, which will consequently lead to social development and prosperity. Deputy director general, BEE, Dr Ashok Kumar, said the DCs under PAT cycle-2 across the nation saved around 14.08 million tonnes of oil equivalent (against the 8.8 Mtoe savings of cycle-1). This is equivalent to coal savings of 31 million tonnes and reduction of Co2 emissions to the tune of 66 million tonnes. Out of the 542 DCs in the country across 11 industrial sectors, 349 DCs performed well and exceeded their targets. They were issued 57.38 lakh ESCerts. The remaining 193 DCs are required to purchase 36.68 lakh ESCerts against their shortfall to reach the set targets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/pat-scheme-sets-industries-on-path-of-energy-efficiency/articleshow/85776249.cms||---

People are not getting dry ration and polythene sheets as flood relief measures, said former Katihar MP Tariq Anwar after visiting the flood-hit areas of Barsoi, Pranpur, Balrampur, Azamnagar, Barari, Manihari and Kursela where Mahananda and Ganga rivers were wreaking havoc. “Several health sub-centres are non-functional in the district and animals have taken shelter in them. Healthcare is on number two as priority sector of the Bihar government. A big budgetary provision has been made in this regard. Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad belongs to Katihar and it is his constituency also. But, the state government has not been taking any concrete steps to improve the civic amenities of the town. Rampant corruption is prevailing in the Katihar municipal corporation,” Anwar told the mediapersons on Monday. On the Centre’s National Monetisation Pipeline, he said, “The economic situation of the country is miserable. The Modi government is planning to sell railways and other profit-making PSUs at throwaway prices. Lakhs of people will become jobless. The Congress will oppose the Centre’s ‘obliging policy’ for the capitalists.” When asked about an alleged outsourcing scam worth crores of rupees in the district health department, in which tendering rate for the housekeeping was inflated and later reverted to the old rate to siphon off money, the former MP said, “It is a big scam and needs a thorough investigation. A sum of Rs8 crore was misused. The money trail must be traced and action must be taken against the culprits.” The alleged bungling occurred between October 9, 2012 and 2020, wherein the rate of cleaning work was Rs13.50 per square metre. But, the rate was suddenly increased to Rs63.63 per square metre for the period between October 10, 2020 and June 9, 2021. Though, from June 10, the same tender rate was reverted to the old one.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/flood-hit-people-not-getting-dry-ration-polythene-sheets/articleshow/85776252.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Education a distant dream for kids of these nomadic tribes||JAIPUR: The De-Notified and Nomadic Tribes (DNT) have shown little progress in education, courtesy decades of neglect and ostracisation by the society. Without documentation it is difficult to get admission in schools. Higher education is a far-fetched dream for most of them. The survey report compares the literacy rate of India with DNT and other communities. It shows that in 2017-18 all-India literacy rate was 77.7%. In Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh it was 69.7%, 82.4% and 73.7%, respectively. This survey of the DNT communities conducted a year later in 2019-20 shows the average literacy rate of DNT children (aged above six years) to be 47%, much lower than that of all India and the three states. If we consider the literacy rate of parents separately then it is much lower. The literacy rate among the girls is 42% while among boys it is 51.9%. The survey data of the eight DNT communities shows that 71.4% parents have never seen a school (non-enrolment), 26.9% dropped out of the school at an early stage and only 1.6% completed their studies. Atish Indrekr Chhara, program officer of Budhan Theatre, (Gujarat-based organisation that participated in the survey) said, “These communities, due to their nomadic trait, don’t have proper documentation as they keep moving from one place to another. As most of them live outside the villages, the distance of schools from their place of stay is far which is difficult for young children to cover. Moreover, there is a lot of caste discrimination towards these children by villagers. All these factors are responsible for DNT children not opting for education.” He added that there are not many role models in the community people can look up to. Only two students in Gujarat from DNT community are pursuing engineering and are now seen as inspiration for others but these examples are few. The Gadia Luhar community sees maximum dropouts and non-enrolment rate of 57.7%. Similarly, in the Kalbeliya and Pardhi communities the dropout and non-enrolment rate stands at 46.4% and 47.2%, respectively. According to the survey, less than 1% children are able to achieve higher education degrees. Government jobs are far from their reach.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/education-a-distant-dream-for-kids-of-these-nomadic-tribes/articleshow/85781076.cms||---

A low pressure area is building over Vidarbha which is expected to move westward, bringing heavy showers at isolated places in city, while parts of Thane, Raigad and Palghar may see more intense rainfall with an orange alert in place. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist at IMD Mumbai, said that in the coming 3-4 days, Maharashtra is expected to see increased rainfall activity with extremely heavy rain also likely at some places. “In Konkan, parts of Thane, Palghar, Raigad and Mumbai could see heavy rain activity,” she said. Mumbai recorded only 289.4mm rain in August this year as against the average of 546.2mm that the month records normally. This is only 53% of the required rainfall for August. On the contrary, the months of June and July recorded rain in excess. For August 31 and September 1, the IMD has issued a yellow alert for Mumbai, indicating heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places while an orange alert has been issued for Thane and Raigad for August 31. Meanwhile, Palghar has been placed under a yellow alert for Tuesday, and an orange alert has been issued for September 1. The IMD has also forecast that with rains, the maximum and minimum temperatures in the city, hovering around 31 degrees and 26 degrees, respectively, are also likely to see a dip.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-records-only-53-of-its-required-rain-in-aug/articleshow/85782825.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Jaipur||Criminal Act repealed 69 years ago, but communities continue to be looked upon suspiciously by society||JAIPUR: The contribution of De-notified and Nomadic Tribes (DNT) in spreading India’s name around the world is phenomenal, but decades of ostracization, neglect, harassment and being branded as criminals makes it difficult for these tribes to be accepted in the society. On October 12, 1871, the British government enforced Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) that branded many nomadic and tribal communities as criminals. The subsequent amendments in the CTA in 1911 and 1924 subsumed many communities under its purview. The CTA 1924 was applied across India listing 191 communities under it. Under the Act, the local government was empowered to notify any tribe, gang, or class of people as criminal tribe and to make reformatory settlements. These settlements were places where nomadic tribes were forced to settle in ‘open prison’ with restrictions on their movement. They had to give their attendance periodically to the village headman or at the police chowki. On being found absent, they were punished or exploited by the headman or police officials. Criminality was not an identity of these wandering tribes until they were notified as such by the colonial rulers under the CTA. The Act was repealed on August 31, 1952 setting free 191 DNT communities who celebrate this day as their ‘Vimukti Diwas’ or Independence Day. Although now repealed, its impact can still be seen on the community members. Madan Meena, executive member of Kota Heritage society and coordinator of the report, said that until a few years ago, the community members had to give ‘hajiri’ (attendance) at the local police station. “The eight communities we studied are still harassed by the police, jailed under false pretext and beaten up. Most of the community people don’t use their community’s name but their ‘gotra’ if they admit their children to school due to fear of discrimination. Till today, mostly marginalized, these communities live outside the villages where there are no civic facilities. There is an urgent need to chart out special packages for these communities from the government,” said Meena. Kanjar community youth living in Madhya Pradesh have complained that there are no hostel facilities for them to study in cities and they cannot get a house on rent if they reveal their true identity. Pallav Thudgar, member from Muskan organization in Madhya Pradesh said that women of Bediya community, if enrolled in school, have to face difficulty as stigma of sex-worker is attached to them. He said that due to various acts, the community members cannot practice their traditional profession as snake-charmers, hunters and with no other skill, they are left to work as labourers, garbage collectors or in the agriculture fields. Community members demand focused policies for their upliftment by the government without which these communities find it difficult to get respectful status in the society.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/criminal-act-repealed-69-years-ago-but-communities-continue-to-be-looked-upon-suspiciously-by-society/articleshow/85781106.cms||Parul Kulshrestha

Several makeshift eateries set up along the lakes are selling snacks to visitors. In the absence of garbage bins, visitors often throw waste in the open. Waste carried by wind ends up in the lakes, resulting in environmental problems.Farahath Nisha of Gandhipuram, who visited the Ukkadam Periyakulam with her family, said she could not find a garbage bin there. “We kept waste in a bag to discard it later. But I don’t expect all visitors to do it. Waste is littered even near the I Love Kovai selfie corner,” she told TOI. “Officials should immediately place adequate bins and ensure that visitors use them. Food stalls should be placed some distance away from the fence, so that people don’t eat inside the premises.”Waste discarded by visitors is creating an eyesore on the Valankulam lake stretch, said P K Rajendran, a visitor. “Apart from placing adequate bins, authorities should install signboards urging people not to throw waste in open place,” he said.An official with the engineering wing of the corporation said that the civic body will take all measures to maintain cleanliness at lakes. An inspection will be carried out soon to find out the issues, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/lack-of-garbage-bins-spoils-beauty-of-lakes/articleshow/85781095.cms||V Devanathan

We are expecting a final word from the state government on Monday night or Tuesday. But that should not stop the schools from preparing for reopening.”A teacher with the corporation higher secondary school at RS Puram said all the standard operating procedures would be followed if the schools were allowed to operate as per the earlier order. “There will be only 20 students in each class and classes will be conducted on alternative days for students of each class.

But classes will not be split as it would take more teachers to handle the same class. But disallowing offline classes for Kerala students has made colleges to plan online classes separately for them,” an administrator from a private college in Coimbatore said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/only-online-classes-for-day-scholars-from-kerala/articleshow/85781099.cms||---

A newly-wed bride was among the dead, while the groom survived after their car was washed away. In the incident in Vikarabad on Sunday night, the newly-weds along with 4 others got trapped after their car got stuck in a stream.

The move comes in the wake of a number of complaints made by residents and market welfare associations about the dilapidated condition of toilets. The MC plans to give all 35 of them in city markets on CSR (Corporate social responsibility) basis. The issue of poor maintenance of public toilets is a longstanding one. According to market welfare association members, foul smell emanating from the toilets is affecting the business of a few shopkeepers nearby. Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said the MC has 35 public toilets and when he looked into their poor condition, it came to light that employees of Sulabh Agency had not received their salaries from March onwards. Now, the MC has opened tenders for repair and renovation of 35 public toilets in the city on CSR basis. Mayor Goyal said that the firm which will do this work will be allowed to earn 75% income from advertisements while 25% would be that of the MC. At present, the MC pays the Sulabh agency, but now, it will earn from public toilets, he added. One of the staff members working at a public toilet and with the Sulabh agency said, “Our employer told us that the MC is not releasing funds, which is why salaries are not being paid.” Market Welfare Association members asked the MC to take strict action against the Sulabh agency for causing public harassment and for not paying the staff. President, Lok Sarvhitkari Society, Rakesh Aggarwal said, “The wrongdoings of the agency were known earlier too and the issues were often raised by residents but no one took any action. Some action should be taken and recovery should be ordered for the past four years from the agency.” The mayor said that the MC is also purchasing 100 e-toilets, including one-seat, two-seat and five-seat toilets to be placed at spots most vulnerable to open defecation. Photo quotes: Rakesh Aggarwal | President, Lok Sarvhitkari Society Strict action must be taken against the agency for its wrongdoings and wastage of public money S K Nayar | President, Citizen Welfare Association The situation is so bad that one cannot even cross a public toilet from outside, how can one use it? With a large number of sanitation workers with the MC, a dedicated team must be appointed till the CSR starts functioning Kulbhushan Goyal | Mayor We have a contract with the Sulabh Agency till November this year, but the tender for repairing and renovation of toilets under the CSR scheme will be opened on August 31.

This makes it difficult for them to get benefits of the government schemes. According to a study on DNT communities conducted by Bhasha Research and Publication Centre, Vadodara and five other organizations in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, due to non-institutionalised childbirth, the average number of households in which all the members have birth certificates is only 19.3%, while in 58% households, only some of the family members have them and in 22.8% households, none of the family members has birth certificates. The process of getting the birth certificates is tedious, the illiterate parents particularly find it tough. No birth certificates mean difficulty in getting admission in schools. Hiralal Gadia Luhar, a youth leader of Gadia Luhar community in Jaipur said that most of his community members face immense difficulty in getting their children admitted to schools. Majority of children are still not able to attend school due to this technical reason. An analysis of job cards availability with the different communities in three states for MNREGA shows that an average of 42.2% DNT communities in rural areas do not have job cards. This percentage is very high among the Pardhi community surveyed in Madhya Pradesh which stands at 85.2%. Among the Bachhada and Kalbeliya communities, 53.2% and 54.8% respectively, don’t have job cards. Pardhi, living in rural areas are forced to live outside the village because of the stigma of criminality. As they are remotely located and because of their migration in search of livelihood, many of them missed the survey for being included under the MNREGA in 2011. The Kanjar and Bediya families who are involved in sex trade also avoid participating in MNREGA works. Similar, situation is seen in case of BPL card. Under the present survey the average percentage of the DNT communities with no BPL cards is 51.7%. The data shows that 75.4% members of the Pardhi community do not have BPL cards followed by Kanjar and Bediya. Trustee of Bhasha Research and Publication Centre, Vadodara and coordinator of the report, Madan Meena who was part of this survey in Rajasthan said, “Due to their nomadic nature, most of these communities’ members couldn’t get any documentation. To get their votes, local leaders have made their voter ID cards and Aadhaar cards, but it has been found that many people provide wrong information. The decades of stigmatisation, neglect by the society and authorities have forced these communities to live in pitiable conditions.” Major setback for these communities get is lack of a caste certificate which prevents them from getting benefits in reservation or any other government schemes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/de-notified-tribes-no-docus-no-access-to-govt-schemes/articleshow/85781141.cms||Parul Kulshrestha

The number of tests should be increased further to check the spread of virus effectively. Health staff, accredited social health activists, anganwadi workers and people’s representatives should monitor cases in home quarantine,” he said. More emphasis should be given to trace all primary contacts of infected persons. Those who have symptoms of Covid-19 should be compulsorily admitted to Covid care centres (CCC) or hospitals, he added. Deputy commissioner KV Rajendra said the district has a positivity rate of 2.27% and there are 29 containment zones and 28 micro containment zones.

The city will get 110 million gallons of water per day (MGD) less. A pump house of the clear water reservoir (CWR) at Mallaram in Siddipet, about 130 kilometres from the city, was inundated due to flash floods in a rivulet in the wee hours of Monday. Pallecheruvu, a rivulet, breached the compound wall and inundated the pump house. Officials started work to flush out floodwater from the pump house using motors, which were shifted from Bommakal water treatment plant. Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) built CWR to supply 172 MGD of Godavari water by tapping raw water at Yellampalli barrage. The raw water used to be treated and stored at Mallaram reservoir. After the incident, HMWS&SB managing director M Dana Kishore put in place a contingency plan to compensate the shortfall, 110 MGD water. “We will supply 79 MGD —40 MGD from Singur, 27 MGD from Osmansagar & Himayathsagar and another 12 MGD from Krishna— from other sources to compensate the loss,” the HMWS&SB chief told TOI. To restore normalcy, it might take 72 hours. Consumers have to use water judiciously, he added. Dana Kishore, who rushed to the site, said they have put forth a proposal to build a retaining wall along the rivulet to prevent breaches of the compound wall and prevent excess water from Pallecheruvu flooding CWR. During teleconferences, Kishore directed officials to ensure free water tankers to all slums.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/godavari-supply-hit-as-flash-flood-inundates-siddipet-pump-house/articleshow/85782843.cms||Sunil Mungara

The overall achievement has neared the targeted 70% of population as the district’s estimated population is around 40 lakh, including 25 lakh in the city. As compared to August, July had recorded 16 deaths, 494 cases and 728 recoveries. Between the two months, large number of Covid tests were done by the public and private labs. As on August 29, the district has performed more than 34.14 lakh tests. In July, over two lakh were done. Given the steady decline in daily cases, the tests have slid to 1.28 lakh in August. As per officials, the district would need to achieve 64 lakh vaccinations to assume its mission is accomplished. The estimate is drawn considering the district population.

We shall start expediting the second dose too. We have started reaching out to those who are unable to visit the centre,” he said. The civic chief further said that more number of people may have developed immunity than the assumption. “While a big number has been vaccinated, some have developed natural antibodies from infection,” he said. Yet, he warned that vaccination doesn’t guarantee 100% protection and people should continue to follow Covid norms. “Keeping using mask and avoid crowds, for whatever purpose it may be. Unless citizens exercise complete restrain, we can’t keep the infection spread under control,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/as-district-crosses-30l-jabs-covid-graph-on-steady-decline/articleshow/85781167.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Nashik||Nashik: Fewest Covid cases in August since June 2020||NASHIK: The city identified 1,075 fresh Covid cases in August this year — the fewest since June 2020. The lowest monthly Covid figures in Nashik city prior to this were last year, in May (222) and June (1,948). The daily recoveries for August 2021 exceeded daily positive cases and the Covid fatalities were also the lowest this month. NMC officials said the trend of decline in Covid cases continues in the city. NMC’s medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje said the infectivity of the coronavirus has reduced and it has become milder. This is the reason for the drop in the number of new cases. However, there has been a projection of a third Covid wave in the coming months. People must continue to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour given that the festive season is almost here. The first wave of the pandemic that started in April 2020, infected around 80,000 people till February 2021. The city had reported 26,443 cases in September 2020 — the highest monthly Covid positive cases during the first wave. Moreover, the number of active Covid cases in the city had increased to 6,200 cases during the first phase of the pandemic. But the second wave was bigger, and it infected around 1.48 lakh people in the city. The city had reported 71,680 cases in April 2021, which was the highest monthly Covid tally during the second wave. In April this year, the city had reported 2,615 new cases per day on average, but the cases started dropping significantly thereafter. In June and July, the city reported 109 and 55 cases per day on average, respectively. The daily average number of cases dropped further to 37 in August 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-city-fewest-covid-cases-in-aug-since-june-20/articleshow/85776274.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Jaipur||Unfair of Modi govt to belittle Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru’s contribution: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has condemned the absence of the photo of first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru from the poster released by Indian Council for Historical Research(ICHR) on the 75the year Independence Day (Amrut Mahotsav) celebrations. He said such a step was not only condemnable, but shows the pettiness of the central government. He added that Nehru was sent to jail nine times and spent almost nine years (3,259 days) in incarceration. He said Vinayak Damodhar Savarkar started seeking apology from the British within a year of his incarceration and sought apology six times and started working as an agent of the British after being set free while Pandit Nehru stood with steely resolve and realised his dream of Independence till the end. He said Nehru put forward the case of Indian Independence not only in the country, but to the world. Born in one of the most affluent families in the country, Nehru had denounced all luxuries to the cause of the country. Gehlot said the whole family from Motilal Nehru to Indira Gandhi made stellar contributions to the freedom movement and Independence of the country. Nehru’s father Motilal Nehru had given away his home Anand Bhawan for the revolutionaries. Besides, he had formed a party named Swaraj Party to advance the cause of Independence. Gehlot said it was unfair on the part of the Modi government to belittle the contribution of Nehru, who had left his home and hearth for the cause of freedom. Gehlot pointed out that when the British filed criminal cases on three commanders (Prem Sahgal, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan ) of the Indian National Army (INA) of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, it was Nehru who formed defence committees and run a campaign against the British. Gehlot said Nehru along with other lawyers fought their case and saved them from the gallows. He said Savarkar had recruited Indians in the British army to fight the Azad Hind Fauz. He said traitors like Savarkar being given the status of freedom fighter is an insult to all freedom fighters. The Modi government will be taught a lesson in due course on its attempt to undermine the contribution of Pandit Nehru, who devoted his body, mind, wealth and life to fight the freedom struggle of the country and lay the foundation of modern India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/unfair-of-modi-govt-to-belittle-nehrus-contribution-cm/articleshow/85781179.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh sewage samples to be studied for signs of Covid outbreak||CHANDIGARH: Soon, sewage samples will be collected from the city to detect early warning signals of a Covid outbreak. This will enable epidemiologists to track the area where Covid outbreak might start much before patients develop symptoms. As part of the two-year long WHO-ICMR project, 10 places have been selected in India for waste water tracking. For this, WHO has selected PGI’s virology laboratory, which will include samples from Chandigarh and Punjab. “Funds have been granted for the first year. Our staff has been trained and a biosafety chamber has been established exclusively for this project,” said Prof Mini P Singh, who will head the project in Chandigarh. “We have received Rs 20 lakh for the first year,” she said. It has been established that the faecal matter of infected patients contains virus RNA and is flushed out in toilets. The stool has long-term shedding and even if the patient is asymptomatic, the virus can be detected in stool. Moreover, the virus can be detected in the stool of asymptomatic patients much before the onset of symptoms. This will be on the lines of polio virus surveillance, where infected individuals excrete polio viruses for several weeks, whether they are symptomatic or not. Testing protocols have already been standardised by the National Institute of Virology, Mumbai. Samples will be collected and sent to the virology laboratory in PGI by a team assigned by WHO-ICMR. “The samples will be collected from catchment areas and where there is no sewage line, open drains will be selected for sample collection. There are maps of these sewage systems with the polio team to find the catchment area. Before it drains out to effluent treatment plants, it will be collected. This is an environmental survey,” said Prof Mini. Sewage surveillance can offer cost-effective and real-time analysis. “When not many are coming forward for testing, this surveillance can monitor any outbreak or detect a new variant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/city-sewage-samples-to-be-studied-for-signs-of-covid-outbreak/articleshow/85778767.cms||Shimona Kanwar

When many Covid deaths were occurring, the bodies had to be taken as far as Kamarhati and Titagarh for cremation due to lack of cremation facilities here. Many people have suffered. We are trying to set up a crematorium here. There are some samshans in Rajarhat area which could be developed into crematoriums. There have been some objections from a section of residents on this issue but in reality there is a need to have a crematorium for Bidhannagar,” said BMC board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty. Civic authorities had also been trying to set up a mortuary in Bidhannagar for preserving dead bodies. Years back, there had been a plan to set up a mortuary in EE Block but the plan had to be shelved after locals objected. The Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) is already preparing a detail project report for setting up a crematorium on the outskirts of New Town. The authorities have identified a spot about five kilometers from the boundary of the New Town project area at Hazratala Samshan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/crematorium-in-bidhannagar/articleshow/85778848.cms||Suman Chakraborti

An NMC official said if cases start rising again, these health workers would again be given the letters. The second wave was bigger than the first one as around 1.5 lakh people were infected by the contagion. The NMC had recruited around 1,000 health workers on temporary basis in February and March to provide treatment to Covid patients during the second wave. The cases continued to rise in the moth of April, but the trend started changing from May onwards and in the following months the Covid scenario improved further. However, there has been a projection for the third wave by the experts that is most likely to begin around September or October. Considering that the number of people that may get infected will be more during the third wave, the NMC had planned to enhance medical infrastructure and increase the manpower to provide better treatment to the patients. Accordingly, during the last week of July, the civic administration had conducted a walk-in interview to recruit various medical staffers on temporary basis for 340 posts, including health staffers like MBBS, MD doctors, staff nurses, hospital managers and other posts. During the first two waves of the pandemic the response from the doctors was lukewarm after the NMC had invited applications. The NMC had shortlisted the candidates for all the vacant posts and had planned to issue the appointment letters from the second week of August. But now this decision has been put on hold. An NMC official said they will now take a call on giving the appointment letters to health workers after September 15. “If the cases start increasing, then NMC will immediately start giving appointment letters,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nmc-puts-appointment-of-340-health-staff-on-hold/articleshow/85776345.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Chandigarh||Ending corruption, providing jobs on merit biggest achievement of govt: Khattar||Chandigarh: Tightening the noose around corruption and providing jobs only on the basis of merit are the two biggest achievements of this government, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said here on Monday on the completion of 2,500 days of the BJP-JJP regime. Changes brought in the system of governance have not only eradicated corruption and non-meritorious selection, but also increased the trust of the common man in the government, he told media persons. On the occasion, Khattar also announced the launch of a dynamic portal in Right to Service Commission, with a feature of automatic appeal to higher authority in case of lapse given time for service as prescribed in the rule book. “This will not only speed up the system but also bring errant officials to book.’’ He reiterated his government’s resolve to bring a law against forced conversions in the state, saying the draft has been prepared and is being vetted by the legal department. He said the government will bring either the Bill in the next session or the ordinance. Regarding governance reforms, Khattar said efforts were being made to weed out corruption by introducing digital reforms to bring transparency in each of its wing. “We have brought more than 50 such services and weeded out the system of middlemen in the state. We made smart offices and governance through use of IT modes and recently introduced Parivar Pehchan Patra to check corruption in various departments,” he said. “We have ended the system of ‘kharchi-parchi’ (money and approach). Now, even the nominations to IAS and HCS cadres are done through fool proof system... Earlier, only the CM took decisions. Similarly, we have decentralised powers and ended the system of manual movement of files,” he added. Regarding opposition’s allegations of the government’s debt liability, Khattar said the knowledge of the Congress about the debt figures is poor and therefore, it always spreads lies. He said the Congress left the state with a debt liability of Rs 97,000 crore. Taking a jibe at the Congress, he said when BJP came to power in the state in 2014, age-old corruption, exploitation of the poor and dynasty politics had pushed Haryana into a vulnerable situation, wherein government property was being looted. “It was then that we decided to write a new chapter of development in Haryana, along with ensuring that benefits of all schemes reach those who are at the bottom of the pyramid,” he said. BOX ‘Better if people forget me’ When asked how he would like people to remember his tenure as the Haryana chief minister, Khattar candidly said, “I have never thought about it and don’t have any expectations. It will be better if people forget me.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ending-corruption-providing-jobs-on-merit-biggest-achievement-of-govt-khattar/articleshow/85781308.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Currently, schools have started holding physical classes for students from Std VIII to XII in villages that have not reported any Covid case for the past 30 days. With the state government asking the teachers to get vaccinated before September 5, the district administration has also asked the officials from Nashik zilla parishad and Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to find the exact number of people that have not been vaccinated and coordinate with the local health officials to help them get the jabs. “Going by the information from the education department, we understand that more than 85% of the teachers have already been vaccinated — one or both the doses. However, we have asked them to ensure every teaching staff is vaccinated by September 5,” Ganesh Misal, deputy collector and nodal officer for vaccine in Nashik district, said. Out of more than 24,700 teachers as many as 20,500 have been partly or fully vaccinated. “The number of teachers yet to get the jab is very small and they can be vaccinated for the first or second dose if they are eligible. We have asked the block education officers to get in touch with the taluka health offices to chalk out the vaccination programme,” PM Patil, education officer of Nashik zilla parishad, said. The NMC education officer said the office has written to all the schools to provide information related to vaccination of their teachers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/more-than-85-teachers-vaccinated-in-nashik/articleshow/85776363.cms||---

We issued a circular to all field directors on August 25,” said Alok Kumar, PCCF (wildlife), MP. With the new hike, the cost of a jungle safari will be virtually equal to what the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) has been charging at weekends and holidays. At present, a safari in MP’s tiger reserves costs Rs 4,650 (Rs 1,550 entry, Rs 2,500 Gypsy and Rs 600 guide) on all weekdays and holidays. This fee will continue to remain the same for buffer and core zones on weekdays. However, with a double hike, it will now cost Rs 6,100 on weekends and holidays. Besides, the per seat charge will cost Rs 500. For foreign tourists, it will Rs 6,000 and per seat, the charge will be Rs 1,000. Of the over 275 days of the tourism season from October 1 till June 30, 2022, the MP PCCF has identified 117 days as premium days, which means on these days, tourists will have to pay through their nose. As per the circular, most of the premium days have been identified in October (15), November (13), December (18), January (15), and March (13). During summer, the peak wildlife tourism season, only 9 days have been identified as premium. However, with the fuel price hike, Gypsy owners are also likely to increase the safari rate from the present Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000, but no decision has been taken yet. “As the fee hike for premium days in MP is for both core and buffer zones, a safari in Tadoba’s buffer will cost less than MP for Rs 4,200 on all days. It will also be competitive at Rs 5,200 on weekends if the safari is booked within 60 days,” says resort owner Nikhil Abhyankar. After the liquor ban was lifted in Chandrapur district, more tourists are expected this season. Even now, when the core area is closed, the buffer zone is witnessing a huge rush due to regular tiger sightings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/tiger-tourism-to-cost-more-in-mp-on-premium-days/articleshow/85781250.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The woman - a mother of seven children - had filed her complaint on August 23, two days after the incident. Initially, police ignored her complaint, but later detained two men once the video surfaced. In the clip, a few men can be seen overpowering the woman, tying her to a cot, carrying her to a farm and harassing her. On Monday, Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Singh said, "The woman was married 20 years ago. She has seven children. She suffers from some behavioural disorder and turns aggressive and abusive at times. Her family was carrying her on a cot and taking her home after she refused to return. However, the way it was done is inhuman. We have booked members of her family." Ahmadgarh SHO Virender Sharma said, "Investigation suggests the woman used to often fight with her family. In one such incident relating to certain financial issues, she left home threatening to kill herself and that is when her family chased her and tried to bring her back. They tied her to a cot when she refused and carried her home while passing through a few farms." The SHO added, "We have booked eight members of her family, including her husband, under IPC sections 342 [wrongful confinement] and 323 [voluntarily causing hurt]." The woman, however, dismissed the claims. "My in-laws and neighbours who keep fighting with me are spreading all this about me. They demanded money from me which I did not have. Later, they beat me and tied me up. I had filed a police complaint earlier, too, but no action was taken," she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/woman-37-tied-to-cot-carried-to-farm-and-harassed-two-detained/articleshow/85776370.cms||Sandeep Rai

They claimed that wholesale traders refused to buy their produce even at Rs2 per kg despite requests. One of the farmers, Navnath Khandu Rajguru (32), sold his produce free for two hours at Indapur town on Sunday morning before throwing it away on the highway. “People were surprised by my move,” he told TOI on Monday over the phone. “But even after that I could sell only 10kg capsicum as buyers purchased in small quantities, despite urging them to buy in bulk,” he added. “I had brought 1,200 kg of capsicum to sell it to a trader. However, he said there was no demand for it. I even urged him to buy the produce at Rs2 per kg, hoping to recover at least the transportation cost. But he refused. Then, I sold it for free, but I was unable to empty the vehicle. This made me more frustrated and I threw it away on the road,” he said. Navnath has cultivated capsicum on three acres of land. He claimed that he has invested about Rs5 lakh capital to reap the harvest. “I was into pandal business. But I had to close it as there were no orders from customers due to pandemic restrictions. That is when I decided to cultivate capsicum on the farm, hoping to get good returns. But my plan has come a cropper,” he added. Another capsicum farmer Pappu Devkar from Ramwadi village claimed that he also had to dump at least 50kg of capsicum on the highway when he could not sell the produce in the local market at Indapur three days ago. “Unless the government decides on the minimum support prices (MSP) for vegetables, farmers like us will continuously suffer. We do not have facilities and logistic support to supply the products to housing societies and other places,” said another grower Dinesh Kute from Abhangwadi village. “We received two tonnes of capsicum in the last four days. Prices have crashed in the range of Rs4 to Rs6 per kg,” said Babasaheb Bibve, the temporary head of the vegetable section at the Market Yard. Vilas Bhujbal, president of the commission agents’ association at the Market Yard, said, “Last year, the growers got a decent rate. One kg of capsicum was sold in the range of Rs15 to Rs20 per kg. Thus, many farmers cultivated capsicum in large numbers this year. Therefore, the vegetable supply in the market is double the average, leading to the crash.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/farmers-dump-capsicum-on-highway-over-price-crash/articleshow/85778868.cms||Sandip Dighe

A large crowd gathered at Iskcon temple in Sector 36, Chandigarh, where Covid norms were violated. Temple authorities said they were trying their best to ensure that people followed Covid guidelines by wearing masks and maintaining proper social distancing but the swelling crowd made it difficult for them.

Still, we are checking to see that everyone follows protocol and stays safe.” In Shri Sanatan Dharam Mandir, Sector 36, large crowds gathered on the premises and children could be seen without masks. Among those who did wear masks, many pulled it down to their chin. This year, officials did not issue any instructions or guidelines for the festival.

The demands came during the meeting of Ganesh mandals held at divisional level at all six divisional offices of the the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC). The NMC charges fees of Rs 886 (including GST) to set up pandals and also charges for putting up advertising boards during Ganesh festival. It collects around Rs 750 per board/banner for advertising at the Ganesh pandal. “We have sought waiver of various charges the NMC collects during the Ganesh festival celebrations.

We have urged the NMC administration to follow suit,” said Ganesh Barve, president of Shri Raje Chatrapati Samajik Sanstha and Kirda Mandal. NMC officials said that municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav will take a call on the issue. In the meantime, the e-permission procedure for Ganesh mandals has been opened. “We have already given instructions to the Ganesh mandals to obtain permission online around seven days before the start of the Ganesh festival. We have set the deadline of September 3,” said NMC officials. The Ganesh mandals have been told not to dig up the roads and put up pandals until they get permission.

---||Nagpur||Surgeries cure woman of epilepsy, infant’s brain tumor||Nagpur: Doctors at a private hospital gave a new lease of life to a patient of epilepsy and a three-month-old baby born with a lump in the head through two rare surgeries. The baby’s treatment cost was met through crowd funding initiated by the hospital itself beside offering concession to the poor family. In the first case, a 28-year-old city woman was suffering since the last four years with a history of seven to eight episodes of convulsions per day. She had undergone treatment in many hospitals but the condition persisted. She was gradually put on four anti-convulsant drugs to control epilepsy, but still she had episodes of convulsions and there was no improvement. “Her family had also noted some changes in her behavior. She had consulted multiple clinicians for this problem. The MRI brain revealed tumor involving the sensitive part of the brain like the base of the left frontal lobe, caudate nucleus and hypothalamus,” stated Nelson Neurosciences Centre in a press release. Because of the complexity of the lesion site and surgery-related complications, she was managed with multiple anticonvulsant drugs all these years, it said. Dr Sandeep Iratwar, chief neurosurgeon at Nelson Neurosciences Centre, examined her thoroughly and planned the line of treatment at Nelson Hospital. Doctors decided to perform surgery. “After a detailed pre-operative evaluation, Dr CE Deopujari, senior neurosurgeon from Mumbai, and Dr Sandeep Iratwar conducted neuro navigation guided craniotomy and total excision of lesion using high-end technology,” the note said. Post-operatively, she recovered completely, the anti-convulsant drugs were reduced and discharged on the 4th day in a stable condition. Another team of doctors led by Dr Iratwar successfully performed a high-risk surgery on a three-month-old baby to save his life at Nelson Hospital. The baby was born to a daily wager in March 2021 with a small visible and painful lump at the back of his head. As he grew, so did the lump and doctors diagnosed it as brain tumor. To get rid of the tumor, which was the size of a fist, the child needed to undergo three surgical procedures which his poor parents could not afford. The boy used to cry endlessly, said doctors. “There was excess fluid in his brain that was causing the tumor to grow, just like a plant grows when it gets water. The only way to get rid of it was surgery on an emergency or the tumor could have worsened and could have had adverse effects on his brain and body,” they said. The excess fluid was drained out of the brain and the tumor was removed . The funds were arranged by Nelson Hospital through crowd funding from Milaap and the surgical procedures were done at a concessional rate in order to save the life of the child and reduce the financial burden of the parents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/surgeries-cure-woman-of-epilepsy-infants-brain-tumor/articleshow/85781302.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

However, medical officers in other districts in state are getting the salaries regularly. About 40 such doctors in Nagpur district have blamed the zilla parishad administration for not ensuring that their salaries are released on time. “I am from the 2015 MBBS batch. Along with others, I was asked to join the rural service in March this year as there was severe shortage of medical officers. Our PG-NEET examination was postponed twice and we were deprived of the PG opportunities. Yet, we joined the service and started work. It’s September now and none of us have received salary till date,” said a doctor. “I am 25 years old and working since last six months. I have to continue to depend on money from my parents. Isn’t it embarrassing? Why do they want to call us Covid warriors,” the doctor asked not wanting to reveal her name. With a list of those who have not received their outstanding salaries, the doctors have regularly approached the district health officer on the issue. “Every time, we are assured that the funds have been released and we salaries will be credited in next 2-3 days. This has been going on for 5 months now,” said another doctor. District health officer Dr Deepak Selokar also gave the same reply to TOI. “The grant has been released and the salaries will be credited in next 2-3 days,” he said. The doctors working in rural PHCs get a salary of Rs 75,000 per month. Director of state health services Dr Archana Patil said the issue is Nagpur district specific. “We have already released the grants in all eight divisions and no others have any complaint,” she said. TOI spoke to the deputy director of heath services in Akola, Dr Rajkumar Chavan. He said no doctor has complained in the division. “Sometimes it takes one or two months to process the salary and then it becomes regular,” he said. DDHS Nagpur Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said that the issue will be resolved in a day or two. Doctors who joined the bond services have to work round the clock. They have worked extensively during the Covid times.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/doctors-on-bond-service-not-paid-salaries-since-march/articleshow/85781257.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||HEALTH INSURANCE IS WEALTH many realized after 2nd wave||Nagpur: The pandemic has been an eye-opener for thousands of citizens who had never bought any health insurance cover. Due to Covid-19 treatment expenses which ran into lakhs, many had to lose their bank balance, savings, gold ornaments and property. After the second wave, the surge in enquiry for medical insurance is visible and many young professionals are going for comprehensive health policies. According to financial adviser Shrikant Tijare, there has been increase of at least 30% about inquiries for health insurance. “Earlier, people used to ask for investment options. Now, their first point of enquiry is health insurance. Many young professionals are buying cover from Rs5 lakh to Rs10 lakh,” he said. Tijare further said that during the health check-up done for the policy, many came to know about their ailments they were unaware of. “Most insurance companies undertake pre-policy health check-up and it is when many diseases like hypertension and diabetes are diagnosed before they could turn serious,” he said. Doctors have also welcomed this change. “It’s like blessing in disguise. People have realized the importance of health insurance like never-before,” said cardiologist Dr Amar Amale. Mental peace, said Dr Amale, is the best offering of a health insurance policy. “In Covid times, reimbursement under insurance put back some money into the pockets of distressed people. Even hospitals are at peace when patient is covered under insurance because the already stressed family is not needed to be asked daily for money,” he said. Insurance adviser Rakshit Patel explains a simple formula which underlines how life insurance is profitable. “It’s like paying Rs10,000 annually, which means Rs1 lakh in 10 years, for insuring a whole family for Rs5 lakh per year. If anyone from the family needs admission due to Covid, dengue or any accident, your yearly investment will cover the bill amount,” he said. “Health insurance also leaves people assured that they have Rs5 lakh cover in hand. So it’s a win-win situation,” he said adding that even unavoidable diseases like cataract, knee or hip replacement etc are covered under insurance these days. “So, you will not be in loss when you insure your health,” he said. Sharing his experience during the second wave of Covid-19, businessman Praful Dahake said, “I was admitted to a private hospital for 10 days and the bill was more than Rs2 lakh. I had a short-term Corona Kawach policy. I got near Rs1.50 lakh reimbursed. It was a big respite,” he said. Surgeon Dr Aparna Das emphasized that it’s not just about Covid or dengue or accident but health insurance should be a way of life. “Having health cover is one of the biggest lessons of Covid-19,” said Dr Das.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/health-insurance-is-wealth-many-realized-after-2nd-wave/articleshow/85779012.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Raj Kisan Saathi portal promises to be game changer for farmers||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had recently launched the Raj Kisan Saathi portal as part of ‘ease of doing farming.’ The portal has been created as a single window to provide information about all the schemes being run for the farmers. This portal developed by the department of information technology and communication and Rajcomp Info System Limited has a total of 144 modules of agriculture and allied departments of which 46 have been prepared in 2020-21 and 50 are being made in 2021-22. Agriculture minister Lalchand Kataria said a farmer can apply at his own level through Janadhaar or SSO ID in addition to e-Mitra. The application process has been simplified. Earlier the application form was big, in which about 40 types of information had to be filled and 7 types of documents had to be uploaded. Then all these documents had to be submitted to the department's office. Kataria said now farmer's photo, address and bank account come automatically as soon as the Janadhaar number is entered on the Raj Kisan Saathi portal. Similarly, land records (Jamabandi) and map of the farmer will come in the application from the e-Dharti portal of the revenue department. The applicant only has to fill the account and khasra number of the land. As soon as the online application is made, it will reach the office of the department and a message will come on the farmer's mobile. Principal secretary (agriculture) Bhaskar Sawant said scrutiny of the application and physical verification will also be done online through an app, in which the time, date and place will come along with the photograph of the applicant farmer. Administrative and financial approval will also be issued online and the grant-in-aid will be paid in the bank account linked to the beneficiary. So, the entire process from application to payment will be online. So far, more than 2 lakh applications have received on the portal, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-kisan-saathi-portal-promises-to-be-game-changer-for-farmers/articleshow/85781343.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Senior NU profs withdraw patent application post plagiarism plaint||Nagpur: In an alleged case of plagiarism in Nagpur University, a teacher from Dharampeth Science College lodged a complaint claiming that a PhD thesis of her student was sent for registration of patent by senior professors working with NU’s physics, chemistry and electronic departments while deliberately excluding her name and copying entire material from the thesis. After her complaint, the application filed for the patent registration at ‘Controller of Patents Office’ in Mumbai was withdrawn recently. Even its website displayed that it was disposed of. The complaint, referred to as “opposition” as per the Patents Act, 1970, and the Patents Rules, 2003, was filed by Seema Ubale, who is a professor at Dharampeth Science College, on July 31. Subsequently, a well-known seniormost professor from the physics department, who has many patents to his name, approached her with an offer that they would include her name in the team of researchers. She, however, refused to be a part of the team. Ubale told TOI that such malpractice of using someone else’s work and ideas and putting them as their own while applying for the patent “is rampant in NU”. “These senior professors are involved in the unfair malafide practice of acquiring, copying and cheating of scientific literature verbatim from my student’s thesis. Those are already published in various research journals and patent publications,” she said. The professor said that she has decided to expose this practice, “as my work with my student was copied and sent for patent registration without granting me credit”. The NU teachers allegedly lured the girl, who completed her PhD under Ubale, to apply for a patent by including their names and deliberately excluding the guide’s name. According to the complainant, her student had registered for PhD with NU in 2012 in the science faculty after completion of her post-graduation, with her as the guide. After conducting research under Ubale at Dharampeth College, the student submitted her thesis in 2019. The seniormost professor was named as co-supervisor. The student was accordingly conferred the degree during July 9 convocation. In 2019 itself, Ubale came to know that the NU teachers had applied for a patent on the same subject for which the girl had completed research under her guidance. Ubale said that she did not raise her voice then, “as the student would have suffered and her PhD may have been jeopardized”. “After she got the degree, I decided to stop such malpractices. After my complaint, the professors concerned sent the girl to my home to convince me. Later, the seniormost one visited my residence requesting me withdraw my complaint and offered to add my name on the list of applicants. When I refused, he said that they would have to withdraw the patent registration, to which I replied that it was their decision and I would continue to fight for justice.” The seniormost teacher, however, blamed the student for not including her guide’s name and said that he has no role to play in the entire affair. The teacher admitted that he approached Ubale for inclusion of her name as one of the applicants for patent to avoid further controversy. “Now, there’s no question as we have withdrawn that application as it was incomplete and more research is needed into it. We will file a new patent application,” he told TOI. WHAT HAPPENED * A student applied for PhD in 2012.

Responding to Khattar’s claims of achievement on the completion of 2,500 days of his government, the former minister alleged that the “lath jeevi government” manged to cling to power on the “crutches” of JJP while people suffered on multiple counts. Haryana has seen more deaths in police action during the tenure of Khattar government than in (J&K) valley in police firing, he alleged. He slammed the government over several issues including paper leaks, unemployment and debt burden, saying the BJP-JJP leaders enjoyed the fruits of power but the state was “pushed for deep division on caste lines”. Haryana Congress in-charge Vivek Bansal will lead a party delegation on Tuesday to submit a complaint to the National Human Rights Commission against the lathicharge on farmers in Karnal on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/govt-writing-haryanas-story-of-ruin-surjewala/articleshow/85781345.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad police investigate ‘certificate without jabs’ claims||Aurangabad: Based on the complaint lodged by a medico heading a civic body-run vaccination centre, the Aurangabad city police have launched a probe into the alleged racket of issuing vaccination certificates without actual vaccine administrations. The civic body too has initiated an independent probe into the incident of over a dozen people being issued certificates without them actually being inoculated. The alleged incident took place at the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s vaccination centre being operated at the DKMM College in the Pahadsinghpura area of the city. The issue came to light on Saturday after one of the health employees raised an alert about the sudden increase in the number of beneficiaries on Saturday. Soon a team from the civic body went to the health centre and screened the list of beneficiaries lined up for inoculation for the day and found that some of them had not even turned up at the centre, but still got listed. When contacted, Begumpura inspector Prashant Potdar said: “We are trying to find out if it was intentional or due to some human error. At this stage, no one is being given a clean chit.” The officer said that depending on the findings, an offence will be registered against the suspects. Those privy to the probe maintained that one of the theories being probed is that as a solution to vaccine hesitancy, clubbed with the mandatory inoculation certificate required either at the professional level or for movement, people might have come forward seeking only certification.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/aurangabad-police-investigate-certificate-without-jabs-claims/articleshow/85776411.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Fines, revised rules help reduce truck overload on Kolkata roads||KOLKATA: City roads seem to have been spared by the overloaded trucks. Transport department data shows that stringent enforcement and revision of axle load have significantly reduced the overloading of goods vehicles. The Bengal government adopted zero tolerance to overloading of goods vehicles and increased the penalty from Rs 2,000 to Rs 20,000 and an additional Rs 2,000 per extra tonne. Transport department data showed that in the month of July, the number of overloaded trucks was 3,710. In first 15 days of August, the overloaded trucks dropped to 1,237. In the same period in July, the number of overloaded vehicles was 1,855. The drop of nearly 600 vehicles is quite significant and it will be reduced further, said a transport department officer. “Overloaded vehicles damage roads, commit accidents and pollute air. Thus, the enforcement against overloading will continue with greater zeal,” said transport minister Firhad Hakim. The state government allowed relaxation of axle weight by 25% as per the allowance granted by ministry of road transport and highways. A stringent penalty was brought in. For first offence Rs 20,000, Rs 40,000 for second time, for the third time permit will be cancelled and for fourth, registration will be revoked. In July total revenue earned was Rs 10 crore, but in 15 days of August the revenue earned from the fewer vehicles was over Rs 6 crore, said an officer. “Overloading will be completely eradicated, if enforcement can be increased at loading point. The trucks involved in sand and stone mining continue to run weight beyond prescribed limit. A very well networked nexus of sand-stone mafia and police is upsetting state government’s right steps,” said Sajal Ghosh, general secretary, Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators’ Associations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/fines-revised-rules-help-reduce-truck-overload-on-roads/articleshow/85779027.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Before you can start reading it, he begins a speech on how life has become easier for you and your family in the last five years! This is how BJP plans to kick off campaigning for the upcoming municipal corporation elections. From September 1, a month-long door to-door campaign called Jan Sampark Abhiyan will be launched. The target is to cover 2.5 lakh houses in the city. The BJP is hoping to rope in 40,000 to 45,000 people for campaigning and booth-level planning. Around 25,000 people, including over 21,000 “panna pramukhs”, functionaries at the booth level, are already appointed. The increase in municipal wards from 26 to 35 following delimitation has spurred the saffron party to constitute teams accordingly, giving responsibility of each ward. There are 595 polling booths. The main strategy of the BJP is to go by the voter list to cover each booth. A full-fledged campaign plan will be out in the next few days. The elections are scheduled in December. Relying on the strength of its organisation, the party has filled crucial posts by appointing office-bearers. A majority of them has started work on the ground, keeping election strategy and mobilisation of people in mind. The BJP has districts, mandals, cells and morchas, with members of these wings holding regular meetings. Arun Sood, president, Chandigarh BJP, told TOI, “Around 92,000 people have registered with the party through the missed call plan. We have identified 21,000 party workers under panna pramukh committees. They will work on the voter list of their area and booth. In the coming days, more such committees will be formed. Multiple wings in the party have already started working and will increase their pace soon.” Sood claimed many works have been executed by both the MC and the Chandigarh administration during the BJP rule. “We will explain their benefits to people. Moreover, we have plans to reach out to each person in the city,” he added. The Covid vaccination drive will be a crucial part for the BJP’s strategy. The party has already mobilised its team to make people aware about the vaccination and providing related help to people to ensure they get their shots in different areas. Besides, the central government schemes, especially to provide foodgrains, will be started soon, BJP leaders said Box: KEY CONCERNS City residents have been facing multiples issues for past many years The local wing of the BJP has raised over half a dozen crucial issues These relate to Chandigarh Housing Board, industry, traders, societies and villages The BJP is keen to resolve some of the issues before the MC polls to gain benefit A few rounds of talks have already been held with officials of the Chandigarh administration||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/bjps-mc-polls-game-plan-catch-em-in-their-homes/articleshow/85778939.cms||Deepak Yadav

Upgrading the sub-district hospital to the level of DCH is being taken up considering various factors including lack of hospitals in rural areas for treatment of the critical patients. “In order to cut down the dependency on civil hospital in Nashik city and general hospital in Malegaon city, we have now decided to have to DCH facilities — in Kalwan and Chandwad — to treat the patients from the rural areas,” Dr Ashok Thorat, chief surgeon of Nashik civil hospital, said. The government and private hospitals in Nashik and Malegaon cities catered to critical patients who had to travel over 100 km to get the access to good treatment. The conversion of hospital into a DCH would mean that more staff and better equipment, oxygen and ventilator support, in dealing with Covid would be made available here for the treatment of the patients. “The facilities to be added are ventilators, technicians to operate them and doctors to look after the patients. This is being done on the backdrop of the third wave that has been predicted by experts,” Thorat said. Both the hospitals will have 25-bed each for critically ill Covid patients. The DCH at Kalwan will cater to the patients from Sugana, Kalwan, Baglan talukas and parts of Peth and Dindori talukas. Similarly, the DCH at Chandwad will cater to the requirements of those from Chandwad, Deola, Nandgaon and Yeola talukas. At one point in time the number of Covid cases were on the rise in Yeola taluka and the patients had to travel to Malegaon or Nashik city to get a bed. “The two hospitals will provide major relief in times of emergency,” the officer added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/rural-nashik-to-have-two-dedicated-covid-hospitals/articleshow/85776448.cms||Abhilash Botekar

City-based activist had written to secretary, AWBI, in which he had submitted that these birds will be kept in enclosures made of very thin layer of net covering the trees so that birds may not be able to fly away and remain inside the aviary. As such birds will not be able fly freely and will be confined to a specified area, which is against the rules for bird sanctuaries, he had submitted. The ‘Bird Park’, proposed to be developed on the lines of Jurong Bird Park in Singapore, envisages creating a new tourist spot in Chandigarh and a place for bird lovers and aspiring ornithologists. Earlier, AWBI had written to UT forest and wildlife department stating that procurement of birds should only be made from authorised sellers, while exhibition of animals in zoological garden for education or scientific purpose is exempted under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The AWBI had also mentioned that many aerial birds in India are covered under the various schedules of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and necessary permission need to be obtained from the Wildlife Department for their procurement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ut-defends-walk-through-aviary-says-no-rules-violated/articleshow/85779040.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Teachers who have been laid off, quit due to differences with the management or are looking for better opportunities will probably have to wait till the next academic session as the hiring activity is unlikely to pick up anytime soon. TOI spoke to a few school trustees who said that there’s an unofficial hiring freeze. One trustee said, “Fee collection is extremely low and we are struggling to meet most of our expenses. In such a situation, schools are being forced to lay off teachers or reduce salaries and hence, hiring is out of the question.” But then how are they managing to conduct classes, online or offline, with less staff. The same trustee said, “Every school has a core teaching staff. It could be anywhere between 20% to 40% of their total teacher strength. These teachers basically help keep the wheels moving while the others are in a transitional phase. Some are always looking out for new jobs, some want a peaceful job while others are trainees looking for experience.” Teachers working with well established CBSE schools are earning a minimum Rs 25,000 per month, while those with experience can rake in more than double that figure. That, however, is just for a couple of schools as the majority of schools pay their teachers between Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000 per month.  A CBSE school trustee said, “The monthly salary can be very high if the candidate is right and we are in need of that subject’s expert.” In 2017, a city-based CBSE school principal was desperately looking for a math teacher for Std XI-XII and was willing to pay Rs 1.25 lakh per month if a suitable teacher could be found at short notice. A senior principal said, “Such situations are rare. It happens if your ace teacher quits abruptly and that leaves the school in dire straits. So to immediately fill that void, the school can shell out a hefty amount of money. That’s why you always have contractual teachers every year who can back-up your core staff.” While the management focuses on the ‘core’ team, the others get neglected even in terms of salary. In Nagpur only a couple of CBSE schools pay their teachers (non-trainees) almost at par with the seventh pay commission levels, while others pay well only to ‘core’ members.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/school-teachers-hiring-is-almost-at-a-standstill/articleshow/85781368.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Pune||Pune: Road fixed; denied just compensation, claim landowners||PUNE: A stretch of a road in Vimannagar, dug up five years ago for concreting and caught in a legal imbroglio, was finally repaired with bitumen by the Pune Municipal Corporation recently, but some of the landowners alleged that the civic body denied them of just compensation. The 110-metre stretch, commonly known as the Konarknagar Road, serves as a crucial alternative route to the Pune Airport. Before the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) dug up the road to re-lay it with concrete, the civic body maintained a bitumen road in the area, paying rent to the landowners from whom the land was leased. But they filed suit against the PMC, demanding just compensation. The case reached a resolution at the civic court in Shivajinagar on July 30. The court permitted PMC to carry out repairs on the stretch and instructed it to provide the landowners with adequate compensation provided by the law. A section of the landowners alleged that the PMC reneged on an “assurance” to provide a part of the compensation in cash, and the rest in transferable development rights (TDR). “We were assured that 25% of the compensation would be in cash and the rest as TDR. Later, they told us that only TDR would be provided, which we did not agree to. They forced us to give up possession using police deployment and political pressure,” said Abhijeet Deokar, one of the owners of the land parcels. He has now filed an appeal in the Pune sessions court, with a hearing scheduled for September 6. A senior PMC official said, “Nowhere in our conversation with them did we state that we would provide a part of the compensation in cash. They have agreed to TDR and FSI compensation, which would be provided to them. It is currently being processed by the estate and management department.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/road-fixed-denied-just-compensation-claim-landowners/articleshow/85779075.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Nagpur||Childless for 20 years, Pakistani couple gets test tube baby in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Closing down of borders due to Covid pandemic came as a blessing in disguise for a Pakistani couple. Childless for nearly 20 years since marriage, the couple from Ghotki city of Sindh province in Pakistan gave birth to a test tube baby conceived at a Nagpur hospital. With a Pakistani passport issued in the name of the child, now three months old, the three are ready to return home in Ghotki. Their return plans coincide with Pakistani authorities easing the Covid protocol for cross-border travel. Vijay (name changed) is a Pakistani Hindu, who had come on a visit visa to meet his relatives in Nagpur in 2019. Soon, the borders closed due to Covid. As the relatives insisted, the couple got an in vitro fertilization (IVF) done. IVF is the medical term for test tube baby. “Yes, there are IVF centres in Pakistan also. We could have got it done in a city like Karachi or so. But we kept delaying the plan and ultimately 19 years passed. I had come to India in March 2019. In the meantime, my relatives insisted that I can get IVF done here and also referred a hospital. Finally, I took a call and went ahead,” said Vijay. The family then obtained a long-term visa (LTV) as the visit visa only allowed a month’s stay. The first IVF attempt failed and the couple went for another round and finally succeeded. “My wife gave birth to a baby boy on May 16 this year. He is healthy and with all the check-ups done, we plan to go back to Ghotki. My father has developed some heart problem and he has asked me to come back. On reaching there, we can decide whether to stay or come back,” he said. “The baby has given a new meaning for our life,” he says. Dr Mayuri Assudani of Indira IVF at Nagpur, who treated the couple, said, “After the first attempt failed, I took it as a personal challenge. It worked the second time.” “They earlier had plans to return to Pakistan when the wife was five months pregnant. However, given her condition, I preferred that they stayed so that direct monitoring could be done. The travel could have had its own hazards. They agreed and finally the child was delivered here,” she says. The story has brought out another aspect of lives of those travelling to India from Pakistan. Rajesh Jhambia, secretary of Sindh Hindi Panchayat, says, “There are many who come from Sindh for this purpose. The child is born in India and some of them return, but others also continue staying in India. There are 2-3 similar cases in Nagpur.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/childless-for-20-years-pakistani-couple-gets-test-tube-baby-in-city/articleshow/85779129.cms||Shishir Arya

He was speaking after launching the implementation of National Education Policy (NEP)-2020 at Mangalore University (MU) here on Monday. “The major reformation in the education sector, especially in the administrative perspective, is giving autonomy for institutions. At present, these institutions are functioning under either the government or universities. Our aim is to come out of the affiliation system. All institutions should get autonomy which allows them to grow. In the next 15 years, each institution, being autonomous, should have the powers to award degrees. Such institutions will improve quality of education through a well-planned roadmap. Those institutions will have their own independent boards,” the minister said. The aim of public universities, deemed-to-be universities or private institutions is to bestow quality education to students, he added. On NEP-2020, he said it is a student-friendly and student-centric policy that will strengthen the education system and bring in more educational and administrative reforms in the sector. “NEP was drafted after wide consultations and considering more than three lakh suggestions in the last five years. The policy aims at empowering the student community to face competition at the global level. It will make the rigid education system flexible through a slew of reforms. NEP has the objective of providing right kind of education, and aims at all-round development of students and upholding the rich culture and heritage of the country,” he said. Pradeep P, commissioner of the department of collegiate education, said awareness on NEP is being created among students and teaching faculties. “The admission module under the Unified University and College Management System (UUCMS) model has been launched. Students should be guided by the colleges on choosing two core subjects and an open elective. All queries from students and faculties are being answered through a web portal created for NEP,” he added. In his presidential remarks, MU vice-chancellor prof P S Yadapadithaya said a PG centre, with an Advanced Study Centre, will be opened at Belapu from the next academic year. The university has also submitted a proposal to the government to set up Dr V S Acharya Centre for Coastal Development Studies in Udupi at an estimated cost of Rs 5 crore, he said. The sixth constituent college MU at Moodbidri was also inaugurated on the occasion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/reforms-on-anvil-to-make-institutions-autonomous-in-15-years-min/articleshow/85779091.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Outside’ cars parked overnight block Salt Lake roads: Locals||Kolkata: People arbitrarily parking their vehicles on the roads in Salt Lake, especially in front of homes, is causing much inconvenience to residents as well as motorists: The issue was raised at the ‘Meet Your Coordinator’ programme at AJ Block on Sunday, when Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty was also present. Following the discussion, the civic body came up with the idea of issuing stickers to Block residents who own private cars to distinguish them from “outside” vehicles. “The stickers will help the authorities identify cars belong to Salt Lake residents and the ones that come from outside and are parked on roads. Cops can take actions accordingly. Once the system of using car stickers starts in one Block, other Block committees can also follow suit,” said Chakraborty. “The parking of vehicles, especially on the sides of Canal Road, is a big problem. Many from outside park their cars in front of houses and leave them there for long hours. That inconveniences the residents, who find it difficult to bring out their own cars from their driveways. Members of the AJ Block committee raised the issue with us for a solution and asked whether car stickers could be issued to residents. I have told them to have a discussion with police about the matter. These stickers can have an authorisation signature by the Block committee authorities, with an approval from the police,” she added. A police officer, who was present at the meeting on Sunday, said that they had asked locals to inform cops whenever they found outsiders parking cars in their areas. TOI on Monday went around different parts of Salt Lake and found that several stretches leading to blocks and main thoroughfares had many cars parked on the roadsides. “This problem is increasing every day. A few hours of parking in front of houses is fine but on some occasions, outsiders leave their cars here overnight,” said Sankhadeep Roy Chowdhury, a resident of AE Block.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/outside-cars-parked-overnight-block-salt-lake-roads-locals/articleshow/85779112.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Several cars on the highway were reduced to heaps of metal. According to police, the injured are undergoing treatment at different hospitals. Local police said the accident took place sometime after 10.30 pm when a truck barreling through the highway began to flounder, possibly due to excessive speed and slammed into three different vehicles, including two cars. One of the cars that was hit by the truck then struck another vehicle that spun around on the highway before colliding with a rushing vehicle. As vehicles began to pile up on the highway, traffic came to a grinding halt. “It was a multiple-axle truck that had triggered the pile-up on the highway. The first car that the truck had rammed into shot off the divider and landed on a service lane. The same truck smashed into another car which got almost sandwiched between the divider and the truck,” an official said. Locals claimed they were shocking howls of cries across the highway soon after vehicles hit each other. Some dazed passengers and drivers emerged from their wrecked vehicles with their faces covered in blood and bruises all over their bodies. Till early Monday morning, police had not learned of any casualties. Officials, however, also said at least four cars were reduced to a jumble of crushed metal as they could barely be recognised. A search and rescue operation began as soon as the highway control room was informed of the incident. Ambulances were called. Policemen sifted through twisted cars to look for people who were stuck under the debris of their wrecked vehicles. “All vehicles were headed to Jaipur. Many vehicles had registration numbers of Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Railings alongside the service lanes were completely destroyed in the accident,” the official said. A resident of Mundawar tehsil in Alwar, Dharmendra Choudhary, was one of the persons injured in the accident. He was coming back from Haryana with his wife and two kids when a vehicle hit his car. He said his daughter sustained injuries in the accident and there was complete mayhem and confusion on the highway. Behror SHO Prem Prakash told TOI that traffic was diverted from Shahjahanpur on account of the farmer protests. He said n FIR was registered in the case and police were looking for the truck driver.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cars-pile-up-on-each-other-on-national-highway-after-being-hit-by-truck-8-hurt/articleshow/85781390.cms||---

Till now, very few locals in Malana had opted for vaccination, said the Kullu DC, who talked to the villagers and tried to end their misconceptions about the vaccine, answered their questions, explained the danger of the Covid-19 pandemic, and briefed them on preventive measures to stay safe. Malana had till recently strictly banned entry of outsiders into the village to protect locals from the pandemic and had announced a heavy fine on all locals if they hosted any outsider. The DC’s efforts yielded immediate results as 200 villagers received the first dose on the first day of the campaign. More locals will be vaccinated on Tuesday and officials believe all the Malana residents will get their first vaccine dose in a few days. “Along with a team of health department officials, I visited Malana on Monday to check the reason why residents are hesitating in getting the vaccine. The residents, full of enthusiasm, gathered near the temple in large numbers where vaccination was to be held. The panchayat representatives cooperated with us. I thanked all the residents for their cooperation. The entire Kullu district has achieved almost 100 per cent vaccination target, except for Malana. This historic village will also be covered in a few days for which efforts are being made. Hopefully, all remaining residents will get the first dose on Tuesday,” the DC said. “The residents were hesitating to visit the health centre, so it was important that they get vaccinated at doorstep during mop-up rounds,” Garg added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/kullu-dc-visits-remote-malana-to-end-vaccine-hesitancy/articleshow/85781417.cms||---

Two severely injured people were also airlifted to a hospital on Monday. According to officials in the district disaster control room, a cloudburst on Sunday caused several houses to collapse in the village in Dharchula block, trapping the inhabitants. Teams of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), police and the revenue officers carried out search and rescue operations on Monday. Pithoragarh district magistrate Ashish Chauhan told TOI that six houses were damaged in the cloudburst. “Five bodies have been recovered. Three of the victims were sisters who were sleeping in their house when it flattened,” he said. The sisters were aged between nine and 15. The other two victims have been identified as Sunita Devi and Parwati Devi. Two people have been reported missing while four people were found injured, including Nar Singh and Jaimati Devi, who were airlifted to Dharchula hospital. The DM said that relief material, including rations, have been sent to the village. Meanwhile, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami spoke to Pithoragarh district officials on Monday and asked them to evacuate families in calamity-stricken areas. He directed the public works department (PWD) officials to ensure swift removal of debris from the disaster-hit village. The CM also asked district officials to work on “war-footing” to clear up national highways blocked due to landslides. In the past 24 hours, Dharchula has received 81 mm of rainfall. Heavy downpour in the district has triggered landslides that cut off 16 villages and six border roads. Meanwhile, in the Tanakpur area of Champawat district, water levels of Sharda river reached the danger mark following which an alert was sounded by the district administration, said Himanshu Kafaltiya, sub-divisional magistrate of Tanakpur.

---||Delhi||Proposal to split NCZ into 2 may hit conservation battle||NEW DELHI: The NCR Planning Board (NCRPB) has proposed to split the “Natural Conservation Zone (NCZ)” into two categories of “forests” and “green cover”, which is likely to ease the current norms that restrict non-forest activities in such zones. Areas such as Aravalis, river beds, lakes and water recharging areas are currently treated as NCZs. The Draft Regional Plan 2041, which the Board has shared with participating states, says the components under NCZ as in Regional Plan of 2021 shall remain and will have to be conserved. “However, a distinction shall be made between ‘forests’ and ‘green cover’, wherein areas now categorized as ‘forests’ shall continue to be conserved, while conservation of the areas now designated as ‘green cover’ areas shall not be mandatory,” it says. The proposed change is likely to create more conflict, particularly in Haryana where the forests have not yet been defined and even deemed forests have not been demarcated till now. Sources said though conservation won’t be mandatory for areas under ‘green covers’, any activity in such areas will require necessary permission from the authorities and these can’t be unregulated. However, considering the “environmentally sensitive natural features of NCR” such as Aravalli ridge, protected and reserved forests, wildlife and bird sanctuaries, major rivers, large lakes such as Badkal, SurajKund, Damdama and Siliserh and identified ground water recharging areas such as wetlands, the draft plan has specified that these are “required to be conserved and protected”. The full planning board, which includes the chief ministers of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, is scheduled to meet on Tuesday where the draft plan will be put for approval and then the NCRPB will put it in public domain for consultation. The current plan allows agriculture and horticultural activities, social forestry and plantations in the NCZ areas. Regional recreational activities such as sanctuary and regional parks are also allowed with construction not exceeding 0.5% of the land and this requires prior permission. In the Draft Regional Plan 2041, NCRPB has proposed a change. It says, “The 0.5% of total area under NCZ is allowed for related compatible development which could be either at one place or at multiple locations, subject to other approvals, Acts of different states and related sectors and land use compatible with the area. Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) shall be admissible to land owners of such conservation areas for sustainable conservation.” In fact, when the earlier Haryana government had tried to push for tourism activities in Aravalis, which is part of the NCZ in 2014, the environment and forest ministry had opposed this move. In its letter addressed to NCRPB and Union urban affairs secretary on April 24, it had said that no regional recreation activities can be permitted with construction exceeding 0.5% of the area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/proposal-to-split-ncz-into-2-may-hit-conservation-battle/articleshow/85779144.cms||Dipak K Dash

Addressing a public rally at Ram Leela ground in Mathura on the occasion of Janmashtami, Yogi said, “Earlier governments feared of being branded as communal if they paid obeisance to deities in temples. Earlier, those who were afraid to visit temples are now calling lord Ram and Krishna as their own.” “Earlier, no chief minister, minister or MLA, except from the BJP, visited people to congratulate them on Hindu festivals. But today all political parties are embracing these festivals as their own,” said the chief minister. He further said restrictions of timings which were earlier imposed on Hindu festivals, no program could be organised after 12 am, no fire crackers could be burst after 10 pm, and no Rangotsav was held after 12 am, are no longer there and people can proudly celebrate their festivals. “I have prayed to lord Krishna today to end Covid-19 just like the lord killed the demons,” said the CM adding that he wanted to participate in the programme for the last three years but he could not. “This year, I got the opportunity to visit Mathura on this occasion. I am thankful to the God for granting me the opportunity,” he said. He further said that for the first time after Independence, the President of India visited Ayodhya to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla and this was made possible under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s new India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/people-no-longer-fear-of-being-branded-communal-if-they-talk-of-ram-krishna-says-yogi/articleshow/85776593.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Chandigarh||3 from Hry held for 1.5L ATM theft in Odisha cities||Bhubaneswar: A special squad of the commissionerate police on Monday arrested a gang of three persons from Haryana for allegedly stealing more than Rs 1.5 lakh from some ATMs over the last two days by tampering with the cash dispensers. The gang targeted a total of 11 unguarded ATMs, including five in Bhubaneswar and six in Cuttack, of a leading nationalised bank. The accused were identified by the police as Mohammad Salman (18) and Raj Kumar Tanwar (35) from Faridabad, and Sheikh Kafhaiyat (35) from Nuh. The police said the accused came to Odisha in their SUV, which has been seized. They were trying to steal cash from an ATM in the Old Town area when the bank received an alarm and immediately informed the police, leading to their arrest. Narrating their modus operandi, the police said the accused fiddled with the cash dispensing trays of the ATMs to commit the fraud. “We found that the accused damaged the cash dispenser windows and inserted a small steel plate into them. This hindered the cash dispensing system of the machines,” Sanjeev Satapathy, the assistant commissioner of police (special squads), said. The accused had taken many debit cards from their acquaintances and used those to defraud the bank. They first inserted the debit cards and placed the amount they wanted to withdraw on the screen. “They withdrew the cash from the dispensing trays. However, the sensors perhaps misread the action owing to the damage caused to the dispensers. The sensors sent auto-generated messages to the servers about the transactions having failed and cash not being dispensed. Within seconds, the bank accounts concerned were credited despite the withdrawal of the cash from the ATMs,” Satapathy said. The police are likely to take the accused into custody for interrogation. They said the accused are part of a bigger interstate gang whose members have been targeting unguarded ATMs in different states. The police have advised the banks to improve the security features, including software systems of their ATMs, and deploy security guards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/3-from-hry-held-for-1-5l-atm-theft-in-odisha-cities/articleshow/85781442.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: More complexes join Ganesh Chaturthi bandwagon but celebrations to be muted||KOLKATA: More than 100 khuti pujas for Ganesh Chaturthi were performed on Monday in areas like Salt Lake, New Town, lake Town, Burrabazar and south Kolkata, setting the ball rolling for the festive season. At Kumartuli, the porters have been receiving steady orders for the idols of the deity signifying luck and prosperity, though, the organisers have scaled down both the size of the idol and celebrations owing to the pandemic. The orders coming from housing complexes or co-operatives have increased marginally due to the safety guidelines for Covid-19. Ganesh Chaturthi will be celebrated on September 10 this year. Salt Lake Maitri Sangha organised the khuti puja on Monday. The puja that takes place near Salt Lake swimming pool every year is organised by resident of BF and CF block together. “Since Janmashtami is an auspicious day so we had the khuti puja today. The work on the pandal will start from Tuesday onwards and the deity will be brought next week,” said Kripa Shankar Sharma, president of the club. . The past 10 to 12 years have witnessed a steep rise in the number of Ganesh pujas in the city. Earlier there would not be more than 100 to 150 Ganesh Pujas in the city and most were in pockets like Burrabazar, Posta, SN Banerjee Road, Kankurgachi and Bangur. But now there are close to 1,000 to 1,200 Ganesh Pujas every year. One of the main reason behind the popularity is the heightened prayer for prosperity not only among the business class but even those in service and manufacturing. Another big reason is the active role politicians have started playing. “The top Durga Pujas in the city are headed by the frontline politicians of the ruling party. But those in the second and the third rung too need to mobilise their workers but don’t have the budget. So, they started organising their own Ganesh Pujas,” said a TMC leader who organises a big Ganesh Puja in south Kolkata. This year, more housing societies have decided to organise the Puja, since visiting the communities might be a problem due to Covid-19 safety guidelines. Many gated communities which already organise Ganesh Chaturthi have got all their members vaccinated before undertaking the preparations. “We have 405 apartments in the housing and everybody is already fully vaccinated. The preparations for the festival will start from Tuesday,” said Paramita Adhikari, cultural secretary of Greenwood Sonata in New Town. “Due to the pandemic and safety guidelines we will be involving very few people in the arrangements and all norms will be followed.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/more-complexes-join-ganesh-chaturthi-bandwagon-but-celebrations-to-be-muted/articleshow/85779147.cms||Zeeshan Javed

According to police, the player met a girl during a tournament in 2017. They struck a rapport and the girl invited him to come to Jaipur to provide private tennis coaching to people. She assured lucrative fees. The youth came to Jaipur in June 2018. The girl took him to a C-Scheme located hotel on the pretext of meeting people interested in taking tennis lessons from him. But as soon as he entered the room, a girl was already there while a man who claimed himself to be a journalist allegedly beat him up and locked the door. When he tried to leave, the girl reportedly threatened him by saying that she will scream for help and implicate him in a molestation case. The gang then allegedly compelled him to stay in the room. They also allegedly forced him to undress and recorded videos of him in intimate activities with a girl. The family claimed that he was 17-year-old when the incident in the hotel took place. A series of bullying and extortion soon began. He allegedly paid Rs 6 lakh on different occasions and in multiple tranches to the gang members. Clouded by worries, his tennis performance began to take a hit. When his family members asked him about the matter, he finally confided in them and revealed his ordeal. His mother filed an FIR at Ashok Nagar police station on Sunday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/tennis-player-blackmailed-in-2018-fir-filed-on-sunday/articleshow/85781452.cms||---

The reservoir has been getting steady inflows for a while. The present water level at the reservoir was 1,762.50 feet against the full tank level (FTL) of 1,763.5 feet. As of Monday (till 6 pm), the inflow was 2,500 cusecs and the floodgates would be opened if the same quantity continued into the reservoir, according to an official statement released by Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) on Monday. Water board officials have alerted Hyderabad district administration and police to be prepared for any contingency, including evacuation of people from low-lying areas. The floodgates were initially opened in July and subsequently kept open for a couple of weeks, with gates being shut periodically as the inflows reduced. On August 10, the last floodgate of the reservoir was closed after inflows reduced to a trickle. The reservoir has 17 floodgates in all.

The toddler, Ved Akshay Chaskar (3), was rushed to a private hospital where he was treated and received about 150 stitches on his neck and head, said officials from the Junnar forest division. The child was playing in the verandah of his house while his parents were working nearby in a cattleshed when the leopard emerged from a sugar cane farm close by and pounced on him. Deputy conservator of forest (Junnar) Jayram Gowda said on Monday that the leopard caught the boy by his neck and dragged him into a sugar cane thicket about 25m away. “Hearing Ved’s cries, his parents chased the animal shouting for help. The animal then left the child and fled,” said Gowda. “Ved was bleeding from the back of his neck and throat, and was rushed to a private hospital in Aalephata village,” Gowada said. “He was later shifted to a private hospital in Bhosari where he has been treated,” Gowda added. Forest officials, who reached the spot in the village where the incident took place, found pugmarks of the leopard, as well as bloodstains. Yogesh Ghodke, forest officer, Otur range, said they have received permission to install cages in the village to catch the leopard. “The leopard is frequently in and around the village due to a large number of sugar cane fields and fruit plantations,” said Ghodke. “We suspect that the animal might have identified the child as a prey. However, we are investigating all possible aspects,” said Gowda. According to government norms, Gowda said the family will be compensated. “The family will get compensation of up to Rs 2 lakh from the government soon,” he added. In 2015, three deaths were reported due to leopard attacks in Junnar. A 60-year-old woman Sakhubai Hile from Pimpalgaon Joga was mauled to death in May. In April, five-year-old Praveen Dudhpade was killed by a leopard in Khamundi village while in March, a toddler was killed by a leopard in Dindore village.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/three-yr-old-boy-severely-injured-in-leopard-attack-in-junnar-village/articleshow/85779178.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Nagpur||16 more tiger bones, whiskers seized near Kanhargaon; 3 held||Nagpur: In a major breakthrough in the tiger poaching case, Butibori forest officials on Monday arrested three more persons from Pachgaon, bordering Kanhargaon Wildlife Sanctuary in Central Chanda division. Those arrested have been identified as Vijay Laxman Aalam, Ramchandra Nago Aalam, and Vasanta Adku Tekam, all aged around 55. While two accused were taken into custody, Vasanta was asked to stay back as he is suffering from paralysis. The arrests are linked to the seizure of a tiger nail and canines on August 27. In all, 16 tiger bones including the skull, three whiskers, four canines, porcupine quills, peacock feathers, and wire snares, weapons etc were seized from the accused. Sources said the obscure Pachgaon is mostly engaged in bamboo extraction through community forest rights (CFR) under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, but the village did not have any record. “It is simply shocking that locals are not only engaged in the extraction of forest produce under FRA but are also engaged in poaching,” they said. The accused were nabbed based on the statements of four accused who were arrested on August 27, after laying a trap by a team led by ACF Narendra Chandewar. Those who were arrested earlier included Vijay Wagh (33), Butibori, Parasram Bijwe (36,) Taas, Ganesh Ramteke (28), Bordkala, and Dikshanand Raut (30), Masal near Chimur. The forest officials had information that a deal was being struck to sell tiger nails and canines near a dhaba on Butibori-Chandrapur NH-7. All the accused were remanded in forest custody till September 3. It is not known how many tigers were poached. Forest officials were shy of revealing the area from where the tiger was poached. “We don’t know how many tigers are involved. During the last four days, five persons were arrested from Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR) landscape and 13kg tiger bones were seized,” said officials. In the Butibori case, accused Bijwe belongs to Taas village, which is on the outskirts of Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary, while another accused Raut hails from Masal near Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). Another three accused arrested on Monday stay close to Kanhargaon Wildlife Sanctuary. “The various incidents involving the seizure of tiger body parts indicate that tigers outside protected areas are nobody’s baby. Electrocution is rampant, and in an attempt to protect crops from herbivores, tigers are also being eliminated. The protection mechanism in the forest department needs a complete overhaul,” said Uday Patel, honorary wildlife warden of Gadchiroli.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/16-more-tiger-bones-whiskers-seized-near-kanhargaon-3-held/articleshow/85779216.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Nagpur||Hearts of city’s Afghans bleed for trapped kin||Nagpur: Deep dejection filled the voices of Afghan refugees like Arz Mohammad and Khan Gul Mohammadi — now Nagpur residents — whose relatives and friends are trapped in a war-torn country captured by the surging Taliban. The relentless reports and images of blasts, evacuations, killings and bombings in the media are leaving them more worried as they minced no words to blame Pakistan and its “ally” America for the fiasco. Arz and Mohammadi said Pakistan’s villainy has pushed their country to turmoil as the former fuelled this Taliban uprising to ensure Afghanistan remained a poor and under-developed country. “Pakistan was carved out of a region which was originally known as Pakhtoonistan. Their country came up, bleeding the Afghans. This Talibani coup is engineered by Pakistan so that they do not have to return the lands they were supposed to give back to Afghanistan,” said Arz. “The Taliban regime has captured power but can it govern a country without having any knowledge and experience of it,” he asked. Mohammadi, who owns a biryani shop on Gorewada Ring Road in partnership with Arz, lamented that his wife and five children left Nagpur just a few months ago to return to Kabul after growing differences with him. “I have been speaking to my friends and relatives in Kabul; the situation is really bad there. People have kept their belongings on the roadside, offering to sell them off with a mindset to leave the place immediately,” he said. “In 1995, Taliban had come to power but did nothing. There is no hope about them doing anything better this time,” said Mohammadi, labelling the Talibanis as ‘jahils’ (unlettered). Arz said the schools, banks, markets and most establishments had shut down. “Those who had jobs have lost them. Business people have closed their operations. The economy has collapsed miserably,” said Arz, on the basis of the telephonic conversations he is having with his kin in Afghanistan. “My relatives and friends are all cooped up indoors. They are not stepping out of their homes due to fear. No one knows what the future holds for them,” he said. Arz and Mohammadi had migrated to India around five years ago seeking greener pastures. “Our fathers and forefathers had been frequenting India as traders and we sold various materials like dry fruits, carpets, blankets and so on. We were driven out of Afghanistan due to poverty and economic crisis,” they said. Mohammadi added, “If the men are so scared to leave their houses, we cannot imagine what the women would be going through. Everyone knows how the Taliban treats women.” Mohammadi attributed the migration of refugees like him to the aggravated military action between various outfits and security forces there. “The ongoing strife in Afghanistan had compelled us to leave our native land and shift to India. We are quite happy and living peacefully India, thanks to local administration, police and the Indian government. My wife and children made a major mistake by leaving this place for Afghanistan. They will realize it soon,” said Mohammadi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/hearts-of-citys-afghans-bleed-for-trapped-kin/articleshow/85779279.cms||Soumitra Bose

Senior inspector Balkrushna Kadam of the Hadapsar police said, “We found a note, purportedly written by Mahajan, from the flat where he had been staying alone after his wife succumbed to cancer in May. Among other things, the note stated that he was depressed after his wife’s death and had run into financial trouble.” He said, “Mahajan mentioned in the note that he had given a loan of Rs2 lakh to two persons and they were not returning the money.

The recovery agents of the finance firm were harassing him.” Kadam said, “We shall send the note to handwriting experts for verification. For now, a case of accidental death has been registered.” “Mahajan’s landlord, who stays nearby, realised in the afternoon that a foul smell was emanating from the flat. Mahajan was neither responding to doorbell nor answering phone calls.

---||Nagpur||Siblings injured in NMC anti-encroachment drive||Nagpur: A 15-year-old girl’s hand got fractured while her 10-year-old sister suffered bruises after they tried to prevent Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) anti-encroachment drive in Wardhaman Nagar. The episode involves former town vending committee member Nandkishore Sharma who sells fast food in a handcart in Wardhaman Nagar. According to Sharma, he had obtained a licence from the NMC for running his business. On July 26, the NMC’s anti-encroachment squad visited Wardhaman Nagar to evict handcarts and other encroachments from footpaths and roads. “During the drive, the anti-encroachment squad led by enforcement inspector Anil Kamble started seizing my stall,” Sharma told TOI. “Soon, my daughters, Palak (15) and Aditi (10), informed me about the NMC’s drive as I had gone to hospital for a check-up. I told them to show the officials the hawking licence that we obtained from the NMC. I also told my daughters that I would be there soon,” he claimed. Despite Palak furnishing the hawking licence, the enforcement squad did not budge. One of the woman constables then resorted to lathi-charge after the sisters tried to defend their stand, leaving Palak with a fracture on her right hand. Palak’s younger sister Aditi too was allegedly manhandled by the squad. After his return, Sharma found his daughters crying. The father, however, succeeded in preventing the NMC squad from seizing his handcart. “The court had directed the NMC to identify hawking zones within the city limits for rehabilitation of hawkers but nothing was done,” Sharma told NMC officials. “I saw lathi marks on Palak’s right hand while Aditi had bruises on her left hand,” Sharma stated in a complaint to additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi. Sharma also lodged a complaint at the Nandanwan police station against the NMC team for injuring his daughters. Meanwhile, additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi assured the victims of action against the ‘guilty officials’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/siblings-injured-in-nmc-anti-encroachment-drive/articleshow/85781536.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Delhi||Rs 33-crore parking project to ease traffic woes near Delhi's Punjabi Bagh crematorium||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation will develop an automated multilevel parking system at the Punjabi Bagh crematorium under a Rs 33.8-crore project. The second largest cremation centre in the city currently has the capacity to park 80-90 cars and the spillover parking often leads to traffic jams on Ring Road. The new facility will be able to cater to 225 vehicles at a time. The crematorium is one of the largest such facilities in Delhi. It is situated on Ring Road along the Club Road flyover. “Since the facility is situated at a prime location and is easily accessible, this crematorium is being used by a large number of people from north and west Delhi areas,” an official said. “Due to less capacity of existing surface parking within the crematorium, there is commonly a long queue of vehicles outside the crematorium resulting in traffic congestion on Ring Road along the existing flyover throughout the year,” the proposal earlier put forth by the municipal commissioner argued. “The traffic congestion is likely to increase substantially in this stretch as the Bharat Darshan Park is under construction in the vicinity of the crematorium and this park is expected to be visited by a large number of people,” the proposal stated. The consultant for the project had proposed three options of puzzle parking with 225 cars capacity, a tower parking system with 170 cars capacity and shuttle parking system with 160 cars capacity. “The puzzle parking system has been preferred due to higher parking capacity, queue length and traffic circulation around the parking,” the official stated. Out of the Rs 33.8 crore, Rs 8.7 cr will be spent on the building work, Rs 14.1cr on parking equipment and Rs 10.9 cr on operations and maintenance of the parking system for 10 years. Earlier, the civic body had approved similar automated parking systems at Amar Colony, Greater Kailash and near Nizamuddin Basti. Automated parking systems are already operational in Green Park and Lajpat Nagar, while the parking project in Adhchini is nearing completion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/rs-33-crore-parking-project-to-ease-traffic-woes-near-punjabi-bagh-crematorium/articleshow/85779285.cms||---

The volcanic sheet rock, due to differential weathering, formed certain patterns. Historian Sriramoju Haragopal of Kotha Telangana Charitra group said, “The volcanic sheet rocks could be 6.5 crore years old. They are found in different formations in the region.” Chakilam Venugopal Rao, retired deputy director-general, Geological Survey of India, said, “At first glance, the crude polygonal patterns appear like anthropogenic petroglyphs . However, on careful examination, the polygonal grove appears to be following defined patterns of joints. Such highlighted joint patterns are due to combination of spheroidal weathering and differential weathering. The blocky pattern is of volcanic origin. Such defined patterns are known in different volcanic rocks, especially volcanic tuff and basalt combined with tuffaceous material. The surface patterns on the basalt flows are worth preserving for posterity. They are unique,” Haragopal said Sourab Pal, senior geologist, GSI also expressed his opinion. “These seem to me a result of differential weathering surface of rock. Here, blocky weathering, which highlights joints, combines with spheroidal weathering. Such weathering are common among diversity of volcanic rocks. Differential weathering of a volcanic rock, emphasising the joint pattern and components.” Professor N Chandramouuli of Pondicherry University said: “The images of rock patterns on sheet rock were not reported from any other place in our country. We have petroglyphs in Goa, comprising of animals and birds on sheet rock. The associated archaeological context, if any, found at the present site may give some clues about their nature and age. Otherwise, an international expert may be able to identify their significance.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/volcanic-sheet-rock-with-shapes-found-in-adilabad/articleshow/85782961.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The state plans to build 2,601 ‘Rythu Vedika’ to give farmers a single platform for support as well as better prices for crops. KTR, who was accompanied by agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy and school education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy, urged the university to ensure ‘AgHub’ doors were open for farmers as they were the best innovators despite limited resources. “We should encourage more such ventures. Technology must serve the common man, otherwise it is of no use,” KTR told the audience. He also appealed to authorities to set up signboards in Telugu for the benefit of farmers who could not read English. The IT minister said that production, productivity and profitability were the most important things for a farmer. While production has increased in the last few years, it was time for all to focus on improving productivity and profitability, he said. KTR also said that soon Telangana would achieve record oil palm cultivation as state has increased its production target. He alleged that the BJP-led government at the Centre has been reduced to sloganeering and failed to deliver on its pledge to double farmers’ income by 2020. However, Telangana government has made strides in this area, he said.

As on the end of the 2020-21 fiscal, the bank has been making a profit for five years, but still has an accumulated loss at around Rs 627 crore. The RBI had recently denied Rupee Bank permission to merge with Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank. “We have written to RBI seeking three options for the future of the bank. These options include the bank’s merger with a large bank, the bank to be converted into a small finance bank, among others.

While 258 persons were rescued from station in 2018, 77 children and women have been rescued this year till July. Officials claimed this number had been going down over the last couple of years owing to the pandemic and awareness campaigns being run across the country. “Mostly minors and women have been rescued from Jaipur and Gandhinagar stations. They mostly come from other states like Bihar and while factories were closed due to the pandemic, there were fewer rescues. Apart from this, the states from where these people come have been regularly running awareness campaigns, which has acted as a deterrent epecially in trafficking cases”, said an official of RPF. In 2018, 258 children and women were rescued which reduced to 223 in 2019, 174 in 2019 and 77 till July 2021. The helplines for children have been working during the pandemic to deal with issues which the minors have been facing because of the Covid situation. Jaipur railway child help desk officials claimed that while the number of cases in the year 2020-21 have reduced from the previous year, they are getting more number of runaway cases. These children are handed over to the child welfare committee, who get in touch with the families and in case there is no legal guardians, then the minors are accommodated in shelters. Meanwhile, the Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights has also started the process of working on a policy to curb child labour in the state which has become a concern for the officials, more so because of Covid.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/over-700-kids-women-rescued-by-rpf-in-jaipur-division-since-2018/articleshow/85781631.cms||Yeshika Budhwar
---||Nagpur||CAP Std XI deadline extended till today||Nagpur: The state’s education department has extended the deadline for Std XI admissions in the city by a day to Tuesday to help students gather relevant documents needed for admissions. Focus was on students who are yet to get their caste certificates, something which is a crucial part of the admission process. The education department is allowing submission of an acknowledgement receipt which proves that the student has applied for the caste certificate. The centralized admission process (CAP) is completely online and applicable only to colleges located within the city limits. This year the academic session has been majorly delayed because of two things. First was Covid pandemic’s second wave which resulted in cancellation of exams and also delay in results. Second reason was specific to cities where CAP is mandatory. The education department decided to conduct a common entrance test (CET) for students based on which they will get admissions in Std XI. Though this test was not mandatory, the department made it clear that priority in admissions shall be given to those who appeared for this test. A senior teacher said, “This, in a way, made it mandatory as no one would like to be standing at the end of the line for admissions.” However, some parents in Mumbai challenged the CET in high court following which it was scrapped. The education department then revised the CAP dates and as of now only the first round of admission will come to an end. Physical classes have resumed in full swing from July itself in colleges just outside the city limits because CAP is not applicable to them and students can get admissions directly by approaching the college. A city junior college principal said, “We are now more than a month behind in the academic schedule as compared to our rural counterparts and this deadline extension, though by a day only, further adds to the delay.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/cap-std-xi-deadline-extended-till-today/articleshow/85779341.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Delhi||Delhi: Kingpin, 11 women arrested for running fake call centre that promised cheap loans||NEW DELHI: Rohini district police have arrested 11 women and their male associate for allegedly running a fake call centre and duping people by offering them low interest loans under a fictitious scheme named ‘pradhan mantri loan yojna’. According to DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal, the accused have duped people from several states, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. “Twenty-nine mobile handsets, one tablet, customer details register, order book receipts, internet dongles, a laptop and other incriminating documents have been seized from the accused,” Tayal said. The arrested man, Deepak Saini (24), belongs to Nangloi and is one of the masterminds of the racket, cops said. The call centre was being run from the first floor of a building in sector 6, Rohini. “Acting on the directions of senior officers, ground staff was briefed to develop information regarding fake call centres operating in the area. The teams alerted informers and received a tip-off about this call centre after which a probe was initiated and surveillance mounted,” the DCP added. A team comprising ACP Brahamjeet Singh and inspector Kuldeep Singh conducted a raid on the premises and found the employees engaged in tele-calling. On seeing police party, they stopped their activities and tried to hide their mobile phones. During questioning the accused admitted they were involved in duping people on the pretext of offering personal loans at very low interest rates under ‘pradhan mantri loan yojna’. The accused told cops that they used to make calls to people offering loans on lucrative interest rates so that they could start some business. They claimed it was being done by the government as part of Covid relief package. To make it look like an authentic deal, they used to collect documents and ID proofs of the customers. In lieu of sanctioning the loan, the gang would ask them to pay a certain amount as “processing fee”. Subsequent to submission of the fee, they would keep asking them to pay more money on one pretext or another. Later, they would block the person and go unreachable. The 12 accused persons have been sent to judicial custody up to September 10, 2021. However, the owner of the call centre is yet to be arrested.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/kingpin-11-women-arrested-for-running-fake-call-centre-that-promised-cheap-loans/articleshow/85779399.cms||---

ISWAI CEO Nita Kapoor pointed out that such a move will not only boost tourism but also contribute to state revenues. Andhra Pradesh government recently switched liquor policy from prohibition to restriction. Suresh Menon, secretary-general, ISWAI said, “The state government should not discriminate between the new local brands and the historically popular national brands, most of which are also produced locally within the state. This curtailment of consumer preferences will only promote illegal movement of products and encourage spurious and counterfeit liquor that will ultimately harm the consumers, besides impacting state revenues.” Kapoor rooted for ‘responsible alcohol consumption’ campaign to promote tourism in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/iswai-urges-ap-to-allow-indian-made-foreign-liquor-brands-in-state/articleshow/85779375.cms||---

---||Delhi||Two accused of attack on Delhi cops granted bail||NEW DELHI: A city court has granted bail to two people arrested for allegedly attacking policemen. It noted that if one of the injured cops had left the police station at 8.05pm, then he couldn’t have received secret information at 7.20pm about a satta being run by the accused while he was allegedly on patrol duty. According to the FIR, sub-inspector Sachin Dev Dangi and head constables Harender Kumar and Devender were patrolling the area. Around 7.20pm, an informer informed them that some boys were running a satta. However, the documents filed in the chargesheet mentioned that Dangi had left for patrol duty at 08.05pm. Additional Sessions Judge Sanjeev Kumar Malhotra said, “There is no satisfactory explanation given by the investigating officer as to why the information to the police station was given after about one hour of the alleged incident, although some other policemen without any information had reached there.” The court further said it was surprising that a mere swelling on the left side of Kumar’s face was opined as a grievous injury by the doctor. It observed that perusal of the chargesheet showed that although on the medico-legal case report of Dangi and Kumar the doctor had opined the nature of injuries as grievous, there was no X-ray or any other material on record to show that the injuries were grievous. It directed that a copy of the order be sent to the medical superintendent of the hospital to examine the basis on which the doctor gave the opinion. The court also said that a copy of the order be sent to DCP (Shahdara) for his information and further necessary action. The accused, Raja and Nawab Sarif, were granted bail on furnishing a bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety of like amount each. The counsel for the accused claimed that they were falsely implicated in the matter and the doctor concerned had opined only swelling and laceration as grievous injuries under the influence of the police officers. Police had opposed the bail pleas saying the accused were arrested as their co-accused had disclosed their names. They had been booked under IPC sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and 34 (common intention).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/2-accused-of-attack-on-cops-granted-bail/articleshow/85779384.cms||Usha Das
---||Aurangabad||Farmer rues tomato cultivation, feeds produce to livestock||Aurangabad: The promising start to the monsoon in June this year had raised Navnath Chavan’s hopes of making good profits from tomato cultivation. Two months down the line, the 37-year-old farmer from Lasur near Aurangabad, regrets his decision. Following the recent crash in wholesale prices, Chavan has had to open up his farm for the livestock to feed on the tomatoes. “After all the hard work, I would have made Rs 20,000 against my investment of Rs 1.3 lakh. I grew tomatoes but earned only regrets. I am getting Rs 2 per kg for my yield, which is a mockery,” said the marginal contractual farmer who has to feed his parents, three children and wife. Like Chavan, many other tomato growers in the region are getting extremely low prices for their agricultural produce, which is selling at the price of Rs 10 per kg in the local retail markets. Each crate of tomatoes, with around 28 kg of the produce, has been selling for only Rs 80 in the local wholesale market. This is a huge drop in price. The main wholesale market in the Jadhavmandi area recently witnessed few incidents of tomato growers dumping their yield without selling the same. The office-bearers of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), Aurangabad, said they have little scope for intervention. “Tomato production has been much more than the actual demand, which has caused the prices to crash. Many AMPCs do not have the cold-storage facilities to store perishable agricultural items like tomatoes,” AMPC president Jagganath Kale said. He suggested the state agricultural department should have certain control over the cropping pattern. “Unlike agriculturally developed countries like Israel, the cropping choice is still the sole discretion of the farmers in our country, which leads to price crashes in case of bumper crops. Also, the government should encourage setting up of different agricultural product and food processing industries that can open more market avenues for the farmers,” Kale said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/farmer-rues-tomato-cultivation-feeds-produce-to-livestock/articleshow/85776916.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Delhi||Fancy this! In less than hour from Delhi's IGI airport, catch a transit flight at Greater Noida’s Jewar||NEW DELHI: A 95-km ride between transit flights can be daunting. But in a few years, transit flyers from Indira Gandhi International Airport could board a rapid train to Sarai Kale Khan, then change to the Varanasi bullet train. A mere 21 minutes later, they could reach Noida International Airport to take their connecting flights. This is among the five connectivity plans the central government is drawing up for the upcoming airport at Greater Noida’s Jewar, 95km from IGI. Arun Vir Singh, CEO of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority and NIA Limited, told TOI, “We will have an interchange from Eastern Peripheral Expressway for Yamuna Expressway, which is close to NIA. One segment of the Eastern Expressway goes to Uttarakhand, the other towards Manesar. IGI Airport will be connected to NIA via this link.” He added, “We will also have an elevated road from the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, of which 24km will be in Haryana and 10km in Uttar Pradesh. The two state governments are holding discussions on sharing the land acquisition cost. NHAI will carry out the construction. We will give road connectivity to Jewar from Delhi via Ballabhgarh.” Apart from these two surface connections, three rail links are also planned. “The IGI Airport Express runs via Shivaji Stadium Delhi Metro station and this corridor will link the two airports. A metro train line will link NIA with Shivaji Stadium with 4-5 stations en route,” revealed Singh. The proposed Delhi-Varanasi bullet train will be another link. According to Singh, the preliminary detailed project report has a bullet train station at the NIA terminal itself. The final DPR is being worked out. Additionally, the regional rapid transit system is planned between Sarai Kale Khan and IGI, opening up another connectivity between the two airports. While no timeline has been set for the proposed Delhi-Varanasi bullet train, Rail Board sources said the National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited has conducted a Lidar survey, or light detection and ranging, on the proposed route to examine the surface of the earth. “A straight-line route is necessary for trains travelling at 300kmph, so the scanning was done while preparing the detailed project report,” confirmed a source. Depending on the Covid situation, the Noida airport is expected to become operational in around three years. The surface and metro links are likely to be ready by then. “Work has already started on the Noida airport site. Earth levelling is going on and a site office will come up shortly,” claimed Singh. The biggest emerging concern as the National Capital Region gears up to be among the first cluster of cities in India to get a second civilian airport is the daunting 95-km gap between IGI and NIA for transit travellers, especially given Delhi’s choked roads. This is a far cry from what Delhi has witnessed decades ago when commercial flights shifted from Safdarjung Airport to Palam in 1962. The approach road to IGI’s Terminal, when it opened in 1986, made driving a breeze in the congestion-free good old days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/fancy-this-in-less-than-hour-from-igi-catch-a-transit-flight-at-jewar/articleshow/85779683.cms||Saurabh Sinha

A division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar directed the dean of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) to immediately complete the formalities and take necessary steps for DNA profiling and preserving the samples, including the fetus. The bench also instructed Khaparkheda police station’s investigating officer to immediately seize, seal and forward the samples to the chemical analyser urgently. “The survivor became pregnant due to the sexual assault by the accused. The petition is filed for termination of the forced pregnancy upon the minor. The pregnancy can be terminated urgently because the petitioner is already an indoor patient of the IGGMCH,” the judges said. The 17-year-old girl, through counsel Adil Mirza, had knocked the judiciary’s doors, alleging that the pregnancy was forced on her by accused Anilkumar Shrivastava, who allegedly exploited her with the help of her mother and distant relative Shambhunath Pal. She was also subjected to mental and physical abuse by the accused trio after the death of her father a few years ago. While praying for allowing her to abort the fetus at the earliest, Mirza informed the court about the survivor’s deteriorating health. Earlier, the medical board comprising of a gynaecologist, a female doctor, and an anesthetist, examined the minor and submitted a report to the HC through additional public prosecutor Sanjay Doifode. The board stated that the medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) is medically feasible as per the MTP Act. The patient has been fully investigated as of now and is fit for MTP from anesthesia and the physician’s point of view with due risk, the members said. On the basis of her complaint, Khaparkheda police booked the three accused under section 376 (2) (n), 323, 506 of the IPC and sections 5(i), 6 and 17 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Two accused have been arrested while main accused Shrivastava is absconding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/hc-allows-17-year-old-rape-survivor-to-abort-pregnancy/articleshow/85781669.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The Centre has allocated more than two crore additional Covid-19 vaccines to the states to vaccinate the two categories on priority in the run-up to Teacher’s Day on September 5. N K Arora, chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on immunisation, told TOI: “States must expedite full vaccination among teachers and non-teaching staff. Most would have received the first dose. The objective now is to accelerate their full immunisation.” There are nearly 97 lakh teachers in the country. Earlier this month, NITI Aayog member V K Paul had said almost 50% have already been vaccinated. “It is crucial for teachers and school support or non-teaching staff to get fully vaccinated as part of the preparation for reopening of schools,” said Arora. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has indicated that inoculation of these two groups would be necessary to restore school education that was disrupted by the pandemic in March 2020. Schools have been shut for almost 18 months, raising concerns about the cognitive and physical growth of children. “I request all the state governments to give their support and cooperation to this campaign to strengthen the foundation of the future,” Pradhan had said in a recent tweet. Experts said states and UTs can use the Unified District Information System of Education data and coordinate with their education departments, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghtan, Navodaya Vidyalaya Sanghtan to leverage full immunisation of teachers and non-teaching staff.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-cowin-starts-separate-booking-slots-for-teachers-school-support-staff/articleshow/85781706.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Kochi||Cong veteran Gopinath quits party||Palakkad/Thrissur: Veteran Congress leader and former MLA and DCC president A V Gopinath has announced his decision to quit the primary membership of the party but has not yet made up his mind on joining CPM. Addressing mediapersons here on Monday, Gopinath said, “I am ending my 50-year-long association with Congress. I feel that some people fear that my continuance in the party will affect its growth. But I do not want to be a stumbling block in the path of Congress.” He was tipped to become the new DCC president. He was given such a promise by top party leaders when he was planning to quit Congress on the eve of the assembly elections. So the announcement of the new DCC president disappointed him and his supporters. Talking to TOI, Gopinath said, “I have no intention to join any party at least for the next few months. Through my resignation I gave a strong message to Congress. Let the Congress high command examine the issues behind the resignation and the appointment of the new DCC president in Palakkad. I have to talk to my supporters, especially the Peringottukurissi grama panchayat which is ruled by Congress for the last 42 years. I have to convince them if I join any other party.” When asked specifically about widespread reports about his joining CPM, he said, “The work culture of Congress and CPM are different. The decision to join CPM is the last resort for a Congressman like me.” This has to be read along with the statement of KPCC president K Sudhakaran that he was sure that Gopinath would return to Congress. At the press conference he praised chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan as the strongest political leader of Kerala politics presently, giving indications that he is likely to join CPM. Akkara chides Gopinath Meanwhile, in a Facebook post, Congress leader and former MLA Anil Akkara said Gopinath will not be able to enjoy the respect and freedom which he was enjoying in Congress. Akkara said Gopinath has a choice of selecting the respect he was receiving in Congress or to end up as servant at the house of Pinarai Vijayan, and remain contented with the leftovers there. According to Akkara, Congress has given numerous positions to Gopinath in the past, from the posts of Peringottukurissi panchayat president to MLA, KPCC office-bearer and DCC president. “There is none currently to replace you within the Congress in Palakkad. But if you quit Congress, another leader will emerge at Peringottukurissi, though it may take time, and this is the law of nature,” Akkara said. He reacted sharply to Akkara’s comments saying, “I wouldn’t mind eating the leftovers or licking the boots of Pinarayi Vijayan. I will only be proud.” Balan attacks Cong There are reports that he held closed-door discussions with AK Balan, CPM central committee member and former minister. Balan said the CPM leadership will take a call on accepting Gopinath into its fold after he makes his stand clear. Referring to praises showered by Congress leaders on chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Balan said many Congress leaders will follow the path of Gopinath. Congress is heading for a major disintegration, none can salvage it now. Other parties in UDF like the Muslim League are also facing internal dissensions, Balan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cong-veteran-gopinath-quits-party/articleshow/85779499.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While addressing the party cadre on Sunday, Mushrif had said the NCP workers should have only one goal now: To help the party win majority seats in the upcoming local body elections. “We have started planning for the municipal council, municipal corporation and zilla parishad elections. We are going to give a chance to young party workers to contest the elections. Every party has the right to expand its base. To ensure our party workers get a fair chance, we are planning to go solo in the upcoming elections,” Mushrif had said. Mushrif’s statement has cleared the confusion over the pre-poll alliance between Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena. The three parties have teamed up to the form the state government and their leaders had joined hands recently for the Gokul Dairy election. Responding to the Mushrif’s statement, Patil said: “All parties are trying hard and there is scope for them to expand their bases. Contesting elections without alliances helps keep a party intact. We have formed alliances post the elections. For the past 15 years, Congress and NCP have been in power in the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC). We had come together after the polls with a common agenda. Elections and forming post-poll alliances have different dynamics. We may have to contest the elections independently due to the demand from workers.” The KMC polls have been due since November 2020 and are likely to be announced later this year. All the three parties had earlier contested the polls alone and had joined hands later as none of them got a clear majority to get their corporators elected as mayor and chairmen of various committees.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/satej-patil-backs-mushrifs-view-on-going-solo-in-polls/articleshow/85776864.cms||---

---||Pune||NCP’s second U-turn on leasing of amenity spaces||Pune: After changing its stand twice, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has decided to oppose the proposal to lease out amenity spaces, after a meeting on Sunday chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to rent out 270 amenity spaces to private players. They will be developed using public private partnership (PPP) model. The NCP had opposed the proposal first and then decided to back it up on Wednesday. But the party again withdrew support at the last minute before the proposal was tabled before the general body of PMC on Thursday. “We discussed the proposal and its impacts during our meeting on Sunday. A call was then taken to oppose this proposal,” Vandana Chavan, NCP’s Rajya Sabha member said on Sunday. She said the NCP was seeking 33% reservation for urban forestry and 33% reservation for gardens and grounds. The revised proposal sent by BJP did not meet these demands. Even the demand of drafting a master plan was not entertained by the BJP, she added. “We had sought more time from BJP to discuss this proposal. It should not be cleared in the present format. Debate and discussion was needed. But BJP did not make the proposal accordingly, so now we have reached to a conclusion of not supporting it,” Chavan added. The approval for the controversial proposal to lease out the amenities was put on hold on Thursday as the general body of PMC had postponed the call. The change of stand by the NCP has led to putting the proposal on the back-burner. Congress and Shiv Sena had opposed the move and continued to maintain their stand. BJP claims leasing of amenity spaces will not only develop these facilities, but also generate Rs 1,753 crore from this initiative. In another meeting, a presentation of a development plan for Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) was given to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. “The suggestions and objections from public on on this DP are important. They should be included for the overall development of the region. Rapid urbanization should be considered, while drafting this plan,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ncps-second-u-turn-on-leasing-of-amenity-spaces/articleshow/85749482.cms||---

Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director of state health services, said besides booking slots on CoWin, they can walk in and show their ID cards to get the priority shots. It would take more than a month to cover all of them, said Deshmukh, adding: “We are seeking the education department’s help so that every teacher and non-teaching staff is followed up to get fully immunised with both the doses.” A sizeable number of teachers, especially working with government schools, have already got the shots as frontline workers because they had been pressed into field duties, including contact tracing. Yet, 100% vaccination of teachers before September 5 may not be possible, said Jaywant Kulkarni, a secondary school teacher in an aided school in Navi Mumbai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/20l-school-professionals-can-get-shots-on-priority-from-tomorrow/articleshow/85781743.cms||Umesh Isalkar

All the candidates of both rival groups, United Alliance Group (UAG) and D S Chawla group filed their nominations with their respective groups.  In the afternoon all UAG group contestants filed their nominations and shortly after they left the Chawla group candidates filed their nominations. Meanwhile, on Sunday both the groups held lavish parties at different marriage palaces of the city where members of UCPMA and the office bearers of associations which represent other industries (non-cycle) were invited by the hosts to put a show of power and seek votes. According to the election schedule, Tuesday is the last date for withdrawal of the nominations and elections will be held on September 3. Speaking to TOI, UAG’s Avtar Singh Bhogal, who filed his nomination for the post of president, said, “My main focus is to take the cycle industry to unprecedented heights so that the manufacturers, specially small factory owners, can be able to produce world-class products. After our group comes into power, we will setup a helpdesk for the members to resolve their problems with any department. We will form different committees for the faster resolution of the problems of the businessmen. The committees will also keep a watch on whether or not the problems of the complainant have been resolved or not. Election committee is doing a great job by disposing off its duties in transparent and impartial manner and also ensuring proper safety arrangements for the elections. We also request all the members to come forward and vote in large number and also maintain calm and and harmony during voting on September 3.” According to Chawla, who is the current president and contesting again for the same post, “Working as a president of UCPMA during these last two years I have had sweet and bitter experiences both but the support and love extended to me by the members during my tenure. Members will vote for me and my team on the basis of achievements of my tenure including putting up fight against Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which was going to destroy bicycle industry, ending the culture of using the staff of UCPMA by the office bearers and paying off the debts of the association.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/ucpma-contestants-file-nominations-voting-on-sept-3/articleshow/85781717.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Groups lose steam as key leaders in Kerala remain neutral||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With Congress high command rallying behind the new leadership and making it clear that it will not yield to the demands of groups, the dominant groups in the party have started disintegrating. The worst scenario is in ‘A’ group headed by Oommen Chandy. Senior leaders like Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan and M M Hassan have taken the stand that the decision of the high command should be obeyed and open mudslinging will not do any good for the party. Young leaders in the group — T Siddique, P C Vishnunath and Shafi Parambil — are also advocating that a new leadership should take over the reins of the party and group dominance should end. These three leaders had stood with V D Satheesan during the selection of new opposition leader. Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan’s relation with Chandy had strained when A group was not ready to project Thiruvanchoor as nominee for the opposition leader post. Thiruvanchoor had informed AICC that he wants to become the opposition leader but he did not get any support from the parliamentary party. He had personally visited K Sudhakaran at his home when AICC appointed the Kannur leader as the new KPCC president defying objections from Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala. It is also interesting to note that Thiruvanchoor’s nominee has been appointed as the new DCC president in Kottayam. Hassan had received the support of Sudhakaran and Satheesan to continue as UDF convener even though there was a demand to remove him from the post. This made Hassan rally behind the new leadership. Benny Behannan, who was a close confidant of Chandy, was the UDF convener but was removed by A group itself to accommodate Hassan. This irked Behannan and his relation with A group had strained earlier. But he is still rallying behind Chandy. If this is the case with A group, things are no different in the ‘I’ group. In the I group, several splinter groups have been formed now with leaders rallying behind Sudhakaran, Satheesan and party general secretary K C Venugopal. Hence the disintegration process is also being witnessed in I group. If all the leaders in the group stood behind Chennithala all these days, these leaders have now started ditching him, realizing the fact that the power centre has shifted to new people in the party.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/groups-lose-steam-as-key-leaders-remain-neutral/articleshow/85779588.cms||---

Based on allegations of corruption, the Syndicate set up a committee to conduct an inquiry and a report has found irregularities too.

Aurangabad unit of the BJP on Monday staged a demonstration at Gajanan Maharaj temple at Garkheda. Local BJP MLA Atul Save and city president Sanjay Kenekar led the protest, raising slogans against the ruling MVA government amid sound of conch and traditional musical instruments. “The bars and liquor shops are allowed to reopen, but temples and other places of worship continue to remain closed. If the government does not pay heed to our demand, we will reopen temples on our own in presence of devotees,” Save said. Kenekar said, “Sena has conveniently distanced itself from the ideology of Hindutva ever since coming to power. People will never forgive such double standards of the party.” Maharashtra public health minister Rajesh Tope, while responding to the demand for reopening of temples, recently said that the decision would be taken at an appropriate time. Hundreds of BJP workers held ‘Shankh Naad’ outside the Mahalaxmi temple at Mahadwar entrance in Kolhapur city demanding the temples and other places of worship to be opened. Rahul Chikode, Kolhapur district president of BJP, said, “Now, the Covid cases have come down. All devotees of all faiths expect the places of worship to be opened. By denying the people their right to worship, the government is going against the rights of the people.” The BJP workers protested outside main temples in their city, town and villages. At Sangli, they protested outside famous Ganpati temple. Local representatives of the BJP took part in the protests. At some places, local vendors and traders also took part as their business has been hampered due to closure of the temples. Heavy police protection was deployed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/bjp-holds-stir-demanding-reopening-of-places-of-worship/articleshow/85776957.cms||---

CP said he wanted police personnel to be present on duty, be punctual and always be prepared. The top cop has already directed the police personnel to be present in the police station and in their jurisdiction, unless they are deputed on a special duty. They have also been directed to go immediately to a crime spot and also have been asked to be strictly punctual when called for the meetings. By being prepared, a police man or woman will be ready to deal with any situation, added the CP. “The officials were asked to come on duty in the wee hours and early morning hours. Further, late night mock drills were also conducted. All these efforts were made to keep them prepared to deal with any situation at any time of the day. I must also share that due to staff crunch, our PCR teams are working for 24 hours. We will make certain changes in the system to manage the duty hours.” The CP also said he wanted to highlight the unsung heroes of the police force so they could get their due recognition. Daily crime meeting The CP will also hold crime meetings daily with all the officials. In the meeting, officers will discuss crimes that occurred in their respective areas. All the officials have already been told to have information on FIRs and complaints lodged in their areas. “We are not allowed to say I will check the matter and revert on this. We are supposed to have information of all the cases and complaints being reported in our areas,” said a senior police official. Cops must be courteous towards people The top cop said in the weekly review meeting he will be addressing the police force and asking them to be polite with the complainants and visitors, as it has come to notice that the behaviour of the police personnel towards the people at times is disrespectful.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/top-cop-rolls-out-3p-formula-for-city-policing/articleshow/85781783.cms||Payal Dhawan

The Aurangabad city police arrested the 32-year-old, who is a private security guard, in a case registered under sections of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. He was produced before the court on Monday and remanded in police custody for four days. Investigation officer and police sub-inspector Vandana Muley said that the minor girl was admitted to a private hospital, where she delivered a baby on August 25. While admitting her to the hospital, the family claimed that she was a widow and no one from in-laws’ side were present at the hospital. After one of the treating doctors grew suspicious, the family was asked to produce the girl’s her Aadhaar card. It was then revealed that the girl was only 15 years old. Soon, the hospital recorded a medico-legal case and alerted the City Chowk police station. The police team took the minor into confidence. She revealed that she had allegedly been raped by her elder brother. Accordingly, an offence was registered and the suspect was arrested. Police investigation has revealed that the suspect allegedly raped her after finding her alone at home on more than one occasion. “The victim comes from a poor family, where all the members go out for work. The suspect is not married and he took advantage of finding the girl alone at home,” said an officer privy to the investigation. The family found out about the pregnancy about two months back and fearing social stigma, refrained from lodging a complaint. Police said that post-delivery, the family intended to give the baby up for adoption.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/15-year-old-delivers-baby-elder-brother-held-for-rape/articleshow/85776967.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Chandigarh||Felt like house arrest on Janmashtami, says angry locality||Chandigarh: For the residents of Sector 27, police arrangements for the press conference called by Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar at Chandigarh Press Club— on a day like Janmashtami— felt like house arrest or a curfew without warning. Somila Sandhu, who lives in Sector 27B, said the CM should have arranged the press conference at the Sector 25 Rally Ground, just like what politicians had been advising farm activists to do, if there was a security concern. “This was not an event of national importance, so I really don’t understand the urgency behind this exercise,” she said, adding that it was suffocating to see fortification of the entire sector. “There were no maids today due to Janmashtami, so I had ordered food online. However, they were not even allowing the delivery man to enter the sector, so I had to walk to the main road,” she said. Somila, who has been living in Sector 27 since 1994 and is the vice-president of Sector 27 RWA, said she had never seen such police deployment, even though several political personalities visited the club. “We felt like we were under house arrest,” she said. She added police had been harassing all the locals. “Our cars were being stopped and we were being asked to show our identity cards. Thankfully, we were warned of the protest in the morning today on our local residents’ WhatsApp group,” she added. Mohanjit Singh Pooni, a resident of Sector 27A, said most residents in their locality comprised senior citizens. “My mother is in her 80s and I had to struggle to reach the market to buy medicines. What if there was an emergency?” he said. Both Sandhu and Pooni felt residents could have either been warned or the function could have been organised in a place where locals were not harried. “He could have arranged the press conference at his own residence, instead of locking all of us up here,” added Pooni. BOX Babla to adviser: Should not happen again Angered by the fortress-like security arrangements, ward number 18 councillor and leader of opposition in MC house Devinder Babla, who is also a resident of Sector 27, wrote a letter to UT adviser Dharam Pal, saying the entire ordeal was disheartening and sad. He also hit out at the behaviour of a police personnel deployed at the sector. “People were neither allowed to go out of their homes nor allowed to enter,” he wrote. He claimed that he ended up in an argument with a police officer as all locals were being harassed in the morning. “When I was coming to my sector in the morning, I was stopped by a police officer, to which I did not object. But, when I saw there were many vehicles behind me who wanted to go to their homes in which there were many senior citizens as well, who requested a lot that we have brought medicines and to let us go to our respective homes, the police staff did not listen one bit. As a result, I had to intervene as the area councillor. After a lot of debate and heated arguments, Inspector Devinder Singh took over the spot and handled the situation,” he said He added the fortification being done on a day of a festival like Janmashtami, added to the hurt of residents. “It is very shameful to not allow the residents of the sector to leave their house; I strongly oppose this,” he said. “I request you that such an incident should not happen again. Strict action should be taken against police officials who harass residents in such a manner,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/felt-like-house-arrest-on-janmashtami-says-angry-locality/articleshow/85779548.cms||Siddarth Banerjee

Rajendra Inani, BU head, Smart Cities, Tata Projects, said, “After our repeated requests to regularise the payments were ignored by the officials, we have conveyed to the mayor that either the authorities will have to ensure due payment or close the project. The company has already escalated the issue with state authorities requesting their prompt intervention into the matter.” The firm claimed that it has installed and is maintaining more than 1 lakh lights under Ludhiana LED street lighting project. However, since installation in October 2020, Zone A and Zone C’s monthly maintenance has not been paid, claimed the company. In addition, the maintenance for Zone B and D has not been paid for the last six months. “This has unfortunately resulted in more than Rs 9 crore payment being overdue to Tata Projects,” said sources. The company also claimed that the project has achieved Rs 1.65 crore monthly savings for the city and its residents. “This can be estimated if one considers the 64% reduction on earlier monthly electricity bills of Rs 2.53 crore borne by municipal corporation when conventional street lights were used,” pointed out firm in a statement here. While Mayor Balkar Sandhu, who is out of town was not available for comments. The senior deputy mayor Shyam Sunder Malhotra said, "In a meeting at mayor office last week they had raised this issue and at that time too we had assured them that MC is ready to pay them dues but first they will have to improve things. Since first day there is issue of poor maintenance how can we make them payment when work is not satisfactory. The company is now playing blame game nothing else."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/firm-issues-notice-to-mc-over-9cr-dues-of-led-street-lights-deputy-mayor-calls-it-blame-game/articleshow/85781800.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ludhiana||Relief for bizmen: GST amnesty scheme extended till Nov 30||Ludhiana: In a big breather for the assessees and the tax practitioners of the city, the GST amnesty scheme (under which the penalties for filing returns late were waived or reduced as per the case) has been extended for three more months till November 30. The development is being welcomed in the city as several associations of both businessmen and tax professionals had sent representations to the ministry of finance for extending the deadline, which was earlier August 31. Besides this, the deadline for filing an application for revocation of the cancelled GST numbers has also been extended by one month till September 30. Stakeholders are of the opinion that the government should also refund the late fee paid by the assessees who defaulted on filing the returns and paid full charges. A notification for extension of the amnesty scheme was issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) on Sunday.Tax professional NK Thamman said, “The assessees who have tax liability but fail to file GSTR-3B by due date, the late fee is Rs 50 for every day of delay. Similarly, the assessees who have no tax liability but fail to file GSTR-3B return by due date, the late fee is Rs 20 for every day of delay and the maximum late fee levied is Rs 10,000 per return. But now under the amnesty scheme, the maximum late fee has been capped at Rs 1,000 per return (where there is a tax liability) and to Rs 500 per return (where there is nil liability) for non-furnishing of monthly or quarterly GSTR-3B by due date for the period July 2017 to April 2021, provided such return is filed between June 1, 2021, and November 30.”Thamman said, “This decision has been taken to clear pendency by those assessees who have not filed their delayed returns by May 31, 2021. The government is bringing amnesty schemes to improve GST compliance, but the genuine taxpayer will feel cheated, as they had abided by the penal provisions and deposited the late fee for delay in filing of return. There is no notification for refunding of late fee deposited by these genuine taxpayers, but the government must consider giving relief to such assessees too.”Kulpreet Malhotra, a member of United Cycle and Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association, said, “We had recently written to the ministry of finance to extend the GST amnesty scheme by six months as a big number of assessees were still unable to avail its benefit. Though the scheme has been extended by three months, we are okay with it and will avail the benefit of the waivers in late fee.”Rajkumar Singla, president of Fasteners’ Suppliers’ Association, Ludhiana, said, “We are thankful to the ministry of finance for accepting our demand. The due date for filing revocation of the cancelled GST numbers has been extended by one month, but the government should also consider refunding the late fee already paid by the taxpayers when the amnesty scheme was not in place.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/relief-for-bizmen-gst-amnesty-scheme-extended-till-nov-30/articleshow/85777002.cms||Mohit Behl

The 25-km Kolhapur-Kale village stretch will be widened in the first phase and it has a sanctioned primary budget of Rs 168 crore. Though the widened road is likely to make the ride smoother, it may take a toll on the environment as around 1,700 roadside trees along this stretch will be felled. Some local residents are also demanding that pillar-type flyovers be built at three places — that usually get submerged — between Kolhapur and Kale. The road has been handed over to the National Highway Authority by the PWD department. Sachin Sangaonkar, the executive engineer, said, “The tenders for the road works between Kolhapur and Kale have been called and will get finalised next month. The road work is expected to start by October and will have a deadline of 18 months. A new concrete road of 10m width wide will be made. For each tree that will be cut, we will plant 10 others as per the guidelines.” Environmentalists have started an online petition with the demand to stop cutting these trees. Vikas Taralekar, the person who started the online petition, said, “The government should find some alternatives and stop the butchering of these 1,700 trees that have been providing shade and oxygen to people. These trees are more than 100 years old and should be protected.” Umakant Chavan, an environment researcher, said, “This year, due to the heavy rainfall, landslides have taken place at several places. Cutting down of roadside trees will furthee loosen the soil.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/kolhapur-kale-village-road-widening-1700-trees-to-be-cut/articleshow/85777006.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

We have administered 10,07,777 Covid vaccine doses by 7pm and the final figures could be more,” said state additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas. On August 21, the state managed the highest-ever score of 11.17 lakh and, on August 27, it did another 10.02 lakh vaccinations. In Mumbai, over 1.4 lakh were vaccinated on Monday. The BMC vaccine update, however, said that 1.61 lakh people were vaccinated because it included 21,175 vaccinations done in private hospitals on Sunday. “We expect good numbers on Tuesday as well as we have adequate numbers of vaccine doses,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The high vaccination numbers on Monday are due to fresh stock of 19 lakh doses that the state received over the weekend. This included 85,000 that the BMC received. Since the immunisation drive began on January 16, the state has administered 5.81 crore doses so far. Of these, 4.23 crore have got at least one dose while 1.57 crore have had two. Experts have said the state needs to vaccinate 10 lakh every day to be able to vaccinate all its citizens by the end of the year. In Mumbai, 93 lakh vaccine doses have been distributed. Of these, 68 lakh people have got the first dose and 24.89 lakh are fully vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-vaccinates-over-a-million-in-one-day-3rd-time-in-10-days/articleshow/85781824.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Only 0.34% of fully vaxxed in Mumbai got infection: BMC||MUMBAI: Only 7,057 Mumbaikars got Covid-19 despite being fully vaccinated, according to data released by the BMC health department. This figure was computed from the civic ward-level Covid war room reports when the number of vaccinated people in Mumbai stood at 20 lakh as against 24.89 lakh on Monday evening. “This works out to 0.34% of the fully vaccinated people getting breakthrough Covid infection,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare on Monday. The definition of breakthrough infections is when an illness affects a person despite him/her being vaccinated against it. Out of the 7,057 who got breakthrough Covid-19 infection, 52% or 3,694 were senior citizens over 60 years of age. “However, the infected 60-plus group accounted for only 0.5% of the fully vaccinated senior citizens in the city so far,” said Dr Gomare. Senior citizens have emerged as the most vulnerable group in the Covid-19 pandemic so far, both in terms of morbidity and mortality. Another 2,156 (0.3%) were in the 44-59 age-group and the remaining 1,207 (0.2%) were in the 18-44 age-group, Dr Gomare added. While there has been widespread discussion and fear about new Covid variants affecting fully vaccinated people, BMC officials said that the new data showed the vaccine offers protection to the majority. “Vaccines don’t offer 100% protection against a disease, and this statistic is indicative of this,” said a senior civic hospital doctor. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said that breakthrough infections are low. “The Mumbai data seems to be no different from that emerging from across the world. Global data has shown that vaccines offer protection against death and severity of the disease,” said Dr Joshi. However, he said the BMC should give further details about how many among these 7,057 had severe disease and needed hospitalisation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/only-0-34-of-fully-vaxxed-in-city-got-infection-bmc/articleshow/85781862.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Kochi||‘A’, ‘I’ groups likely to merge||Kottayam: The new developments in state Congress party following the appointment of DCC presidents have invited the wrath of the loyalists of senior leaders Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala in the party. Those who rally behind the two leaders said that the two senior leaders do not deserve such a treatment from the new power centre in the party headed by KPCC president K Sudhakaran and opposition leader V D Satheesan. The discontent among the followers of these leaders may lead to the merger of the two groups ‘A’ and ‘I’ in the party. Meanwhile, senior leader Joseph Vazhakkan, who is close to Chennithala, said that the new leadership of the party in the state were duty-bound and responsible to consult with Chandy regarding the appointment of DCC presidents. Chandy was not just a senior leader but an AICC general secretary working from Kerala and also a Congress working committee member, he said. He also said that the new leaders should also have shown the propriety to talk to Chennithala, who too had occupied very important posts in the party. The new-found alliance will have its eye on grabbing the maximum posts during KPCC organizational revamp.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/a-i-groups-likely-to-merge/articleshow/85779702.cms||---

---||Pune||Stress of online classes in pre-schools gets to parents||Pune: Children as young as three years, and their parents are feeling the stress of online classes for the pre-primary sections stretching from one to two hours. The compulsion of daily attendance, attentiveness during the hour-long sessions and the pressure to keep up with the class is telling on both groups. Preschoolers, experts say, must not be compelled, to be in front of screens. Shweta Patel’s son joined a play school this year. For two weeks, the school tried online classes, but soon realised that keeping such young children engaged online for 15 minutes is impossible. “They have opened schools physically now for the playgroup. Their staff is vaccinated and as parents, we take all precautions. At that age, what the children need most is social interaction. I don’t expect them to teach my son anything, but at least he should be able to interact with other children, play, listen to stories. Online education is not suited for the formative years, and it is easier on parents too. Otherwise, that one hour was unmanageable as it was a struggle to make the child sit still,” she said. IT professional Santosh Suryavanshi whose son is in junior kindergarten, felt pre-schools must be allowed to reopen physically. “Online classes are more for parents than for children when it comes to pre-schools. The children are too young to learn on their own and can get distracted easily. Hence, one parent needs to be constantly with the student for two hours. If both are working, then we have to divide the time and sit with them while simultaneously doing our office work. In school, even if they don’t want to do something, they will imitate what other students are doing,” he said. Getting such young children to do the home work is tough, he added. Parents are already overworked and the children are too young to complete it on their own, he added. All parents cannot send the homework by 6pm or the time set by the teacher. “But the teacher cannot correct homework till midnight. A couple I know works the night shift and the other the day shift. Imagine the struggle of online classes for them. If the children are not monitored, they will mute themselves, switch off the video and roam around. We take children to malls, shopping centres, restaurants, parks, society common areas and hospitals. In such situations, the school is also a safe option. If the staff is vaccinated, and parents take enough care, sending preschoolers to physical classes will be a good thing,” Suryavanshi further said. The head of a preschool with several branches across the city said extreme competition among parents is taking a toll on students, teachers and on the parents themselves. “Our school tied up with an online partner for a mathematics-based activity just to give exposure to students. There were over 100 levels for four-year-olds. Each level had to be completed in three days. All we expected was for students to enjoy solving the problems as much as they can and leave it there. Three days later, two parents came up to me saying that their child had completed 124 levels and they wanted their names to be displayed. Imagine what the child must have gone through for three days. It was just a fun activity,” the principal said. Preschoolers are not expected to be attentive, but parents make it so. “We have two-hour classes for preschool children. We wanted to reduce it to one hour, but the management needs to justify the fees and parents did not ask for shorter hours. In fact, we have parents wanting an hour’s class for play-groups too. We had a hard time explaining that a child so young cannot be expected to be in front of the screen studying,” the principal said. During physical classes too, not all children would answer, some have very little attention span, some are very active, some study and answer on their own. But, teachers help them learn at the same level. “Many parents see their child not speaking up like the others and get upset. The child must learn at his or her own pace. Parents must be facilitators and not micro-manage,” the principal added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/stress-of-online-classes-in-pre-schools-gets-to-parents/articleshow/85779734.cms||Ardhra Nair

They fear that their kin might find it difficult to come here after Tuesday, the deadline set by the Taliban for the exit of the United States and allies from Afghanistan. Family of Maan Singh, who ran a Unani medicines shop at Shor Bazaar in Kabul before Taliban took over, lives near Dana Mandi in Ludhiana. His wife Kiran and three sons are worried as he had gone to Afghanistan about a month ago.“Since the deadline set by the Taliban is Tuesday, we don’t know how my husband will return. I talk to him frequently and he says he is fine there with other persons in a gurdwara in Kabul. We are worried for him and my children are having sleepless nights,” says Kiran.Family of Darshan Kaur of Sindhu Nagar is getting jittery as her 13 relatives, including her daughter and son-in-law, are in Kabul. “My daughter Channa Kaur and son-in-law Rajinder Singh, who has a medical store in Shor Bazaar in Kabul, have been living there for more than 10 years and they are Afghan citizens. My granddaughters, Manpreet Kaur (14) and Taranjeet Kaur (13), came here after a bomb blast near a gurdwara in Shor Bazaar in February this year in which our relative Sunny Singh had died. Our relatives, Chocha Singh and Sher Singh, were injured in the blast. Besides them, my three nephews and other relatives are also stuck there,” says Darshan Kaur. The family is apprehensive that after August 31, once the Taliban get control of the airport, people’s movement will be controlled by them.“I cannot sleep in such circumstances. My granddaughters are also having sleepless nights. They miss their parents all the time. They are safe in the gurdwara, but we are waiting for their return. They told me that Afghan citizens had gathered at the airport, but no one is being allowed to go ahead. The Indian government should safely bring those who are stuck there,” Darshan Kaur adds. Another family living here is having anxious moments as many of their relatives are in Afghanistan. “My three brothers-in-law, Sukhbir Singh, Kaun Singh and Baghi Singh, two uncles-in-law, cousin and her children are in the Kabul gurdwara. Three of our relatives, including my nephew, had returned, but others are stuck there. Though they are not in danger, we are worried for them. My wife Jyoti is anxious as her three brothers are there.

While, for the seventh consecutive day on Monday, the daily case count in Mumbai was over 300. The state reported 3,741 cases, against the over 4,500 cases being recorded for the last few days, and 52 deaths, the lowest since June 5 (51). With this, the state’s total caseload rose to 64.6 lakh and fatalities touched nearly 1.4 lakh. Mumbai added 333 cases taking the total tally to 7.4 lakh. Two deaths were registered, taking the total toll to 15,976. While the number of tests done in Mumbai were only 33,391 (lower than the daily average of 35,000) due to the weekend effect, the daily test average was below 1%. The only worrisome indicators in the city’s Covid graph were the slight increase in the weekly overall growth rate of Covid cases — from 0.04% to 0.05% — and a sharp drop in the doubling rate from nearly 2,000 days until last week to 1,577 days on Monday. As the number of sealed buildings in the city rose again, the BMC top brass held a review meeting on Monday. It was decided that sealing of buildings with over five or more positive cases should be strictly done and ward officials must ensure the presence of police personnel outside sealed buildings. “We have also instructed our staff to ensure that testing is carried out in a phased manner among people living in sealed buildings,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the state government is keeping a close watch on the surge in numbers during the festive season and guidelines have been issued for citizens to follow during celebrations. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-sees-dip-in-cases-city-count-still-over-300/articleshow/85781902.cms||---

An eatery in Kondhwa, which opened for home deliveries after curbs were eased, started dine-ins last week but with just two tables. The restaurant manager said though there is space for at least 10 tables, there is the issue of staff crunch. “At least 40% of our staff is not returning. We are continuing with takeaways and set up tables only if customers wish to eat at the restaurant,” said the manager. Another eatery, famous for its kebabs and grilled food, has started limited dine-ins. “Many people are not dining in, except on weekends. The shortage of staff persists too. We have slowly started with dine-in rather going in all guns blazing as we cannot handle more losses,” the owner said. Nearly 2,000 of the total 8,000 restaurants in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad are yet to open up or have closed down permanently, said those in the restaurant industry. With restrictions such as 50% capacity and closing time of 10pm, senior officials of Pune Restaurants and Hotels Association (PRAHA) said that 15% of the remaining 6,000 restaurants, that is 900 eateries were yet to start dine-in facilities. “The state government should further extend the timings of restaurants and allow operations at 100% capacity,” said PRAHA president Ganesh Shetty. “Business is not improving and given the curbs as well as the heavy losses suffered since March 2020, many restaurants have not been able to start dine-ins and are operating with takeaways,” he said. “With talk of a third wave, the apprehension is increasing,” said Shetty. A sizzler restaurant in Koregaon Park reopened after the second wave. “We cannot afford the rent. There is no point doing business like this. I am neck deep in debt,” the owner said. Shetty said that restaurants need more government help. “The government should grant an exemption from paying property tax for the duration that outlets were closed. If another wave hits and things close again, another 2,000-3,000 restaurants will shut down permanently,” he said. The owner of café in Camp said he had been thinking about starting dine-in for a month but in vain. “It will mean hiring new staff as my previous employees never returned despite repeated requests. What if I hire again and things close?” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/restaurants-struggle-to-stay-afloat-amid-capacity-curbs-staff-crunch/articleshow/85779756.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Kozhikode||Efforts on to help NIT alumnus stranded in Af||Kozhikode: Former students of National Institute of Technology, Calicut (NITC), have launched a campaign to help their fellow alumnus Abdul Ghafor Saifi, 28, from Afghanistan who had spent five days with his wife and three-month-old daughter before the Kabul airport in their bid to leave the country. With the help of his college mates, Saifi, who belongs to the 2019 Civil Engineering batch of graduates of NITC, has submitted an emergency e-visa to travel to India and is waiting for a response from the ministry of external affairs. The efforts by the NITC alumni are spearheaded by Youth for Afghan, an online platform started by Saifi’s close friend and fellow NITian Harshad Bhardwaj and his brother Uday Bhardwaj hailing from Rajastan to help Afghans stuck in their homeland and also those who have fled to other countries. NITian Kanwaljeet Singh is also in the forefront of YFA’s efforts as team lead. “Saifi had been waiting for five days with his family and kid at the airport. He was within 1km distance when the suicide bombing happened at the Kabul airport on August 26. After spending five days before the airport, now they have returned to their house in Kabul tired and exhausted,” Harshad said. He said that as civilian evacuations are now suspended, they are waiting for the situation to improve and also trying to reach out to officials of the ministry of external affairs to give priority to the family to fly out. “We are also reaching out to NITians to see if we could help him fly to any of the countries in the Middle East or any other country,” Harshad, who is a data scientist with a startup firm in Bengaluru. Adding to their concerns is the fact that Saifi is from the Hazara community, a minority group in Afghanistan, who have long faced persecution from the Taliban. Harshad said that Saifi was set to come to India a few months ago to participate in the Kanthari Leadership programme, but as the Covid cases escalated, he could not get a visa. “He had been working in Kateb University but is currently unemployed. Now, he is living on his last pennies and our attempts to send across money to him has also been affected by the suspension of international money transfers,” he added. “He was a year senior to me at NITC, but we were close friends and also gymmates. He was the most humble person I have ever seen. He was the best body builder on the campus and he was the runner-up in the all India inter-NIT competition,” Harshad said. He said that Saifi also wanted them to take up the case of his niece, a Class VIII student of the Sayed Ul Shuhada High School in Kabul where nearly 85 people, mostly girl students, were killed in a bombing in May 8, to fly out of the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/efforts-on-to-help-nit-alumnus-stranded-in-af/articleshow/85779826.cms||---

The turnout of the 18-44 years category on Monday was the highest single-day turnout since the vaccination drive began. Overall, 3,400 beneficiaries got their jabs in Kolhapur city on Monday. The KMC has, so far, achieved 100% first-dose vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers. Around 82% of citizens above the age of 60 years, and 56% in the 45-59 years age group have also received their first doses. Amol Mane, the nodal vaccination officer of the civic body, said: “We have received good response from the younger population. We have arranged for sessions at every centre where 200 to 300 younger citizens are being vaccinated every day. This has become possible due to the regular supply of vaccines. On Monday, we got 13,000 doses.” The KMC is finding ways to get more of the younger population to turn up for the vaccination. For instance, on the insistence of city MLA Chandrakant Jadhav, the KMC is going to vaccinate 1,750 players of 16 football teams in Kolhapur city by registering them on the spot. Moreover, the KMC has decided to carry out door-to-door survey to find eligible beneficiaries above the age of 45 years who have not got their first vaccine dose yet. “In a week or two, we will complete 100% first dose vaccination of the above-45 population in the city. We will arrange for more special sessions in the eight wards for completing vaccination of those above 45 years,” said Mane.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/kolhapur-city-highest-turnout-of-18-44-beneficiaries/articleshow/85777209.cms||---

The plant was constructed in a year’s time near platform 4 where the water will be treated and be re-used for all non-drinking purposes on the station saving more than 1 lakh litre of water per day. According to Subhashchandra Sharma, senior section engineer of Nashik Road railway station, the construction of the plant is complete and would be commissioned in a few days after work on some small connections are completed. “The Rs 1.6 crore STP constructed at the A1 class station is ready to save water and help in environment conservation. The construction of the plant is based on phytorid waste water treatment that only uses gravity for movement of water and there will be no chemical or even power consumption for the project,” the officer said. The current consumption of water at the station is about 1.5 lakh liter per day, including drinking and non-drinking purposes. The plant constructed at a cost of Rs 1.6 crore has been constructed keeping in view the future needs of the railway station that is expanding. The waste water is collected in one of the chambers that is then processed as part of the treatment that uses specific plants that can absorb nutrients directly from water.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/stp-at-nashik-road-railway-station-nears-completion/articleshow/85777238.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||I don’t want to become Fr Stan Swamy, Sachin Waze tells court||MUMBAI: A special court on Monday rejected the National Investigation Agency (NIA) plea seeking custody of dismissed cops Sachin Waze (52) and Sunil Mane (49) in the case involving a bomb scare near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence in February. The NIA made the plea days before the chargesheet is to be submitted in the case which also involves the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran as part of the larger conspiracy. Special judge Prashant R Sitre also granted Waze permission to seek medical treatment in a private hospital for his heart condition. His lawyer told the court that had to undergo bypass surgery urgently or he could die. Waze, who was produced in court and appeared feeble, told the judge, “I don’t want to become another Stan Swamy.” Fr Swamy (84), who was lodg-ed at Taloja jail since his arrest on October 8 in the Elgar Parishad case died in a hospital while in custody last month. The NIA opposed Waze’s plea. It sought two days’ custody of Waze and five days’ custody of Mane. Earlier this month, the NIA was granted a 30- day extension to submit the chargesheet. The period ends this week. Opposing NIA’s plea, Waze’s lawyers Sudeep Pasbola, Sajal Yadav and Rounak Naik questioned why the prosecution had moved the plea at such a belated stage and that too soon after Waze had sought private medical treatment. Pasbola submitted that Waze’s condition had deteriorated last month with three 90% blockages, and on Sunday, JJ Hospital doctors had advised his immediate admission. Waze had, however, refused to be treated at the government hospital. He said that Waze was not even given a wheelchair to come to court. Opposing the custody plea, Mane’s advocate Vaibhav Bag-ade said the NIA was acting in the “most pathetic way”. “The agency is acting in an irresp-onsible and callous manner… Confrontation is not an investigation and whatever is said by the accused in custody is inadmissible evidence,” he said. Mane too addressed the special court and said that during his last custody, the NIA had only taken his DNA test and there was no mention of it thereafter. Allowing Waze’s plea for private hospital, the court said, “Taloja jail superintendent is directed to take the accused to SS Hospital & Research Center…Bhiwandi for medical treatment. In case he is admitted, the superintendent…will file a report regarding the same to this court. Every 15 days, the superintendent is directed to submit the medical certificate of the accused and to file a report...” The court also allowed Waze’s plea for home food for the next two months as per doctor’s advice.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-court-rejects-nia-custody-plea-for-waze-allows-pvt-hosp-admission/articleshow/85781987.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Its officers and soldiers trained in India, now in the firing range as the Taliban take over, told that it is the distrust of army personnel and their association with India that has put them at extreme risk. They have petitioned India for help. "It's our big hope," one of them said from Kabul on Monday. "When the Taliban attacked, they had our (army's) biometric pads. They were forcing people to put their fingers on the pad and all information would come up instantly. It was scary," said Lieutenant Amir (name changed), 26, who graduated from the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun in 2018. "News came in, meanwhile, that four Afghan army personnel had been killed at Karte Naw (in Kabul) ... Our address, too, was registered with the government and the army. So, we left. We have been in hiding for over a week." 'Pak soldiers won't spare me if they know I'm from IMA'Many like Amir are walled in from all sides - the Taliban is wary of army personnel and the Pakistan operatives of those with India links. "When the Taliban entered Kabul, we got orders that no one should fight them... The Taliban searched military officers' houses and seized their weapons and vehicles. They killed randomly. I tried to get to the airport one day but they beat me up and kicked me, along with others. I went back to hiding at home," a second Afghan army officer, who graduated from IMA the same year, told TOI. Another Afghan officer texted this correspondent saying: "I used to track military convoys before Taliban captured Afghanistan. When I see Pakistani malisha (militia) and fuagi (soldiers), I know they will not spare me if they know I graduated from IMA (sic)." A fourth, also an IMA alumnus, said, "Soldiers who got training in India are at risk because the Pakistan army has issues with us." Help is yet to come though. A lieutenant who was in the IMA 2018 batch said his wife worked with the Indian embassy in Kabul for more than five years. He said they sought help from the Indian foreign ministry and Indian Army. "We haven't got a response. Families of our liaison officers in all Indian academies are stuck in Kabul. So they can't come to our aid right now. I request the Indian government to help us," he said. "I keep changing my location every day," said his batchmate. "I know so many people (soldiers) who were trained in the US, Australia and Germany. The countries helped the officers leave Afghanistan. We have more trust in India than anyone else," an officer said. Defence expert Maroof Raza said Afghan officers who graduated from India "must have patience". "The Indian government is yet to clarify its stand on Taliban."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/afghan-army-officers-trained-at-ima-say-theyre-on-pak-taliban-radar/articleshow/85774764.cms||Ishita Mishra

The frequency of the buses would be every 30 minutes. NMPML is starting the new bus service from Central Bus Stand (CBS) in Nashik city to Mohadi, via Nashik airport. The directorial board of the NMPML gave its approval to start bus service via Nashik airport during the board meeting. This is for the first time that public transport would be available for air passengers reaching Nashik airport. Till now, air travellers relied on private cabs or own vehicles for travel to and from the airport. The frequent travellers from Nashik city have welcomed the move of the public transport utility to start the bus service. Manish Rawal, chairperson of the aviation committee of Ambad Industries & Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA), said that this is a positive development. “There are many flyers who use the private cab either to reach the airport or coming to city from the airport. It has some limitations and the charges are high. Hence, we had demanded bus connectivity to the airport,” said Rawal. The footfall of flyers at Nashik airport, which had been badly affected due to Covid pandemic, has now increased in July and August. At present, daily footfall of flyers at Nashik airport is around 4,500. Presently, NMPML is operating 51 buses on13 different routes in the city. Apart from Mohadi, NMPML has plans to introduce buses on six more routes from the first week of September. These six new routes are -Tapovan to Bhagur via Shalimar and Dwarka, CBS-Saikheda, Tapovan to Satpur via Civil hospital, Nashik Road to Uttam Nagar, Nashik Road to Hanumanwadi and Gangapur to Adgaon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/buses-to-nashik-airport-every-half-hr/articleshow/85777304.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Action plan ready to improve ease of doing biz||Thiruvananthapuram: Government has formulated an action plan to simplify procedures for providing over a dozen consumer services as part of improving the ease of doing business (EoDB) in power sector. The simplified procedures will benefit consumers from domestic category to industrial and commercial ones. As part of the change, KSEB will no longer press for ownership certificates from LSGI/Revenue offices to establish the possession of the residential apartment/building of customers who apply for a new connection or change of consumer name. Alternatively, KSEB will now accept sale deeds of building/apartment or any other alternative proof of identity for availing the service. This change would be helpful for those living in apartments. According to the changes being implemented, service connection for industrial/HT/EHT consumers would be given based on an ‘undertaking’ filed along with the application. This is in lieu of the service connection agreement. The changes mooted in Section five of the Kerala Lifts and Escalation Rules 2013 would lessen the burden of apartment associations and commercial building owners regarding renewal licence for lifts. The validity will now be three years, instead of the current period of a year. Also, renewal of D certificate of cinema theatre would also have three- year validity, instead of the current one. The changes in the pipeline would remove the provision that insists on one cinema operator for every screen. Multiplex theatres would need to engage only one operator for two screens. Periodicity of renewal of cinema operators’ licence would also be increased from three years to five. The new changes would exempt prior approval/sanction for the installation and testing of generating units up to 30 kVA, in place of the current 10 kVA. Periodical inspection of electrical installations with voltage level between 250V and 650V would be modified from two to three years. The changes are being made by reducing the regulatory complications by amending rules and regulations. The government has given an in-principle clearance to respective agencies, including KSEB, chief electrical inspectorate, Anert and KSERC for carrying out the change.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/action-plan-ready-to-improve-ease-of-doing-biz/articleshow/85779953.cms||B S Anilkumar

In the video circulated on WhatsApp and some other platforms, he claimed that the charges against him are “false and baseless”.

Reason: A rumour in the area that ration would be reduced for individuals who have not received the vaccine. As a result, the centre — which normally sees around 100 to 150 visitors a day — is now seeing an unprecedented rush. The primary health centre (PHC) can deliver around 200 vaccinations per day. On Monday, local authorities had to enlist assistance of police to maintain order at the centre as many started jostling for places to get vaccinated first. “We have the capacity to inoculate everyone but there are health camps in the surrounding areas and treatment facilities for communicable diseases. So, we are limiting the number to 250,” said deputy medical and health officer, Dr Vidya. Authorities were concerned that the absence of social distancing could lead to infections. “They were concerned about rations but not about masks,” said one official. A few days back, officials had to take extra doses of the vaccine from neighbouring centres to administer jabs. Most people turning up at the centre are said to be between ages of 40 and 50. “We don’t know what the rules say but we were told by neighbours that ration rice would not be handed to us, so we rushed to the centre,” a local said. Despite assurances from officials that ration will not be decrease and that the collector would ensure ration is distributed to everyone, the rush at the centre continued. Officials are now hoping that as a result of this rush, vaccination in the mandal will be completed soon. Currently, vaccination is only 50 per cent complete.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/beeline-at-vax-centre-following-rumour-over-ration-supply/articleshow/85780042.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Decision to reopen schools taken considering parents demands, says education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy||HYDERABAD: Foolproof measures have been taken in coordination with medical & health, municipal administration, panchayat raj and education departments, Telangana education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy tells ahead of schools reopening on September 1. Excerpts: The government is reopening schools amid fears over possibility of a third wave, rise in Covid-19 cases in some districts. What precautions has the government taken?The government has taken every precaution to prevent Covid-19 cases in schools. All schools have been asked to sanitise classes, premises and even buses. All teachers and non-teaching staff have been vaccinated. Masks have been made compulsory. In villages, gram panchayats have been directed to distribute three masks to each student. Even district collectors have been asked to closely monitor the situation every day There are reports that many parents are hesitating to send their children to schools. What is your feedback on this?CM K Chandrasekhar Rao has decided to reopen schools only after considering demands of parents and keeping in mind the psychological conditions of students. Many parents have complained that they are compelled to sit with their children during online classes and many students are not able to understand lessons during online classes. In villages, poor and daily labourers cannot sit with their children as they go to work. Also, many students do not have access to cellphones and other electronic gadgets. Telangana is the 25th state in the country to conduct physical classes If any student contracts coronavirus, what will the government or school education department do? What is the government’s responsibility?Earlier, when a student was infected with Covid-19, we used to isolate him or her in a room in the hostels or day school. Now, we have decided to hand them over to parents and admit them to a nearby government hospital or PHC. All students, who are contacts of a Covid-19 positive student, will be tested. The decision has been taken as other students in hostels are prone to infection as they use a common toilet There is a spurt in viral fevers and dengue in the state. How are we going to deal with these cases in schools?Asha workers and ANMs are visiting schools regularly and monitoring the situation. Headmasters have been asked not to neglect even normal viral fevers. Students will be tested and sent to their homes or hospitals, if required, for treatment What about schools waiting for complete guidelines on opening of schools?During video conferences with collectors and other departments, we informed all Covid-19 protocols and earlier guidelines sho-uld be followed. There is no need for any fresh guidelines now. After opening schools, if we find any gaps, we will issue instructions accordingly||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/decision-to-reopen-taken-considering-parents-demands/articleshow/85780208.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Hyderabad||Schools in Telangana districts prepare for reopening||HYDERABAD: With educational institutions set to open for in-person learning after 16 months due to the Covid-19 situation, students’ health will be monitored. School staff have been advised to get a Covid-19 test done if any student shows symptoms of coronavirus infection. If a student tests positive, other students in the class too will be tested. From September 1 when schools reopen, students will have to follow social distancing norms in classrooms in the seating arrangements, education department official said. They will also have to wear masks. Gram panchayats have been given the responsibility of cleaning the schools. However, in some districts, sarpanches have said while it would be done for the next one month, government schools would have to make own arrangements for maintaining cleanliness. They said as gram panchayats did not have staff, the additional responsibility would not be possible to carry out. In Nagarkurnool, staff at the Government High School in the district headquarters represented to the district education officer (DEO) to remove the Covid centre at the school since the educational institutions were reopening. DEO Govindarjulu also encouraged people who had discontinued studies to enrol themselves to pursue their studies through the Telangana Open School. Those who discontinued class 10 can opt for the Open School and also pursue Intermediate as there was a facility to opt for any group. The applications could be made by September 10. Mahbubnagar collector S Venkat Rao on Monday directed officials to ensure that there would be no water logging on the premises of schools. While schools should be clean by the time they open, he also said that for an entire month, thorough cleaning should be taken up, if necessary, encouraging donors to facilitate cleaning. If students show any symptoms of Covid-19, they would have to be taken to the local primary health centre for treatment, health offcials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/schools-in-districts-prep-for-reopening/articleshow/85779983.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Hyderabad||Govt schools in mandals to be monitored by panel||Hyderabad: The school education department has constituted committees at the mandal level to monitor government schools. These committees include three teachers and school headmasters to monitor sanitisation, water, electricity and other resources. Officials said that the guidelines issued in January this year have to be largely followed by all the schools and no new guidelines will be issued. According to officials, of the 3,000 schools in Hyderabad, more than 1,300 government schools have been sanitised with the help of GHMC. “A check list has been issued to all the officials on the ground on cleanliness of classrooms, water facilities, electricity etc. They have to track all this and submit a report on a daily basis. Sanitisation of most schools has been completed and we are regularly monitoring the situation on ground,” said R Rohini, district education officer, Hyderabad. On August 24, the government released a memo announcing reopening of all educational institutions. In another circular, it released a list of basic Covid-19 protocols all institutions have to follow including sanitisation and safety of symptomatic students. No other protocols specific to resumption of schools have been released yet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/govt-schools-in-mandals-to-be-monitored-by-panel/articleshow/85779909.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Back to school? Many parents in Telangana still unsure||HYDERABAD: With schools set to reopen on September 1, many parents are still unsure about sending their wards back to school. However, fear of further loss in academics and changes in social behaviour are likely to see a higher number of parents take the risk this time, as compared to January when the government had opened schools for a brief period. In fact, when TOI ran a poll earlier this year, an overwhelming 90% parents voted against physical classes. Only 10% said that they were willing to make the shift. In comparison, on Monday, even as 70% parents voted for continuation of online classes, 30% said that they were ready to send their children to school, for various reasons. “My daughter is an introvert. She used to speak only to limited set of people in earlier classes. She improved quite a bit in class 6-7 . But from class 8 she has been attending online classes due to which it has been difficult for her to gain all social knowledge. I believe she needs more exposure and, therefore, I am ready to send her back to school,” said Sai Prabhakar. In most cases, it is the parents of students in higher classes who are willing to go with the government’s move. While concerns over the kids taking ill — Covid-19, dengue, malaria — continue to haunt them, they fear the children might fall behind if they continue to study from home. “Not just Covid-19, this is also the season for other diseases. While that is a worry, my son is in class 11 and he feels he will miss out on academics if he does not attend physical classes. So, I think he will start going to school once it reopens,” said Anu M. She has, however, decided not to send her daughter — in class 8 — to school just yet. On their part, school managements say they are expecting the numbers to increase subsequently as many parents will take a call depending on how things unfold post September 1. “Almost 50% parents are willing to send their children back to school as they didn’t find online education effective. Many have told us that they will wait and watch before they make a decision. We are hoping that by mid-September the percentage of parents sending their children back to school will increase,” said Sadula Madhusudan, general secretary, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/back-to-school-many-parents-still-unsure/articleshow/85779864.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra bars human pyramids, police act against MNS, BJP||MUMBAI/THANE: In the run-up to next year’s civic election, the spectator sport of dahi handi acquired high political stakes ahead of Gokulashtami on Tuesday. The Shiv Sena-led state government prohibited mass celebration of dahi handi amid the pandemic but MNS and BJP vowed to defy orders and proceed with the human pyramids. The state instructed police, BMC and health officials to enforce the ban. It barred the human pyramids, and instead asked people to hold blood donation or health camps and observe the festival privately. “The second wave may have receded but the threat remains. Health experts have expressed concern about a third wave. The Centre has also advised caution. In view of this, dahi handi should be celebrated in a simple manner. Instead of gathering in public, people should watch the festival (worship) online or on cable networks,” said the guidelines (see box). Thane witnessed high drama on Monday as the police arrested 18 MNS activists, including district president Avinash Jadhav, for setting up a pandal and violating the dahi handi curbs. The police dismantled the stage erected by party functionaries, prompting a dharna at the Bhagwati ground. The party workers were released on bail after a case was registered. But the defiance persisted. “Come what may, we will go ahead with dahi handi as planned. The government should not use the shield of police,” said Jadhav. The Thane Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti extended support to the MNS dahi handi. Some govinda pathaks in Mumbai had been counting on the MNS event to express dissatisfaction with the ban. But police action came as a dampener. “We were planning to travel to Thane and form a small pyramid, just to show our dissent. But now we are not sure,” said a member of the high profile Jai Jawan mandal in Jogeshwari. Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik cancelled his dahi handi and will flag off two oxygen plants instead. The Mumbai police upped the ante, issuing notice to BJP leader Ram Kadam, who had tweeted he would bring a dahi handi to Ghatkopar police station on Tuesday morning with govinda groups. Similar notices were despatched to people who posted on social media about celebrations. “We warn that any violation of the state guidelines will invite action. We will register cases and detain violators,” said a senior officer from the eastern suburbs. The govindas are torn by rival political loyalties. The coach of the prize-winning mandal of Tadwadi, Mazgaon, is Arun Patil, who is also working president of the Dahi Handi Samanvay Samiti. “We will abide by the government rule. Our boys will simply crack a coconut in the local temple and may break a symbolic handi from ground level. No pyramids will be formed. In fact, govinda pathaks from Borivli, Vasai and Virar have been calling to ask if they should make plans to head out. I advised them to avoid violating the law. Don’t force the authorities to foist cases on you, I told them,” said Patil.

Mishra and her group, all residents of Vadodara, along with two local guides were stuck midway on their way to the Kulang fort in Igatpuri taluka of Nashik district after they lost their way. The fort is located at a height of 1,470 feet above sea level in the Kulang hill range in Nashik district and forms part of the Alang-Malang group of forts. With its caves, fresh water cisterns, the fort is a popular trekking destination but also a tough rocky climb through a dense forest area. “We were panicky and remained awake all night. We had planned to start scaling the fort at 10 am on Sunday, but got late. We started climbing at around 3 pm. We stayed together and waited for the rescue team to arrive,” Mishra said. Thankfully for them, the spot where they were stranded had mobile connectivity and they could call home in Vadodara and inform their families of their situation. There were eight men and five women in the group, majority of them in their 20s and 30s. All of them were first-time trekkers. Igatpuri tehsildar Parmeshwar Kasule told TOI, “The team had two local villagers as guides to lead them to the fort. They had planned to spend the night at the fort before returning on Monday morning. But, even the locals could not find the route to the fort. All 13 of them were stranded at a height of over 500 feet.” Fortunately, it did not rain in Igatpuri on Sunday night and the trekkers had food and water with them. “The authorities of the Vadodara administration informed about the issue to the senior authorities of the Nashik disaster management cell at 3am on Monday,” Kasule said. Arjun Kurhade, district disaster management officer, said a team of 15 local volunteers from Chandori village of Niphad taluka, was mobilised and started scaling the hill range from 5am. “Tracing the trekkers was a challenge because of the dense forest. After a gruelling three hours, the rescue team finally zeroed in the trekkers group at around 9am and guided them down at around 12.30 pm,” added Kurhade. Nashik rural superintendent of police Sachin Patil said that the local police took feedback from the plan of the trekkers. They left for Vadodara on Monday evening. “Trekkers should be extremely careful while climbing the hills as they don’t know the tough terrain,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/13-trekkers-spend-night-stuck-on-way-to-kulang-fort-rescued/articleshow/85777318.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Goa||Bhumi bill may be scrapped as BJP senses public anger ahead of polls||Panaji: The controversial Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill, 2021, may not see the light of the day, as the state government is likely to scrap it ahead of the crucial state assembly election scheduled early next year. BJP has told chief minister Pramod Sawant not to go ahead with the bill. The bill was passed in the monsoon session of the assembly, but was later kept in abeyance in view of widespread criticism against it. “I do not want to comment right now on the bill,” said Sawant, when asked if any decision has been taken. On Monday, TOI reported that RTI documents revealed that the bill was introduced and passed in the Goa assembly ignoring the red flags raised by revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate and bureaucrats. A senior BJP functionary said that during Sawant and state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade’s constituency visits, party workers raised apprehensions about the bill. Most of them were apprehensive that the bill could harm the party’s prospects in the elections. “The party has told the chief minister not to go ahead with the bill as it could backfire on the party in the assembly elections,” said another senior BJP functionary. He said that the party has felt the resentment among the people over the bill, and in a poll-bound state, “we can’t take a decision against the people’s voice”. He said that the resentment has been brewing because the bill would give rights to migrants to claim illegal houses built on private or government land. Around 200 suggestions have been received from the general public after the chief minister invited suggestions over the bill. Sawant had conceded to the demands of some people and decided to drop the word Bhumiputra from the bill. He had said that the bill would be reintroduced in the winter session, which may be the last session before the state goes to polls. The aggrieved persons included BJP’s ST morcha, who told Sawant their sentiments were hurt, prompting the CM to promise them to remove the word. The morcha’s national general secretary, Ramesh Tawadkar, had said that the word ‘bhumiputra’ in the name of the bill will “finish” the identity and originality of the ST community in the state, and demanded dropping it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/bhumi-bill-may-be-scrapped-as-bjp-senses-public-anger-ahead-of-polls/articleshow/85779995.cms||Murari Shetye

The case pertained to a person from South Goa who tested positive on July 19, and recovered after home isolation. His sample was among the 16 random samples that were sent for genome sequencing to a laboratory outside Goa, and results were received by the state on Monday. Other strains detected were those of delta and kappa, and seven showed delta sub-lineages. “The report received today (Monday) was of the sample taken on July 19. One person in the family had travelled to Maharashtra.  Besides him, two members of his family had tested positive during that period,” said state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar. All three were vaccinated with a single dose, none faced major issues and didn’t require to be hospitalised. When further contact tracing was done, three more in their family, but who lived elsewhere, had also tested positive. “They too recovered after home isolation. It could be said that five contacts had the delta-plus strain though genome sequencing of their samples was not done. We select random samples for genome sequencing,” Betodkar said. “Scientists have not said that delta and delta-plus are two very different strains,” said Betodkar. “If a completely different mutation emerged from delta, they would give it a different name. When a new sub-lineage of the delta was detected, it was named delta-plus. Nowhere in the country has a big outbreak been reported due to the delta-plus strain. When I last checked more than fifteen days ago, more than 15 states had delta-plus strains, and possibly now every state has it. We felt that the presence of delta plus was very much possible in Goa.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-had-delta-case-in-july-patient-cured/articleshow/85780021.cms||---

The arrested accused has been identified as Nayan Dhali. He was produced before the court on Monday and remanded in two-day police custody. Investigation officer and police sub-inspector Amar Nagre said this is the second offence registered against the accused for practicing medicine (and performing a surgery) without holding any degree or certificate from any of the recognized health universities. MIDC Cidco police, after registering an offence on August 19, had launched a manhunt for the quack, a self-proclaimed expert on piles treatment and operation. They nabbed him on Sunday from his hideout in the city. MIDC Cidco police station inspector Vithal Pote, citing the content of the complaint, said it has been almost six months since the piles surgery was performed and the patient is yet to completely recover. The complainant, a resident of the Cidco area, stated that despite the suspect not having the qualifications or skills to perform the procedure, he went ahead and performed the wrong surgery which led to health complications. He said Dhali gave him the wrong medicines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/aurangabad-quack-arrested-for-botched-up-piles-surgery/articleshow/85777338.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Her qualification round in the 10m Air Pistol Para Women event will start at 6am (India time). Another MP player (para canoe) Prachi Yadav who reached Tokyo has also started her practise there to acclimatise with the conditions. She will appear in her event on September 2. Daughter of a mechanic, Rubina had set a new world record in the 10m Air Pistol Para Women event at the Para World Cup shooting held in Lima, Peru in June, earlier this year, to secure her berth for Tokyo. Rubina said, “I am all prepared for the big show. I will put my best foot forward.” 21-year-old Rubina had also won the gold medal for the country by setting a junior world record in the 10m Air Pistol Women Team Event of the World Shooting Para Sports Championship held in Bangkok in the year 2017 and bronze medal in the World Shooting Para Sports World Cup held in Croatia in the year 2019. Congratulating Rubina, sports minister Yashodhara Raje Scindia said, “Our MP Shooting Academy has made its strong presence felt at the international level. Our shooters are not just winning the gold but also winning the Olympic quota and setting world records.” Gwalior’s Prachi will be the only entry from India in this para canoe category at the mega event. “This is a big experience for me. I have started my preparations here and I am confident of winning a medal here,” said Prachi. Her coach Mayank Thakur who is from Bhopal said that Prachi did not waste a single minute in starting her preparation after reaching Tokyo. “She is a hard worker.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In third list, humanities cut-offs barely dip in top colleges, BMS, BAF over 90%||MUMBAI: Cut-offs in humanities dropped only marginally in top-rung city colleges in the third merit list released on Monday, bringing little relief to aspirants. For self-financed courses such as BMS, BMM and BAF at these colleges, the cut-offs remained above 90% and, in some, even above 95%. Many of these colleges do not expect a fourth list in sought-after courses. In fact, students were disappointed as some of these courses did not even see a third list. At N M College, BCom (accounting and finance) or BAF saw a cut-off at 97.3% in the first list, but only dropped to 96.6% in the third one, making it difficult for students even with 95% to secure admission at the college. There was no third merit list at the college for BMS and plain BCom. Principal Parag Ajgaonkar, said students are preferring self-financed courses over BCom. While these self-financed courses are considered as employment-oriented, BCom’s syllabus has not been upgraded for some time,” he said. Ramnarain Ruia College did not have a third list for their B Sc (computer science) programme, but the ones for BA, BSc (biotechnology) and BMM, saw a marginal drop in the cut-offs. For BA, the cut-offs at the college remained above 94% even in the third list, leaving little scope for 90%-plus arts’ aspirants. “We may have a fourth list for some courses, if there is withdrawal of admissions,” said principal Anushree Lokur. The college plans to hold the orientation programme for the new session on September 1 and start classes in a day or two. HR And KC Colleges, which are now part of HSNC University are following a different admission schedule. Their second list was released on August 26 and the cut-offs at both the colleges dropped only marginally. St Xavier’s College did not have a third list for their BSc programme while the BA admissions closed after the first list. At Podar College, the cut-offs for BMS and BCom only dropped a little in the third list and stayed above 95% for commerce students. Cut-offs for Jai Hind and Mithibai Colleges were not out till late night. Science cut-offs dropped across colleges and many expect a further dip once NEET and JEE results are out. Courses such as biotechnology and computer science, though, have managed to attract high scorers. As arts’ seats are fewer in numbers after in-house admissions, several students are unable to get a college of choice. For commerce, though, despite more seats, many colleges have seen higher cut-offs even in the third list as there is more rush. Principals advise students to secure admissions wherever they get a seat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-in-third-list-humanities-cut-offs-barely-dip-in-top-colleges-bms-baf-over-90/articleshow/85782144.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Goa||Fully-vaxxed visitors don’t need Covid negative certificate to enter Goa: HC||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday permitted the state government to allow the entry of fully-vaccinated persons in Goa without a Covid-19 negative test report. Partially vaccinated and non-vaccinated persons will still have to produce a negative Covid test report for entry. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that active cases as on August 29 were 945, and that the positivity rate was 1.3%. He submitted that the expert committee unanimously agreed and decided that all fully-vaccinated persons who have completed two weeks after their second dose should be allowed into Goa without a Covid-negative test report. The high court turned down a suggestion to wait until after the approaching festive season. When concerns were raised about the Delta-plus variant, the bench pointed out that it is a “high-powered expert committee” that has taken the decision. Pangam also placed before the court the meaning of “liberal tourism”, which the expert committee, headed by GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar, decided against permitting under the present circumstances. “Liberal tourism entails group activities which are crowd gathering and compromises on Covid-19 appropriate behaviour like wearing of masks, social distancing and hand sanitisation,” he submitted to the high court. Conversely, he said that non-liberal tourism entails prohibitions on group activities that compromise Covid norms. When asked for examples, Pangam said that music shows and other activities directly related to tourism could fall under the definition of liberal tourism. The expert committee has also unanimously agreed and decided to explore the possibility of issuing a universal pass which is linked to the Co-Win portal as adopted and issued by the government of Maharashtra. The high court, taking cognisance of PIls at the peak of the second wave, had on May 6 directed that only those possessing Covid-19 negative certificates be permitted into Goa from May 10. At the time, the high court had said the state government ought to have imposed these minimum restrictions in public interest on its own, considering the virulent nature of the new strain and how it is spreading and considering the positivity rate was as high as 52%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/fully-vaxxed-visitors-dont-need-covid-ve-cert-to-enter-goa-hc/articleshow/85780069.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Mumbai||BJP holds protests across Maharashtra to demand temple re-opening||MUMBAI: State BJP president Chandrakant Patil on Monday led a statewide protest, Shankhnaad Andolan, to demand the opening of temples in Maharashtra by conducting a puja outside the Manacha Kasba Ganpati in Pune. In Mumbai, a delegation of about 30 party workers, including MLA Gopal Shetty, was detained by Kandivli police as they gathered to protest. The police served them with notices under the Maharashtra Police Act and released them in a couple of hours. MLA Ram Kadam was detained outside his Khar house, along with BJP workers, when police learnt that they were headed to Siddhivinayak temple. The police explained why religious places were being kept shut during the pandemic and released them in a few hours. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis has been demanding re-opening of temples as these also support livelihoods like those of the flower sellers, kumkum sellers, priests, etc. Earlier, the party had held agitations for allowing regular commuters to travel by suburban trains. The party’s stand appears inconsistent, as it is protesting in Delhi after the AAP government announced the re-opening of schools from September 1.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-holds-protests-across-state-to-demand-temple-re-opening/articleshow/85782207.cms||---

For the last two days, traffic jams resulted on various roads, due to this pending work; the erring company has now been given 15 days to complete the work in various locations of the state capital. While inspecting the works related to water supply, BMC commissioner KVS Chaudary directed the company to complete the remaining work of laying pipelines, restoration and connectivity at the earliest. According to reports, Chaudary expressed strong displeasure over the delay in gravity and feeder main pipe lines being laid in the city for water supply and imposed a penalty of Rs 10 lakh on the private agency. Instructions have been given to complete the pending work on main roads within a fortnight and a penalty of Rs 10 lakh has been imposed by the corporation administration, said BMC additional commissioner, Shahvat Meena. The agency was earlier given a deadline to complete the work by August 30, which lapsed; after relaying of roads, alignment and other jobs are expected to take more time. BMC commissioner, additional commissioner, chief engineer AR Pawar and other officers and representatives of construction agency were present during the inspection. Choudary also inspected the pipeline laid on the drain in the same area and instructed to expedite the work of laying the wall and slab of the drains.

---||Kolkata||Rijuda’s creator, singer, painter, CA passes away in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Very few people lived and savoured life the way Buddhadeb Guha did. Author, singer, painter and CA were just four of his many sides, the larger image being that of a king-sized man. On his final journey on Monday, many described him as the king from his famous story for teenagers, ‘Baja Tora Raja Jae’. Guha, who was 85, died of post-Covid complications at a hospital late on Sunday. After a brief recovery from Covid, he was at home but started complaining of breathlessness and kidney disorder, which took him back to the hospital, where he passed away. “But not before he had said his goodbyes,” said Bamacharan Mukhopadhyay, his friend for over 30 years who edited several books on Guha. He and dermatologist Kaushik Lahiri were Guha’s constant companions. Be it at McCluskieganj, Palamau, the Sunderbans or the jungles of north Bengal, vignettes of which are found in Guha’s stories for children and adults alike, Mukhopadhyay and Lahiri trailed him like shadow. “The last few years when poor health and eyesight had confined him indoors and he could not write, Dada dictated his stories,” Lahiri said. The creator of the very popular ‘Rijuda’ and ‘Ribhu’ was as deft with a paint brush as his pen. “Sometimes I lose track of my words and see them turn into pictures and then, the pen automatically turns into a brush,” Guha had once said at his Ballygunge home, while accepting an invitation to Times Lit Fest.  Guha was trained in Rabindrasangeet at Dakshini, where he met his wife, Ritu Guha, a Tagore music expert, who predeceased him. He also trained in classical music and old Kolkata toppa music under Ramkumar Chattopadhyay and Chandidas Mal. “Music was as close to his heart as writing and he was ready to sing, with or without asking. Once when we were at a Jalpaiguri tea garden, he went missing. After almost an hour of search, found him in the coolie line, singing the toppa, ‘Kichhui to holo na’, to garden labourers. They did not understand a word but sat in front of the regal entertainer,” recounted author Samaresh Majumdar. Similar stories were shared by writer Amar Mitra, who was also close to Guha. Friends for 60 years, author Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay found Guha the most handsome man when they were both 25. “He was lean, tall, handsome and always nattily dressed, to suit his background of opulence. I used to say you are miles ahead of us,” he laughed, a tear escaping him. “Till he was absolutely confined to home, he would come home every winter, asking my wife to make pithe for him. She, too, passed away yesterday,” he said. Guha has entrusted Lahiri with a large collection of his letters and paintings and an anthology is being prepared. “He supervised a large part of it and told me how he wanted the book to be. I will try my best to stick to the instructions. Now that he is physically not here, the instructions and suggestions he would continuously give me will ring louder,” Lahiri said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: “Shri Buddhadeb Guha’s writings were multifaceted and displayed great sensitivity to the environment. His works were enjoyed across generations, particularly among youngsters. His passing away is a big loss to the literary world.” Chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted: “Deeply pained at the demise of Buddhadeb Guha, one of the most celebrated authors of Bengal. He leaves behind a huge void in Bengali literature.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rijudas-creator-singer-painter-ca-passes-away/articleshow/85780152.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Goa||Goa: Congress retains Girish Chodankar as president, Aleixo Sequeira working president, others get plum posts||PANAJI: Putting an end to the year-long speculation and uncertainty over the state Congress head, Congress on Monday retained Girish Chodankar as its state president. The party has also accommodated senior party functionaries who were angling for the president’s post by assigning them key responsibilities.  Probably for the first time in Goa, the state Congress will have a working president. All-India Congress committee interim president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi cleared the appointment of former power minister Aleixo Sequeira to occupy the post. Former CM and Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro has been put in charge of the 2022 state election co-ordination committee. Political observers say that the new appointments create a balance between youth and senior members. Besides, representation has been given to women and various other factors have been considered, as the Congress central leadership is making a determined bid to win the 2022 polls. The changes come after senior AICC election observer P Chidambaram held a two-day meeting with party functionaries and block workers. Chidamabram is expected to return to Goa on September 3 for another round of deliberations with party functionaries  “Congress president has approved the proposal for the continuance of Girish Chodankar as the president of Goa pradesh Congress committee and Digambar Kamat as the Congress legislature party leader,” said AICC general secretary K C Venugopal in an official communique. Curtorim MLA Reginaldo Lourenco has been appointed as chairperson of the campaign committee for the state, while Sangeetha Parab has been made its co-chairperson. South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha, who is a bitter critic of Chodankar, has been made chairperson of the finance committee, and Pramoda Salgaocar its co-chairperson. Ramakant Khalap and Elvis Gomes have been made chairperson and co-chairperson of the manifesto committee, while Chandrakant Chodankar and Martha Saldanha have been appointed chairperson and co-chairperson of its publicity committee, it said. Reacting to the development, Chodankar said he hoped that uncertainty and speculation surrounding the state party president’s post would be laid to rest. “In the past six-seven months, this question of leadership kept surfacing, and the entire cadre was left in confusion. Let us all, office bearers and functionaries, (and) party workers put aside our differences and work together to win the elections and form the government. Our differences should not come between us when we take on BJP,” said Chodankar. “I thank Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for appointing Aleixo Sequeira as working president and senior leaders as chairpersons of various committees. Congratulations to all and I’m sure the new team will lead Congress to victory in the elections,” said Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao. With Chodankar’s position at the helm strengthened, the anti-alliance stance within the Congress is expected to harden. Goa goes to polls early next year to elect its 40-member assembly, and Congress plans to dislodge BJP, which has had two continuous terms. “My role here is to cooperate with him and work as one team. Our goal is to ensure that in 2022, we bring a Congress government to govern the state of Goa. We have got senior leaders in our midst who have vast experience,” said Sequeira.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cong-retains-girish-as-prez-aleixo-working-prez-others-get-plum-posts/articleshow/85780119.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Mumbai||BMC to appoint fire & life safety auditors for low-rise buildings||MUMBAI: To fast-track construction approvals and ensure transparency, the BMC will soon empanel fire and life safety auditors to carry out fire safety audits in residential buildings that are up to 32m in height or less than 10 storeys. “As part of its ease-of-doing business initiative, the BMC has decided to accord fire and life safety no-objection certificates to residential buildings having height up to 32m through fire and life safety auditors to speed up building construction approvals in a more transparent manner,” said a senior civic official. The BMC has invited applications seeking qualified personnel for the audit job. TimesViewIt’s good that BMC is appointing auditors to carry out fire safety audits. This will ensure faster clearances. But in the past, there have been several occasions where third-party fire compliance agencies have failed to carry out checks and maintain fire-fighting equipment. The BMC must supervise work of auditors and take penal action if needed.“At the time of construction, the auditor, along with the fire safety consultant and architect, will ensure compliance of the provisions of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention & Life Safety Measures Act, 2006, and other building bye-laws,” an official said. “The auditor will issue a fire safety compliance certificate in a prescribed format along with a schematic draw-ing showing various safety measures provided as per the codified fire safety requirements.” The auditor will also test all active measures related to fire and life safety provided in the building and upload photographs or videos of the inspection and testing of fire-fighting installations and equipment with the date and time stamp, along with the compliance certificate, through the architect. Under the Act, it is the resp-onsibility of the property owner or the cooperative housing society to follow fire safety nor-ms and submit an audit report, signed by a licensed fire expert, every six months certifying co-mpliance to the chief fire offic-er. If there is no owner or society, the occupants will have to do it. In recent fires, the fire brigade found that most had failed to submit the audit report or maintain fire safety equipment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-appoint-fire-life-safety-auditors-for-low-rise-bldgs/articleshow/85782262.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

There were several cultural events organised at International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) temple, Patel Nagar, and other temples where Laddu Gopal’s arrival gave people a reason to forget Covid blues. ISKCON curated some signature events for Janmashtami Mahotsav. The day started with a mangal arti at 5am, followed by shringar darshan and Krishna katha. Evening saw another round of kirtans, along with aartis and Krishna katha.  “A major attraction was a dance drama titled ‘Shreel Haridas Thakur’ presented by members, followed by maha abhishek,” said PRO of the temple, Shyam Sundar Das. He added, “Due to pandemic, we allowed 50 people inside the temple and 200 in the pandal outside at a time, Covid precautions were duly taken. Chhappan bhog was offered to the Lord and later packed prasad, including baghar, rajgire ki poori, several sweets made of milk, were distributed.” Communities also organised cultural events to mark the festival. Rajputana women’s cultural and welfare organisation organised matki phod and ras leela, wherein women dressed as Krishna and Gopikas presented a beautiful picture. Founder president of the organisation, Shiva Raje Sisodia, said, “These festivals strengthen the social bond; celebrating these occasions together motivates everyone to fight depression in Covid times. Matki and bansuri decorating competitions were a big hit and brought to fore the child within.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/festive-fervour-krishnas-arrival-celebrated-with-chhappan-bhog-colourful-events/articleshow/85780111.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
---||Chandigarh||Extend assembly session to scrap power purchase agreements: Navjot Singh Sidhu to Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Building pressure on the state government to scrap power purchase agreements (PPAs) to provide cheaper power to consumers in the state, Punjab Congress president Navjot Sidhu on Monday said the one-day special session of Punjab assembly should be extended to five-seven days to enable bringing a legislation to terminate the PPAs. He said just as the assembly had passed the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act in 2004 on river water sharing with Haryana, the assembly should pass the legislation on PPAs. In a video posted on his social media, Sidhu said, “As a result of cancellation of PPAs, the dream of providing power to domestic users at Rs 3 per unit and Rs 5 per unit to commercial connections will be realised. This is apart from the free 200 units to SC, BPL and freedom fighters. There is also a need for a grievances redressal system to take care of complaints of exorbitant outstanding power bills of poor households with two bulbs and one fan. All such bills should be waived to lighten their burden by keeping aside Rs 1,200 crore-Rs 1,500 crore.” Sidhu said the issue of faulty PPAs figured in the 18-point agenda of the high command and the five points raised by the coordination committee with the CM. The PPCC chief tweeted: “Punjab government must immediately issue directions to PSERC in public Interest to revise tariffs being paid to private power plants, making the faulty PPAs null and void, and call a 5- or 7-day vidhan sabha session to bring a new legislation for termination of faulty PPAs.” He said a single-day session was not sufficient to raise issues connected to people of the state and the session needed to be extended. “Just like the law for termination of water agreements was passed, a similar law should be brought in for termination of these PPAs, so people get power at cheap rates. Punjab is already a leading light in giving power subsidies,” he said. The Congress government has convened a day-long special session on September 3 to commemorate the 400th Parkash Purb of Guru Tegh Bahadur. At present, there is no other legislation listed for the session.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/extend-assembly-session-to-scrap-ppas-sidhu-to-capt/articleshow/85782239.cms||---
---||Kochi||Payments: Kerala firm opts for cryptocurrency||Kochi: Athey Nallatha, a Kerala startup that sells fusion pickles to the domestic as well as a global clientele, becomes the first company in Kerala which is ready to accept cryptocurrency for its payments. It is also the seventh firm in India to enter into cryptocurrency-based transactions, the startup claimed. On Aug 28, 2021, the startup opened its payment gateway by CoinBase to customers. Digital currencies accepted on this portal are Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, DAI, and USDC, though a transaction is yet to happen. When questioned why they included cryptocurrency as a mode of payment, apart from cards, UPI and Google Pay, while it is yet to gain popularity in the country, Akshay Raveendran, co-founder and director, Athey Nallatha said, “The promoters have been involved with cryptocurrency right from the inception itself – we used to keep track and invest in them. Also, if we implement blockchain technology on the operations side, it is going to save us a lot of money and customers are also going to benefit from this. There are major scaling plans but as a starting step, we have done this.” Interestingly, the startup doesn’t accept cash due to the pandemic. Founded in June 2020, during the pandemic, by two management graduates Hafez Rahman and Akshay Raveendran, Athey Nallatha also aims at providing employment opportunities to mothers. “We source vegetables and meat products from local farmers in and around Kochi. And during the initial days of the pandemic, we couldn’t group the people to work together at a single place to process these raw materials. Hence, we distributed the jobs between various groups of women. While one group took care of vegetable peeling, another took care of cleaning fish. Finally, we collected the products and brought them to a centralized kitchen where it was prepared,” Raveendran said. At present, Athey Nallatha employs 70 women from Panangad, Paravur or Tripunithura – places in and around Kochi. And a number of farmers around Kochi benefitted from local sourcing. “We wanted to stimulate the local economy. During the initial days of Covid, the inter-state trade was disrupted and farmers were affected. So, we decided to source locally only,” said Raveendran. Athey Nallatha sells its products online through its website and Amazon. It also sells them via 30 retail stores. For serving the Middle Eastern clientele, the startup is tying up with online portal Noon.com. Raveendran said he got the first direct order from Germany and the shipments are going soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/payments-kerala-firm-opts-for-cryptocurrency/articleshow/85780181.cms||Shenoy Karun

Police have registered a case against 17 AAP members and 500 unidentified persons under IPC sections 188 [disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant], 269 [negligent act likely to spread infection of disease], 270 [malignantly does any act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life] and sections 3,4 of the Epidemic Diseases Act at Lohamandi police station. The AAP members did not follow social distancing norms and were without masks, and they took out the 'Tiranga Yatra' from GIC ground to Shahid Smarak, Hariparvat, stated the FIR filed by sub-inspector Kapil Kumar. Ahead of next year's assembly polls, AAP now plans to hold similar 'Tiranga Yatra' in Lucknow, Noida and Ayodhya. The Rajya Sabha member further said that there was no such violation notified in the PM’s rallies and chief minister’s functions during the pandemic. He added that 15 FIRs have already been registered against him, but these will not deter him or the party from taking out more such "Tiranga yatras". AAP’s coordinator of North assembly constituency in Agra, Kapil Vajpayee, who was also booked by the police said this shows that BJP is scared of the Opposition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/tiranga-yatra-manish-sisodia-sanjay-singh-booked-by-up-police/articleshow/85774953.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Plan to transfer 6 N corpn hosps to Centre to be taken up today||New Delhi: The executive wing of the cash-strapped North Delhi Municipal Corporation plans to place a proposal in the standing committee meeting scheduled on Wednesday for transferring all six hospitals (including medical colleges) to the central government. The proposal has been made on the ground that huge expenses are being incurred on salaries of doctors and staffers and other expenses, which the civic body is finding difficult to pay due to financial constraints. However, the standing committee members maintained that there wasn’t any such plan. “The commissioner has sent a proposal, which is likely to be tabled in the next standing committee meeting. But we are looking at alternatives to arrange for funds and pay salaries regularly rather than transferring the hospitals. In any case, since the trifurcation in 2012, we have been looking after their operations and maintenance successfully,” said standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain. “The corporation pays Rs 35 crore per month as salaries and other administrative expenses. The overall expenditure is Rs 350 crore, which includes pension (Rs 56 crore) and maintenance (Rs 40 crore),” said former mayor and councillor from Sadar Bazar, Jai Prakash. On Thursday, Delhi High Court had said the corporation did not exhibit a sense of urgency on considering the proposal of handing over its six hospitals and medical college to the Centre or Delhi government. It had warned that any default in timely payment of salaries and pensions would lead to attachment and sale of its properties. For payment of salaries at Hindu Rao (980 beds), Kasturba (450 beds), Rajan Babu (700 beds), Balak Ram (100 beds), Mrs Girdhari Lal (97 beds) and Maharishi Balmiki (150 beds) hospitals, the civic body had spent Rs 356 crore in 2020-21, Rs 344 crore in 2019-20 and Rs 370 crore in 2018-19. Leader of the House Chhail Bihari Goswami said there was no question of transferring the hospitals and medical college to the Centre or Delhi government. “We are considering various proposals to arrange for funds to overcome the crisis. We have paid salaries till July. We will soon take a decision regarding the demand for enhancement of dearness allowance and HRA. If we get all dues from Delhi government, then salaries can be paid on time,” he added. The south and east corporations had recently issued orders for enhancing DA and HRA, said a representative of Confederation of MCD Employees Unions. He added if this enhancement was not implemented, they would be bound to start protests. The union members claimed to have met the mayor, leader of the House and Opposition on this issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/plan-to-transfer-6-n-corpn-hosps-to-centre-to-be-taken-up-today/articleshow/85780185.cms||Vibha Sharma

Reacting to Congress MLA Pargat Singh’s remarks, Rawat told media persons, “I am not backing any individual but backing the Punjab Congress. As for the faces, the party has Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka at the national level; and Amarinder Singh, Navjot Singh Sidhu, besides Pargat Singh himself, will be in the forefront. There is no reason to get impatient too soon on this count.” “I understand what to say when and what to do when,” he said, adding that he didn’t wish to engage with his party colleagues through the media. He said he had no regret about what he said about Sidhu’s adviser (Malwinder Singh Mali) as it was against the party’s policies. Last week, Rawat had said the party will contest the 2022 Punjab polls under the leadership of Amarinder. The statement was welcomed by the Amarinder loyalists. However, the party high command has not announced its chief ministerial face for the Punjab elections so far. “The CM and the PCC chief fight elections together. That is the tradition of the party. But it is the high command and the party leadership that decides on the chief minister. The PCC chief is the overall controller of the election. The chief minister is the person who is running the government and gives accounts of the implementation of the policies and decisions,” he said. Rawat also told a TV channel that his statement about the face of the party was interpreted differently by the media in Uttarakhand and Punjab. Pargat had said on Sunday that if Rawat is saying that the 2022 Punjab elections will be fought under the leadership of chief minister Amarinder Singh, then he should also tell when this decision was taken. Rawat is likely to visit Chandigarh in the coming days and speak to both Amarinder and Sidhu to make sure that the state leadership puts up a united face.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/rawat-says-navjot-cm-will-fight-polls-together/articleshow/85782282.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Dealers on strike, no fuel sale today across Bengal||KOLKATA: The West Bengal Petroleum Dealers’ Association struck work across Bengal has decided to stick to their plan of daylong no-purchase-no-sale at fuel stations on Tuesday. Their protest is against oil marketing companies (OMCs) not heeding to their pleas of roll-back of ethanol blended petrol (EBP) during monsoon. Ethanol being hygroscopic attracts moisture from the humid air and rain and later settles into a separate layer. This layer of water in underground tanks and vehicle’s fuel tanks led to breakdowns the association members said. Customers often sought compensation from dealers for damage due to ‘adulterated petrol’, said Snehasish Bhowmik, vice-president of the association. The dealers also accused OMCs of short supply of fuel to petrol pumps. “A very large portion of our profitability goes in adjusting for the pilferage of fuel during transit which can be 1% of the amount of fuel loaded,” said Prasenjit Sen, joint secretary. The association will meet the transport minister on Tuesday. IOC in its statement said their dealers would not be part of the strike as of now. “The city has 21 company-owned stations which will be operational,” the statement said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dealers-on-strike-no-fuel-sale-today/articleshow/85780214.cms||---

Terming the ED raids as vindictive, Gawali said it was an attempt to malign her image. “The BJP government at the Centre is targeting Shiv Sena leaders who raised voice against its policies,” she said. The Sena MP also demanded ED action against BJP MLA from Karanja Rajendra Patni, whom she accused of being a land shark. Gawali claimed she has lodged a complaint against Patni for amassing over Rs500 crore wealth through land grab. “The Maharashtra government has already started an investigation into it,” she said. “The ED is being used by the BJP as a tool to harass opposition leaders. They targeted Sena MP Sanjay Raut, notice has been served on transport minister Anil Parab and now my establishments have been raided,” said Gawali. “My establishments include educational institutions and how can these be raided without notice. Whatever I own is my ancestral property, unlike Patni, who is a known land-grabber,” said Gawali. A few days ago, Somaiya had claimed that Gawali supporters had thrown stones and ink at his car in Risod when he wanted to visit a factory there.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/ed-raids-5-institutions-of-sena-mp-gawali/articleshow/85782311.cms||---

The PSI is Shobha, from Barke police station who is also known as a lady with a golden heart. Mangaluru City police on Saturday conducted 152 awareness meetings in ladies’ hostels, educational institutions and public places as part of an attempt to popularize the Emergency Response Support System (ERSS)-112 and reach out to the public, particularly women. Shobha told TOI: “Most staff members were assigned particular duties for the day, and I was at the police station. I received a call from the police control room asking me to go near Vishal Nursing Home as a lady was in distress. I got the victim’s number and contacted her. She spoke to me as if she was tensed and said that five people were teasing her. The Mysuru rape incident flashed into my mind, and I was praying that nothing unfortunate should occur here. I confirmed the victim’s location and told her to remain there,” she said. She along with ASI Dharmavathi and constable Kumar stepped out of the police station but realized that there was no vehicle at the station. “We immediately got into an autorickshaw and reached the spot to find city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar and inspectors interacting with students. I then realised that this was a demonstration to show how quickly police react. I almost went blank for a few seconds, because till then my only concern was to ensure the woman was safe. Once everything settled down, I was even felicitated,” she said. The PSI has been a powerlifter and an Ekalavya awardee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/unaware-its-a-mock-drill-psi-rushes-to-save-victim/articleshow/85777551.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Man held in bangle-seller case has Pakistan links on social media, says Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra||BHOPAL/INDORE: Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra on Monday said that one of the four men arrested for holding a protest outside a police station in Indore after the assault of a bangle seller has ‘Pakistan links on social media’, and that he is connected with Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM). "As per the evidence found, one of the arrested persons, Altamash Khan, who staged a protest at a police station after the bangle-seller incident, has links with Pakistan through WhatsApp and Facebook,” Mishra told reporters. “Objectionable material found with Khan was enough to disturb peace in Madhya Pradesh. Interrogation of the four arrested people is underway,” Mishra added.’ Indore SP Ashutosh Bagri steered clear of naming Pakistan or AIMIM. “Regarding who the four accused have connections with, there are countries that have been trying to damage India’s peace and order and there is a section that seeks to radicalize youth. Police and administration are tough on such people and we will foil their plans,” he said. Police are investigating this case very carefully, he said. “The number of accused will rise, but those who are innocent will not face any trouble,” he assured. “The four accused have been questioned and every call recording stored in their phones is being checked. We are also looking at all their WhatsApp messages and groups,” said the SP, adding that investigators have recovered deleted photos and data. “After analysis, all this we will have a clear picture of how deep their roots were,” he said. AIMIM, however, denies Altamash is a member of their organization. The party’s state president in-charge Dr Naeem Ansari and Indore district chief Shahrukh Hussain said there is “no office-bearer or worker named Altamash Khan in AIMIM”. “We don’t believe in staging protests or raising slogans. Our leader, Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, talks about the Indian Constitution and we also work on the same line. We live in India and we have nothing to do with Pakistan or any other country,” said Hussain. Ansari said “IB officials” had approached him to check if Altamash was a member of his party. “He is not related to AIMIM in any manner,” he said. Altamash and three other men – Md Imran Ansari, Javed Khan and Syed Irfan Ali – have been booked for spreading inflammatory messages and conspiring to trigger riots in Indore after the bangle seller incident. They were allegedly in a group that had staged a protest at Banganga and Central Kotwali police stations, demanding action against those who had thrashed bangle-seller Tasleem. He was booked under Pocso Act the next day, and police also registered a case against those at the gherao of the police station. Home minister Mishra had said that Tasleem used a fake name to do business. “He has been doing business under a Hindu name though he belongs to a different community. He was selling bangles to womenfolk which caused the incident,” Mishra said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/man-held-in-bangle-seller-case-has-pak-links-on-social-media/articleshow/85780198.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Hotels go to NGT against pollution board’s directives||PANAJI: After the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) sought to levy environmental compensation on some hotels, which did not have functional organic waste treatment facilities, the hotels have approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT). They said there was no application of mind from the pollution control board when issuing the directives. The tribunal, in the matter, has issued notices to the GSPCB, seeking its say by October 8. The hotels have told NGT that the pollution control board has not taken full facts into consideration. They have told the tribunal that they were not operating at full capacity and so there is no question of treating massive amounts of waste. “In the light of the fact that only 10 rooms are operational from January 1, 2021, and there would not have been generation of organic waste and therefore, the imposition of environmental compensation on account of non functioning of organic waste converter could not arise at all. He (hotel owner) would further plead impugned proceedings of the respondent no.1 (GSPCB) exhibit non application of mind,” one hotel has told NGT. One hotel said that the GSPCB issued directives against it even though the Board was aware that the hotel was in the process of replacing its plant with a new one. “The hotel of the appellant have removed the existing organic waste composter on January 16, 2021, to make way for the new organic waste composter which was also reinstalled on February 10, 2021, and the fully functional nature of the compositing waste facility has also been confirmed by the engineering assistant appointed by the respondent no.1 (GSPCB) and the said vital facts have not been taken into consideration by the respondent no.1 before passing the impugned proceedings levying environmental compensation and hence prays for interference,” another hotel has told the NGT.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hotels-challenge-pollution-control-boards-waste-management-directives-before-ngt/articleshow/85780241.cms||---

---||Delhi||A hotspot every few kilometres in Delhi: Focus on winged friends during their special month||NEW DELHI: With the Big Butterfly Month-2021 to begin from September 4 with the theme of ‘habitat creation’, the focus is on setting up more butterfly hotspots within a distance of a few kilometres to provide a conducive habitat for increasing the population of the winged insects. The steps are also being taken to strengthen the butterfly corridor and to help butterflies travel across the city. So far, 67 butterfly habitats have been created in Delhi-NCR and over 50 host species have been planted at various sites. Experts say the population of butterflies is on the decline due to threats like use of pesticide, deweeding and ornamental gardens and hence, it is necessary to create butterfly hotspots. In an ongoing project, Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) has been creating a corridor for butterflies by planting a variety of host plants at parks and gardens in various areas of Delhi-NCR to attract butterflies. During the month, the census of butterflies is also conducted. “The methodology is to collect data on species and record them on an annual basis to correctly identify gaps in the corridor and apply effective interventions. The interventions done are planting of native host plants to facilitate egg laying of butterflies, augmented by already existing seasonal flowers plantation done by various civic agencies and declaration of small wild patches left in these set locations across the corridor,” said Sohail Madan from BNHS. Data is also being collected on specific species and their ability to cross urban barriers like flyovers and six-lane roads present at some gap points. “We have observed that some bigger species of butterflies are able to cross flyovers and six-lane roads,” said Madan. Of the total 67 butterfly habitats developed, 10 butterfly parks are in schools and colleges, while 17 butterfly parks have been established in public parks. The remaining 40 butterfly habitats have been prepared in home gardens and terrace gardens. Experts said locals could attract butterflies in their garden at home by planting some common host species like Kadi patta, Aak or Madar, Vajradanti, Chulai, Lemon, Arandi, Patharchatta and Senna. Anil Kapur, a member of BNHS who created a butterfly habitat in the garden of his colony, said, “We first covered the muck present in the garden with sand and soil. We planted the host species and after some months, we sighted many butterfly species.” Plain Tiger, Common Grass Yellow, Mottled Emigrant and Common Emigrant are the common butterfly species which were sighted last year. While some rare sightings, including Dark Cerulean, Common Albatross, Striped Albatross, Common Shot Silverline and Common Mime, were also made in 2020. The butterfly month will conclude on September 30.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/a-hotspot-every-few-kilometres-focus-on-winged-friends-during-their-special-month/articleshow/85780243.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Agra||Criminal with Rs 75,000 reward shot dead in encounter by Agra police||AGRA: A wanted criminal carrying a reward of Rs 75,000 was shot dead in an encounter with Agra police on Monday after he escaped from custody by snatching a revolver from a policeman. He was being taken to his accomplice’s house to recover weapons when the encounter took place. According to police, as many as 146 criminals have been killed and 3,389 injured in encounters since March 2017 and the force has lost 13 of its personnel in such incidents. Giving details of the encounters in the state, ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said that 61 criminals have been killed in Meerut, 18 in Agra, 14 in Varanasi, 10 in Lucknow, and eight in Kanpur zone. Police said 40 criminal cases, including murder, kidnapping for ransom and robbery are registered against Mukesh Thakur, 44, who hailed from Rajasthan’s Baseri, at various police stations in UP and Rajasthan. He was involved in contract killing. In February 2021, the then IG (Agra range) had declared Rs 50,000 for his arrest and Rs 25,000 was declared by the additional director general of police, Rajasthan. In February this year, Thakur had looted a petrol pump in Agra’s Iradat Nagar. Giving details of Monday’s encounter, inspector general of police (Agra range) Naveen Arora said on a tip-off that Thakur was planning to commit a crime in Agra, a police team of SOG and surveillance were keeping a tab on his movement through electronic surveillance. Thakur was arrested on Sunday afternoon while travelling on a bike with an accomplice, Jitendra, on Rohta road. The duo was taken to Sadar police station. During interrogation, Thakur revealed that he was planning a murder and was going to his accomplice’s house to collect weapons. On Monday, the criminal was being taken to his accomplice’s house to collect the weapons when he pushed one policeman in the vehicle, snatched the service revolver and escaped. At least 12 police personnel in two vehicles were escorting him when he fled. Immediately the news was flashed and teams were formed to nab him. A police team surrounded Thakur but he opened fire in a bid to escape. In retaliation, police fired, injuring him. He was taken to SN Medical College for treatment but doctors declared him brought dead.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/criminal-with-rs-75k-reward-shot-dead-in-encounter-by-agra-police/articleshow/85775086.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Bhopal||Attempts to disturb social fabric in Madhya Pradesh on: CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Monday that attempts were being made to disturb the social fabric in the society in state and it has become necessary to stop the campaign against the BJP's ideology. Chouhan, while addressing a programme organised to mark the centenary year of party's founder member, late Kushabhau Thakre, announced to set up a training institute for BJP workers in his name. "Today there are many such elements in the society, in many areas, who want to break the society and there is a systemic campaign against our ideology in Madhya Pradesh. So, in this 'Sangathan Parv' (strengthening of organisation), we should involve full-time workers and work in areas where such disinformation is being spread so that the facts are known to all," said Chouhan without naming any political party. He further said that the birth centenary celebration of Thakre is a golden opportunity for the BJP to develop the government and the organisation as a model in the county. "There should be proper coordination between the government and the organization. We are doing many experiments through participation of workers in the government programmes so that government schemes should reach to the bottom in a proper way through the workers." The chief minister said that the government will further take up the work of the training institute being set up in the name of Kushabhau Thakre and develop it for the party workers so that they could be trained. He said, his (Thackre's) sacrifice, penance and virtuous thoughts will always inspire and guide the workers for the service of the nation and society. BJP state president Vishnu Dutt Sharma said that programmes will be held all over the state throughout the year during the birth centenary celebrations. "During Vistarak programme (to expand the party's ideology), 10,000 workers will work for 10 hours for continuous 10 days in the state. Party officials and workers will travel up to the booth level. A series of lectures based on the personality and work of Thakre ji will be organised throughout the year," said Sharma. Top party leaders including national joint general secretary Shiv Prakash, state in-charge P Murallidhar Rao, national general secretary Kailash Vijayavargiya, union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, chief whip in Lok Sabha Rakesh Singh, former chief minister Uma Bharti were present during the launching of the birth centenary celebrations of Thakre, among others. An exhibition focused on Thakre was also inaugurated in the BJP state head office on Monday. BJP offices across the state also held recitation of "Sunder Kand" to mark the occasion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/attempts-to-distrub-social-fabric-in-state-on-chouhan/articleshow/85780245.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: After raid, Shiv Sena MP seeks ED action against BJP MLA||MUMBAI/YAVATMAL: The ED on Monday conducted raids at seven locations in connection with a money laundering case pertaining to alleged irregularities in a trust promoted by Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali. Among the raided premises included offices of Jan Shikshan Sansthan NGO and Mahila Utkarsh Pratishan trust, Balaji Co-op Particle Board Factory and Risod Urban Co-operative Credit Society. Gawali is the president of the NGO, and both the institutions are situated in Washim district. The trust runs Ayurved College, Hospital & Research Center in Risod, which was also covered in the raid. The Sena MP also demanded ED action against BJP MLA from Karanja, Rajendra Patni, whom she accused of being “a land shark.” Gawali claimed she has lodged a complaint against Patni for amassing over Rs 500 crore wealth through land grab. “The Maharashtra government has already started an investigation into it,” she said. She filed the police FIR in last May in Washim about cheating of cash from her institution’s office in July 2019 against 12 persons, including former secretary of her NGO and trust, Ashok Gandole and chartered accountant (CA) Upendra Mule. Gawali alleged that Gandole, along with others, walked into the office of the institutions in July 2019 without permission and took Rs 7 crore cash along with documents like trust registration certificate and financial statements till 2018 after threatening the office manager. They also afterwards cheated the trust of Rs 11 crore more. Gandole had been working with institutions promoted by Gawali since 2008 and resigned in June 2019. She claimed in the police FIR that after her institutions’ auditor pointed out the irregularities to her, she formed a committee to inquire about the incident. The committee inquired with Gandole about the money, and he allegedly told them that he had given it to Mule. In her complaint, Gawli alleged that both the accused had threatened to file a false case to frame the institutes’ officials in case they approached the police. “My establishments include educational institutions and how can these be raided without notice? Whatever I own is my ancestral property, unlike Patni, who is a known land-grabber,” said Gawali. Recently, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had written a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray mentioning demands for illegal money made by Sena leaders from highway contractors, particularly in Yavatmal-Washim, which is represented by Gawali in Lok Sabha. Gadkari said he would have to stop all work if such illegal activities continued.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/after-raid-sena-mp-seeks-ed-action-against-bjp-mla/articleshow/85782398.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Pune||Janmashtami celebrations muted second year in row||PUNE: The usual joie de vivre associated with Janmasthami was missing for the second consecutive year on Monday as temples remained shut owing to the pandemic, forcing devotees to make do with online darshans and celebrations at home. Conspicuous by absence were the long queues outside the city Iskcon temples, a familiar scene on Janmasthami. “Though they cannot experience the rituals inside the temple, we have made efforts to ensure they can be a part of it online — right from the early morning broadcast of the aarti to the abhishek ceremony at midnight. Many devotees are calling us up and coming to the gate for darshan and we have to explain to them that government regulations need to be followed. People get angry, but we try to placate them by distributing prasad at the gate,” said Harivilas Das from the management at Iskcon Sri Govind Dham Nigdi, Ravet. “We had arranged a 3D immersive experience for those watching online,” said Jagannath Dham Das, from the Iskcon Pune communications department. “September 1 marks the 125th birth anniversary of our founder A. C. Bhaktivedanta and we had big celebrations in mind, but due to the pandemic we are strictly following safety protocols. Cultural activities such as drawing competitions, quiz about the founder’s life, dance, drama, music performances and so on had been organised all week as a part of our Krishna Fest. We will also release videos of the founder’s life to commemorate his 125th birth anniversary. To mark the occasion, the Government of India will release a commemorative coin of Rs125, made of silver and copper, in the honour of our founder along with a booklet on the contribution and achievements,” he said. Meanwhile, the city unit of the BJP staged an agitation in front of the Kasba Ganpati temple on Monday as part of their statewide protest to demand opening of temples.  “All other establishments are open as part of the break the chain policy, but only temples have remained shut. The state government must open the temples. Guidelines for reopening of temples can be drafted and issued accordingly, so that social distancing norms are followed,” said Chandrakant Patil, state unit chief of the BJP. There were many who celebrated the festival at home. Rekha Agarwal, a resident of Mangaldas Road, said, “We had prepared Krishna’s favourite foods, including makhan mishri, which was made with butter and sugar, as well as panjiri made with flour, sugar and lots of dry fruits.” Priyanka Ramaiya, a resident of NIBM Road, dressed her toddlers in Radha-Krishna costumes to make them understand the concept of the festival. “All of us also listened to the story behind the festival.” (With inputs from Prasad Kulkarni)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/janmashtami-celebrations-muted-second-year-in-row/articleshow/85780302.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Taking to Twitter, Nath said that shortage of coal has affected the generation in thermal power stations in the state and some of them are on the brink of closure. Despite an increasing gap between demand and supply of power, the state government is not addressing the issue, he said. During the Congress regime, power crisis was never allowed to crop up in the state and people were also provided cheap electricity. On the other hand, people are today plagued by the power crisis and highly inflated electricity bills. The veteran Congress leader threatened a state-wide agitation if the prevailing power crisis is not tackled and inflated electricity bills are not checked. Later, state Congress media vice-president Bhupendra Gupta in a press statement claimed that unscheduled power cuts amounting to 1300 MW or more are in effect in the state and 9 out of 16 power generation units of MPEB are defunct. He said that power generation units in the public sector are being shut and power is being purchased from private companies at costly rates. Gupta, while referring to figures of the power discoms, said that on Sunday, there were unscheduled power cuts amounting to 1363 MW and on Saturday it was even more-1708 MW.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/govt-not-addressing-power-crisis-nath/articleshow/85780281.cms||---

One of the oldest universities in India, NU is without any grade now after its validity expired on December 9, 2019, due to official indifference. In 2014, NU was awarded ‘A’ grade with 3.08/4 CGPA. The original NAAC team from Bengaluru, however, would be visiting NU from September 2 to 4. It would visit all departments and conducted colleges and interact with the students, vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari told TOI. According to NU officials, the mock NAAC team, consisting of one retired and one current VC from outside Maharashtra along with one member from MP, visited various departments and conducted colleges. The panel found the facilities highly inadequate and noted that there was lack of research activities in most of them, and number of patents filed were meagre. NAAC coordinator Smita Acharya refused to comment stating that she was not authorized to talk to the media on any issue. In its report, the mock panel comprising former VC from Aurangabad and current VC from Karnataka universities also pointed out huge vacancies in all NU departments and colleges, thereby severely affecting academic performance and research activities. Refuting that the mock panel had awarded poor grades to NU, pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe told TOI that it was constituted to find discrepancies and suggest remedial measures. “After their suggestions, we have brought out changes as suggested by them. We are trying our best to achieve top grades,” he said. NU officials said the mock panel also suggested to cleanse the campus, as grass and bushes were seen everywhere due to rains and the premises looked unkempt. Even many departments lacked adequate facilities and equipment for research activities as required for securing top grade. “We have given a facelift to the campus as per the mock panel’s suggestions. We are aiming for achieving top grades,” they said. NU to ask engg colleges to restore salaries in 8 days After being forced by Management Council (MC) members, Nagpur University (NU) would be sending letters to all engineering colleges to pay salaries of their teaching and non-teaching staff within eight days. NU also decided to extend dates of undergraduate admissions after MC members made a demand for it. Now, the admission would be made till September 30. The VC remained non-committal about reinstatement of six teachers sacked by Priyadarshini Group of Institutions for “revealing” the reality to the visiting MC panel. The VC told members that the university didn’t have powers to direct private colleges to reinstate their sacked staffers. It was decided to seek a comprehensive report from the college concerned within three days with valid reasons for sacking of teachers, as per the officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/mock-naac-panel-shows-mirror-to-ngp-varsity-grants-b-grade/articleshow/85777658.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Busy Juhu junction to get pedestrian island||MUMBAI: One of Juhu's most congested traffic intersections, BP Patel Chowk, which has five roads merging into it, is set for a redesign to make it pedestrian-friendly. Just like what was done at Jagnade Chowk, Lalbaug, not so long ago, refuge islands will be made at Patel Chowk for pedestrians to stop and cross. “The project was planned a long time ago. The pandemic stalled it. We want to begin work soon,” said local corporator Renu Hansraj. Locals said congestion at the junction has progressively become worse over the years. It is so unsafe that people who would normally walk a short distance to the beach now bring out their cars. “The junction leads to the beach and so people from all over the city converge on it. It’s time the junction was reorganised,” said Mohanbhai Patel, a former sheriff of Mumbai and a local resident. Saurabh Jain, a consultant with WRI India which is helping with the junction redesign, said the site of the would-be traffic island is at present inaccessible and a visual barrier. “The proposal looks at making it accessible for pedestrians, to provide refuge, designing it for human scale and also to improve visibility,” he said, adding that beautification will be a byproduct of the focus on safety.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-busy-juhu-junction-to-get-pedestrian-island/articleshow/85782474.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Goa||Southwest monsoon active over Goa again, light rainfall likely this week||PANAJI: After being inactive for 20 days, the southwest monsoon over Goa saw increase in activity owing to a few weather systems. As a result, parts of the state experienced short spells of intense rain on Monday. The India meteorological department (IMD) had forecast heavy rainfall of 6.4cm in 24 hours at one or two places over Goa. Light to moderate rainfall occurred at most places over the state with Mapusa and Sakhali receiving 6cm of rain each; Ponda and Canacona receiving 3cm each; Old Goa receiving 2cm of rainfall while Quepem and Sanguem received 1cm each. The IMD has attributed the reason for the wet weather to the formation of a low-pressure area over south Odisha which was over south Chhattisgarh and neighbourhood regions on Monday. In addition to this, there is an east-west shear zone above mean sea level and an offshore trough at mean sea level from Karnataka to Kerala coast that persists. “Though these three systems are not that significantly strong, they have caused the monsoon over Goa to become active. It is possible that compared to the past week, the monsoon could be stronger in the coming week,” said IMD scientist Rahul M. There could however be a comparatively weaker spell for two to three days after 24 hours following which the rainfall activity will pick up by September 7. Light to moderate rainfall and thundershowers very likely at most places from August 31 to September 3, the IMD forecast reads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/southwest-monsoon-active-over-goa-again-light-rainfall-likely-this-week/articleshow/85780360.cms||---
---||Pune||Travel enthusiasts opt for trips to nearby destinations in Maharashtra||PUNE: The likelihood of a third wave and frequent changes in travel regulations have prompted many to opt for short trips to nearby tourist spots during the upcoming Ganapati festival. Travel agents said they have been getting enquiries from people wishing to travel to Nashik Vineyards, Mahabaleshwar, Karjat, Igatpuri, among places. However, the queries are not getting translated into bookings and visits to destinations in other states are not being considered by people, said tour operators. They said that the fear of the third wave and constantly changing travel regulations are main deterrents. “Ganesh festival is the biggest festival in Maharashtra and many people tend to go on short trips. We have been getting many queries for places in Maharashtra which are not very far from Pune. Many are opting to spend a few days at the vineyard in Nashik, but there are also queries and booking for Karjat, Lonavla, Mahabaleshwar, among others. People are enquiring but requesting for a few days more to make up their minds,” Nilesh Bhansali, the director of Travel Agents Association of Pune said. Jeevan Vyas of city-based Ganapati Tours and Travels said that trips to far-off places are not being preferred by many. “There are two main reasons — fear of the third wave and the constantly changing travel regulations. Many states have made RT-PCR negative report compulsory. Also, there are talks of children getting affected, so many are cautious before booking a getaway to the northeast or Kashmir, for example. We are getting an average four to five bookings to far-away destinations,” Dheer said. The representative of another travel company in Shivajinagar said they received more bookings for travel within Maharashtra than to places outside the state. “During pre-pandemic times, the bookings during Ganapati festival were more for places like Goa, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and the far east. Such bookings are between 3% to 4% this year,” the representative said. Niranjan Dhoke, a Kalyaninagar resident, has decided to spend some days during Ganapati festival at his friend’s farmhouse in Lonavla. “We were planning to go to Goa, but there is fear of a third wave, which stopped us from booking the trip,” Dhoke said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/travel-enthusiasts-opt-for-trips-to-nearby-destinations/articleshow/85780329.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Bhopal||BJP MLA calls protest rally on Sept 4||Bhopal: Amid Congress threat to launch a protest against intermittent power cuts, BJP MLAs have also expressed their ire over frequent power cuts in rural areas and cautioned the party leaders against big loss in the upcoming polls. BJP MLA from Maihar Narayan Tripathi has also announced a big protest in Vindhya region on September 4. “Parts of Vindhya region are reeling under frequent load-shedding and power cuts for almost 20 hours a day. In rural areas of Vindhya region, the farmers’ pleas have fallen on the deaf ears and the officials of the power companies are misguiding. If the situation persists, we will launch a big protest in the Vindhya region on September 4,” warned Tripathi. “In rural areas, power cuts have been imposed from 18 to 20 hours. The farmers are already facing problems due to shortage of urea and DAP. Now the situation is deteriorating. In Satna district, the situation is pitiable. The power companies do not inform the farmers before load-shedding, or power cuts. We will stage a dharna and gherao at DE and JE offices in Satna,” saidTripathi. Not even a single representative even from our party can deny the fact that there is irregular power supply in our Vindhya region. People are facing a lot of inconvenience. Vindhya seems to be neglected”, BJP MLA from Maihar, Narayan Tripathi told TOI. “Even today it is a festival but there is power black out in several villages, even today the condition is such. In my Maihar constituency several transformers have burned and are in the same condition for months”, he added. The BJP MLA urged power minister Pradyumna Singh Tomar to give attention to the demands of the farmers and warned that this could snowball into a major electoral issue. BJP MLA from Tikamgarh Rakesh Giri Goswami has also alleged that unscheduled power cuts have created severe shortages in several villages of Tikamgarh district. "In remote areas, power cuts from 12 to 15 hours have severely affected the crops. The farmers are unable to water their standing crops. They have also threatened to hold demonstrations against the power companies,” said Goswami in a letter to CM. BJP MP Ganesh Singh held meeting with the officials to take stock of the situation. “There were some supply issues for the past three days in the district, less power was being supplied and I had a talk with concerning people, the energy minister, senior officials and it has improved from Sunday onwards”, Ganesh Singh told TOI. He added, “Apart from it, the officials informed about several issues, like there are 118 transfomers which are not working though there are no power dues by people and there are around 199 other transformers in the district that have been damaged however there is an issue that payments are due against these. Officials are facing problems in availability of equipment. Then the power supply cables in several parts are old they need repairs. There is also a scarcity of maintenance funds, in past Rs 1 crore was provided for maintenance every month now it is being provided every six months”. Tomar said there is regular power supply and no crisis or undeclared power cuts have been noticed.  "Everything is fine. We will take immediate action after receiving complaints of power shortage or power cuts," said Tomar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/bjp-mla-calls-protest-rally-on-sept-4/articleshow/85780315.cms||---

The government guidelines are in place,” joint police commissioner Ravindra Shisve said. “It is expected that the people should follow the government guidelines in the larger public interest. They should cooperate with the police and government authorities,” Shisve said. “We will deploy adequate bandobast on Tuesday to avert gathering of people, especially in the old parts of the city,” he said. “Police will interact with the members of the Dahi-Handi mandal on Monday night and request them to follow government guidelines. We will not allow mandal members to celebrate Dahi-Handi on road, which may attract a crowd,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/adequate-cops-to-curb-crowding/articleshow/85780314.cms||---

It lifted a 10-litre tank of pesticide and sprayed it on the crop in minutes, taking everyone by surprise. The same task would have taken days. The drone for farmers is being promoted by the agricultural scientists of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University (SVBPAU), who have been holding demonstrations at various villages. They say it is quite effective not only in terms of reach but also in mitigating health risks faced by farmers who walk through the fields with handheld sprayers, exposing themselves to toxic chemicals. Besides, it will help overcome the shortage of labour. “The technique is very helpful, particularly for paddy and sugarcane, where negotiating the way through every nook and corner of vegetation is not possible and several portions of the crop are left out from the spray. The cost of a drone is Rs 6 lakh and it can spray crops in one acre in 15 minutes,” said RS Sengar, agriculture scientist, department of biotechnology, College of Agriculture, SVBPAU. A Chennai-based company has tied up with the university for the supply of drones “Utilization of drone technology will go a long way in attracting youth towards farming,” said RK Mittal, vice-chancellor, SVBPAU. According to the university sources, the drone-based technique will reduce the cost of spraying by almost half as 700 ml of pesticide is used to cover an area of one acre under conventional system, but with the drone, only half the amount will be needed, reducing input cost. The high cost of equipment is still a challenge. Bhoop Singh Chaudhary, a farmer at Ditoli village, suggested, “As of now, we think that a few farmers can jointly purchase the equipment instead of one bearing the entire cost.” As of now, agricultural drones are being used for spraying pesticides on paddy, groundnut, red gram, cotton and soya bean crops in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Chhattisgarh among other states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/drones-to-help-meerut-farmers-spray-crops-cut-risk-of-exposure-to-toxic-pesticide/articleshow/85775226.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Pune||Maharashtra: 20 lakh teachers, support group to take jabs from tomorrow||PUNE: The state government will prioritise the vaccination of teachers and non-teaching staff from September 1. Close to 20 lakh teachers and non-teaching staff, including administrators, clerks, peons and drivers working in government as well as private schools across the state, will be able to avail the benefit of free vaccination on priority. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director of state health services, said, “A separate category for teachers and non-teaching staff has been introduced on the CoWin portal. It will now be easier for teachers to book slots at government and municipal corporation-run vaccination centres to avail the benefit of free immunisation. For walk-ins, they can show their identity cards to get the shot on priority from September 1.” It would take more than a month to get all the teachers and non-teaching staff vaccinated, he added. The Union government has set September 5 as the deadline to get teachers/non-teaching staff vaccinated. “We are seeking the education department's help so that every teacher and non-teaching staff is followed up to get fully immunised with both the doses,” Deshmukh added. A sizeable number of teachers in the state have already gained from the priority vaccination in the front line workers’ category during the initial roll-out of the immunisation programme. “Teachers were deployed for contact tracing work and other field duties along with health workers to contain the spread of the virus. Hence, most have got their first dose under front line workers category. We now want to ensure that they are fully immunised,” Deshmukh said. Nitin Khandale, a zilla parishad primary school teacher in Jalgaon, said the block education officer in Chalisgaon taluka had registered all their names for vaccination in the January-February period, and got the vaccination done on priority. “Since most ZP teachers were also on Covid-19 duties, most of us here are already vaccinated. However, the government must also vaccinate the non-teaching staff as well as the contract teachers on priority,” he added. Jaywant Kulkarni, a secondary school teacher in Navi Mumbai, said, “Vaccination of all staff members will help though the target of 100% vaccination before September 5 may not be possible, since nothing has been planned.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/20l-teachers-support-group-to-take-jabs-from-tomorrow/articleshow/85780375.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Delhi||20 new cases, Delhi sees first Covid death in past five days||NEW DELHI: The national capital reported 20 cases of the coronavirus and one death on Monday, while the positivity rate stood at 0.04 per cent, according to data shared by the state health department. The capital had not recorded any fatality due to the infection in the past four days. The low number of Covid cases can also be attributed to fewer tests (51,387) conducted during the previous day. With the new cases, the overall infection tally in the city climbed to 14,37,736. Over 14.12 lakh patients have recovered from the disease. The death toll stands at 25,081. Twenty-eight people have succumbed to the disease this month so far. On Sunday, the city reported 31 coronavirus cases with a positivity rate of 0.04 per cent. There are 375 active cases in Delhi, of which 88 are in home isolation. The number of containment zones stands at 144, the health bulletin said. The capital battled a brutal second wave of the pandemic that claimed a large number of lives, with the shortage of oxygen at hospitals across the city adding to the woes. On April 20, Delhi had reported 28,395 cases, the highest in the city since the beginning of the pandemic. On April 22, the Covid case positivity rate was 36.2 per cent, the highest so far. The highest number of 448 deaths was reported on May 3. The state government has been ramping up health infrastructure to prevent a repeat of the crisis witnessed during the peak of the second Covid wave in April and May. Steps have been taken to increase the number of hospital beds to accommodate up to 37,000 patients and to become self-reliant in terms of oxygen supply. According to officials, around 160 PSA oxygen generation plants with a total capacity of 148.1 metric tonnes are being installed at various government and private hospitals in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/20-new-cases-delhi-sees-first-covid-death-in-past-five-days/articleshow/85777815.cms||---
---||Pune||CoWin adds 2 new slots for vaccination of school staff||PUNE: Two new categories on the centralized CoWin portal for teachers and non-teaching staff hope to accelerate full immunization for this crucial segment as many states across the country plan to reopen schools for physical classes after Diwali. The Centre has allocated more than two crore additional Covid-19 vaccines to the states to vaccinate the two categories on priority in the run-up to Teacher’s Day on September 5. N K Arora, chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on immunisation, told TOI, “States must expedite full vaccination among teachers and non-teaching staff. Most would have received the first dose. The objective now is to accelerate their full immunization.” There are nearly 97 lakh teachers in the country. Earlier this month, NITI Aayog member VK Paul had said that almost 50% have already been vaccinated. “It is crucial for teachers and school support or non-teaching staff to get fully vaccinated as part of the preparation for reopening of schools,” Arora said. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has indicated that inoculation of these two groups would be necessary to restore school education that was disrupted by the pandemic in March 2020. Schools have been shut for almost 18 months after the Covid-19 outbreak raising concerns about the cognitive and physical growth of children. “I request all the state governments to give their support and cooperation to this campaign to strengthen the foundation of the future,” Pradhan had said in a recent tweet. Experts said states and Union territories can use Unified District Information System of Education data and coordinate with their education departments, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghtan, Navodaya Vidyalaya Sanghtan to leverage full immunization of teachers and non-teaching staff.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/cowin-adds-2-new-slots-for-vaccination-of-school-staff/articleshow/85780352.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Delhi||School reopening SOP in Delhi: Staff to be vaccinated, 50% students allowed in a classroom||NEW DELHI: Giving top priority to vaccinating all employees, including teaching staff, devising a plan for only 50% occupancy in a classroom, manning of the entry and exit gates to avoid overcrowding and setting up of quarantine rooms are some of the guidelines for educational institutions for their reopening on September 1. Schools have been allowed to reopen for students of classes IXth to XIIth initially. However, parental consent is a must. Colleges and coaching institutes too have been allowed to resume functioning by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). For students of class VIIIth and below, online learning will continue. DDMA has asked the head of schools to hold a meeting with the parents-teachers body on the school’s readiness. Not more than 50% of the students who usually occupy a classroom should be called. The rooms need to have adequate ventilation and only one child can sit at one desk. “The lunch breaks may also be staggered to avoid crowding of students and held preferably in an open area, particularly as the students will be removing the mask for having food. Schools/institutes are also advised to use all the entry and exit gates…to avoid overcrowding at the time of entry-exit of students. Students may be guided not to share lunch, books, copies and stationery items. Students, teachers and employees living in the containment zone will not be allowed to visit schools," says the SOP. Specific guidelines have been issued for the government schools which are also being used as vaccination and ration distribution centres. “The area or part of the school institute building being used for vaccination or ration distribution should be properly separated from the area/part of the school building that will be used for academic activities. In this regard, the district administration shall cordon off the area marked for vaccination and ration distribution. They have to make separate entry-exit for this purpose and deploy a sufficient number of civil defence volunteers to avoid mingling of students with the persons coming for vaccination,” says the DDMA order. The schools will also have to provide emotional counselling to the students and teachers. Due to Covid, many students and teachers have lost their loved ones. The teachers also have to assess the learning levels of the children and work towards bridging the gap that may have developed during the lockdown. In case of any emergency, when a student or staff member shows any symptoms of Covid, they should be moved away from other people and into an outdoor, well-ventilated space and quarantine room. Routine guest visits should be discouraged, but during any emergency, parents will be allowed to visit with appropriate Covid protocol. The schools have been asked to place posters and standees on Covid preventive measures at prominent places like classrooms, washrooms, parking and entry and exit points.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/school-reopening-sop-staff-to-bevaccinated-50-students-allowed/articleshow/85777823.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||Schools, colleges in Delhi unsure of return on September 1||NEW DELHI: Most private schools say that reopening from September 1 for students of classes IX to XII might be difficult. However, practicals for students of classes X and XII will continue. Many schools will take a decision on reopening depending on the consent from parents. For colleges and universities, too, it is a wait and watch scenario as internal meetings over reopening are yet to be held. Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School, Rohini, said, “On Tuesday, we will be sending the consent form to parents. Most importantly, we will have to revive the school’s transport. Earlier, we used to run 12 buses on different routes. We have to seek the opinion of parents on how many will be willing to take the buses.” The Indian School would also be sending the consent forms to parents. “Depending on the response we get from parents, arrangements will be made,” said Tania Joshi, the principal. Schools like Mount Carmel, Dwarka have decided to wait till October and will reopen after seeing the experience of government and other schools. With Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) asking the heads of schools to treat vaccination of staff as a priority, most principals said only those who had received at least one dose were being called. “Some of the teachers had got Covid, so while they have taken the first dose, they are yet to get the second one,” said Joshi. In government schools, too, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said 98% of the staff had received the first dose of the vaccine. Sarita Batra, principal of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Shalimar Bagh, was quite confident that children could be called in from September 1. “All teachers are already coming and we have been having district-level workshops on reopening of schools. As the DDMA order has allowed only 50% seating capacity, students will be divided in batches and called on a rotation basis,” she added. Delhi University and Ambedkar University would be holding a meeting on Tuesday to decide the modalities. “We may conduct a meeting on Tuesday with deans and heads of colleges. Outstation students will have to be given at least 10 days’ time to come to Delhi for the practicals,” said Vikas Gupta, DU registrar. AUD vice-chancellor Anu Lather said, “I will be speaking to the deans on how reopening can be done. But I have already ordered for cleaning and sanitisation of the campus.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/schools-colleges-unsure-of-return-on-september-1/articleshow/85777831.cms||Shradha Chettri

Sharma said keeping in mind the climate of Punjab, crop should be procured on the basis of old quality specifications, so there is no impact on the purchase of their crop. The Punjab BJP president said the Food Corporation of India (FCI), on the recommendation of the expert committee constituted by the central government in the matter of procurement of wheat and paddy by the central control pool, has issued new uniform quality specifications which say that not more than 2% grain should be damaged, not more than 2% grain should be colourless, not more than 20% grain should be broken, and the grain should not contain more than 14% moisture. Sharma said these new specifications were wrong. He said as per the earlier quality specification, not more than 3% grain should be damaged, not more than 3% grain should be colourless, not more than 25% grain should be broken and the grain should not contain more than 15% moisture. He said from September to November, the temperature decreased and this had a direct effect on the crops. He also urged Goyal to intervene in the matter personally. Sharma said the rice sheller owners of Punjab had also put forward this problem in front of him and that the objective of BJP was to solve the demands of farmers and traders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/punjab-bjp-chief-procure-paddy-wheat-in-old-manner/articleshow/85782490.cms||---

In a related development, a court remanded Kohli and alleged drug supplier Ajay Singh in NCB custody till September 1. Kohli was first summoned to the NCB office on Saturday evening after the central agency, during a search operation, found drugs from his residence. Kohli’s name had also cropped up in the probe while NCB was questioning Singh. “On Monday, we detained two persons from Juhu for questioning. One of them, Mohammed Ajaz alias Chia bhai has been arrested with intermediate quantity of mephedrone,” said Sameer Wankhede, NCB’s zonal director. Saeed will be produced before a court on Tuesday. Saeed is alleged to have supplied drugs to Singh. “We are looking into the financial angle too and are verifying details. The case is at a preliminary stage and it would be too early to comment on it,” said Wankhede, adding that there were serious charges against Singh and Kohli. Wankhede said their priority was to break the drug supply chain.

Its officers and soldiers trained in India, now in the firing range as the Taliban takes over, told TOI that it is the distrust of army personnel and their association with India that has put them at extreme risk. They have petitioned India for help. “It’s our big hope,” one of them said from Kabul on Monday. “When the Taliban attacked, they had our (army’s) biometric pads. They were forcing people to put their fingers on the pad and all information would come up instantly. It was scary,” said Lieutenant Amir (name changed), 26, who graduated from the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun in 2018. “News came in, meanwhile, that four Afghan army personnel had been killed at Karte Naw (in Kabul) … Our address, too, was registered with the government and the army. So, we left. We have been in hiding for over a week.” Many like Amir are walled in from all sides — the Taliban is wary of army personnel and the Pakistan operatives of those with India links. “When the Taliban entered Kabul, we got orders that no one should fight them… The Taliban searched military officers’ houses and seized their weapons and vehicles. They killed randomly. I tried to get to the airport one day but they beat me up and kicked me, along with others. I went back to hiding at home,” a second Afghan army officer, who graduated from IMA the same year, told TOI. Another Afghan officer texted this correspondent saying: “I used to track military convoys before Taliban captured Afghanistan. When I see Pakistani malisha (militia) and fuagi (soldiers), I know they will not spare me if they know I graduated from IMA (sic).” A fourth, also an IMA alumnus, said, “Officers and soldiers who got training in India are at risk because the Pakistan army has issues with us … They know who the army and police are.” Help is yet to come though. A lieutenant who was in the IMA 2018 batch said his wife worked with the Indian embassy in Kabul for more than five years. He said they sought help from the ministry of external affairs and the Indian Army. “We haven’t got a response. Families of our liaison officers in all Indian academies are stuck in Kabul. So they can't come to our aid in any way right now. I request the Indian government to help us,” he said. “I keep changing my location every day. India, please help me,” said his batch mate. Some of these officers said they take hope from what they’ve heard of the evacuation of other soldiers. “I know so many people (soldiers) who were trained in the US, Australia and Germany. The countries helped the officers leave Afghanistan. We have more trust in India than anyone else,” an officer said. Defence expert Maroof Raza said Afghan officers who graduated from India “must have patience”. “The Indian government is yet to clarify its stand on the Taliban. So, the road ahead doesn’t appear smooth.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ima-trained-afghan-officers-fear-for-safety/articleshow/85784319.cms||Ishita Mishra

The right-wing group members disrupted an annual ritual held to celebrate the birth of Lord Krishna and then demolished the idol of the Hindu god in front of the helpless minority Hindu community members. Pakistan rights activist Rahat Austin said the temple was vandalised at Khipro in Sanghar district of Sindh. Rahat hit out at attacks on minorities in the neighbouring country: “Why do the crimes against non-muslim gods go unpunished whereas even the allegations of false blasphemy against Islam lead to mob lynchings?” In the recent past, a group of fundamentalists had attacked a Hindu temple in Bhong city of Rahim Yar Khan district of Pakistan’s Punjab. They had vandalised the Sidhi Vinayak temple and broken the idols of Hindu deities. Dr Jaipal Chhabria, member of Pakistan’s National Commission for Minorities, said the Kohli Hindu community was celebrating Janamashtmi when the incident happened. According to sources, local Hindus blamed policemen for the incident. A Hindu religious leader in Pakistan, Ramnath Maharaj, said after the incident, hundreds of Hindu protesters marched to the local police station to demand the arrest of the miscreants. Incidents of sacrilege of Hindu temples and idols are common in Pakistan and continue to happen despite claims of the Pakistan government of providing religious freedom and security to minority communities. On March 2, miscreants had vandalised Rawalpindi’s Purana Qila Mata Mandir.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/in-pak-janmashtami-festivities-disrupted-temple-vandalised/articleshow/85782556.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The move comes after one of the housing societies in Pimple Saudagar reported over 30 Covid-19 cases last week. The society has been sealed and testing of all the residents is underway. Rajesh Patil, the PCMC commissioner, said, “The rise in cases in the society certainly does not indicate that there is a spike in Covid infectionsacross the civic limits and we are studying it. The cases have been identified in a lone society and even though there is nothing to panic about, we will make sure testing is ramped up whenever required.” Patil added at present on an average, around 5000 Covid tests were conducted per day in the civic limits. Of them, 60% tests were RT-PCR and 40% were rapid antigen tests. Vikas Dhakane, PCMC’s additional commissioner, said they were following all the protocols to curb the spread and the possible reasons for the sudden surge in Covid cases in the society would be investigated. “The head medical officer of the concerned zone has visited the society. It has been declared as a containment zone, where entry and exit would be limited,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pcmc-to-ramp-up-testing-in-over-390-pockets/articleshow/85780423.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Speaking at a webinar titled “Environmental and health risks for reopening schools during Covid-19” organised by Society for Indoor Environment (SIE) on Monday, experts welcomed the new guidelines that focus on 50% seating capacity and staggered timings to reduce overcrowding. However, they said classrooms with poor ventilation needed to be avoided. IIT-Delhi professors Mukesh Khare and Harsha Kota said owing to the different methods of transmission of Covid, which included the risk of airborne infection, ventilating classrooms was the key with more reliance on keeping windows open than mechanical ventilation. “Closed classrooms, which possibly use airconditioning, or do not have open windows need to be avoided. Wherever possible, fresh air needs to be let in. Classrooms with adequate ventilation will be able to ensure minimal risk of transmission. Even then, sanitisation will be the key,” said Kota. They also suggested measuring CO2 concentration in classrooms to gauge ventilation levels. “CO2 can become a good indicator of whether fresh air is circulating in classroom or not. A benchmark can be set and if CO2 concentration crosses that limit, it means air is being trapped inside. As long as fresh air gets introduced, CO2 concentration should be low,” Kota said. Dr Arun Sharma, professor-director, UCMS and part of SIE, said while the new guidelines were welcome, even a 50% seating capacity might turn out to be risky as ensuring a six-feet gap between students would be unlikely. “One may have to measure the area inside the classroom and determine the actual number of students that can comfortably sit inside while maintaining a six-feet distance. One doesn’t necessarily need to have a 50% seating capacity, so dividing each class into sub-sections may be beneficial,” said Sharma, stating that risk of transmission dropped considerably outdoors. He added that with outdoor activities, there was less risk as the ventilation quotient was high. Unless students were really close to each other for a considerable period, there should be no risk. “Holding classes outdoors, if the weather permits, could be an option for some schools,” said Sharma. Dr Priyanka Kulshreshtha, an indoor air quality expert, stated that while certain schools had been completely relying on mechanical ventilation, Covid had presented the need to return to windows once again.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/outdoor-classes-open-windows-healthy-options/articleshow/85777845.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Pune||10 pointers from educators to govt on rebooting in-person teaching||Pune: Equitable access to schools when they reopen for in-person classes, increasing effective instruction time, preparing a school readiness programme that focuses on socio-economic learning, identifying at what stage of learning the children are, and mobilising community volunteers were among the 10 important recommendations made by a panel of 16 educational institutions in Maharashtra. Their report, called ‘Make school children ready during and after the pandemic’, suggested that adopting ‘phygital learning’, which included the use of technology to deliver education, along with coordinated teacher-parent interventions at home, and in-person classroom instructions, would be the key to building back learning outcomes when schools reopen. The Central Square Foundation published the report and the recommendations tat were made by the 16 organisations. The report called Rebuild Back Better said,“In India, 250 million children have been out of school for over 15 months. With barely 40% of children being able to access any form of digital learning, it is likely that learning for students enrolled in government and low-fee private schools has been minimal.” The impact of schools’ closure has been disproportionately heavy in primary grades where children are dependent on parents or older siblings for access to digital learning and were last on the priority list to return to school during the brief period when they operated physically in early 2021. The 16 organizations working in the education sector have collaboratively drawn on their learnings from the past year to develop a concerted strategy to rebuild the education system. As a collective, the organisations converged on three critical challenges when children return to school. The report said that thoughtful and urgent steps needed to be taken to avoid irreversible damage to an entire generation of children who stand to lose an average of 3-5% of their lifetime earnings when they enter the workforce. “Over the last few months, the education sector, including government bodies and non-governmental organizations, and civil society organizations have worked to investigate the stated problems and identify possible solutions,” the report added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/10-pointers-from-educators-to-govt-on-rebooting-in-person-teaching/articleshow/85780416.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The landslides occurred on Sunday night and now the administration has asked people not to visit the area. Thandi Sadak skirts Naini Lake and runs parallel to the Mall Road on its opposite side. The area is frequented by locals as well as tourists. The mountains above it have almost half a dozen temples and schools. Kumaun University’s DSB Campus is located above the landslide zone as well. The administration has deployed machines to clear the stretch. “We have our workers clearing the debris. The location is sensitive. So, we are keeping an eye for any fresh development. People have been alerted and asked to not visit the place,” a PWD official said. The landslides have worried the locals since it is not an isolated incident. Earlier, a part of the road to the Governor's house had collapsed. The cracks on the Nainital-Bhowali road have also widened. Last year, another major tourist spot, Tiffin Top, had developed cracks and boulders fell from it. Cheena Peak has also been one of the landslide prone areas. Apart from this, Baliyanala is a recurring landslide zone while the 20m stretch of the Lower Mall Road that fell into Naini Lake in 2018 is yet to be fully restored.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/landslides-block-thandi-sadak-in-nainital/articleshow/85775351.cms||Prashant Jha

The civic body has planned to keep around 25,000 beds available across the municipal areas. PMC officials said affidavits have been taken from the hospitals about providing beds as and when required. “The upkeep of the Covid care centres and dedicated Covid hospitals is being checked,” said senior PMC official Rajendra Muthe. The civic body had set up 13 Covid care centres during the second wave, which had around 4,700 beds. Besides, 10 more facilities were developed to make available 4,200 beds then. The civic officials said these facilities were currently shut as there was no demand for beds. As per the civic officials, the recruitment of manpower for these facilities would be an issue, if there was a sudden rise in cases. The civic administrations has given extension to some medical staff members, who were working on contract at the civic centres. But running these facilities at full capacities would need additional manpower. Civic data stated that around 18,500 beds without oxygen support, 7,500 oxygen supported beds, 1,100 ICU beds and 850 ventilator supported beds were available in the civic limits during the second wave. The jumbo hospital at College of Engineering, Pune will also be continued, which has 800 beds. PMC has also set up another jumbo hospital in Baner. “The decision to continue with the jumbo facility was taken as rebuilding it at the last minute will be a tough task and a very costly affair,” said Siddharth Shirole, the MLA of Shivajinagar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-tells-hosps-to-keep-infra-ready-for-possible-third-wave/articleshow/85780451.cms||---

To deal with increased caesarean and normal delivery cases, the hospital administration has been frequently calling senior doctors. “We are receiving at least 40 cases per day in this section, including 10 caesareans,” said an EDMC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/e-delhi-hosp-to-get-dialysis-machines-and-oxygen-plant/articleshow/85777934.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Five year disadvantage for diesel vehicles over petrol to stay in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi government’s transport department on Monday clarified that even though the validity of all categories of vehicles in registration certificates (RC) is 15 years, the owner of a diesel vehicle that is more than 10 years old cannot ply it in the national capital as per a 2018 Supreme Court order. Senior officials said the department has been inundated with queries from vehicle owners regarding validity of a vehicle’s RC, which shows 15 years but isn’t applicable in Delhi. Another reason that has made the department issue public notices regularly is the provisions of the National Vehicle Scrappage Policy, which proposes to allow personal vehicles that are over 20 years old as long as these clear fitness and emission tests. While a diesel vehicle that is more than 10 years old cannot ply in Delhi, an NOC can be obtained for such vehicles older than 10 years, but less than 15 years for States that have conveyed their concurrence for registration of such diesel vehicles, the notice issued on Monday stated. “Owners of such vehicles, i.e., more than 10 year old diesel and more than 15 years old petrol vehicles are hereby advised not to ply them on Delhi-NCR roads and are further advised to get such end-of-life vehicles scrapped through authorised scrappers of the transport department, a list of which is on the department’s website,” the notice read. Officials claimed that the government felt that since the emphasis of the National Vehicle Scrappage Policy is on fitness and not on the vehicle’s age, the same principle should apply for vehicles in Delhi. An official said that work is going on to see if the provisions of the policy can be applicable in the capital and there are plans to approach the Supreme Court and request a review of its 2018 order that prohibits plying of 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles in NCR. As per the amended Motor Vehicles Act, plying of old vehicles can invite a fine of Rs 10,000, which is compoundable to Rs 5,000. However, as per the court’s directions, such a vehicle can be impounded and scrapped if found plying on the city roads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/5-yr-disadvantage-for-diesel-vehicles-over-petrol-to-stay/articleshow/85777894.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Bhopal||Jailed in Pakistan at 28, Madhya Pradesh man back in India 30 years later||BHOPAL: Thirty years after he strayed into Pakistan and was jailed there, Madhya Pradesh’s Prahlad Singh stepped on Indian soil on Monday. Brutal torture in Pakistan custody has rendered the mental patient unable to speak, said police. Back home in Ghoshi Patti village, about 45km from Sagar city in MP, Prahlad’s brother Veer Singh couldn’t speak either. He just kept crying. For 23 years, the family didn’t have a clue if Prahlad was alive or dead, let alone that he was in a Pakistan prison. Once he knew, though, Veer fought for his brother’s freedom like a man possessed. Half of Prahlad’s life had wasted away behind bars in Pakistan, Veer was determined that his remaining years should be as a free man. The Pakistan Rangers on Monday handed over Prahlad, 58, and another Indian to BSF at Wagah Border after they were released from Rawalpindi central jail. Officials here say Prahlad was tortured after his arrest in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, with no regard to his mental condition. “Prahlad is not in a condition to speak or recall anything. Let him be home with his family for some days. He will be alright,” said a police officer. What makes his plight even more distressing is that he had completed his prison term but continued languish in jail, along with 21 others, as the Indian government had no information about their relatives. Battling mental ailments, they couldn’t give much information on their families back home, making it difficult for the authorities to identify them and begin the process to have them freed. Prahlad was 28 when he mysteriously disappeared. He doesn’t know yet that his mother and one of his brothers have died. Veer, two other brothers and three sisters are eagerly awaiting his arrival. When local mediapersons went to their home on Monday, Veer couldn’t speak through his tears at first. After a while, he said: “He is mentally unstable. We tried to look for him everywhere. It was only in 2014, when police came looking for his credentials, that we came to know he was a prisoner in Pakistan. We have no clue how he ended up there.” Sagar SP Atul Singh had told TOI that Prahlad was missing since 1991. “As far as we know, he was arrested in POK where he was kept for more than a month and then shifted to Rawalpindi,” he said. Prahlad may have inadvertently crossed into Pakistan or he may have been trafficked, say officers. He is the seventh ‘mentally ill’ MP resident to surface in a Pakistan jail, and that’s too much of a coincidence, say officials, suspecting that a cross-border trafficking ring may be at work.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/jailed-in-pak-at-28-mp-man-back-in-india-30-yrs-later/articleshow/85780493.cms||P Naveen

Ramlal, a resident of Nayi Basti (a settlement along Rispana) , told TOI, “We had to move to the first floor of our house as the flood water engulfed the ground floor on Thursday (August 26) night.” Recently, the residents of Valmiki Basti, a settlement along Bindal, had a narrow escape after the water level of the river breached the danger mark. Locals say that five-foot-deep water accumulated inside their houses last Tuesday leading to panic. Pooja, a Valmiki Basti resident, claimed that she almost got swept away by floodwaters. “We had to break one of the walls of our room to rescue our children as water entered from the main door of the house,” she said. Another resident of Valmiki Basti, Gyanchand, said that officials from the administration visited the colony the next day to make a list of the people who suffered losses but no compensation or help has reached them yet. “The boundary of my house collapsed due to the force of the water. All our food items and utensils got swept away. This has become an annual occurrence during monsoon but the civic body is taking no steps to prevent this,” said Gyanchand. Local BJP MLA Khajan Das had also promised financial aid to residents who suffered losses. However, locals say that only a few affected families received the compensation. “Almost 50 families were affected by the recent flooding but only 10 of them received the aid of Rs 3,800 from the MLA. The rest of us are awaiting compensation,” said Sayyam Kumar, a local shopkeeper. Meanwhile, district magistrate R Rajesh Kumar said that restoration works are underway and the affected people have been provided relief. “We have deployed earth-mover machines for clearing the debris. We have also distributed contingency funds and ration kits to the affected families,” he said.

---||Chandigarh||‘Afghan Sikhs, Hindus with passport, visa can visit India’||AMBALA: The Taliban has allowed Afghan Hindus and Sikhs to visit India on pilgrimage, provided they have valid passports and visas, India World Forum (IWF) president Puneet Singh Chandok said on Monday evening. “While speaking to an Afghan media channel, Zabihullah Mujahid, the spokesperson of the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan, has confirmed that the Taliban has no problem with Afghan Sikhs and Hindus going to India if they have valid passports and visas,” he said. Meanwhile, most Afghan Sikhs and Hindus who had taken shelter at Gurdwara Dashmesh Pita, Karta-E-Parwan, near Kabul for the last two weeks have returned to their hometowns in Afghanistan and started opening their businesses. However, a few families are still staying at the gurdwara. A Kabul-based Sikh, who runs a cosmetics shop, said, “Nearly 40 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus run shops and businesses in Kabul. My brother has a wholesale business of medicines with Indian pharmaceutical companies and is back at work. Taliban commanders have assured us safety and asked us to start work as per routine.” An Afghan Hindu said they have opened shops, but there was hardly any work. “We sit for some hours and return home as there are few customers. People are also afraid to coming out of their homes,” he said. An owner of a cosmetics shop said “work could start gaining pace with time.” Earlier in the day, Chandok said he had independently opened negotiations with the Taliban on Saturday, through its representative Bilal Karimi, who is an official assistant of Mujahid. “We requested the Taliban to facilitate Afghan Sikhs and Hindus for pilgrimage to India and Indians back to their country. Karimi assured to protect the rights of religious minorities while saying that Sikhs are part of their culture and their hum-vatan (fellow countrymen),” he said. Chandok said India’s ministry of external affairs was also in contact touch with heads of gurdwaras in Afghanistan. “As of now, the evacuation process from Kabul airport has been stopped and it is not feasible due to security concerns. India is ready to bring Afghan Sikhs and Hindus along with Indian residents, but it is waiting for the situation to normalise. There are a lot of Indians who are stranded in Kabul,” said Chandok. DSGMC leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa tweeted on Monday that people who were taking shelter at the gurdwara have returned to their homes. Sirsa tweeted: “Afghanistan update: I had a talk with Gurnam Singh, pradhan of Kabul Gurdwara Committee, today who apprised me that people taking refuge in Gurdwara Karte Parwan have dispersed back to their homes in wake of recent attacks in Kabul. Eight people (2 families) went back to Ghazni, 60 people went back to Jalalabad, and two families are still there. Yesterday, the commander of Taliban came to meet them in gurdwara sahib. These families told Taliban of their desire to visit India to be part of Guru Teg Bahadur’s 400th Parkash Purab celebrations. The commanders assured them of taking this matter up with their high command.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/afghan-sikhs-hindus-with-passport-visa-can-visit-india/articleshow/85782592.cms||JK Singh

The high court bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav directed that several individuals who between 2015 and 2016 had booked flats in a project at Malad (West) had sought orders for recovery of arrears under a recovery warrant of 2018 passed by MahaRERA against the builders. In March 2021, the builder agreed to pay Rs 2.7 crore in instalments. But in their July 2021 instalment, 10% was deducted as TDS, which the petitioners said was not permissible in law. The buyers’ counsel Subit Chakrabarti said the refund was in the form of compensation or a judgment debt. Senior counsel Zal Andhyarujina for the builders after analyzing the law said they had no objection to paying the deducted amount back to the petitioners.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bombay-hc-tells-bldr-not-to-deduct-tds-in-refund-to-buyers/articleshow/85782603.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Recognition for insulin pioneer on drug’s centenary||Kolkata: On insulin’s centenary year, researchers have discovered a pioneer — Jyoti Prakash Bose, the first Indian endocrinologist who had administered the drug here at the School of Tropical Medicine 98 years ago. Bose started injecting the drug to children with Type 1 diabetes in 1923, the same year Fredrick Banting and J J McLeod got the Nobel Prize for discovering insulin. The UK-trained Bengali doctor also ran India’s first diabetes clinic at STM. Chennai-based diabetologist Viswanathan Mohan, son of M Bishwanathan, who until now was called the father of diabetes treatment in India, published his paper recently, acknowledging Bose, five decades after his demise. The paper — titled ‘Diabetes in Pre-independence India: Rediscovering a Forgotten Era’— published in the August edition of Journal of The Association of Physicians of India, has created a stir among physicians world over. More proud are city endocrinologists like Utsho Basu, attached to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, who said, “This is a historic moment for Kolkata. Insulin was such an epoch-making discovery. It changed diabetes management because there’s no other cure for those suffering from Type 1 diabetes. I am especially happy because I know Mohan personally and am grateful to him for letting the world know that JP Bose was using the lifesaving drug 98 years ago when the rest of India was clueless about it.” Mohan, a Padma Shree awardee with 1,500-odd diabetes research to his credit, told TOI from Chennai: “All these years, everyone believed that my dad had started India’s first diabetic clinic at Stanley Medical College in 1948. But he was only born in 1923 when Bose was already injecting insulin at his STM clinic. Our article describes a forgotten chapter, showing that contrary to common belief, India was not a ‘late starter’ in the treatment of diabetes with insulin.” “My father’s glory doesn’t fade as Bose gets the recognition due to him,” added Mohan, reminding of T C Anand Kumar discovering Subhash Mukhopadhyay as the father of test-tube baby Durga. Until then, Kumar himself was celebrated as the pioneer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/recognition-for-insulin-pioneer-on-drugs-centenary/articleshow/85778007.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

To convince the parents, many schools have decided to invite them to review the preparedness on the campus. School authorities said that the move intends to convince the parents that the children will be safe in schools. “Schools are doing their best to boost the confidence of the students and the parents. They have launched different initiatives at their own level including inviting the parents to review the preparedness,” said Vinny Raj Modi, vice-president, MP association of unaided private schools. Outlining the preparations, schools said that they have made all possible arrangements for the safety of the students. “We are following every Covid protocol guidelines. Schools are equally aware that students’ safety is the topmost priority,” said Manisha Kawadekar, group director IES Public School. Asked about the vaccination of the staff, Kawadekar said, “School have done complete vaccination of the staff. In a situation when everyone is concerned about safety, I don’t think any school staff would be left out without vaccination.” As per the guidelines of the school education department, parents’ consent will be a must and schools have to follow the Covid instructions strictly. School education department issued guidelines to open schools. It is mandatory for all teachers and staff to have at least 100% vaccination of a dose. If even a dose of vaccination is not done, then schools will have to do it before opening the classes. In case of ill health of the child, it is necessary to immediately take him to the hospital as well as inform the parents. School principals can take the decision to conduct classes to follow maximum 50% attendance in the class as per availability of the rooms. The accommodation and other facilities, particularly washrooms, must be sanitized and cleaned thoroughly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/schools-invite-parents-to-review-safety-preps/articleshow/85780554.cms||---

From a local newspaper vendor to next-door neighbours, all came to meet him and were happy to find “their boy hale and hearty”. Azhar’s father, Molla Ahmadul Haque, was busy calling his friends and relatives to share the news that his eldest son had finally made it home. “It was a tough time for the family. We spent sleepless nights and were praying for his safety,” said Jahanara Begum, Azhar’s mother. Family friend Nasim Mullick visited the house to meet him as soon as he got the news of his arrival. Azhar’s friend Issac Arron said he was immensely delighted to have him back. “I was in touch with the family and was delighted to see my child safe, fit and fine,” said Noel Watson, a neighbour. For Azhar, it was an emotional moment. He was back at his home with his near ones but his heart was with the countless people of Afghanistan who didn't know their fate. “It feels good to be back home but at the same time I have left behind another home. My guard wished me to return home safely knowing well that he was not safe any more. I could not face him as I was moving out of this crisis with UN help,” said Azhar. The trauma and guilt of witnessing desperation of people while he was privileged to sit in a bullet-proof car, he felt, will haunt him for long. The Kolkata resident who used to work in an NGO on education, women rights, youth empowerment was also worried about his colleagues and is trying to move them out of the country. “We have been able to move some of our colleagues to Italy,” said the LSE alumni who is keeping a track of the situation and is in constant touch with his colleagues there. He feels it is his duty now to support the Afghan community, especially women and children in whatever way he can. “I am planning to organise a fundraiser and would urge the international community to stand by the Afghans in this human catastrophe. I am also supporting them to ensure food security,” said the 32-year old.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/happy-to-be-back-but-feel-sorry-to-leave-2nd-home-afghan-returnee/articleshow/85778018.cms||Dipawali Mitra

Residential buildings were evacuated as waters of the Kali entered the area in Tapovan which houses the NHPC office and its employees and their families. At least three vehicles were also swept away. There were no reports of damage to the 280 megawatt (MW) Dhauliganga Power Station which is located 20 km from the affected site. The cloudburst occurred in Sribagar area of Darchula (Nepal) on Monday. The resultant debris blocked the flow of Kali river — which acts as a natural boundary between India and Nepal — and turned its waters towards the NHPC buildings on the Indian side of the border. Abrar Ahmad, tehsildar of Dharchula, said teams of police, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the revenue officials reached the spot for rescue operations. All families were relocated to another NHPC building in Nigalpani, 7 km from the site. Officials did not divulge details of how many families were relocated. “We are still taking stock of the damage,” Ahmad said. In Nepal, three people were killed following the cloudburst, while two went missing. Two injured people were airlifted to Dhangari for treatment. The cloudburst also swept away a motor bridge, four shops and a ranger’s office.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/cloudburst-in-nepal-sends-muck-across-border-power-corp-office-damaged/articleshow/85775478.cms||Prem Punetha

The hoarding reads, “All dogs and cats entering must be registered on arrival at Goa borders by rail and road.” The hoardings also have a contact number for visitors arriving with pets that are unvaccinated to inform them that “free vaccination will be provided” by the Mission Rabies team if required. “We have put up one at the Keri check-post. We are in the process of erecting more hoardings at check-posts at Patradevi, Keri, Mollem and Canacona on Monday and Tuesday. We are also placing them at the Vasco and the Margao railway stations. The message is going to be posted at the airport as well,” said Mission Rabies director of education, Murugan Appupillai. TOI had reported on June 24 that the Directorate of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services (AHVS) has decided to ensure that the virus doesn’t enter the state through its borders. People, especially tourists, travelling to Goa along with their pets will now have to inform the AHVS about bringing animals along and get them vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hoardings-to-vaccinate-outstation-pets-on-arrival-erected-at-borders/articleshow/85780608.cms||---

In the recently held board meeting of SCML, suggestions arose over paying Rs 10,000 as monthly rent for the beneficiaries for two years. At present, the corporation has offered Rs 5,000 as monthly rent for the beneficiaries of the housing scheme. The residents at Rajaji Nagar who are enlisted for the housing scheme are concerned about shifting to a new location as part of transit accommodation. The civic body has zeroed in on a property owned by a government body adjacent to the site of construction. However, it is estimated that setting up a prefab facility in this place would incur exorbitantly high cost. “Ideally, we would want the beneficiaries to accept a monthly rent of Rs 10,000 or if we are to arrange a transit accommodation close to their existing dwellings, all the beneficiaries will have to agree to that or else the cost factor is so high that it wouldn’t be financially feasible,” said mayor Arya Rajendran. If the corporation settles to pay Rs 10,000 as monthly rent for a housing scheme as part of transit accommodation, it would be the highest amount ever to be paid by the civic body for a transit accommodation. For housing schemes under basic services for urban poor project, monthly rent never exceeded Rs 3,000 per month. The corporation is looking for a political consensus at Rajaji Nagar before a formal meeting is held. CPM district party leadership has already intervened in the issue. An all-party meeting has been scheduled in the coming days following which the corporation will hold a formal meeting with the beneficiaries to get on with the project. The work commencement at Rajaji Nagar was inaugurated in October 2020 by former LSG minister A C Moideen. The project was awarded to a firm in September 2020 and the work was expected to be completed in 24 months. The inability of SCTL to hand over the project site to the firm almost a year after the project was awarded could act against SCTL and civic body in terms of tender conditions. The beneficiaries are sceptical about shifting from their current dwellings and the corporation has offered to enter into formal agreements with each beneficiary. So far, no proposal has been acceptable for the beneficiaries of the housing scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/tough-task-ahead-for-corp-to-end-deadlock-over-project/articleshow/85778105.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena’s Anil Parab faces ED heat, deputy RTO’s premises raided||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday raided the Pune premises of a deputy RTO Bajrang Kharmate, attached to the state transport ministry headed by Shiv Sena’s Anil Parab as part of its probe into the money laundering case against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. There was no clarity on Kharmate’s and Parab’s connection with the Deshmukh money laundering case. The ED had summoned Parab for his statement in the case on Tuesday, but he sought exemption citing prior engagements. Kharmate was twice suspended for his involvement in corrupt practices and one case pertained to his involvement in illegal registration of imported bikes in Pen. In April, former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya wrote a complaint to the state governor demanding an inquiry on a letter he received alleging corruption in postings and transfers of RTO officials. The letter also talked about Kharate’s posting and about Parab for favouring such officers. Parab’s name was not mentioned in the CBI FIR that was registered against Deshmukh and others. Former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked now-dismissed police officer Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from restaurant and bar owners in the city illegally every month for him. The ED has registered the money laundering case based on the CBI FIR against Deshmukh. In April, Waze tried to submit a letter to the special court when he was produced before it by NIA in the case of planting of explosives in a vehicle outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s bungalow and subsequent murder of the vehicle owner. In the letter, Waze alleged Parab allegedly asked him for the collection of money from tainted BMC contractors after threatening them. Parab figured in the Sena versus Narayan Rane row last week when a video of his allegedly instructing cops to take action against Rane went viral. - V V Singh||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-senas-parab-faces-ed-heat-dy-rtos-premises-raided/articleshow/85782627.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal’s vaccine drive on a bull run after August last-week push||KOLKATA: With a steady supply of vaccines in the past few weeks, the state health department has accelerated its inoculation drive by expanding the vaccine coverage. By Monday, 55% plus of the eligible population in Bengal had got at least the one dose of the vaccine. Health officials said if the supply continues, the state can scale up its drive further. According to health department sources, the state government has received 1 crore plus doses in August, of which 42 lakh plus doses arrived in the past one week. In fact, the 16.7 lakh Covishield doses the state got on Sunday has been the largest consignment to arrive in a day since the inception of the immunisation drive. On Monday, too, the state got another shipment of 6.3 lakh Covishield doses. The uninterrupted supply has pushed up the vaccination coverage with the state administering close to 5 lakh doses regularly for about a week. In last week, 5-lakh plus doses were administered on two days. “We are ready to vaccinate as much as we can get. For this, there should be regular and assured supply. This will enable us to plan ahead for 5-6 lakh doses per day. If supply goes up further, we can expand our drive accordingly,” said director of health services Ajay Chakraborty. Around 5.6 lakh jabs were administered on August 27, making it the highest number of shots offered in a day in Bengal. The state also crossed another milestone of crossing 1 crore second dose mark on that day. A total of 2,98.01,167 doses were administered in Bengal as on August 1, among which 59 lakh plus doses were administered to recipients between 18-44 age group. On Monday, this number shot up to around 4 crore (1.1 crore plus second dose) and around 1.7 crore (18-44 age group) . Bengal got a share of little over 85 lakh doses in July. While the 1 crore jabs came to the state’s kitty in August, the vaccine supply is likely to go up in September with the Union health ministry officials assuring about 1.3 crore doses for the coming month. “We can go for specific drives and scale up the vaccination operation. We can administer about 10 lakh doses with the existing facilities and infrastructure. But for this, we need to have that kind of supply,” said a health department official. And with talks of school re-reopening post Durga Puja, the health department has also decided to ensure full vaccine coverage to teachers. “Majority of teachers have got the vaccine shot. But to ensure covering each teacher before school reopens, district inspectors of schools have been asked to collect and compile data of teachers who have not been vaccinated,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. With close to 70% of Kolkata’s eligible population being covered with at least one dose, the health department now wants to give due weightage to other districts. Unlike the first wave, when many districts remained unaffected or only partly affected, the second wave penetrated deep into rural Bengal. Health experts said the districts too need the vaccine protection equally.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/states-vaccine-drive-on-a-bull-run-after-aug-last-week-push/articleshow/85778027.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

TOI reported on August 27 how two RFOs — Kailash Bhumar and Ashish Kokate — had influenced their transfer to get choice posting in Amravati. The Amravati CCF had recommended request transfer of six RFOs, some of which were premature. While the APCCF transferred RFOs Vivek Lad, Yogesh Tapas, and Mahesh Dhandar as proposed, the case of RFO Kailash Bhumar was rejected. Bhumar is posted as RFO at Wadali in Amravati and wanted to get posted with the social forestry department (SFD) in Amravati. He had influenced his transfer by attaching a letter from Prataprao Jadhav, Shiv Sena MP from Buldhana. Another RFO Ashish Kokate, who is with SFD Amravati, wanted posting as RFO Morshi, and his case was recommended by none other than women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur. Thakur’s letter stated that some areas like Nandgaon Peth in Teosa constituency, represented by her, fall in Morshi forest range and she wanted RFO Kokate there to carry out some projects there. However, transfers of Kokate and another RFO Mayud Bhailume have been put on hold. The transfer order issued by APCCF states both will be told about their transfers separately. Kokate is not due for transfer. Moreover, he worked as a territorial RFO in Chandur Railway for four years. As per policy decision by the government on May 22, 2017, an RFO has to spend three-year tenure in each wing — wildlife, social forestry, and territorial. Yet, instead of posting him in the wildlife wing, his case was recommended for territorial RFO again.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/vip-influenced-transfers-of-amt-rfos-in-the-dock/articleshow/85750529.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: With 1 lakh patients in 15 days, e-clinics take load off hospitals||KOLKATA: The mounting pressure on hospitals, which are overwhelmed by the rush of patients both at out- and in-patient facilities, seemed to have eased a bit over the last 15 days with more than 2,000 e-clinics treating more than 1 lakh during this period. Inaugurated by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, e-clinics have also systematised the referral system of patients from primary to tertiary and super specialty facilities. Taking a cue from the success of the telemedicine system for Covid patients, the state health department has converted more than half of Suswasthya Kendras, which used to give rudimentary health advices at the grassroot level, into e-clinics to give people quality healthcare by arranging a video calls between doctors and patients. After checking patients, doctors generate e-prescriptions and medicines are provided at free of cost to them from the e-clinic itself. “The entire programme is being monitored through an online app called ‘Swasthya Ingit’. “The chief minister instructed to take the benefit of telemedicine to the grassroot level. ‘Swasthya Ingit’ is a product of the CM’s vision of taking healthcare to grassroot level,” said health secretary Narayan Swarup Nigam. The state has been divided into a few zones and a zonal hub coordinates with e-clinics personnel and connect patients with the available doctors. “Suppose, most of the doctors in East Midnapore are busy treating patients at hospitals, doctors available at South 24 Parganas can treat the patients of East Midnapore e-clinics. The entire operation is being monitored at the Swasthya Sathi building of the health department headquarters,” said Ravi Ranjan, a joint secretary and in charge of the Swasthya Ingit. In fact, some superspecialist doctors have also treated patients. Currently, 2,313 Suswasthya Kendras were converted to e-clinics. However, the department has plan to convert all 4200 such centres into e-clinics so that more people can reap the benefit of healthcare and wellness at their doorstep, said an official. Apart from easy and early diagnosis of a health issue, a lot of complications and hospitalisation can be avoided. Since the entire operation is in the e-format, a huge amount of health data is getting generated. Through analytics, we can have a clearer picture of the prevalent ailment that can help the government to take remedial measures. Moreover, e-clinics has also systematized the referral method of patients from primary to tertiary and superspeciality facilities. “Now, a patient from the remotest part of Bengal is straight taken to a city hospital like NRS or SSKM. This practice not only puts eases pressure on the limited resources, but also saves patients from suffering unnecessary harassment,” said a doctor of a government hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/with-1l-patients-in-15-days-e-clinics-take-load-off-hosps/articleshow/85778036.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The process will begin with a field survey and mapping of the terrain to determine the number and species of trees that can be planted based on soil, climate, and other parameters. The seed balls will be prepared by the local communities, especially women, which will be dispersed via drones in the targeted areas. Further, the area will be continuously monitored to track the growth of plants.Commenting on the development, Telangana IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao said, “Forests are essential to maintain a clean and habitable environment for human life, and emerging technologies have potential to support afforestation efforts.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/state-to-use-drones-for-afforestation/articleshow/85780667.cms||---

It also extended lockdown restrictions till 6am on September 15. Vinayaka Chaturthi is on September 10. These are part of the restrictions imposed on all religious festivals in TN till September 15. The government also barred people from congregating at churches in Chennai, Velankanni, Nagapattinam and other places for celebration of Mother Mary’s birthday on September 8. In a statement, the government said that the restrictions were being imposed in the wake of an increase in Covid infections after crowding during Bakrid and Onam in Kerala. The government also said that college and school authorities should ensure that students from Kerala have received two doses of anti-Covid vaccine and produce a negative RT-PCR report as classes are going to begin. The statement said that people should restrict the Chaturthi celebrations to their houses and permission would be given to individuals to immerse their idols only in nearby waterbodies. “This permission is only for individuals and not for associations or groups,” said the statement. Idols will not be allowed to be immersed in the sea on Marina beach from Santhome to Napier bridge in Chennai. Individuals are permitted to leave their idols near temples in some areas. Appropriate steps will be taken by the HR & CE department to remove them. Permission will not be given for religious processions, festivals and sports like ‘uriyadi’ in public places. The government has also urged people to maintain social distance, use masks and follow precautions as they shop for essentials for the festivals. It is common for religious associations, residents, youth groups and traders to install Vinayaka idols of different sizes and themes on street corners and carry them in a grand processions for immersion later. Hindu Munnani has planned to install 1.25 lakh Vinayaka idols across the state for the festival. As per the lockdown norms, the government has extended restrictions on religious places and festivals and they will continue as before on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/this-vinayaka-chaturthi-no-public-idols-procession-or-immersion-in-tn/articleshow/85780689.cms||---

The 36-year-old woman, who is divorced, is one of the six accused of murdering their rival Shankar Naik (40) in June 2021 in Raja Naik thanda near Suryapet. She was out on bail but had been staying with her sister in Suryapet instead of returning to Raja Naik thanda fearing reprisal from Naik’s family. She, however, turned up at the hamlet on Saturday to attend a relative’s funeral. “Shankar’s family came to know of the woman’s arrival. They dragged her onto the street from a house and beat her with sticks,” Suryapet rural CI B Vittal Reddy said. The women from Naik’s family tore her clothes and threw chilli powder in her eyes,” the CI added. The accused was thrashed for about half an hour, following which she managed to sneak into the house of Suryapet MPTC Shanta Bai who alerted cops. The woman was later shifted to Suryapet hospital. Based on her complaint, police registered a case under IPC sections relating to outraging the modesty of a woman, criminal intimidation, trespassing and voluntarily causing hurt against 10 accused, including three juveniles. On Monday, five accused women - L Bharathi, B Jyothy, L Padma, L Jyothy and L Sunitha - were arrested. “The arrested accused will be produced before the court for judicial remand. We have launched a search to trace the others,” the CI said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/murder-accused-tribal-woman-thrashed-and-disrobed-5-held/articleshow/85783211.cms||---

The minister said that online public hearing held as part of the SIA evoked good response and people opined about implementing the project without any delay. “Once the final report is submitted, land acquisition procedures will be expedited and the project will be realized. Specially-deputed land acquisition tahsildar of Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board-1 will take over the land for the project. It will be completed within the present fiscal,” the minister said. The project received financial sanction of Rs 279.3 crore for the work and Rs 59.22 crore for land acquisition. Kerala road fund board project management unit, which was constituted for executing KIIFB projects, is the implementing agency. At present, it takes one hour to reach Thiruvananthapuram from Nedumangadu. With the four-lane project becoming a reality, opportunities would open up for commercial and tourism sector, the minister said. As per the project, 7.56 hectares of land in Karakulam, Peroorkada, Aruvikkara, Nedumangadu and Karipoor villages will be acquired for the project. Centre for land and social studies was entrusted with the SIA study in 2020. The project has been dragging on for a while due to lack of funds. The 32nd general body meeting of KIIFB held in 2018 had decided not to release funds for the project then. The executive engineer (PWD roads) had informed that four-laning of Vazhayila-Pazhakutti-Kacherinada 11th stone road would be developed by the national highways authority of India (NHAI) as part of the Thiruvananthapuram-Chenkotta road work.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/sia-report-on-widening-of-road-to-be-ready-this-week/articleshow/85778162.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||HC dismisses plagiarism case against college principal||Chandrapur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court has dismissed plagiarism charges and revoked action taken by Gondwana University against Sardar Patel College principal Dr RP Ingole. An article was published in a student research journal and Dr Ingole was the student’s guide. Gondwana University on February 25, 2019, had served a show-cause notice to Dr Ingole on the basis of a complaint of plagiarism. Later, Institutional Academic Integrity Panel of university investigated the matter and took action against him. Dr Ingole challenged it in high court. Dr Ingole’s counsel advocate BG Kulkarni argued that the committee did not understand the technicalities as per the criteria of the University Grants Commission. Also, the original work from which the student made the complete or partial writing was not included in the inquiry. As a result, the committee’s inquiry does not prove that the student is involved in plagiarism. Hence, the action initiated by Gondwana University does not fit within the framework of the law.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/hc-dismisses-plagiarism-case-against-college-principal/articleshow/85780705.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Hyderabad||Loan app fraud: Banker held by Hyderabad cops for defreezing accounts||HYDERABAD: The manager of an ICICI Bank branch in Kolkata has been arrested for siphoning off Rs 1.18 crore from accounts frozen by Hyderabad police's cyber cell as part of its probe into a loan app fraud. Accused Rakesh Kumar Das allegedly made Rs 36 lakh by way of "commission" for facilitating the fraud, said officials chasing the money trail for months. Das, the manager of ICICI Bank’s Alipore branch, was arrested a few days ago from Kolkata and brought to Hyderabad on a transit warrant. He was remanded in judicial custody on Monday. Assistant commissioner of police (cyber crime) KVM Prasad said a fraudster posing as an SI of Kolkata police had visited ICICI Bank’s Alipore branch in April, carrying a fake letter. The purported letter from the in-charge of the cyber cell at Kolkata police's Lalbazar headquarters directed the bank manager to defreeze seven of the 12 accounts frozen by Hyderabad city police and transfer the money to an SBI account in Hyderabad. Citing the letter, Das transferred Rs 1.18 crore from seven accounts. The SBI account holder, Anand Jannu, was arrested on June 2. He confessed to the police that his alleged associate, Nallamothu Anil Kumar, paid him Rs 1 lakh in commission in return for being allowed to use his bank account. Anil was arrested on June 12. During the interrogation, Anil told investigators that he and another accused, Uttam Chowdhary, transferred Rs 1.18 crore from the SBI account to various bank accounts and withdrew the money. The accused also confessed that he and Chowdhary paid Rs 36 lakh to the bank manager. “Despite knowing that accounts were frozen at Hyderabad police’s behest, the bank manager defreezed them on the basis of a fake letter from Kolkata police. A bank can transfer any amount from an individual’s frozen account only after getting a court order or with the consent of the account holder,” the ACP said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/loan-app-fraud-banker-held-for-defreezing-a/cs/articleshow/85783217.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Visakhapatnam||Covid-19: Andhra Pradesh readies line-up of 708 hospitals to tackle third wave||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh is lining up 708 hospitals for the presumed third wave of Covid-19. At the peak of the second wave, 654 hospitals served Covid-19 patients. Patients can avail treatment at 84 hospitals in Guntur district in the third wave, the highest number of hospitals being readied in any district, followed by East Godavari (81), Krishna (77) and Visakhapatnam (75). Nearly 3,950 paediatric and neonatal beds are being added or converted to at these 708 hospitals based on the assumption that the third wave may hit the kids most. In all, after completion of the ongoing additions and conversions (from general beds to oxygen beds or oxygen beds to ICU beds), these hospitals will have about 60,000 beds. The AP health department is setting up 120 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants at various hospitals across the state. Due to the same, oxygen beds alone will constitute more than 60% of the total beds being prepared for the third wave at these 708 hospitals, apart from the ICU beds. According to the health officials, these plants are being erected at the teaching, district and community hospitals having a bed capacity of 50 and above to cater to 100% ICU beds and about 50% non-ICU beds. All these plants are expected to come into operation by the third week of September. From the initial hypoxia-related complications during the first wave, oxygen management took the centre stage at the peak of the second wave. Learning lessons from the second wave, the state is establishing oxygen plants at all major hospitals with a combined oxygen flow rate 1.07 lakh litres per minute (LPM). Even though there is no clarity on the onset, timing and impact of the third wave, the state seems to be preparing for the worst case scenario. As per an earlier report submitted by the paediatric Covid-19 task force committee, constituted by the health department to guide on the preparation of the third wave, it is anticipated that Andhra Pradesh may witness 18 lakh new infections in the third wave. The AP health department has readied 13 lakh home isolation kits as nearly 90% patients may not require hospitalisation. State Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said that the third wave’s effect on kids is only an assumption. “It is only a general understanding based on the fact that the vaccination is yet to start for the children. From increasing oxygen and ICU beds to roping in more hospitals and establishing oxygen plants, the health department is gearing up to tackle the third wave,” said Dr Rambabu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/state-readies-line-up-of-708-hosps-to-tackle-third-wave/articleshow/85778170.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Jaipur||Team Vasundhara Raje opens office in Jaipur, raises eyebrows||JAIPUR: In a move that may hasten the power struggle within the state BJP unit, the supporters of former chief minister Vasundhara Raje inaugurated the ‘Team Vasundhara Raje Rajasthan’ (TVRR) state office in the city on Monday to garner support within the party and outside to promote her as the chief minister candidate for the 2023 assembly polls. The act by her supporters may spark yet another controversy in the state party unit. The poster inviting people for the inauguration of the office on social media has pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the left and Raje’s mother Vijaya Raje Scindia. This is not the first time that her loyalists had attempted to project her as the sole leader of the masses in the state. Ashok Sharma, the state in-charge of TVRR, said the body’s main objective was to project the two-time CM as the most popular candidate in 2023. “The setting up of the office in the state capital has brought us one step closer to carry forward the political legacy of Vasundhara Raje into the future,” said Sharma. “The contribution of Raje in the development of the state has no parallels and thus it makes her the only undisputed mass leader in the state,” said Sharma. He added that Raje didn’t attend the inaugural since she was in Delhi. Sandeep Verma, vice-president of scheduled caste morcha of TVRR, clarified that it was not a political body while claiming that it to be more like a fan club. He stated that all functionaries associated with TVRR are BJP party workers. “We are all dedicated party workers and raising this demand within the framework of party rules,” Verma said, claiming to be an active party worker. The members of the body informed that they have formed units in all 33 districts and appointed state officials. “Over five lakh people have pledged to work tirelessly to see Raje as our CM,” Sharma said, confident that the BJP would honour the sentiments of its core supporters. The inauguration of the office was a low-key affair with no significant names from the state or local politics attending it. The move has yet again raised eyebrows of the state unit which chose not to react in public. Sources said that the state unit would send a detailed report to the party’s central leaders. A similar controversy had surfaced in January this year when an outfit called ‘Vasundhara Raje Samarthak Rajasthan’, claiming to have the support of several MLAs, promoted her as the next CM. Later in June, Vasundhara Jan Rasoi, promoted by her close aides, didn’t find favour with the state leaders. In both instances, Delhi was called upon to intervene.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/team-raje-opens-office-in-city-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/85780729.cms||Shoeb Khan

Officials said that around 65% of the works have been completed. The twin two lane elevated highway is 2.7-km long starting from CSI Mission Hospital in the north and ending at Technopark Phase III Junction in the south. Each lane of the elevated highway is 10.5-m wide. The major components of this elevated highway are 60 piers (pillars) and as many pier caps (concrete structures on the upper part of a bridge pier designed to distribute concentrated loads evenly over the area of the pier) and concrete slabs and two approach ramps of 250m length on both ends. The officials said that so far they have completed installation of all 60 piers. As many as 49 pier caps and 37 concrete slabs have also been completed. The pier caps and concrete slabs that have been laid so far are on the stretch between Technopark Phase III Junction and Kazhakkoottam Junction. Currently, workers are engaged in the task of shifting two giant gantry cranes that were used to install girders (large iron framework) from this stretch to the second stretch between Kazhakkoottam and CSI Mission Hospital. The giant equipment will be dismantled and the parts will be transported on trucks. Hence, traffic along the service roads along the elevated highway will be restricted on Tuesday and Wednesday in this regard. The elevated highway is a key infrastructure project that is expected to solve traffic woes along the IT corridor of Kazhakkoottam. Works of the elevated highway was affected a few months ago during the second wave of the pandemic. While several of the workforce comprising migrant workers got infected with Covid-19, many others chose to go back to their native places. After the government relaxed lockdown restrictions, the construction firm flew down many labourers and recruited many others to resume the work in full swing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/over-60-work-on-elevated-highway-over/articleshow/85778204.cms||---

Rahul Ahirwar’s calm words don’t give away the pain he has suffered in the last two years. He was 19 years old when he lost a third of his forearms in a factory mishap in Haryana and, during the transplant at KEM Hospital, only one hand could be attached due to complications with the other donor arm. “It would have been good to have both my wrists, but I am glad that I at least got my right hand back,” said Ahirwar, who has started physiotherapy. Ahirwar had got a job in a car manufacturing company in Harayana after finishing his Class XII exams. “On the 15th day of the job, my hands got stuck in the machine,” he said. He returned home to Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh when he heard about KEM Hospital’s plan to start hand transplant. “I came here for the first time in September 2020,” he said. Dr Vinita Puri, who heads KEM Hospital’s plastic surgery department and conducted Ahirwar’s transplant, said the youngster is doing well physically. “The boy’s commitment to get his hand functional is incredible, but he has a long path of recovery that includes staying in Mumbai for at least a year,” Dr Puri said. Ahirwar got the hand when the family of a brain-dead patient in a private hospital agreed to the donation. Dr Puri said Ahirwar will stay in hospital for another few weeks. The MP government has given him an assistance of Rs 5.5 lakh that helped with the transplant and immunosuppression drugs, which cost up to Rs 3 lakh in the first year. The hospital too is helping the family gather funds. Ahirwar said, “We have no resources, but I am sure people will help me. I want to get back to my town and study BA and appear for the civil services exams.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-first-hand-transplant-patient-of-kem-happy-with-even-one-arm/articleshow/85782657.cms||---

The Chinchwad police recently arrested Jetithor and found that he was involved in around 30 cases of burglary in the past three years, stealing valuables worth at least Rs77 lakh. Police said his modus operandi was simple — as he moved around Chinchwad in his mobile cart, he conducted a recce of locked houses. He would then confirm that the houses were locked in the evening, and strike at night. The Chinchwad police had CCTV footage showing Jetithor near the spots, but they could not pick up his trail. A police team led by senior inspector Vishwajeet Khule recently got a tip-off that he was at his native place in Solapur district. “Our team shared the footage with the Solapur police and found that Jetithor had nine cases of burglary registered against him,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. He said the police team took Jetithor into custody from Solapur. During questioning, Jetithor admitted his involvement in the burglaries in Chinchwad. He said that Jetithor even started a moneylending business from the loot he got through burglaries. “Along with gold ornaments and 10 TV sets, we have recovered an SUV, which Jetithor had forcefully acquired from one of his defaulters,” the commissioner said, adding, “We have collectively recovered booty worth Rs 77 lakh.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/chinchwad-police-crack-30-burglaries-with-one-arrest/articleshow/85778228.cms||---

And India Inc is cheering the champions with gusto. When Avani Lekhara won the first ever shooting gold for India in a para-sport, Anand Mahindra jumped in on Twitter to congratulate the monumental athlete. “A week ago, Deepa Malik (another athlete) suggested that we develop SUVs for those with disabilities like the one she uses in Tokyo,” he tweeted. “I requested my colleague Velu (senior VP R Velusamy), who heads development, to rise to that challenge. I’d like to dedicate and gift the first one to Avani Lekhara.” He followed this up with a similar gift for India’s second Paralympic gold medalist, Sumit Antil. He then requested Mahindra chief design officer Pratap Bose to “design another Javelin edition of the XUV700 for this incredible sportsperson”. Mahindra had earlier announced a gift for Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra too.Fellow auto boss Rajeev Chaba, president & MD of MG Motor India, announced something similar. “MG stands for women empowerment,” he said. “We applaud (table tennis silver medalist) Bhavina Patel. It is our honour and privilege to gift her a customised SUV.” Vikram Kirloskar, too, extended support to discus throw silver medalist Yogesh Kathuniya. “What a brilliant debut, congratulations on your silver,” he tweeted. The reason India Inc’s rousing toast to these athletes is interesting because it comes on the back of some inclusive changes in supporting para-sports. Lekhara, for instance, has been supported under the Para Champions Programme backed by two brands — IndusInd Bank and Sony Pictures Films India. Hero MotoSports, too, has an ongoing association with the Paralympic Committee of India. Apart from medal-gifts and sponsorships, Paralympians are also being offered brand ambassador roles. Brand consultant, Harish Bijoor explained opting for a para-sports star may actually make a great deal of sense. “We live in an era which believes in storytelling and there are very strong stories that these athletes bring to the party,” he said. “Brands need to be bold to take that story to the market.” M&M executive director Rajesh Jejurikar agreed, “We admire the spirit of our Paralympians, they overcome all adversity to Rise,” he said, quoting the group’s value mantra. MG Motor has roped in Paralympian athlete and Khel Ratna awardee Malik to be the voice for the new SUV MG Astor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/paralympians-rake-in-medals-india-inc-showers-them-with-rewards/articleshow/85780761.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Rai had used a single-bore breech-loaidng (SBBL) gun to kill the buffalo. Rai was upset over the stray buffalo as it was damaging his plantation. To get rid of it, he told the other accused to kill it and sell its meat. It is learnt the six accused had made a failed attempt to capture the buffalo about three days ago. They borrowed an unlicenced weapon from a person in Kodagu and fired two rounds on the buffalo, tied it with ropes and slit its neck. They were planning to slaughter the animal and sell its meat. But by then, locals rushed to the spot on hearing the firing sound, it is learnt. Police have seized a goods vehicle, scooter, SBBL gun, machete, live rounds, rope, a wooden piece used to cut meat and plastic bags. A case has been booked under the various provisions of IPC, Arms Act and Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Act. Painter held under Pocso Act The city police have arrested a painter under various provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Raviraj, 31, a painter, has been accused of misbehaving with a 12-year-old girl. He allegedly touched her inappropriately when she was walking around 12 noon on Monday.

---||Goa||Goa: Verem’s rich tisreo crop deepens Nerul’s pain||SALIGAO: A bumper tisreo (clams) crop lasting several months in Verem has prompted neighbouring Nerul villagers to lament how their beach side - a hotspot for green mussels and other shellfish - is now almost bare of the delicacies. Verem villagers tap the resource from around summer time till mid-August, though the quantum has slightly reduced now. “This year, we got a very good catch of tisreo just like last year, and we are hopeful of getting a good crop next year as well,” said a villager. A few of them even visited the riverside locality in Verem to harvest some for themselves. But locals sent them away, reminding them of similar treatment they faced at Nerul. Till a few years back, Nerul on the confluence of the sea and river was a rich habitat for green mussels (xinnanneo). The fishermen provided a good supply at the dinner table for many in Bardez and beyond. But now hardly a few handful are found in what they think is a ruined habitat. Even the annual tisreachem fest - litany and get-together at the Holy Cross as a celebration of the crop - has stopped, also due to pandemic. Some blame the large-scale water sports activity and boating facilities on the waterfront. “Many people would come from all over Bardez to Nerul, especially for green mussels and also clams which they relished very much. But they are missing now,” said a local Eric Godinho. The locals blame pollution for adverse impact on their habitat. “The oil spillage from motorised boats could have disturbed breeding of clamps and mussels,” said Bonny Pereira, a local resident said. Experts, however, said that a few factors may have impacted the breeding. “A major reason is overexploitation of fish. This affects regular cycles of their life history and even next generations undergo fluctuations, which are unpredictable. They just don’t die (of pollution) but accumulate toxins, which get in the food chain,” an ecologist said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/verems-rich-tisreo-crop-deepens-neruls-pain/articleshow/85780769.cms||---

The chowk provides passage to vehicles headed to Katraj-Kondhwa bypass, Katraj Chowk, Bapdeo ghat, Saswad, Undri and Kondhwa. “A traffic assessment has revealed that trucks, containers, tankers and multi-axel vehicles plying between Katraj and Undri were encountering problems while ascending the slope at the chowk,” said assistant inspector Lekhaji Shinde from the Kondhwa traffic police on Monday. “We decided to conduct an experiment on a trial basis on three Saturdays to increase signal timings to understand traffic scenario. We conducted our first experiment on August 28 and granted 90 and 45 seconds of time for vehicles plying between Katraj and Undri, and Bapdeo ghat and Kondhwa between 9am and 11pm,” Shinde said. He said the experiment would continue on the next two Saturdays. “On the basis of the outcome of our findings, we will take a call on finalising the signal timings,” Shinde said. He said the traffic police have also initiated a proposal to shift an MSEDCL generator from the chowk. Activist Kailash Kamthe said, “Traffic can be decongested if the PMC takes a call to expedite the land acquisition process to widen the bypass between Khadi Machine and Katraj chowks.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/increased-signal-timings-at-khadi-machine-chowk/articleshow/85778260.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Delhi||Moving with times: Mohalla clinics made from containers in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has come up with its first modular and portable mohalla clinics, which are factory-made. There are plans to create more such clinics in the future. The first two such clinics in Shakur Basti in Rani Bagh of north Delhi are airconditioned and have a sleek look with partial glass walls. “We have made more than 500 mohalla clinics and two such modular ones have come from a factory. This is a new concept,” health minister Satyendar Jain said during his visit on Sunday. The modular clinics have been built inside shipping containers, making it easier for them to be installed at a certain location compared with constructing a mohalla clinic. These would also be easier to install in congested residential areas. “Visited the construction site of 2 new mohalla clinics at Shakurbasti. These clinics have been set up in portable containers. Such clinics are easy to set up & transport in cluster areas like jhuggi-bastis & narrow streets where healthcare infrastructure is less accessible,” Jain tweeted after his visit. He further tweeted: “We promised to give a quality healthcare system to Delhiites and when we say quality healthcare, this is what we mean by it. This is just the beginning. Delhi govt is preparing more such projects to revolutionise the healthcare system.” Earlier this month, while inaugurating a mohalla clinic at Tis Hazari Courts complex, Jain had said, “Delhi government is constantly working to strengthen the primary healthcare system.” He added that the Kejriwal government had done what it said. “Delhi government is also working for lawyers and formulating policies for them. Delhi Bar Association will be given the status of the world’s largest bar association. We are working to strengthen Delhi’s primary healthcare system and this new mohalla clinic will give it a big boost,” Jain had said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/moving-with-times-mohalla-clinics-made-from-containers/articleshow/85780796.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||We will distribute Nizam’s assets, says Telangana BJP chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar||HYDERABAD: Telangana BJP chief and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar stoked a fresh controversy on Monday, saying that if his party was voted to power in the state, properties belonging to the erstwhile Nizam of Hyderabad would be taken over and distributed among the people. Addressing a gathering at Aare Mysamma temple crossroads on the third day of his ongoing Praja Sangrama Yatra, Sanjay said: “All of the Nizam’s properties belong to us. We will take over the properties and give them back to the people.” He claimed that some people had encroached upon the lands of ordinary people and publicised them as the Nizam’s properties. Bandi Sanjay during Praja Sangrama Yatra in Langar Houz on MondaySources, however, told TOI that there was nothing like “Nizam’s properties” any more as all that was owned by the last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, had already been converted into government properties. These include the present Raj Bhavan, the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) campus and others. At the same time, Mukarram Jah, the titular Nizam of Hyderabad, owns Chiran Palace (within KBR Park), King Kothi Palace, Purani Haveli, Chowmohalla Palace, and Falaknuma Palace. His brother, Muffakham Jah, owns the Chamlijah Palace. The Nizam trust properties, including NIMS Hospital land, are waqf properties. Sanjay Kumar has taken a strong Hindutva line in all his speeches so far. Starting his yatra on Saturday, he had said that his party would not allow people with a ‘Talibani mindset’ to rule in Hyderabad. The AIMIM and Asaduddin Owaisi have been the main targets of his barbs, along with chief minister K Chanadrasekhar Rao. Targeting the AIMIM and the TRS again on Monday, he said both parties have an ‘unholy’ alliance. “We will chase away the AIMIM, which is attempting to cash in on the12% support of the minority community,” he said. “We are fighting for 80% of the population, while the TRS and Congress are accusing us of being a communal party in a bid to get votes from minority communities. If the sentiments of the majority population are harmed, we will not hesitate to go to any length to safeguard them,” he said. He claimed that the BJP was brave enough to unveil the saffron flag at any place. BJP volunteers have the ability to enter AIMIM’s stronghold, the Old City, but the ruling TRS does not have the wherewithal. “CM K Chandrasekhar Rao has to take permission from AIMIM to enter the Old City,” he taunted. He said BJP was strongly opposing the sale of land parcels belonging to Dalits in Kokapet. Earlier, addressing a press conference, Sanjay had said the TRS government was refusing to provide the Centre with a list of beneficiaries and the number of 2BHK units built for the underprivileged. “Despite repeated requests from the Centre to submit the list, the state is yet to do so. The Centre has sanctioned about two lakh dwellings to the state,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/we-will-distribute-nizams-assets-bandi/articleshow/85783224.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

In a letter to Thackeray, Shaikh who is guardian minister form Mumbai city, demanded a study by either IIT-Bombay or VJTI on feasibility of skywalks and asked them to suggest if the city really needs skywalks. TimesViewThe suggestion to stay and review skywalks in Mumbai is welcome. Several skywalks in Mumbai have been declared dilapidated and dismantled. Many of those still standing are rarely used by pedestrians. BMC must spend such huge sums on skywalks only after proper planning so that they don’t turn into white elephants. BMC must review its skywalk projects.Shaikh said skywalks were being built without planning or thought. “As we know from past experiences, these skywalks will turn into white elephants, like many skywalks in Mumbai which people rarely use. I urge you to immediately direct BMC and MMRDA to stay and review proposed and ongoing skywalk projects. A special panel led by an IIT-B or VJTI professor and an additional chief secretary (urban development) must be appointed to see if skywalks are required,” Shaikh wrote. After massive protests by residents and shopkeepers led by Shaikh, suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray recently stayed a BMC plan to construct a skywalk across Poddar Road in Malad (E). This is the second skywalk project against which residents have protested. Earlier BMC’s plan to construct a Rs 91-crore skywalk in Borivli (E) was opposed. Shaikh said MMRDA has constructed 23 skywalks in the city. It spent around Rs 700 crore on constructing and annual maintenance was around Rs 2.5 crore. “BMC is building skywalks where they are not needed despite opposition from residents, shopkeepers and elected representatives. Most skywalks turn into dens for drug peddlers and anti-social elements,” Shaikh said. “Skywalks are becoming a symbol of poor planning and waste of public money,” Shaikh added. BMC also cleared a proposal to construct a Rs 20-crore skywalk in Kurla (W), and has proposed one from Taximen’s Colony to Shrikrishna Chowk, claiming it will give relief to pedestrians.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-congress-min-urges-cm-to-stay-review-skywalk-projects/articleshow/85782665.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The Human Hair and Hair Products Manufacturers and Exporters Association of India has also sought increased vigilance by enforcement agencies at Guwahati station, which is a gateway for smuggling. “There is a need for increased coordination across departments such as DRI, ED, DGFT, customs, Plastics Export Promotion Council and a task force must be created to complete investigations. Assam Rifles and other police forces should be made aware of the smuggling. Raw hair export, like rough diamonds, has to be prohibited. An 8% incentive should be given on finished products,” said association president Benjamin Cherian during a recent discussion with the Centre. Pointing out that China has 8% export incentive on finished products, the association said that Chinese are circumventing all taxes by smuggling via Myanmar, Bangladesh. “Indian manufacturers are not allowed into the trade shows for Koreans & Chinese. Chinese even have access to North Korean jail labour for their high-value wigs,” Cherian said. In Myanmar, smugglers can afford to buy at a higher price and sell lower as the proceeds are used to smuggle gold, gems and narcotics. “While hair smugglers in Myanmar use child labour and pay them a pittance, their Indian suppliers under invoice the goods and also evade almost all taxes. But genuine Indian manufacturers have to pay through bank accounts and file GST returns,” said Cherian It has been estimated that around 4.1 lakh people have lost jobs in the human hair processing industry in the country due to smuggling. The total estimated value of smuggled goods as per the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics is over Rs 8,000 crore per annum. “We believe it is much more than that based on the latest seizures. Smugglers were adding semi-processed human hair and classified it as raw human hair,” Cherian said in his complaint to ED.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ban-raw-human-hair-export-to-end-smuggling-demands-industry/articleshow/85780773.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Khichan bird haven faces water crisis due to erratic monsoon||JAIPUR: The Khichan bird sanctuary is facing a shortage of water, which is crucial to sustain this aquatic habitat where demoiselle cranes come in thousands every year. An alternative system (pipeline ) to bring water to Vijay Sagar pond from 1.5km away has been put in place. However, it will take 15 more days to artificially replenish the waterholes. Seva Ram Mali, an avid bird lover and caretaker of the area said, “The first batch of demoiselle cranes have arrived this season. However, due to less water, only one has come to the pond. I witnessed around 200 cranes in the region on August 26.” By the end of October, the number of these visitors is expected to swell to 30,000 or so. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) member Dau Lal Bohra said, “Khichan is the only place in the world where people can feed these birds artificially. This is the major attraction for bird lovers across the globe. The state government should keep a back up plan to conserve the water bodies, otherwise these cranes will fly to Gujarat.” In 2017, a division bench issued directives to the state government for necessary arrangements for the migratory birds in Khichan village in Phalodi tehsil. Earlier, the high court had also asked the government to shift high tension lines passing over feeding places for these birds. Following the court’s instructions, a committee had gone for inspection of the site and submitted its report with some suggestions. The state government, through the chief secretary, had assured the court of implementing most of the suggestions. Around 3000 square metres of land was allotted for the bird’s feeding place. Three waterbodies was also proposed to be constructed while a 400-bigha land would also be identified across the road. Mali said, “The PHED had to connect these waterbodies with a canal. However, nothing has been done till date and situation is getting grimmer every year.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/khichan-bird-haven-faces-water-crisis-due-to-erratic-monsoon/articleshow/85780831.cms||---

Several villages in Bijnor district are particularly at risk and a dozen villages have been cut off from its district headquarters. Owing to incessant rains in Uttarakhand, around 94,000 cusec of water has been flowing out of the hill state making it almost impossible for farmers to procure fodder and also save most of their crops. For years, villagers have been demanding a more secure embankment to prevent soil erosion, but no action has been taken by the local authorities. Now, several villages are facing the risk of massive soil erosion. For instance, at Fatehpur Sabhachand, "a school wall is on the verge of collapse as the river has entered deep into the village", said locals. At least 25 villages - Daibalgarh, Gauspur, Kauharpur, Rawali and Brahmpuri, among others - are under imminent threat. And farmers whose fields lie along the river banks fear that in the coming days, they will see more destruction of their farmlands. Shravan Kumar of Rawali village said, “Our existence is at risk. The Ganga has been rising for the past few days. We have been demanding construction of an embankment for many years now." Sonu Kumar, a resident of Fatehpur village, said, "The strong river current is eroding away our farmland. This time the river has entered populated areas. In fact, it has reached near the primary school. If land erosion is not stopped, it will wash away the school." The resident added, "Besides, villagers are unable to carry fodder from their fields as they are located on the other side of the river. It is very risky now." Villagers told TOI that around seven villages in Bijnor district have lost their existence in the past two decades. Farmers are also suffering huge losses every year. On Monday, Piyush Baliyan, a junior engineer at the irrigation department, said, “The Ganga is flowing with 94,000 cusecs of water in Bijnor. Three days ago, it recorded 1.5 lakh cusecs. When water recedes, land erosion increases." In addition, Malan, a tributary of Ganga, is also swelling, cutting off a dozen villages, locals added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/swollen-ganga-enters-farms-saving-crops-procuring-cattle-fodder-now-a-challenge/articleshow/85775926.cms||Harveer Dabas

The district features several scenic spots including Nelapattu bird sanctuary, Irakam Island near Sriharikota, BV Palem port area, and Venadu dargah. Forest department is also keen to scale up facilities in Nelapattu bird sanctuary to attract international tourists. Nelapattu is home to migrant birds from different countries. About 153 species of birds are reportedly visiting Nelapattu during July-January. The fact that the sanctuary is just 3km away from the National Highway makes it a big draw among young adventure tourists travelling on bikes from Bengaluru and Chennai. The Pulicat lake, the second biggest brackish water lake in India. However, nearly 40 per cent of the lake has dried up due to the failure of the administration in taking up dredging at estuaries of ports. The state government is planning to take up dredging to give fresh life to the lake and attract tourists. The waterfalls at Ubbalamadugu village in Buchinaidu Kandrika mandal is also luring tourists from neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Ubbalamadugu waterfalls and neighbouring green forest cover have become the biggest attraction for the tourists who want to keep away from crowded tourist hubs. Forest department has already set up a recreation centre and play area for children on the beachfront at Atakani Tippa village. Atakani Tippa is located between Sriharikota and Sullurpet and acts as scientific centre for Pulicat lake. “We have sent proposals for the development of Atakani Tippa, Venadu, Irakam Island, Nelapattu and Ubbalamadugu as tourism spots.

---||Delhi||Another life snatched as lack of clear law continues to cost Delhi||NEW DELHI: A woman fell victim to chain snatchers in outer Delhi's Mangolpuri on Raksha Bandhan on August 22. Severely injured after being dragged by the snatchers when resisting them, the 38-year-old died of her injuries on Friday. Police were able to trace and arrest the two men involved and charged them with snatching though the initial FIR had been registered for an accident. Police thought the woman had been in an accident after receiving a call from Sanjay Gandhi Hospital around 11.25am on August 22 about admitting a woman with head injuries. A man named Ankur had noticed her prone on the main road near D Block, Mangolpuri and had taken her to hospital. TimesViewThe word, ‘snatching’ gives the impression of it being a petty crime. This is no longer true. Often, such crimes are violent, a few ending in death. This is an old crime in a new violent avatar. The law should recognise this change. It should to be re-categorised and the punishment for it needs to be enhanced.A police officer said, “No eyewitness could be located. The injuries appeared to be like those sustained in a car accident. But when police teams tracked the route from Rithala metro station and analysed the footage from 127 CCTV cameras, they saw two men on a blue-black Pulsar motorcycle following the e-rickshaw that the woman had taken from the metro station.” Following up on this, the cops interrogated 200 e-rickshaw drivers and identified the one used by the woman. Its driver, Rahul, then revealed that two men on a motorbike had tried to rob the woman of her handbag, but she had held on to it. When she continued resisting despite their threats, they yanked her off the three-wheeler and dragged her down the road. The woman was identified as Uma Patwal of Chhatarpur and her family was traced. The family confirmed that a purse, mobile phone and some other articles belonging to Patwal were missing. They said she was going to Sultanpur to meet her brother there to tie a rakhi. Meanwhile, the cops identified Paras Hooda as one of the men involved and apprehended him on August 26. He led the cops to his associate, Mahesh. Police seized the bike used in the commission of the crime and recovered the robbed items. Hooda, 35, is a resident of Sultanpuri and is involved in 12 previous cases of theft and snatchings. Mahesh, 21, a resident of Begampur near Rohini, works as a delivery executive with an e-commerce company. On the day of the incident, Hooda was at the controls and Mahesh snatched the bag from Patwal. The incident again proves why Delhi needs to have a dedicated and a more stringent law on snatchings. After a similar loss of lives during snatchings in February and March, TOI highlighted how there was no specific provision in the Indian Penal Code to deal with snatchings. Delhi Police has broached the issue with the lieutenant governor and the Union home ministry. IN 2017-18, the cops proposed a new provision to deal with snatching, but couldn’t get the necessary approvals. In Delhi, snatchers are currently booked under sections 379 (theft) and 356 (assault or criminal force during theft). The maximum punishment under the first section is three years and under the second, two years. In Haryana, the additional Section 379A has made snatching punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than five years which may extend to 10 years and a fine of Rs 25,000, while Section 379B provides for a rigorous imprisonment not less than 10 years extendable to 14 years and fine of Rs 25,000.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/another-life-snatched-as-lack-of-clear-law-continues-to-cost-delhi/articleshow/85780867.cms||---

As it was a government holiday due to Krishna Jayanthi, the footfall was lower than expected as several vials had to be returned, officials said. “On normal days, 5,000 people get the jab. On Monday it was close to 9,000. People must come forward to take the jab,” corporation commissioner P M N Mujibur Rahuman said.The civic body is prepared to vaccinate at least 10,000 people per day, he added. On Tuesday, vaccination camps will be held at 25 locations including SIT College, Ariyamangalam, Kurinji College, EB road, Cauvery College, Annamalai Nagar, KAPV School, Thillai Nagar, Srimad Andavan College, Srirangam, and Orchard school in KK Nagar.

The expense in maintaining the public parks, many came up recently, has put the civic body in a fix as the maintenance cost of the parks has increased from Rs 6.86 lakh in 2017-18 financial year to Rs 50 lakh in 2020-2021 and set to touch Rs 1 crore in the current year.Trichy city had only 24 public parks until 2017. However, in the past three years, at least 30 new public parks were set up by the civic body. While 12 public parks were established under the Amrut scheme, around 16 were established under the smart cities mission. Several localities have more than one park. While green space is important, the civic body failed to evolve a sustainable model to maintain the public space and is drawing criticism from residents over the poor upkeep of the parks.During the lockdown, many of the parks remained shut and lost their sheen. “Developing green space is fine but those should be maintained properly. Mahalakshmi Nagar public park is ruined,” Balaji Uthira Kumar, a resident of Palpannai, said. While parks were reopened after relaxations, the civic body is aware that the maintenance and repair works will cost it a fortune.This apart, the civic body has also opened around 30 open-air gyms and decorative fountains on traffic islands in at least six spots, all requiring a significant sum for monthly maintenance including electricity bills. Overall, the civic body invested Rs 14 crore in the 2019- 2020 financial year in the parks, while it was Rs 13 crore in the previous year. Such a huge investment has put the civic body in deep trouble. It is getting a revenue of only Rs 4 lakh from the parks. “We will find a sustainable way to maintain the public parks and green space. A tender has been floated to maintain public parks in Ponmalai zone, repair works will be taken up at the earliest,” a corporation official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/maintenance-of-public-parks-becomes-dearer-as-fund-crunch-hits-trichy-corpn/articleshow/85782711.cms||Deepak Karthik

The move has evoked a mixed response among residents who have questioned the civic body for abandoning the parks all of a sudden citing fund crunch.“Not all residents’ associations are capable of maintaining public parks. Instead of completely transferring the responsibility to residents, the civic body can collaborate with the residents to maintain the green space,” K P Rangaprasad, joint secretary of Satta Panchayat Iyakkam, said.While interested RWAs can approach the civic body to support the maintenance of the parks, the civic body is also open to giving away advertisement rights in public parks to private companies for a price. Trichy Corporation sources said that Royal Road Park near the Central bus stand is being maintained in such a way. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/plan-to-rope-in-rwas-to-take-care-of-parks/articleshow/85782714.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Mumbai||In third list, humanities cut-offs barely dip in top colleges, BMS, BAF over 90%||Mumbai: Cut-offs in humanities dipped only marginally in top-rung city colleges in the third merit list released on Monday, bringing little relief to aspirants. For self-financed courses such as BMS, BMM and BAF at these colleges, cut-offs stayed above 90% and, in some, even above 95%. Many of these colleges do not expect a fourth list in sought-after courses. In fact, students were disappointed as some of these courses did not even see a third list. At NM College, BCom (accounting and finance) or BAF saw a cut-off at 97.3% in the first list, which only dropped to 96.6% in the third, making it difficult for students even with 95% to secure admission. There was no third merit list at the college for BMS and plain BCom. Principal Parag Ajgaonkar said students are preferring self-financed courses over BCom. “While these self-financed courses are considered as employment-oriented, BCom syllabus has not been upgraded for some time, with a few exceptions in autonomous colleges,” he said. Ramnarain Ruia College did not have a third list for their BSc (computer science) but the ones for BA, BSc (biotechnology) and BMM saw a marginal drop in cut-offs. For BA, the cut-offs at the college remained above 94% even in the third list, leaving little scope for 90%-plus arts’ aspirants. “We may have a fourth list for some courses, if there is withdrawal of admissions,” said principal Anushree Lokur. The college plans an orientation programme for the new session on September 1 and start classes in a day or two. HR And KC colleges, which are now part of HSNC University, are following a different admission schedule. Their second list was released on August 26 and cut-offs at both the colleges dropped only a little. St Xavier’s College did not have a third list for their BSc programme while BA admissions closed after the first list. At Podar College, cut-offs for BMS and BCom only dropped a little in the third list and stayed above 95% for commerce students. Cut-offs for all courses at Jai Hind was not released till late night. Mithibai College did not have a third list for BA and BMS and BMM had cut-offs above 94-95%. Traditional science courses saw cut-offs drop across colleges and many expect a further dip once NEET and JEE results are out. Courses such as biotechnology and computer science, though, have managed to attract high scorers. As arts’ seats are fewer after in-house admissions, several students are unable to get a college of choice. For commerce, though, despite more seats, many colleges have seen higher cut-offs even in the third list as there is more rush.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/in-third-list-humanities-cut-offs-barely-dip-in-top-colleges-bms-baf-over-90/articleshow/85780355.cms||Yogita Rao

One other youth who was part of the group sustained grievous injuries and is undergoing treatment at a private hospital at Kolencherry. The family which met with the accident hails from Purappuzha in Idukki. The deceased were identified as Vishnu Babu, 26, son of Babu, Kunnel (H), Purappuzha; his younger brother Arun, 23 and Adithyan, 24, son of Rajendran, Mukkilikkattil (H), Purappuzha. Adthiyan’s brother Amarnath, 20, is admitted to MOSC Medical Mission Hospital, Kolencherry. Police said Arun and Vishnu were first cousins of Adithyan and Amarnath. The youth’s uncle and other members of the family were following the car, which met with the accident, in an SUV. The truck was on the way to Wadakkanchery. It was laden with an earthmover and was coming from Punalur. The family was on their way to Thodupuzha. “It seems like the vehicle went out of control and entered the lane on the right. It then rammed head-on with the truck coming through the other lane. Although, fire force, police and local residents carried out a rescue operation, the life of the three youths couldn’t be saved,” said a source with the Muvattupuzha police. Police suspect that the driver of the vehicle could have dozed off, making the vehicle go out of control. “We have registered a case of motor occurrence as prima facie it seems like the driver of the truck was not at fault. The position in which the vehicles were found and statements given by witnesses suggest the possibility of the car driver dozing off. We will conduct an investigation to confirm our initial findings,” said a senior officer with Muvattupuzha police. Bodies of the deceased were handed over to relatives after an autopsy on Monday. Police said that the truck involved was not released as a forensic team and motor vehicle officials will be collecting evidence from the spot on Tuesday. Meanwhile, hospital sources said that Amarnath was in critical condition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/3-youths-of-a-family-killed-as-car-rams-truck-head-on/articleshow/85778511.cms||---

AAP has also jumped onto the bandwagon to criticise the state government over Devasthanam board saying that the ruling party has "ruined the thousand of years old traditions with the formation of the board". "AAP has been against the Devasthanam board since the beginning. The party will revoke the decision of its formation if voted to power," said Colonel Ajay Kothiyal (Retd), who is party's CM candidate in Uttarakhand. He further said the BJP government in Uttarakhand has turned a blind eye towards the ongoing protests by the priests of Char Dham shrines against the board. According to Kothiyal, the government did not take the old rituals and customs into consideration while forming the board, adding, "They imposed the decision on the priests and temple committees." AAP alleged that the government, through the Devasthanam board, is trying to tighten the legal noose on the religious beliefs and traditions of Devbhoomi. Notably, priests and temple committee members of Char Dham shrines have intensified their protest against the board, constituted by the state government in 2019. A priest from Kedarnath shrine, Acharya Santosh Trivedi, even wrote a letter, on August 11, in blood to PM Narendra Modi demanding the immediate scrapping of the Char Dham Devasthanam Board. The Char Dham temple priests, who have been protesting against the board since June 12 this year, are blaming the government for "delaying tactics". The government, on the other hand, has said that a committee has been formed to look into the matter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/will-dissolve-devasthanam-board-if-voted-to-power-says-aap/articleshow/85775939.cms||Gaurav Talwar

With Rs 5,925 per quintal being fixed for 27.5-28.5mm long staple, farmers got between Rs 6,200 and 6,400 per quintal. Cotton season starts on September 1 but the Cotton Corporation of India normally enters the market after October 1, leaving private traders or ginners to make purchases for nearly a month. Against state agriculture department’s target of sowing cotton in 3.25 lakh hectares, the crop was sown in 3.04 lakh hectares in Punjab. In the previous cotton sowing season, there was big mismatch in figures in Punjab, as initially the state government claimed that the crop was sown in 5 lakh hectares and later claimed that as per actual measurement it was sown in 2.51 lakh hectares. The CCI website still shows 5 lakh hectare cotton sowing in Punjab. Mehta village farmer Baldev Singh said he had brought cotton from first picking and sold it for Rs 6,325 per quintal. “I am happy to get this price, which is much above the MSP,” he said. Another farmer Shankar Singh from Katar Singh Wala village had brought about a quintal and sold it for Rs 6,250. Commission agent Anil Aggarwal said it was the firsty day of cotton arrival in mandi and rates quoted by traders were much higher than the MSP. Actual price will be known when cotton starts arriving in large quantities, he said. Bathinda market committee secretary Gurwinder Singh told TOI that 19 quintal cotton arrived on the first day on Monday. “We hope the arrivals to pick in mid-September, when the growers are expected to start the picking in big way,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/cotton-arrivals-begin-in-bathinda-mandi/articleshow/85780912.cms||Neel Kamal

The GMC plans to spend Rs 40 crore on the city’s drainage system. It got a survey done to identify spots where the waterlogging problems were most acute.“On August 21, Ghaziabad recorded above 52mm of rainfall, which threw life out of gear,” said a GMC official. “Drains were choked and the sewage water spilled onto the roads, disrupting normal life and traffic.” “As a part of our preparations, we had de-silted drains across the city. Even then, waterlogging was reported from many parts of the city. A team was formed to identify areas, which were worst-affected,” added the official. A group of 39 officials surveyed the city and identified 13 spots. These included New Bus Adda to Patel Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Ramte Ram Road, old bus stand, Navyug Market, Lohiya Nagar, Seemant Vihar (Kaushambi), Brij Vihar, Mohan Nagar, Apsara Border, Rajendra Nagar, Pandav Nagar, Karpuripuram and Govindpuram.“A proposal for the revamp has been sent to the state government for its approval,” said the official.In Ghaziabad, the major drains include Jwala, Arthala, Kaila Bhatta, Indirapuram, Dasna, Pratav Vihar, Karheda and Hindon Vihar. “There are ten major drains in Ghaziabad that need annual de-siltation, but during monsoon or incessant rains, the drains get choked as effluents and civic waste find their way into them and limit their storage capacities. Our work will include removing encroachments of drains,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/gmc-to-spend-rs-40cr-to-unclog-its-drains/articleshow/85782728.cms||Abhijay Jha

An amount of Rs 25 lakh has been sanctioned for it. Officials said GIMS gets a large number of newborn patients from across western UP and the unit will help provide critical care to them.  “Around 1,200 deliveries are recorded every year at the obstetrics department of GIMS and 8-10% of babies need resuscitation and special care. Apart from that, there are several deliveries that happen outside hospitals and the babies are later brought to the institute for intensive care. The SNCU will improve critical care facilities for the newborns and help reduce the mortality rate,” said Brigadier (retired) Dr Rakesh Gupta, the director, GIMS. The Greater Noida facility is an autonomous institute established by the state government and it offers undergraduate and post graduate courses in paediatrics. Gupta added that it has adequate space and infrastructure to set up the SNCU. Currently, Child PGI is the only government establishment in the district with Newborn Intensive Care Unit NICU facility. Five private hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar have such wards as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/gims-to-get-newborn-care-unit-rs-25-lakh-sanctioned/articleshow/85782734.cms||---

Justice Prathiba M Singh suggested that the entire process of clearing of lawyers’ bills needs to improve and timelines are required to be fixed, failing which the government ought to pay interest. “Considering that the counsels for Delhi government are rendering regular assistance to the courts across the city of Delhi, laying out a timeline for payment of their bills is extremely crucial for their continued and efficient services,” the court said while hearing a plea in this regard. It also directed the additional chief secretary of Delhi government to appear before the court on September 14 to apprise it of further steps to streamline the process. Appearing for the government, a senior officer from the law department told the court that since clearing the bills of lawyers involves coordination between various departments, the additional chief secretary has now been given this responsibility. He also submitted that services of National Informatics Centre are being availed of by the Delhi government to create a Single Window System for clearance of these bills. However, when the high court sought to know how long this would take, the officer submitted that manpower has to be deputed for the software to be prepared on the basis of inputs given by various departments and secondly, the software has to be made operational. The department said it could take six to eight months for making the software operational.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-timeframe-needed-to-clear-bills-of-delhi-govts-lawyers/articleshow/85780963.cms||---

Police have formed teams to arrest the criminals. The incident was captured on a CCTV camera installed at one of the houses in the locality and the police are using the footage, which was widely circulated on Twitter on Monday, to trace the snatcher. An FIR has been filed in connection with the incident. According to police, the incident took place on August 25. The victim, Bala Singh, was on her way back home from a bank after withdrawing around Rs 2.5 lakh. “She had put the withdrawn money in a bag and hung it from her shoulder. Three boys on a bike followed her and one of them got down from bike and started walking next to her,” a police officer said. After walking a few steps, he tried to snatch her bag. According to the footage, the woman resisted and tried to get away. In the melee, the snatcher pinned her on to the ground. The footage shows that the woman put up a brave fight and kicked the snatcher away once. Some bundles of notes fell on the road and in the drain of the lane. The snatcher was seen grappling with the woman to pick up the money and was able to take one of the bundles. “A video is getting viral in which one boy is seen snatching a bag from a lady. A case has been registered and CCTV footage has been analysed. Few visuals of one boy have been obtained.

---||Kolkata||Suman Sufal Bangla New Town 30.08.21||Kolkata: The state government’s Suful Bangla stalls which were doing business on the footpaths in New Town for few hours in the morning have been asked not to do so by the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) as the footpaths were getting occupied. Several residents who regularly buy vegetables from the sufal bangla stalls said that the vans were not coming for the last few days. It was communicated to them that since the stalls were occupying the footpaths, they are no longer being allowed to sit on the pavement. “We have held a meeting with the agriculture marketing department officials to discussion the issue. Occupying the footpaths for doing business is not allowed as NKDA has not given any permission to encroach on the footpaths. The Sufal bangla vans can be allowed to do business at the market areas or other places other than the footpaths or roads. They can also enter the gated communities but should not sit on the footpath. There is no problem if the gated housing societies allow them to enter in their premises,” said a NKDA official. A section of residents have questioned as to whereas the government’s Sufal Bangla stalls are not allowed to sit on the pavement, how several road side stalls were still doing business in an unauthorized manner by encroaching the footpath and setting up makeshift stalls. “As for the existing road side stalls which are doing business for quite some time, a rehabilitation plan has been framed for them. About 900 rehabilitation stalls have been set up and we are to invite applications from them very soon for them to shift in the new set up which has been arranged for them,” said a NKDA official. A two storied rehabilitation market is also on the cards in the township where existing hawkers have been planned to be rehabilitated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/suman-sufal-bangla-new-town-30-08-21/articleshow/85778600.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kochi||Kerala: Meeting decides to expedite drinking water projects||KOCHI: A meeting convened by water resources minister Roshy Augustine and industries minister P Rajeeve decided to expedite the work on the already announced projects to address the drinking water issues in Vypeen and Kalamassery assembly constituencies. The meeting held in Kochi on Monday also decided to explore more options to ensure adequate supply of drinking water in these areas. Augustine gave instruction to the officials with the Kerala water authority (KWA) for preparing a comprehensive project for solving drinking water shortage in Vypeen. K N Unnikrishnan, MLA, had submitted a memorandum to the government seeking urgent intervention on the part of KWA for solving the water woes in Vypeen. Similarly, Rajeeve, who represents Kalamassery assembly constituency, had raised the issue of shortcomings in the drinking water supply in the constituency. It was based on the complaints that the water resources minster convened a meeting on Monday. Augustine said that the demand by Vypeen residents deserves special attention as it is an area which is surrounded by water, still lacking adequate potable water. “The work on the storage tanks being constructed at Njarackal, Malippuram and Murikkumpadam in Vypeen constituency should be completed at the earliest,” the minister said. “It is from the water treatment plants at Chowara and Muppathadam and the pipeline constructed as part of Hudco project that potable water is being supplied to Vypeen area. The problems related to these projects should be identified and rectified soon,” the minister asked the officials. The government had given administrative sanction for the projects worth Rs 17.14 crore for constructing protection walls around Vypeen. “The remaining works under the project should be completed in a time-bound manner,” the minister said. He also asked the officials to submit periodical review reports on it. “Status report on the construction of breakwaters and seawall should also be submitted,” he instructed the officials. Unnikrishnan asked the officials that all the dilapidated drinking water pipelines in the area should be replaced with new ones.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/meet-decides-to-expedite-drinking-water-projects/articleshow/85778529.cms||---

The announcement was made at a public function held at Chellanam that was attended by industries minister P Rajeeve, Ernakulam MP Hibi Eden, Kochi MLA K J Maxi, Chellanam panchayat officials and senior officials of irrigation department. The ministers also visited the sea erosion affected areas at Chellanam. Augustine said that the residents will not have to move to relief camps during next monsoon as the proposed project to construct tetrapod seawall and groynes aims to resolve the issues in the area. He said that the tendering of the project will begin by September 15 and all the procedures to receive central government funding would be completed by November. The irrigation department has been directed to draft the detailed project report (DPR). “Chellanam is one among the 10 hotspots in Kerala that are worst-affected by sea erosion. In the next five years, projects worth Rs 5,300 will be implemented in Kerala coastline for coastal protection. The project will be implemented under the government’s 100-day projects. Chellanam will also be developed as a tourism centre with the help of the tourism department,” he said. Rajeeve, who presided over the function, said that the projects will be completed fast. “Besides coastal protection measures, the model fishing project will be implemented in Chellanam,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/min-announces-coastal-projects-worth-rs-344cr/articleshow/85778557.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Flood affects 30 lakh people, damages crops in 14 districts||PATNA: The floodwaters from Gandak, Bagmati, Burhi Gandak and Kamla and other rivers in north Bihar have caused a huge damage to crops and affected over 30 lakh population in 14 districts, including East Champaran, West Champaran, Gopalganj, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Katihar, Muzaffarpur and Vaishali. At least 43 people have died in the floods so far. The plying of vehicles on the Benibad-Runnisaidpur road in Sitamarhi was stopped on Monday, as the floodwaters from Bagmati river overtopped it. However, the Ganga was flowing below the danger level at most of the places, including at Digha and Gandhi Ghat in Patna. Its water level was above the danger level only at Hathidah, Kahalgaon and Farakka. The Bagmati was flowing above the danger level at most places, including at Kataunja (1.72 metre) and Benibad (1.27 metre). The Kamla was also flowing 1.80 metres above the danger mark at Jhanjharpur. But people living in the Gandak river basin had a huge relief, as contrary to the general fear last night that 5 lakh cusecs of water were to be released from the Valmikinagar barrage, only 3.57 lakh cusecs were released on Monday morning. Incidentally, this is much lower than the 4.12 lakh cusecs of water released on June 26 this year. On Sunday afternoon, the water discharge through the Valmikinagar barrage was 2.67 lakh cusecs, but heavy rainfall was received in the catchment areas of the three tributaries of Gandak in Nepal, which, by late night, accentuated the fears regarding the likely rush of a big layer of water towards the barrage from the Nepal side. Consequently, the West Champaran district administration, in the nick of time late Sunday night, announced the general high alert and also alerted the circle officers (COs) concerned, including of the Sadar block, to sound the alert through miking and also asked people to leave to safer places. “We would say that the rush of water from the upper reaches of Gandak on Sunday night was flash flood caused by erratic heavy rain,” a water resources department (WRD) official said. “In any case, we had apprehended such a phenomenon by looking at the satellite images of the cloud concentration. Accordingly, our forecast was that around 3.70 lakh cusecs of water will be released from the Valmikinagar barrage. The actual discharge was 3.57 lakh cusecs in the morning,” he said, adding that the discharge level at 6pm on Monday was 3.52 lakh cusecs, against their forecast of 3.64 lakh cusecs. The WRD sources also said the earlier forecast that the third peak of the floods in the state has now also passed by. The department’s earlier understanding was that the third peak of the floods in the state could occur either in the last week of August or in the first week of September.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/flood-affects-30-lakh-people-damages-crops-in-14-dists/articleshow/85776922.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Noida||Noida: Woman found dead in room, husband held||NOIDA: A 30-year-old woman, who allegedly had a fight with her husband the previous night, was found dead in her house in Surajpur area on Monday morning. The woman, identified as Meena, is suspected to have consumed several tablets of sulphas, an agriculture fumigant. A packet with just one tablet in it was found near the body, police said. Her husband, Bunty, a plumber, has been arrested following a complaint by the woman’s family. Neighbours have told police that the couple would have regular fights because Meera would object to Bunty’s drinking habits. The couple, who were married for the past five years, have a four-year-old son. They lived on the ground floor of a building in Surajpur. Bunty had three more brothers, two of whom live in the same house but on separate floors. The couple’s son has told police that Bunty and Meena had a fight before going to sleep the previous night. The cops said they received information about the alleged suicide around 8am on Monday. “Neighbours informed her family members too. A police team arrived and sent the body for an autopsy,” a police officer said. Meena’s family members have lodged a police complaint, alleging that Bunty had strangled her. They have told the police that their daughter would remain upset because of repeated harassment over dowry. “Earlier too, Meena had left Bunty’s house and come to stay with us. He would always convince her to return, promising every time that he would not to repeat his mistakes. But he never changed,” a relative said. Ajay Kumar, the SHO of Surajpur police station, said, “There is no external injury on the body. A box of sulphas tablets has been recovered from near the body and it had only one tablet left inside. The box has many tablets in it. She may have popped two or three.” An FIR has been lodged against Bunty, his three brothers and his mother based on a complaint by Meena’s family under IPC sections 498 (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 306 (abetment to suicide) and Section 3/4 the Dowry Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/woman-found-dead-in-room-husband-held/articleshow/85782763.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Work on reconstructing Himalaya Bridge begins||MUMBAI: Over two years after the Himalaya Bridge at the northern end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) came crashing down killing seven persons and injuring over 30 others, the BMC has begun reconstruction work at the site. The large staircase which was lying untouched since the crash in 2019 has been demolished and the entire area has been barricaded. The timeframe for the reconstruction project, which is expected to cost Rs6.4 crore, is 15 months, excluding monsoon. Meanwhile, in a representation made to the civic body around a fortnight ago, Anjuman-I -Islam institute has said that their ‘right of way’ must be protected when the new bridge is constructed so that the thousands of students studying at the institute are not affected. The Himalaya Bridge has two landings outside CSMT, one of which is at the institute gate. Mudassar Patel, from Anjuman -I -Islam institute, said that he met the BMC additional commissioner with their request. “The institute has close to 7,000 students and one gate is not enough. We, therefore, requested them to try and ensure that our right of way is not affected in any manner during reconstruction,” said Patel. When contacted, additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said they are only reconstructing the bridge as it is. “The institute has made a representation, but then we are considering minor modifications only like moving the landing a little ahead on the same footpath,” he said. Activist Kamlakar R Shenoy said the administration took a long time to start work on ground. “Debate over the landing has kept delaying the project. Being a central bridge, work on its reconstruction should have been completed on priority,” said Shenoy. It is learned that the railways had also made a suggestion to the civic body to have escalators for the bridge entry and exit, but the civic body is not inclined due to the maintenance that may be involved.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-work-on-reconstructing-himalaya-bridge-begins/articleshow/85782766.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Coal crisis eases slightly but plants producing 2,100MW still remain shut||JAIPUR: Coal crisis may have slightly eased in the past couple of days but the challenge to keep the power plants running still remains a major concern. Out of the units producing 2,800 MW that were shut down due to lack of coal, 600 MW has been made operational on Sunday. The marginal improvement comes after the state generator (RVUNL) paid coal suppliers Coal India Ltd and PKCL Rs 475 crore and Rs 1,375 crore respectively. In fact, discoms, which owe Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd (RVUNL) Rs 29,000 crore, paid the latter Rs 2,700 crore a few days ago. But sources in the energy department said the 1,500MW Suratgarh power plant and 600MW Kalisindh plant remains shut due to non-availability of coal. While non-payment of dues has been a major reason for coal not being supplied to these plants, the rains are also partly responsible. The thermal power plants in Rajasthan require 15-16 rakes of coal every day against which supplies have reached about 10-11 rakes. One rake contains 4000 tonne. Even if the plants get 15 rakes day, the situation will be hand-to-mouth. For maintaining a stock, the plans need to get 18-20 rakes a day consistently for 15-20 days. Some plants of NTPC in north India from where Rahasthan is getting power has also been facing issues of coal supply due to rains also forcing the discoms to source costly power from energy exchanges. After the partial payment of dues, RVUNL still owes coal suppliers over Rs 1000 crore excluding the dues of August. The discoms buy power from the plants but don’t pay fully. They owe about Rs 29000 crore to RVUNL, which in turn has taken loans of about Rs 2,4000 crore to meet its expenses, including buying coal. On this loan amount, RVUNL pays an interest rate of Rs 275 crore annually. But now, the banks are also not willing to give loans to RVUNL. If the discoms continue to buy power from energy exchange, the cost of power will rise and ultimately, the extra cost will be passed on to the consumer. Already, the cost of power for state’s discoms is highest in the country, at Rs 4.81 per unit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/coal-crisis-eases-slightly-but-plants-producing-2100mw-still-remain-shut/articleshow/85780977.cms||---

It also includes strengthening entry / exit points to the city.Under this initiative all government agencies concerned and shopkeepers will be roped in make the city safer. Cops will involve the business fraternity asking them to focus one camera towards the road and local body authorities will be directed to take security measures at their properties.In the heist case, police struggled to track the movement of the accused in as none of the CCTVs were facing the road. The movement of the criminals couldn’t be tracked immediately as only few surveillance cameras provided clues about their movement.Police commissioner Chandragupta said though both the cases were cracked in no time, the incidents were an eye-opener. “We discussed safety measures at length and came up with idea to enhance surveillance with cooperation from the public as well as the authorities concerned,” he added.The initiative of “My city, safe city”will be launched in Mysuru to keep a tab on movement of suspects through surveillance cameras. Almost every shopkeeper has installed cameras but majority of them are focused in to the shops. “We have decided to direct and appeal to them to mandatorily keep one camera focussed on the street so that it will help cops in case of a crime,” explained the commissioner. This won’t burden them as it is only an arrangement, the top cop stated.Even government agencies like Mysuru Urban Development Authority, revenue department and Mysuru City Corporation and others too will have to take responsibility in safe guarding their properties. “They will be directed to identify secluded or isolated places and take measures to prevent any illegal activity in these areas,” said commissioner Chandragupta This apart, night vision CCTVs will be installed at entry points. There are six entry/exit points and all these places would be reinforced so that movement of miscreants are tracked. In both these cases, the accused were from other states and they soon after committing the offence, Chandragupta stated. BJP MLA SR Ramadasexpressed regret over the rise in crime in Mysuru.“The crimes are a black mark. Police should have been more vigilant. It is terrifying to know that the accused in the rape cases have a criminal background,” he said.Socialist P Mallesh urged parents to be cautious while letting their children out. “Parents must give their children freedom but at the same be aware of their activities. Youths should also avoid going to such desolate places,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/my-city-safe-city-initiative-to-strengthen-surveillance/articleshow/85776071.cms||Lawrence Milton
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 59-year-old ‘jailbird’ sentenced to 5 years in Rs 90 lakh cheating case||MUMBAI: A special CBI court on Monday convicted and sentenced a 59-year-old woman to five years’ rigorous imprisonment for cheating the State Bank of India (SBI) by availing credit facilities of Rs 90 lakh by using false and forged documents. The money was diverted and not used for the purpose for which it was sought. The woman, Zarina Batliwala alias Nargis Divendry, has been in jail for 11 years as there are other cases against her. The court also convicted six others, including bank employees, and imposed fine amounts ranging from Rs 23 lakh to Rs 60,000. Among the other accused convicted by special judge S U Wadgaonkar were Ram Morey(54), the then AGM and Utsav Prasad (36), the then CSO. Both were sentenced to three years in jail. Additionally, Nand Kumar Karnik (66), deputy manager and Jayant Bijapurkar (49), the then assistant vice-president (credit) were sentenced to one year and two years’ imprisonment respectively. Dnyaneshwar V Sawant (45), accused of forging the documents, and Neela Samant (60), the then AGM, were also sentenced to one year each. Special public prosecutor Jitendra Kumar Sharma cited the deposition of over 30 witnesses to seek the conviction of the accused. The accused were booked under IPC sections relating to cheating and forgery and for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. While another key accused, Vijay Seth, died in 2013 and the case against him was abated, the court acquitted Kailash Chand Dayani, the then AGM. The investigating agency had submitted that on February 1, 2008 Batliwala applied for a loan of Rs1.2 crore from the Opera House Branch of State Bank of India. It was further alleged that the application was subsequently given to Prasad, then field officer and Morey, chief manager, advances, for verification. The two officers verified all the documents such as PAN card, ration card, income tax returns, sales tax registration certificates and balance sheets. After verification, the application was forwarded to the credit processing cell (CPC) II situated at BKC. The investigating agency further said that thereafter the proposal was appraised by Bijapurkar and recommended by Neela Samant at the CPC II. It is alleged that in the proposal submitted by the branch, certain properties were shown as collateral security. The loan proposal was sent by CPC II to the zonal credit committee-l and was finally sanctioned. The facilities were renewed in November 2009 for another year. However, the loan account became bad. When the documents were checked, it was found that most were bogus. It was also found that the flat given as security for the loan did not have a clear and marketable title.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-59-yr-old-jailbird-sentenced-to-5-yrs-in-rs-90l-cheating-case/articleshow/85782797.cms||Rebecca Samervel

In a two-and-a-half-minute-long audio clip that was shared on social media, Bhati purportedly tells GNIDA supervisor Yogesh Lohia that they were not informed of the visit to the village. “The next time, nobody from the Authority would be allowed to enter the village. You may inform the CEO that I used these words,” Bhati purportedly says. He dismissed Lohia’s reply that he had informed Sanket Bhati, a village youth. “The government is ours, everything is ours. So, when something is happening in our village… we should be informed,” Bhati says, adding that “election is approaching in five-six months”. Bhati confirmed he had spoken to the supervisor but termed the recording a ‘political act’. “A team had come to the village and started spraying without prior intimation. I asked Lohia why we were not informed… What if there is some mischief?

Taking up the issue with district collectors, the health department has written to them to conduct anti-larvae activities including fogging. In most of the parts of the state, fogging has not begun yet though the mosquitoes are breeding as monsoon created conducive environment for their breeding due to water stagnation. “Post-monsoon the risk of vector-borne diseases increases. It is a general trend which we are witnessing for years that cases of dengue and other vector-borne diseases increase. For preventing outbreaks of vector-borne diseases, we conduct anti-larvae activities,” said Dr Ravi Prakash Sharma, additional director (rural health). He further pointed out that secretary (health) has written to all the district collectors to start fogging in their respective areas. In 2020, the state had reported seven deaths due to dengue and 2,023 persons were tested positive for dengue. However, in 2021, so far, 883 dengue cases have been reported till July with no deaths. The health department is concerned about the coming months, as they are anticipating that cases of dengue, chikungunya and malaria may rise. Doctors have advised people to take preventive measures to ward off risk of vector-borne diseases such as cleaning spaces that have stagnant water, use of aerosol to prevent the mosquito bites, not exposing arms and legs, etc.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/start-fogging-to-stop-dengue-collectors-told/articleshow/85781033.cms||---

---||Delhi||8 mths after policy launch, no data yet on trees felled||New Delhi: Eight months after Delhi Tree Transplantation Policy was notified, no data has been uploaded on the forest and wildlife department’s website despite the policy clearly stating that the department will maintain a record on its website for every application approved for tree felling or transplantation, the location where the transplantation will occur and the number and type of trees to be felled and transplanted. While the policy is aimed at providing transparency, experts say the lack of data on the actual number of trees being transplanted is worrying. Bhavreen Kandhari, an environmental activist, says while the government was able to launch a new website where people can apply for permission to fell trees, the department has been unable to share any data on the number of applications received. “There is no transparency in terms of how many trees are being transplanted for each project. While the information is available in public domain for some major projects, there is no data available on the total permissions given and the total number of trees impacted,” said Kandhari. A senior forest department official told TOI data was being compiled and likely to be shared soon. “Expert agencies were being appointed earlier and once permissions are given, a list is prepared. Individual project details are also sought before permission is given and this will be made public soon,” said the official. Delhi is also yet to see an audit of the transplanted trees in order to determine survival rate. However, forest officials say the policy clearly states an audit will be conducted only after a year of the trees being transplanted. The policy was notified in December 2020. “We have to wait one year to carry out an audit to determine the survival rate of the transplanted trees. Based on that, payment to the empanelled agency is also done. Audits will, therefore, commence from 2022 onwards,” said a senior forest official, stating each forest division in Delhi had formed a citizen committee, which will be carrying out the social audit. According to the policy, at least 80% of the transplanted trees need to survive, in order for the technical agency to receive its full payment. Only 75% of the final payment is made if the survival rate is between 60 and 79%, while only half the amount is paid if the survival rate is between 50 and 69 %. The final payment is not made if the survival rate falls below 50%. In June, 2021, the Delhi government had empanelled four expert agencies to assist construction companies across Delhi in carrying out tree transplantation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/8-mths-after-policy-launch-no-data-yet-on-trees-felled/articleshow/85781026.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Besides the business jet terminal, Rajeeve, who is also the director of Cial, reviewed other projects envisaged by Cial to boost its non-aero revenue stream. Cial managing director S Suhas explained the progress of the works to the minister. Rajeeve said that the Cial director board has decided to boost non-aero revenue sources of the airport. The business jet terminal, which is being constructed at the existing Terminal-2 (T2), is one of the main projects planned to improve the non-aero vertical. The one lakh sqft T2 is not in use since 2019 following the shifting of domestic operations to the renovated Terminal 1. T2 will be converted into three utility blocks, which will house an exclusive area for business jets’ operation, a VVIP safe house and budget rooms for passengers’ short stay respectively. The government approved the blueprints of the business jet terminal and VVIP safe house projects. Cial envisages a cost-effective renovation of the interior of T2 into three blocks. Thirty per cent of the built-up area will be used for block one which will be converted as an exclusive business jet terminal with three lounges. This terminal will cater to both international and domestic business jets. Exclusive areas for customs, immigration and security holding operations will be allotted. “Block-2 will have an area of 10,000 sqft and is earmarked to house a VVIP safe house. This concept will ensure hassle-free movement of passengers during the VVIP movement. Block-3 will have an area of 60,000 sqft. Cial is planning to build 50 budget rooms for the passengers who intend to have a short-stay at the airport. Cial plans to complete block 1 and 2 in one year,” a Cial statement said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/min-reviews-business-jet-terminal-works-at-cial/articleshow/85778589.cms||---

One of the accused who claims that he is 17 years old and so a juvenile, was left out of the procedure. With their heads covered with a black cloth, the accused were brought to the spot by the police team led by DCP (Law and Order) Pradeep Gunti around 5pm. The rain delayed the process by 30 minutes and police collected information about the incident from them till 7pm. More than two dozen cops were present at the spot. The biggest challenge for cops in the case is building the evidence to get a conviction for all the accused. The accused are likely to be taken for another visit on Tuesday too. Explaining the procedure, an officer said that crime scene reconstruction is the process of determining the sequence of events that occurred during and after a crime. The idea is to understand how the crime was planned and committed. “First the investigation officer has to confirm the exact spot of the crime by questioning each accused separately to build a strong evidence. This is important and about 50% of the investigation is over if the verification of spot matches with what each accused has told,” added the official. “Secondly, the process is to extract information from all accused about the incident and how it happened. This has to be done separately. The process is done as per the provisions of Indian Evidence Act,” he added. Goods vehicle driver under scanner City police have identified the seventh accused in the case. His role in the crime is being examined. Meanwhile, the sixth accused is still at large. A search for him in neighbouring Tamil Nadu is on. Initially, it was believed that only six were involved in the heinous act, an officer told TOI. After the arrest of the five accused on Saturday, the name of another accused cropped up. He had brought all the accused to Mysuru from Tamil Nadu in his goods vehicle. According to the arrested accused, he was in the vehicle at the time of the crime. Whether the youth was aware of the plans of the accused and their crime is being verified, the officer stated.

The attack took place at Adlabad village in Nighasan area in UP’s Kheri district, barely 2km from the buffer zone of Dudhwa tiger reserve. A forest department team is combing the area in search of the big cat. Sources said the leopard was hiding on a tree and pounced on the boy, Aadil, who was picking pointed gourd. Hearing his screams, people working nearby rushed to his rescue. The unconscious and bleeding boy was taken to the community health centre in Nighasan. As there was no facility for blood transfusion, doctors at the CHC referred him to the district hospital. But he died within a few minutes after he was administered treatment there. Anil Patel, divisional forest officer, buffer zone, told TOI, “Our team found the pugmarks of an adult leopard. The forest near the village is flooded and this leopard must have moved out of the forest in search of food as no big cat attack has been reported here in the recent past. We have now advised the locals to move about in groups and not to let children venture out alone. A compensation of Rs 5 lakh will be given to the family of the deceased by the revenue department under the state’s disasters Act.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/12-yr-old-boy-killed-by-leopard-near-dudhwa-forests/articleshow/85776118.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The incident came to light after state statistics department found a discrepancy in data of death records. Talking to TOI, deputy medical superintendent of Ranchi district hospital Dr Sabyasachi Mandal said, “We were communicated about the forged certificates from statistics department after which we have decided to stop issuance of certificates until further orders. It has come to light that the log-in credentials of our authorised person at CSC was misused by people who issued 27 false death certificates under our hospital’s name.” The certificates which were issued belonged to Bokaro, Ranchi and nearby districts and issued through forged signatures. On the proper channel of issuing a death certificate, Mandal said, “One has to apply at the CSC kiosk in civil surgeon’s office with details of patient as well as relevant documents. After which we do an offline verification about the request which includes matching our records whether the person was admitted at our hospital. After the verification, the documents are sent to CSC for issuance of the certificate.” Asked how the certificates were issued if applications have to be verified first, Dr Mandal said there were false verifications with forged signatures and the culprits could issue the certificates becaue they had access to the account of the CSC. The hospital management has not filed any complaint regarding the incident so far. The police contacted the management which it would formally lodge a complaint after carrying out an internal inquiry. City DSP Deepak Kumar said, “No FIR has been registered by the management at the Lower Bazaar police station so far.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/ranchi-hosp-suspends-issuing-death-certificates-after-scam/articleshow/85778588.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Over 60 doctors participated in the workshop, where experts like Dr S N Dwivedi from AIIMS New Delhi and Dr Vivek Verma from Silchar University spoke on the methodology as well as on the use of suitable software for enhancing the result of research work. Talking to TOI, Rims director Dr Kameshwar Prasad said, “Bio-statistics plays an important role in any kind of medical research. It is like providing a guide to an ongoing research as well as a new one. We are going to hold training sessions which will highlight the intricacies in data collection, use of software and other variables affecting research work. The aim is to further improve the decision-making power of doctors regarding clinical matters, which, in turn, will benefit the patients.” Dr Dwivedi trained the doctors on various data types and how to record the data types and explain them in proper technical terms. “There are various aspects of data collection, its interpretation as well as statistical description to derive better clinical inferences and we can only do that when the complete process has been done in a proper manner with immaculate practices. The results of such research work is very concrete and it helps governments arrive at formulating new health policies,” he said. Dr Verma focussed on the methods of testing different hypothesis that doctors make using proper data-driven statistics. “A proper data-driven hypothesis is the only way to arrive at the conclusion whether the ongoing findings are correct or require change,” he said. Apart from technical session doctors were also provided hands-on training using real data that will prepare them to take this experience into their day-to-day clinical decision makings. One of the participants, Dr Prashant Kumar who is an assistant professor at the cardiology department, said: “It is very helpful for people like us who not only want to perform clinical duties but as part of our job have to pursue medical research too.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/rims-hosts-workshop-on-bio-statistics-to-promote-research/articleshow/85777320.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The makers of the video said the objective was to “wake up” the government and the Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) to the side effects of unsafe dumping of garbage, which leads to health and environmental hazards. Pranjal Kumar, a Ranchi-based fashion photographer known for shooting models in upscale posh locales, said the actual shoot was done on July 22 but he posted the video and its picture on Facebook only on Sunday night. He said, “I shot it to send it as an entry into an international competition. Before sending the entry, I couldn’t disclose it,” he said, adding that the competition is themed on environmental issues and he chose Jhiri, which is fast emerging as one of the biggest threat to Ranchi’s local ecology and the human habitation around it. “Over the years, unsafe dumping of all sorts of garbage at this place has made many living in the vicinity unhealthy. Such is the situation that people passing through the ring road nearby can’t bear the stench. This is one of the main connectivity to Lohardaga district. Even though I am not a journalist or social worker, I chose to highlight this issue on the global stage to wake up the officials concerned,” he said. The shooting was done for four hours both through drones for aerial videos and still photography. About the selection of model, he said, “I contacted a few models and took them to the site and Surbhi readily agreed as she, too, was aghast with the situation here.” Notably, areas around the ring road have been declared as a Greenfield area, which means high rises and big buildings can’t come up in earmarked peripheries. “But in this Greenfield area, we have the biggest environmental threat, waiting to further explode,” Kumar said, adding that during the shoot, they had to vomit several times, but pursued with their work. Surbhi said the shooting was tough but she took it as a challenge. “Initially, I got terrified but later on, I chose to do it as my way to rake up this issue braving fears of skin and other infection. While walking, my legs sometimes got stuck in the garbage,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/models-garbage-catwalk-video-goes-viral/articleshow/85778537.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Thankfully, decorative items were available at the shops as markets remained open,” noted Priyanka Goyal, housewife and a resident of Kadma. Vendors said business was better this year despite Covid. “It’s nothing like pre-Covid times but definitely better than 2020.

After receiving information about the python, which measures 8 feet and weighs 80 kg, was rescued by forest and local administration officials on Monday. Later, the python was released in Bendi forest, about 30km away from the town area on the Hazaribag-Chatra stretch of the NH-33. The church officials roped in snake catcher Murari Singh to capture the python. Singh, who is also an environmentalist associated with the NGO, Neo Human Foundation Centre, said it was for the first time that he caught the Indian Rock Python. He said, “I kept the reptile for the whole night and on the permission of DFO Hazaribag (west), R N Mishra, it was released in the forest.” Singh was of the view that the reptile mainly entered the town because of the depleting forest area and the unavailability of due food. DFO (wild division) Avinash Choudhury, who looks after Hazaribag, Chatra and Koderma ranges, said, “It was a rare species and is protected under the Wildlife Act. The main reason for the reptile entering the heart of the town could be that they are trying to get the warmth of the sunlight.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/rare-indian-rock-python-rescued/articleshow/85777457.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a statement, Das said the incumbent government under chief minister Hemant Soren was hurting the religious sentiments of the Hindus by not amending the rules ahead of the festive season. “Everything has been opened in Jharkhand except for the places of worship. This is hurting the religious sentiments of the people. While Janmashtami will be celebrated with pomp and splendoUr in Dwarka, Mathura and Vrindavan, the devotees of Lord Krishna in Jharkhand will have to be disappointed because of the ‘authoritarian’ government’s decisions,” Das said. Das claimed that while Jagannath temple in Puri, Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain and other prominent Hindu places of worship, which draw lakhs of devotees each year, have opened their doors for devotees, the Soren government continued to overlook the ongoing agitations in Deoghar and Rajrappa to press for the reopening of Baidyanath Dham and Chinnamastika Temples. “If such prominent temples which attract lakhs of devotees can be opened, why can’t Jharkhand open the temples by observing the Covid-19 protocols? The Covid-19 protocols are being brazenly flouted by the members of the governing coalition parties but no prosecution is initiated against them for flouting the rules,” Das said. “The festive season has started but the Soren government, which believes in appeasement politics, has not taken any steps and no guidelines have been framed for Durga Puja. If the government does not act immediately, BJP will hit the streets,” Das warned. Meanwhile, the Ranchi administration said it has put its police personnel on the ground to look out for any unsanctioned gatherings on the occasion of Janmashtami. “The July 21 guidelines dictate that religious places of worship can open but devotees won’t be allowed inside. All police stations have been directed to stay on alert. So far, we have not received any request from the Janmashtami organizing committees for the Dahi Handi festivals. We are also alert to see whether small temples are flouting the norms by allowing devotees inside,” Ranchi sub-divisional officer Deepak Dubey said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-govt-hurting-sentiments-by-keeping-temples-closed-raghubar/articleshow/85778507.cms||Dhritiman Ray

An order in this regard was issued by mission director of the state unit of the National Health Mission, Uma Shankar Singh, asking all deputy commissioners to ensure implementation of a micro plan in co-ordination with civil surgeons and district education officers. According to Singh’s order, a special Covid-19 vaccination drive has to be carried out between August 27 and September 4 covering all teaching and non-teaching staff of all private as well as government schools of the state. The district education officer (DEO) and district superintendent of education (DSE) have been directed to provide a list of all eligible teaching and non-teaching staff of all schools to the respective civil surgeons for vaccination. Talking to TOI, state nodal officer for vaccination, Dr Rakesh Dayal, said, “This is being done on priority for people engaged in the education sector so that we can announce them vaccinated ahead of Teachers’ Day celebrations on September 5. This will also help in confidence building among students as well as parents as our schools will be announced as vaccinated zones.” Dayal said they are monitoring the drive on daily and civil surgeons are ensuring that all eligible people are vaccinated ahead of target. The health department orders had come after state education department, which is awaiting the state government’s nod to open schools for junior classes too had requested the additional chief secretary (health) for the vaccination drive on priority. Education secretary Rajesh Kumar Sharma said the priority is to completely inoculate over 1.6 lakh teaching and non-teaching staff employed in government schools. Apart from that, all private schools, too, have been informed to get their staff inoculated by contacting their respective DEOs and DSEs. “We have a total strength of 1.5 lakh teaching staff which includes para-teachers too. Apart from that, there are over 12,000 non-teaching staff across Jharkhand and they are also being inoculated in a special drive to ensure a vaccinated environment inside the school after it has been opened for classes of IX to XII from August 1.” Asked whether the department is taking any call on resuming offline classes for junior classes, Sharma said, “We have sent a proposal to the state disaster management department and a decision is yet to be taken on that. However, we are sure that we will be able to vaccinate all school staff and announce them as vaccinated zones on Teachers’ Day celebrations.” Garhwa DEO Sanjay Pandey said, “There are 1,450 schools in my district and over 5,000 eligible staff have been identified who have to be administered the vaccine. We have provided the information to civil surgeons and they have started the vaccination.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/scramble-to-vaccinate-school-staff-before-teachers-day-spl-vax-drive-in-offing/articleshow/85778467.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The core committee of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee is said to be upset over the recent ‘appeasement’ policy of AIUDF leaders towards the state government, especially chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, and has on Monday decided to snap ties with the party headed by Badruddin Ajmal. The decision came after AIUDF, which was ready to sacrifice any number of seats to defeat the BJP in the state, has been praising the party and its chief minister recently at public fora. The panel will, however, need the formal consent of the AICC to break away permanently from the AIUDF. In the pre-poll alliance, AIUDF was the strongest partner of the Congress with the second highest number of MLAs and played a significant role in improving the party tally to 50 in the 126-member assembly. A Congress statement issued by the chairperson of the media department of the state PCC, Bobbeeta Sharma, read, “The committee (core committee) observed that Mahajot alliance partner AIUDF's behaviour and attitude in relation to the BJP has baffled the members of the Congress party. Continuous and mysterious praise of the BJP and the chief minister by the AIUDF leadership and its senior members has affected the public perception of the Congress party. In this connection, after a long discussion the core committee members of Assam Pradesh Congress Committee unanimously decided that AIUDF can no longer remain an alliance partner of Mahajot and will send intimation to AICC.” While Badruddin’s brother and former MP Sirajuddin Ajmal recently spoke highly of Himanta's capabilities as chief minister, AIUDF MLA Phanidhar Talukdar announced recently that he would be joining the BJP. Hagrama Mohilary’s Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) may also be shown the door by the Congress. Reports are doing the rounds that Hagrama's party is trying to get closer to the BJP again “Since the BPF has already expressed its unwillingness in various forums to remain in the Mahajot, the president of the APCC has been given full authority to take decision on this matter and intimate the high command,” stated the Congress release. With the Mahajot dreams dashed for the time being, the Congress may soldier on solo in its fight against the BJP in the state. Besides, at the meeting of the high command on August 14, the party had said that the state unit should be ultimately on its own without any support from other parties. The Left and a few regional parties may, however, continue to be with the Congress for some time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/assam-congress-slams-aiudf-saffron-swing-wants-split/articleshow/85784412.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Dogs are being vaccinated against rabies, canine distemper, parvo and other such canine-transmitted diseases. The park administration has identified 400-odd villages around the park where vaccination of 1,000 stray, feral and local dogs will be carried out, said officials. About 100 have already been given the shots. Unvaccinated dogs living in the perimeter of the park may place the cheetahs — which will need to familiarise themselves with a new environment — and other wildlife at risk for rabies. Forest officials are worried about viral diseases that can be passed from canines to felines with deadly effects. “Vaccination is likely to be completed by next month,” said park director PK Verma. A three-member panel has been set up to guide National Tiger Conservation Authority in translocation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cheetah-prep-vaccination-campaign-for-dogs-around-madhya-pradesh-national-park/articleshow/85784464.cms||---

In a statement issued after the working committee meeting of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, its chief Arshad Madani said the kind of religious and ideological confrontation that is playing out across the country cannot be countered by any weapon or technology, and the only way to counter it is to equip the new generation with higher education. He alleged that all post-independence governments had excluded Muslims from the field of education under a set policy. In its statement, the Jamiat appealed to the influential and wealthy people of society to set up separate schools and colleges for girls in their respective areas.

Dhavalikar, who the new pipeline commissioned on Monday, thanked chief minister Pramod Sawant and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar for laying the new pipeline between Kundaim and Madkai. “They managed to get administrative approval for the project despite the pandemic,” Dhavalikar said. The new 300mm pipeline will carry water from a 300 cubic meter tank in Kundaim and will benefit residents of Adanwada, Aksanwada, Wadalwada, Tonca, Dhutale wada and Hanso wada in Madkai and Bandora areas. Apart from this, the existing Mardol pipeline, which is connected to the Madkai tank, will be cut off at Mahalwada and this line will be utilised to supply water to Mahalwada, Ladiwada, Parampai and Gavane area. Water division executive engineer Nivruti Parsekar said villages used to face water problems as the small 200 mm diameter pipeline catered to the water needs of Gaunem, Parampai and Madkai areas. Before the new pipeline, residents received water supply only on alternate days. “We received water supply on alternate days and that too only for two hours. The water pressure is so low that sometimes, it takes about one-and-half hour to fill a small steel tank,” said Supriya Narvekar, an elderly resident of Adanwada. Narvekar said her family has resorted to purchasing mineral water to meet their drinking water needs. While attributing the water shortage problem to the increase in the number of households in Madkai and the rising demand at the Kundaim industrial area, Dhavalikar also pointed out to a delayed start to the work. Madkai sarpanch Lakshmi Volvoikar said the rise in both, population and industries, has led to a tremendous increase in demand for water. “According to the 2011 census report, the population of Madkai was around 6,000, but the area, which is made up of seven wards, has experienced a change in demography since the rise of industries,” Volvoikar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/new-pipeline-ends-madkais-3-year-water-shortage/articleshow/85779598.cms||---

Colleges will start at 50% classroom capacity to facilitate social distancing. With the new academic year 2021-22 for general stream college students set to begin from September 1, heads of aided colleges held a meeting last week to deliberate on the SOPs for students. The DHE had asked individual colleges to decide on their SOPs based on ground conditions. Heads of aided institutions had accordingly decided to hold discussions to bring some uniformity in the SOPs. Initially, classes for first and second year students will continue to be in online mode. A review of the physical classes for final year students will be carried out after around a month and then a decision will accordingly be taken on conducting classes similarly for first and second year students. “Physical classes may not be able to begin on September 1 itself. It will take time for the teachers to form batches of students and draw a schedule to ensure social distancing. Even at 50% capacity, students on alternate benches will be seated on different sides of the bench. For instance, if one student is sitting on the right side, the student seated behind will sit on the left side of the bench, as a precaution,” a college head said. Colleges have decided to give priority to completing laboratory practicals for final year science students. Also, offline sessions will begin with subjects where there is lower enrolment in that particular college so as to be able to make a slow start to welcoming students back on campus. Institutes will also attempt to convince students that all should at least take one dose of the vaccine to reduce the risk of infections. “In addition, all general SOPs like frequent sanitisation, compulsory wearing of the mask, ensuring there is social distancing at all times, etc, will be followed. City-based colleges with very high enrolment running into thousands of students have been told that they can decide on method of conducting offline classes based on their individual situations,” one college principal, who attended the meet said. Government colleges have already decided to give priority to second and third year students while conducting offline classes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/aided-colleges-to-first-focus-on-final-year-students-for-offline-classes/articleshow/85779740.cms||---

Addressing a gathering, he said, “All of the Nizam’s properties belong to us. We will take over the properties and give them back to people.” He claimed that some people had encroached upon the lands of ordinary people and publicised them as the Nizam’s properties. Sources, however, told TOI that there was nothing like “Nizam’s properties” any more as all that was owned by the last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, had already been converted into government properties. These include the present Raj Bhavan, Administrative Staff College of India campus and others. The Nizam trust properties are waqf properties. He also said,“We will chase away AIMIM, which is attempting to cash in on 12% support of minority community”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-seize-nizam-assets-and-give-them-to-people-says-bjp-leader/articleshow/85784535.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Goa||Goa: Vasco civic body buys 20 lakh of fumigants to tackle dengue||VASCO: The Mormugao Municipal Council has finally procured fumigants following increasing criticism from both councillors and citizens over the large number of dengue cases being reported from the port town. MMC has bought 20 litres of the chemical which will be used to fumigate 25 wards. It may be recalled that at a meeting organised by the Vasco urban health centre (UHC) about 15 days ago a few councillors had created an uproar over the non-availability of fumigants. Looking at the alarming increase of dengue cases in Vasco, the councillors had said that there was growing demand by people to fog their wards but the fumigant quantity available with them was insufficient. Chief officer Jayant Tari had expressed his difficulties in getting the stock stating that there is only one dealer in Goa at Panaji. “When a dengue case is reported the UHC carries out fogging only in the surrounding area, but people demand that the entire ward be treated. Here we become helpless as the chemical is not locally available. However, the municipality has done a great job by making the chemical available. It has placed more orders. Councillors are availing of the fumigant as per their requirement,” New Vaddem councillor Yatin Kamurlekar told TOI. The most number of dengue cases in the state have been reported from the urban health centre at Vasco and the primary health centre at Cortalim combined. Health officials who visited the areas found that the problem is that in the slums of Baina and New Vaddem in Vasco, people follow unhealthy water storage practices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/vasco-civic-body-buys-20l-of-fumigants-to-tackle-dengue/articleshow/85779718.cms||---
---||Goa||Six bidders line up for Calangute Residency plan||Panaji: Six bidders have shown interest in the tender issued by Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) for the renovation, operation and maintenance of the Calangute Residency (Annexe) property. A GTDC officer said that the property has been experiencing a declining trend in occupancy over the past five years. In the year 2019, the occupancy stood at 31% in comparison to 64% in 2016. The officer attributed this to reasons like stiff competition from registered and unregistered accommodation facilities in Calangute, and non-differentiation of its service offerings. In order to compete with accommodation facilities in Calangute, the average room rate (ARR) of Calangute Residency (Annexe) was kept at par with various budget hotels in the area. This rate remained unchanged for the past five years, which led to lower income while expenses continued to steadily increase. The entire scenario culminated in heavy losses for the property in the past five years, the officer said. The property will be given on as-is basis to the successful bidder who will be required to develop a suitable concept, renovate the existing structure based on the said concept and operate and maintain the same. The officer said that the tender is expected to reduce losses to the corporation from Calangute Residency (Annexe), as well as aid in ensuring that the premises are run professionally with the expertise of the private sector under the overall supervision of GTDC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/six-bidders-line-up-for-calangute-residency-plan/articleshow/85779813.cms||---

---||Goa||After a year, GIM students trickle back to campus||Panaji: After a gap of more than a year, the Goa Institute of Management (GIM), Sakhali, has started the process of getting students back on campus. The institute is set to resume physical classes soon, which will be held in combination with online sessions. Over 300 students have already arrived on the campus. More students are due to return in a phased manner in the coming weeks, the institute stated on Monday. GIM director Ajit Parulekar said that in a management school the core of learning happens within teams where the faculty and students exchange ideas, discuss and deliberate on it. The institute, he said, is therefore delighted to have students back on campus. “From our end we are ensuring all SOPs are being maintained strictly. Our massive campus allows us to socially distance ourselves responsibly while also engaging with each other,” said Parulekar. GIM will ensure that students and faculty who are returning to campus are fully vaccinated. Students also have to submit a vaccination certificate, negative RT-PCR test report and a signed undertaking before arriving on campus that they will follow quarantine norms as well as Covid protocols. On arrival students, have to mandatorily quarantine themselves for seven days. Even after the quarantine period, students are not allowed to leave the campus or have visitors from outside enter into the campus. The 50-acre campus at Sakhali will act as a bio-bubble for the 1000-plus students who are part of the various management programmes. GIM has set up a campus war-room with adequate nurses and healthcare practitioners equipped with oximeters, isolation rooms, pharmacy and ambulance services round the clock. Classes for the academic year 2021-2022 have already commenced online in July and the institute is aiming to schedule classes in a blended (in-person and virtual) mode soon. A student Osiya Gupta said, “I’ve just travelled from Indore to the GIM campus. I am ecstatic to see the beautiful campus and experience student life at GIM once again.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/after-a-year-gim-students-trickle-back-to-campus/articleshow/85779840.cms||---
---||India||After 30 years in Pakistan jail, Madhya Pradesh man handed over to BSF||BHOPAL: Thirty years after he strayed into Pakistan and was jailed there, Madhya Pradesh’s Prahlad Singh stepped on Indian soil on Monday, handed over by Pakistan Rangers to the BSF at Wagah. Torture in custody has rendered the mental patient unable to speak, said police. Back home in Ghoshi Patti village, about 45km from Sagar city in MP, Prahlad’s brother Veer Singh couldn’t speak either. He just kept crying. For 23 years, the family didn’t have a clue whether or not Prahlad was alive, let alone that he was in a Pakistan jail. Once he came to know of it though, Veer fought for his brother’s freedom like a man possessed. Half of Prahlad’s life had wasted away behind bars in Pakistan, Veer was determined that his remaining years should be of a free man. What makes his plight even more distressing is that Prahlad had completed his term but continued languishing in jail, along with 21 others, their mental health condition rendering them unable to provide any information about their relatives back home, making it difficult for the Indian government to identify them and begin the process of getting them freed. Prahlad was 28 when he mysteriously disappeared. He doesn’t know yet that his mother and one of his brothers have died. Veer, two other brothers and three sisters are eagerly awaiting his arrival. “We looked for him everywhere. It was only in 2014, when police came looking for his credentials, that we came to know he was a prisoner in Pakistan. We have no clue how he ended up there,” said Veer. Prahlad may have inadvertently crossed into Pakistan or he may have been trafficked, say police. He is the seventh ‘mentally ill’ MP resident to surface in a Pakistan jail, and that’s too much of a coincidence, say officials, suspecting that a cross-border trafficking ring may be at work.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-30-years-in-pakistan-jail-madhya-pradesh-man-handed-over-to-bsf/articleshow/85784565.cms||P Naveen
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh scores 104% in maximum vaccine usage, 11th in India||BHOPAL: For every 100 vaccine doses that were provided to Madhya Pradesh, it has administered vaccines to at least 104 people, putting the state at 11th position on the national chart. Chhattisgarh tops with 10% 'negative wastage', or 110 doses administered per 100 received, according to information provided under RTI Act by the health ministry to Neemuch-based activist Chandrashekhar Gaur. So, how can a state score 100%-plus in a paper of 100? There is no mathematical jugglery here. Each vial of the vaccine actually contains 11 doses, but only 10 are counted and wastage is also calculated on this basis, say sources. It is due to this that ‘negative wastage’ – or over-utilisation -- is achieved when even a vial’s 11th dose is used up. The health ministry’s reply explains ‘negative wastage value’: “It means there is no wastage; instead, the vaccine has been optimally utilized and additional doses have been extracted.” Dists with less vac wastage get more vialsAs per the RTI reply, MP has a wastage of minus-4.41% as on August 17, 2021. Daman and Diu (-6.05%) comes second and Kerala (-5.94%) third. Among the states ahead of MP are Gujarat (-5.77%), Tamil Nadu (-5.63%), Assam (-5.38%), Goa (-4.99%) and Bengal (-4.96%). Delhi is at 25th place. In fact, states are squeezing out the maximum from the doses allotted to them – a complete turnaround from the initial days when vaccine wastage was a concern. Only five states still figure in the vaccine wastage category – Odisha (0.75%), Jammu and Kashmir (0.93%), Manipur (1.54%), Tripura (3.54%) and Meghalaya (3.74%). “In the initial days, we had positive vaccine wastage, but with appropriate emphasis and effective monitoring, it was brought down. Our chief minister monitored this and emphasised maximizing vaccine use. When awareness was created, we started incentivizing districts that had least or negative wastage – they were provided with more vaccines. Successive campaigns increased awareness and this is how we arrived at negative wastage,” state health commissioner Akash Tripathi told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-scores-104-in-maximum-vaccine-usage-11th-in-country/articleshow/85784537.cms||Amarjeet Singh

It was also suggested that all such villages be connected with fibre optic internet service as village panchayats have been provided with the facility. The federation also requested the government to formulate a special scheme under the tribal sub-plan to provide android phones to ST students and that Wi-Fi towers be set up so that online education is not hampered, Gakuved secretary Rupesh Velip told reporters. He said that it was disheartening to see that the education of students in villages has been affected due to lack of internet connectivity, while students in urban areas have access to all such facilities. “Students residing in rural parts of Quepem, Sanguem, Canacona, Sanquelim, Bicholim, Pernem, Dharbandora and Sattari talukas have difficulties attending online classes due to a lack of internet connectivity. When mobile network is available, the speed mostly is less than 30kbps,” he said. Another Gakuved member urged school managements to direct their teachers to record educational content in the form of videos or powerpoint presentations and make it available to students as it will help students who miss their online classes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/improve-net-connectivity-in-remote-areas-tribal-group/articleshow/85779901.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The remaining work is likely to be completed by March 2022. It includes clearing of bushes from the khazan fields, desilting of the balance 40ha of fields and desilting of 1.2km of rivulets. The villagers of Shirgao had filed a public interest litigation before the high court. As per the court’s directives in February, 2020, WRD had taken up various mitigation measures to enable Shirgao villagers to return to agriculture again. The work was to be completed by January 27, 2021, the WRD report to the high court stated. The two khazan lands together cover an area of 80ha and the rivulets a length of 3.7km. Upto May 31, 2020, the appointed agency could desilt 1.8km of the rivulets and 30ha of fields in Kharat khazan and constructed one of the two sluices at Navi manas, WRD said. “Thirty hectares of fields were brought back to original cultivation state. Thereafter, agriculture department supported the farmers by providing seeds and fertilisers and the farmers cultivated the said 30ha of land and harvested paddy crop,” WRD stated. The balance 5ha was not attended to due to the growth of mangroves, said the report. Due to the lockdown, the work stopped and was taken up again in January, but was affected due to waterlogging, issues related to Covid-19 and shortage of materials and manpower, WRD stated. Altogether, 67% of the rivulets have been desilted despite the hurdles, the report noteds. WRD has also told the high court that it is yet to receive the amount for the work from the high court, which was deposited by the mining companies, even as WRD had made part of the payment to the agency employed to carry out the work in Shirgao.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/30ha-of-shirgao-fields-desilted-restored-to-cultivable-state-wrd/articleshow/85779957.cms||---

The Puttur assistant commissioner decided to serve a notice on the temple executive officer, seeking to know why the parking ban board was installed at the premises of Sri Mahalingeshwara temple, which comes under Hindu religious institutions and charitable endowment department of the state government. Puttur is about 40km from here. Assistant commissioner Yathish Ullal told TOI: “The notice is not an executive order. We will ask the executive officer to explain reasons behind the notice and whether it followed a directive from the endowment department. The officer should remove the board if it has no sanctio n.” Since the ground attached to the 12th -century temple spread over 17 acres is not fenced and the area hosts many commercial buildings, visitors have been parking vehicles there for some years now. Sources claimed pro-Hindu organisations had demanded a ban on non-Hindus from using the temple’s parking space about a month ago. The notice says only Hindu devotees visiting the temple can park their vehicles and parking for any other reason is “prohibited” and legal action will be initiated against the owner. However, temple administrative committee president Keshav Prasad Muliya said they decided to strengthen temple security following verbal instructions from the endowment minister. “We observe that vehicles are parked here overnight and many overspeed on Car Street. We will construct a compound wall for the temple,” he added. The Congress criticised the decision, saying people from different faiths also offer prayers to Lord Mahalingeshwara. Former Puttur MLA and Congress leader Shakuntala Shetty suggested that the temple could instead start a pay-and-park system that will also help in generating revenue for the administration. “It is difficult to ask people their religion when they park their vehicle. It could lead to tension. Also, it is not right to create a controversy in the name of Lord Mahalingeshwara, who is worshipped by all faiths,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/karnataka-temple-bans-parking-by-non-hindus/articleshow/85784604.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The university officially notified that the VC’s physical presence in his office was needed for the admission process. The decision, plunging the future of hundreds of applicants into uncertainty, has caused surprise and outrage, with a former VC calling it “unprecedented”. Authorities haven’t mentioned the exact nature of disturbances but speculation was rife that the reference was to on-campus protests sparked after the university rusticated three students for three years and suspended two professors for “gross misconduct”. A notification said a revised schedule of admission to courses under the 10 bhavanas (departments) would be announced in due course.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/under-siege-visva-bharati-stalls-results-admissions/articleshow/85784679.cms||Someswar Boral

---||India||As a kid, I struggled with my cultural identity: Menon||MELBOURNE: Could a story about an arranged marriage be radical? As an Indian-origin writer in the US, Sandhya Menon observed that the idea always generated interest but readers came to it with a set of presumptions. So, she took the age-old trope and remade it — as an Indian teenagers’ love story. Now, the young adult romantic comedy ‘When Dimple Met Rishi’, a ‘New York Times’ bestseller and inspiration for the 2020 Netflix show ‘Mismatched’, is on Time magazine’s ‘100 best YA (young adult) books of all time’ list, sharing space with iconic works like ‘The Catcher in the Rye’, ‘Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl’ and ‘Lord of the Flies’. “It is so humbling to be the only Indian-origin author on the list,” Menon, 38, told TOI from her Colorado home. Time, while releasing this ye-ar’s list on August 11, wrote, “The function of story, especially for young people, is to bear witness to their lives, marking them as valuable and seen and part of something.” It was what Menon was going for with her book. Born to Keralite parents in Mumbai, Menon went to the US when she was 15. “It was a stark experience for me — going from the home of immigrant parents to school and then having almost another identity to become acceptable to people,” Menon, a licensed therapist, said. “I had to tone down things like my religion. People didn’t understand what Hinduism was.” The hostility she saw sometimes made her think about cultural representation. “I remember going to the post office with mom once. In line, someone randomly started yelling that we should go back to our country. It was awful and scary … There were many instances I was made to feel like an outsider,” Menon said. “As a child, you internalise it and feel you are not good enough. I went through a stage I struggled with my cultural identity, which is why I am grateful I am being able to write and there is representation for Indian-American kids who might be going through similar things,” she added. ‘When Dimple Met Rishi’ was her debut novel. It took her three months to write and two years to publish. “In 2015, when I wrote the book, there was a lot of interest in arranged marriage stories. I was really tired of seeing the same story — where the girl is forced into marrying someone 30 years older and is just a pawn for her father and husband...I wanted to put a different story out there about arranged marriages and Indian-American young adults.” The Time’s first YA list came out in 2015. On the updated list this year, half the books are from the past decade. The reason, Menon said, is that young adults are looking for a wider range of stories. “The new generation of young adults sees the world differently. They are not keen on stereotypes and non-inclusive narratives … It is why the YA genre has been so critical when it comes to diversity.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-a-kid-i-struggled-with-my-cultural-identity-menon/articleshow/85784696.cms||Priyanka A Chokhani

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Two Konkan districts put travel curbs, RT-PCR test must||MUMBAI: With the Centre issuing an advisory for imposition of curbs ahead of the festive season, two districts in the Konkan region have mandated a compulsory RT-PCR negative test report on arrival for travellers, except for those who are fully vaccinated and under 18 years of age. Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg have limited health care infrastructure and a positivity rate higher than the state's average. As travel curbs have been eased, a sizeable number from Mumbai, Thane and Pune are expected to travel to their native towns and villages in these Konkan districts for the 10-day Ganpati festival. Teams have been posted at entry points in both districts to check travellers' status. Those vaccinated have to show their final certificates. "There is no way to ban travel and so these are some of the steps that the districts are taking to reduce the spread of the virus," said an official. The measures are based on the administrations' experiences during the first wave. Oppn slams tests for travellers, Tope points to Kerala’s post-Onam surgeThose vaccinated for Covid with two doses and under the age of 18 are exempted. It is mandatory for all others entering the district during Ganesh festival to have an RT-PCR negative test report issued 72 hours before,” said Prashant Satpute, district information officer in Sindhudurg. Last year, the state saw a huge surge in cases in September, right after the festive season in August. Opposition parties, however, criticised the move. They demanded that the requirement for an RT-PCR negative test be withdrawn. However, the government said districts are empowered to issue local directives to keep their individual Covid numbers in check. “The restrictions imposed are for the benefit of the people. It is expected that all citizens follow them,” said health minister Rajesh Tope. He pointed out that the Onam festival in Kerala led to a huge surge in cases and Maharashtra has to learn from that.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-two-konkan-districts-put-travel-curbs-rt-pcr-test-must/articleshow/85784726.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Couple move Bombay HC to ship embryo from US to India||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday issued notices to the Centre, the state government, Indian Council of Medical Research and other departments on a plea filed by a couple wishing to bring to India their embryo which has been cryo-preserved in a lab in Florida since 2016. Childless and now in their 40s, they had resorted to Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) in 2014 when rules permitted the import of an embryo for surrogacy in India, their counsel Nitin Pradhan said before a bench of justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar. The HC has posted it for urgent detailed hearing on September 13. By March 2016, their embryo was conceived through assisted tech. However, an October 2015 notification had changed the rules, barring import of human embryos except for scientific research. The couple, who returned to India in 2018, have challenged the 2015 notification. Couple: Ban on import of frozen embryo irrationalThe couple’s plea says ban on bringing their frozen embryo is unconstitutional, violative of their right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. They’re seeking orders to have the notification quashed as “illegal” and to permit their 5-year-old embryotheir “biological property”—to be shipped to India to enable surrogacy procedure which is “not prohibited for biological conception”. The 2015 bar is “arbitrary, irrational” and their right to have a biological child cannot be curbed by an “executive fiat”, their plea said, adding that there was no legislative enactment prohibiting “formation”, preservation and import of embryo for surrogacy. The notification prohibiting the embryo’s entry except for research was issued by the Director General of Foreign Trade, commerce and industry ministry, on ICMR’s guidelines. Pradhan cited a December 2015 direction of Supreme Court which said in cases where the process had already begun, the import was permitted. But despite the SC order, neither the Centre nor the ICMR has issued guidelines till date, he said. The couple originally sent representations and requests to government authorities in 2018. In 2019, they returned to India. Their petition said the ICMR has not responded to their June 18, 2021 representation though their case “square fits” the exception carved by the SC. Besides, there are two proposed laws to regulate surrogacy. However, they are bills, not statutes—one is the ART (regulation) Bill of 2020 which was sent to the standing committee on health and family welfare. It recommended import and export of embryo for therapeutic purposes which will enable fertility treatments in India, said the petition. It also cited the UK law, saying it does not prohibit import or export of embryo for surrogacy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/couple-move-bombay-hc-to-ship-embryo-from-us-to-india/articleshow/85784752.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Kolkata||Bank group goes to cops against attack by panchayat member’s hubby||Kolkata: State Bank of India Officers’ Association on Sunday evening lodged a police complaint against the husband of a panchayat member in Baruipur, South 24 Parganas, after he allegedly assaulted a former employee on bank premises on August 26. The incident was captured on CCTV. According to officials at SBI’s Khasmallik branch in Baruipur, Obaidh Sheikh alias Rahman, husband of Harihar panchayat member Rabia Bansuri, began loudly berating the bank staff around 4.30pm after the manager told him that opening an account would require a PAN card and address proof documents. Obaidh said he inquired why the bank was reluctant to open accounts in the name of children so they could avail of the state government’s Aikashree scholarship scheme. “How can the bank demand documents from a child for opening an account?” he said. He further alleged that he regularly received complaints from poor villagers of harassment at the bank while they were trying to open zero-balance accounts to avail of various government schemes. While Obaidh was shouting at the manager, a retired bank staffer began recording the incident on his cellphone. On seeing this, Obaidh lashed out at him, landing a slap on his cheek. As the man tried to move away, Obaidh followed him and assaulted him again while trying to snatch the phone. The SBI Officers’ Association (Bengal Circle) filed a complaint accusing Obaidh of trespass, threat, abuse and assault of the retired bank employee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bank-group-goes-to-cops-against-attack-by-panchayat-members-hubby/articleshow/85780940.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: TMC readies for Tripura blitz as Abhishek Banerjee reaches this week||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee is set to return to Tripura later this week to formally kickstart the party’s campaign in all 60 assembly seats in the state. Sushmita Dev, the former Silchar MP, is likely to figure prominently in TMC’s Tripura blitz across eight districts. While Sushmita is expected to reach Agartala from Silchar on September 1, Abhishek is expected to reach two days later. Along with senior leaders from Bengal, TMC student and youth leaders have been camping in Tripura for several weeks preparing the ground for the 15-day mass connect programme to be unveiled by Banerjee. This, interestingly, will also take Sushmita to gymnast Dipa Karmakar’s home. According to sources, Sushmita taking a lead in TMC’s Tripura plans was foregone. Though the party formally did not spell it out when she joined TMC after resigning from Congress on August 16, it was largely felt that TMC has a bigger role carved out for her to firmly establish the party foothold in the Bengali-dominated Barak Valley, which is contiguous with Tripura. Sushmita’s father and former Union minister Santosh Mohan Dev was twice elected to the Lok Sabha from Tripura and had been a central minister in the PV Narasimha Rao government as a Tripura West MP. Interestingly, Mamata Banerjee, then a Union sports minister, was his cabinet colleague then. A source close to the development said, “Sushmita has already launched an organisational drive in Silchar. She is largely expected to do that in Tripura too. She has a long association with the state.” Responding to a question earlier on the party’s face for the Tripura assembly polls, Abhishek had said it will be a local. “It is very clear that Tripura BJP is a divided house. The party is facing internal dissent, which, coupled with the anger against the Biplab Deb government, has made BJP desperate. Hence the repeated threats and attacks on our party workers and supporters,” sources said. The party is watching with interest as BJP reaches out to disgruntled MLAs led by Sudip Roy Burman. The Agartala legislator and the former state opposition leader had been with TMC before switching over to BJP. State education minister Bratya Basu said BJP MLAs in Tripura were also in touch with TMC. “When Mamata Banerjee steps into Tripura, there will be a tsunami. BJP leaders are pretty aware of this,” he said. “Tripura under BJP has been transformed into a valley of fear,” Basu alleged. Abhishek on Monday went to SSKM hospital and spent time with student leader Subhankar Debnath, who was injured in an attack on TMCP foundation day on Saturday. Subhankar was flown to Kolkata late that night.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tmc-readies-for-tripura-blitz-as-abhishek-reaches-this-wk/articleshow/85781121.cms||---
---||Kolkata||BJP team rushes to Tripura after 5 MLAs complain of Deb govt ‘mistakes’||Kolkata: Four BJP seniors from Delhi rushed to Agartala for a weeklong firefighting exercise after some party MLAs in Tripura complained against the Biplab Deb government’s “mistakes” and expressed concern over ongoing “attacks and acts of hooliganism” in the state. The delegation comprises BJP northeast zone (organization) secretary Ajay Jamwal, national general secretary Dilip Saikiya, general secretary in charge of Tripura and Assam Phanindranath Sharma and central observer Vinod Sonkar. On Monday, the Tripura BJP spokesperson said the four leaders would meet CM Deb and reach out to the districts, taking feedback from BJP organizers, MLAs and ministers over the quality of governance and also on the party organisation. They would then hold talks with the CM and Tripura BJP president Manik Saha, and also hold a meeting with ministers, MLAs and party organizers. The BJP team dashed to Agartala after five party leaders — former state health minister Sudip Roy Burman, Ashis Kumar Saha, Diba Chandra Hrangkhawl, Ashis Das and Burba Mohan Tripura — gave a piece of their mind at a press meet on Sunday. “The meeting was held to identify the mistakes. We will now place them before the leadership and hope the errors will be rectified,” Roy Burman said. Roy Burman, who joined BJP from Trinamool in 2017, spoke up at a time the Trinamool all-India general secretary had laid focus on Tripura and Assam. “We have started building our organization in Tripura for the last one-and-a-half months. Rest assured we are coming to power in Tripura. Our leader Mamata Banerjee hasn’t set foot in Tripura yet. There will be an earthquake when she does it,” the Trinamool leader said while virtually addressing a Trinamool Chhatra Parishad programme on Sunday. Trinamool leaders expect a couple of disgruntled BJP leaders in Tripura to join the party soon, like former Congress MP from Silchar Sushmita Dev did recently.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bjp-team-rushes-to-tripura-after-5-mlas-complain-of-deb-govt-mistakes/articleshow/85780623.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bishnupur BJP MLA returns to Trinamool||Kolkata: Bishnupur’s BJP MLA Tanmoy Ghosh on Monday joined Trinamool Congress training guns on his former party, saying those who won on a BJP ticket did so on their own calibre, the party had nothing to do with it. Ghosh also alleged that BJP “does not have any organisational network at the booth level — there is only talk and no work”. Ghosh’s strong statements led to some rumblings within the party. Former Tripura and Meghalaya governor Tathagata Roy, responding to Twitter posts questioning whether BJP leaders who gave Ghosh a ticket will admit their fault, wrote it takes spine and courage to admit wrongs. “Those who are passing off a loss as a victory, who are even scared to analyse what went wrong, how will they have the courage to admit wrongs,” he posted. Ghosh claimed, “BJP is practising vindictive politics in Bengal. During assembly elections, they even tried to win over Bengal by force. BJP is also using government machinery to meddle into matters of the state and to ruin the history and culture of Bengal.” Saying he didn’t speak to senior BJP leaders, Ghosh added: “Over the past 3 months, I have worked in my constituency on my own and tried to help people.” Inducting Ghosh into the party, state education minister Bratya Basu said, “Even BJP legislators are shunning the politics of violence practised by the central government and protesting against their efforts to demean the state. We will continue this fight.” Basu said many BJP leaders were in touch with TMC. “We appeal to all to join TMC. But who will be taken in will be decided by the party leadership,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bishnupur-bjp-mla-returns-to-trinamool/articleshow/85780710.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Visva-Bharati stalls admissions amid stir, says VC’s ‘physical presence’ needed||SANTINIKETAN: Visva-Bharati, a central university, on Monday suspended its admission process and withheld the results of all final-year UG and PG semester exams, saying the decision had to be taken as the university was “under siege”. The university officially notified that the vice-chancellor’s physical presence in his office was needed for the admission process. The decision, plunging the future of hundreds of applicants — both from India and abroad — into uncertainty, has caused surprise and outrage, with a former vice-chancellor calling it “unprecedented”. A former senior officiating VC questioned why the VC’s physical presence was necessary at all, especially in a year the entire admission process was being conducted online. Agitation at Visva BharatiThe authorities have not mentioned the exact nature of the campus disturbances, but speculation was rife that the reference was to the on-campus protests sparked after the university rusticated three students for three years and suspended two professors for “gross indiscipline and misconduct”. The decision by the university authorities sparked sit-ins, one of them outside ‘Purbita’, the official residence of vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty. Late on Monday afternoon, a group of Visva-Bharati teachers approached the protesting students to open a dialogue over the impasse, but were shouted out. ‘Univ wrong to risk students’ future’The university’s admission cell coordinator posted the following on the official website on Monday: “Visva Bharati is currently under siege.... The admission cell needs the physical presence of the VC in his office. Given the unfavourable circumstances... the admission process stands temporarily suspended.” The notification stated that a revised schedule of admission to courses under the 10 bhavanas (departments) would be announced in due course. The suspension comes a week ahead of the scheduled publication of the undergraduate merit list on September 7. The university had announced that it would complete the counselling and admission process between September 13 and 20. The suspension of the admission process affects these deadlines. Former vice-chancellor Sujit Kumar Basu said he was not sure whether the ground situation at the university warranted such “unprecedented” decision. “I had faced violent agitations during my tenure. There was pressure from vested interests on the admission process. But we never stalled the admission process midway. I don’t know how grave the situation is now, which led the authorities to take such an unprecedented decision,” he said. Former officiating VC Sabujkali Sen held a similar view. “The university cannot suspend the admission process and put the future of students in jeopardy,” she said, adding she failed to understand why the admission cell was insisting on the physical presence of the VC. “The process is being carried out in a centrally run MHRD portal. The heads of the bhavanas have asked to keep a tab on the process,” she said. Applicants who came to the campus, and their guardians, were also taken aback. “Most colleges have started coming up with the merit list. I had wanted to put my daughter in Visva-Bharati, but how long should we stand and wait amid such uncertainty,” said Suri resident Baisakhi Bag.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/v-b-stalls-admissions-amid-stir-says-vcs-physical-presence-needed/articleshow/85781729.cms||Someswar Boral
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Vaccinators brave hungry tides to jab 1 lakh in 9 remote Sunderbans island in 4 days||GOSABA: An army of vaccinators has been deployed in the Sunderbans to administer Covid shots to over 1 lakh residents of 40 villages in nine remote islands within four days. “We are targeting 100% first dose inoculation in Gosaba block in a four-day project that began on Saturday. A dry run was carried out on Friday, during which 8,500 were jabbed. On Saturday, when the project officially took off, 16,000 received shots. On Sunday, this went up to around 19,000. We will vaccinate the remaining adults in these islands over Monday and Tuesday,” said Canning assistant chief medical officer of health Parimal Dakua. In all, 154 vaccinators are setting off from Gosaba Rural Hospital at 6am with a stock of 25,000 vaccine shots to make the long boat rides across tempestuous rivers to reach remote villages like Kumirmari, Chhoto Molla Khali, Lahiripur, Shambhu Nagar, Satjelia, Dulki and Puijali. It takes around three and-a-half hours by country boat from Gadkhali during high tide and another 30-60 minutes during low tide to access these islands. After conducting day-long camps, the vaccinators are returning by boat around 9pm. With many villages without internet connectivity, the data is being uploaded on Co-Win by midnight. “There are two major challenges. The first is the movement of staff along the riverine route during monsoon when the rivers are swollen and choppy. For some teams, the to and fro journey takes seven to eight hours. The second is the lack of internet connectivity in many places due to which data entry has to be done after the teams return to the base,” said Dakua. The teams are setting up 45 temporary Covid vaccination centres in schools and other buildings in the 14 gram panchayat areas. Vaccine drive after spurt in Covid casesThe decision to hold the special drive followed a sudden spurt in Covid cases over the past few weeks. Doctors said the rise in infection could be due to the influx of tourists to the Sunderbans from not just Bengal but other parts of the country after the second wave receded. Also, following the easing of transport restrictions, locals from these islands are travelling to Kolkata and its suburbs for jobs and may have contracted the virus there. Gosaba block has a population of 2.5 lakh people of which nearly 70% are in the 18-plus target group. Of these, around 71,000 had taken a vaccine shot before the drive commenced. The teams are setting up 45 temporary Covid vaccination centres in schools and other buildings in the 14 gram panchayat areasOnce the drive is completed, a similar programme will be taken up in the Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality in South 24 Parganas from Tuesday that has also seen a spurt in Covid cases. Around 1,19,000 people need to be jabbed here. “A lot of islanders from Gosaba have a second residence in Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality area where they work. That could be the reason why there is an uptake in Covid cases after the relaxations were announced,” said Baruipur sub-division assistant chief medical officer of health Indranil Mitra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/vaccinators-brave-hungry-tides-to-jab-1l-in-9-remote-sunderbans-island-in-4-days/articleshow/85782087.cms||Sudipto Das
---||Hyderabad||#SundayFunday: Rejoice! Sunday evenings are now traffic-free on Tank Bund||After staying cooped up at home for over a year, many Hyderabadis came out with their family members to Tank Bund road on Sunday for a leisurely stroll. For once, there was no sound of honking or traffic snarls in the area as Tank Bund turned into a pedestrian zone between 5pm to 10pm on Sunday. It all started with a tweet from MA & UD Minister KT Rama Rao who responded to a request from a citizen on Twitter and advised traffic cops to make Tank Bund into a traffic-free zone every Sunday evening. The initiative kick-started on August 29 and received a huge thumbs up from Hyderabadis who thronged the lake road with their families, clicking selfies, strolling on the streets and enjoying food by the lakeside. “I’ve been living in Hyderabad for over two decades and I’ve never seen Tank Bund look so beautiful. It was really pleasant to take a stroll on the road without all the traffic. It felt like we were in a European city. There were a few teething issues regarding traffic but I’m sure it will be resolved soon. This is going to be my favourite Sunday spot from now on,” shares Maithili Sharma, government employee from RTC X Roads. Umesh Chandra, an entrepreneur, adds, “Bird watching at Tank Bund is one of my biggest hobbies and I’ve always been disturbed by how vehicular movement disrupted the birds. However, on Sunday evening, it was a sight to behold as there were no vehicles across the Tank Bund road. Not just pigeons, but many birds were seen happily hopping on the streets. I hope the government extends this move to both Saturday and Sunday going forward.” For many Hyderabadis, it was a relief to take their kids out for an evening stroll. B Payal, who has a 10-year-old child, says, “Kids need to be out in the open and they need to be able to play in the streets and enjoy themselves. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, we have been cooped up indoors for many months and even after things unlocked, there aren’t many places to take my child out to play. But on Sunday, my son had a great time playing on the streets of Tank Bund. I’ll be back again next Sunday.” Sunday Strolls at Tank BundWhen? Tank Bund to be traffic-free zone every Sunday from 5-10pm What is allowed? Only pedestrians and cyclists will be allowed on Tank Bund road. No other vehicular movement permitted Where to park?

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt to reopen schools for Class 6-8 from September 6||BENGALURU: With a steady decline in the daily Covid-19 caseload, the state government on Monday decided to reopen schools for Class 6 to 8 from September 6 in taluks where the Covid positivity rate is less than 2%. Schools are allowed to accommodate 50% of the class strength at a time, so students will have to attend classes in two batches on alternate days. The classes will be held for five days a week. Classrooms and school premises will be sanitised on Saturdays and Sundays. Detailed guidelines are expected to be issued soon. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai with senior cabinet colleagues and members of the Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee amid public demand to reopen classes for younger students. The state government allowed physical classes for those in grades 9 to12 in various schools and pre-university colleges from August 23. The response has been encouraging and infections among students negligible, it said. Curfew relaxation in districts with less than 1.5% positivity rateAttendance in classes 9 to 12 in government schools and colleges is very encouraging while it is yet to pick up in private schools,” said revenue minister R Ashoka. Appealing parents to send their children to school without any apprehension, the minister said of 6,472 swab samples of students collected over the past two weeks, only 14 students have tested positive. At the meeting, it was decided to relax night curfew in Chikkamagaluru, Kolar, Mysuru, Shivamogga and Kalaburagi as the test positivity rate in these districts has come down to less than 1.5%. However, night curfew will continue in Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi. Weekend curfew will be restricted to Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada, Hassan and Udupi. The government allowed 50% attendance for marriages in halls and choultries with a maximum cap of 400 people. Till now, only 100 people were allowed to attend marriages in halls. “Marriage hall owners were repeatedly requesting for relaxations and hence the decision,” Ashoka said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-govt-to-reopen-schools-for-class-6-8-from-september-6/articleshow/85784758.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Farm stir: Haryana, Punjab CMs resume war of words||CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who marked his government’s 2,500 days in power on Monday, blamed the Punjab government for provoking farmers and instigating violence in his state, claiming that only farmers from Punjab were protesting at the Delhi borders. This led to another war of words between the two CMs. Amarinder and Khattar, who had vociferously criticised each other at the start of the farmer protests in November 2020, again had a slanging match over the farmer stir and the violence in Karnal. ‘Farmers will indefinitely gherao Karnal secretariat’Interacting with the media persons in Chandigarh, Khattar said, “Protection of democracy is the work of administration and government. They are assigned this work. We have heard the audio and video. The choice of words of the officer was not appropriate. .. But it doesn’t mean that they cannot be strict. Rest, DGP is probing the incident and local administration too is probing. We shall act as and when it will come to us.’’ The panchayat, chaired by BKU (Charuni) national president Gurnam Singh Charuni, condemned the Karnal lathicharge and alleged that the government had deliberately targeted the farmers. Charuni said, “Several decisions have been taken in the Kisan Panchayat. We have sought suspension of some officials, including Karnal SDM and inspector Harjinder Singh after registering FIRs against them. We have demanded Rs 25 lakh compensation and a government job for the kin of farmer Sushil (who allegedlt died due to the lathicharge), and Rs 2 lakh compensation for each injured farmer.” The farmers will indefinitely gherao the Karnal secretariat on September 7 if the government fails to act on the panchayat’s demand till September 6, Charuni threatened. Urging the farmers to carry on the protest against the BJPJJP leaders, Charuni also attacked the Congress party saying that the opposition party should have come on the roads against the government's adamant attitude. Taking a challenging stance against the SKM leaders, an almost tearful Charuni asked them to spell out their future strategy. "Haryana farmers being attacked by cops and administration cannot be tolerated anymore. The SKM either takes a strong decision or forgets Haryana farmers,” The SKM too demanded that Haryana government should immediately register a case against Karnal SDM under charges of murder, in addition to dismissing him and all other officials involved in the violence in Karnal. The SKM expressed shock at the defence by Haryana CM Khattar, and issued an ultimatum for strict action till September 6 or the farmers will decide on a strong action. Citing the statement of Meghalaya governor Satya Pal Malik for immediate dismissal of the official, the SKM said, “It is utterly shocking that the CM is choosing to brush aside the barbaric and illegal instructions as only a wrong choice of words. It once again clearly reiterates what we have been saying that the Khattar government is at war with its own people.” The SKM asked the protesting farmers to boycott and organise black flag protests against leaders of BJP and allied parties in various states. The farmers’ front also termed the administration’s action of filing cases against 100 protesting farmers as shameful and asked for immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all such cases. In another development, a delegation led by the Indian National Lok Dal state president Nafe Singh Rathee submitted a complaint to the Karnal superintendent of police seeking the FIRs against the Karnal SDM and other police officials. In the complaint, Rathee alleged that a video has gone viral on social media, in which the SDM, who was the duty magistrate on that day, could be seen ordering the cops to hit the protesters on their head. Meanwhile, a state-level coordination committee has been created in Uttarakhand of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha. SAD demands judicial probeThe Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has demanded that Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar order a judicial probe into the Karnala incident, wherein SDM Ayush Sinha ordered use of force against protesting farmers on Sunday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/farm-stir-haryana-punjab-cms-resume-war-of-words/articleshow/85784754.cms||---
---||India||Sri Lanka hit enthrals India, local versions resonate in states||KOLKATA/BHUBANESHWAR: On May 22 this year, a music video was uploaded on YouTube in Sri Lanka. Three months and over 70 million views later, the hit Sinhala song— ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ — has left not only India’s top actors and musicians smitten but is fast gaining popularity in far corners of India, with different versions resonating across the country — from Bengali to Garhwali and Tamil to Sambalpuri. After Amitabh Bachchan and Parineeti Chopra, it’s musicians in Bengal who are outdoing each other in releasing Bengali covers. Some of these covers have gone viral and the artists are now planning second editions. Actors are even making Instagram reels using 15-30 seconds of the song. The original Sinhala song featuring Yohani de Silva and Satheeshan Rathnayaka was produced by Chamath Sangeeth in July 2020. In Odisha, wannabe You-Tube stars are trying to ride piggyback on the runaway hit. While multiple Odia and one Sambalpuri version of the number have flooded the social media, many of these have earned viewership in lakhs. Saroj Haldhar, a sound engineer from Kendrapada, who has sung his own Odia version of the popular number, said, “The moment I heard the song, I thought of having our own version of it. It clicked.” Haldhar, who also runs a music production house, has earned more than 12 lakh views and 33,000 likes for his Odia take of ‘Manika Mage Hithe.’ “This is the highest views I have received for any song in less than two weeks of uploading,” said the 30-year-old said. In Kolkata, singer Iman Chakraborty describes it as a “refreshing song”. “In these difficult times, people have got a hummable and happy tune they are enjoying,” she said. Actor Chandreyee Ghosh, who posted a reel, said, “Technology hasn’t played a big role in its production. For me, this song is like a conversation with one’s own self.” The last time Bengal witnessed such a phenomenon was a decade ago when Anirudh and Dhanush sang ‘Why this kolaveri di?’ in Tamil. Singer Anirban Sur has done a Bangla folk mash-up, mixing the song with ‘Tomae hridmajhare rakhbo’, ‘Tomar ghore bosot kore’ and ‘Lal paharir deshe ja’ while singer Ronit Basak, better known as JJ RoNN in the Hip Hop-RnB circuit of Kolkata, has remixed it with Odisha’s popular ‘Rangabati’ song.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sri-lanka-hit-enthrals-india-local-versions-resonate-in-states/articleshow/85784866.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

They can go home after another test at the end of the quarantine. “The government has mandated seven-day quarantine for travellers from Kerala as a precautionary measure and on the advice of experts,” revenue minister R Ashoka said after a meeting chaired by the CM on Monday. The government clarified that RT-PCR negative certificates are a must to enter Dakshina Kannada from Kerala; those without the certificate will be turned away at border check points. The rule will come into force after the government issues an order on Tuesday. Quarantined to stay in hostelsThe government has decided to utilise government facilities like hostels to house travellers from Kerala in institutional quarantine. “If no such facilities are available, the state will identify budget hotels. While the weeklong stay will be free at government facilities, those quarantined have to pay at private facilities,” said health minister K Sudhakar. Till now, it was mandatory for people coming from Kerala to show RT-PCR negative certificate. Since many tested positive a few days after arriving, the government was forced to make institutional quarantine a must, an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/institutional-quarantine-must-for-kerala-entrants-in-karnataka/articleshow/85784897.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka aims to jab 2 crore in a month, says health minister K Sudhakar||BENGALURU: With supply streamlined, Karnataka plans to significantly ramp up Covid-19 vaccination coverage by administering five lakh doses a day, doubling the target to 10 lakh every Wednesday by arranging special drives. Underlining that it means business, the state administered 6.8 lakh doses on Monday alone. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with health and family welfare department officials on Monday, health minister K Sudhakar said the enhanced drive will ensure that 1.5 to 2 crore doses are administered a month. He said the government is aiming to make Bengaluru the first metro to have completely vaccinated all eligible residents. The state received 1.1 crore doses in August, almost double the usual quota. “Supply has increased after the chief minister and I discussed the issue with the Centre,” Sudhakar said. He said the objective is to cover all eligible people with two doses by the end of 2021. Karnataka has already administered more than one crore second doses. This would mean 20% of the eligible five crore population is fully vaccinated. So far, four crore doses have been administered in the state, including one crore in BBMP limits. “Measures will be initiated to increase coverage in Bidar, Yadgir, Kalaburagi and Raichur districts,” Sudhakar said. Districts in North Karnataka had complained of poor vaccine supply. The health department is also planning to conduct special drives for slum dwellers daily. “Priority will be given to border districts of Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, especially villages within 20km of the border,” Sudhakar said. He also emphasised the need for beneficiaries to provide the same mobile number while taking the second dose. “Otherwise, there will be an information mismatch and the final certificate will not be generated,” Sudhakar said. “Karnataka is one of the best performing states in Covid vaccination.” On Monday, one lakh doses were administered in Bengaluru alone, followed by Belagavi where 59,540 people were jabbed. Of the total 4.1 crore who have been inoculated in the state so far, 3.1 crore have received only one dose. In Bengaluru, where over 93.4 lakh vaccine doses have been administered, 68.2 lakh have received the first dose and 25.2 lakh have been fully vaccinated as at 3.30pm on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-aims-to-jab-2-crore-in-a-month-says-health-minister-k-sudhakar/articleshow/85784945.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Janmashtami devotees take Covid norms lightly||CHANDIGARH: The fervour of Janmashtami overshadowed Covid safety concerns for residents, many of whom threw caution to the winds. A large crowd gathered at Iskcon temple in Sector 36, Chandigarh, where Covid norms were violated. Temple authorities said they were trying their best to ensure that people followed Covid guidelines by wearing masks and maintaining proper social distancing but the swelling crowd made it difficult for them. A priest at Iskcon temple said, “We are trying to ensure that people maintain distance from each other and wear masks but at some point, the situation is beyond our control. Still, we are checking to see that everyone follows protocol and stays safe.” At Shri Sanatan Dharam Mandir, Sector 36, large crowds gathered on the premises and children could be seen without masks. Among those who did wear masks, many pulled it down to their chin. Social distancing was not possible. Unlike last year, this time, officials did not issue any instructions or guidelines for festival celebrations with Covid guidelines. Restraint exercised in PanchkulaThis Janmashtami, there was little rush in city temples. Police and administrative officials conducted patrols and made repeated requests asking people to maintain social distancing. Panchkula health department set up special Covid camps at popular temples in Sector 2, 6, 9 and 20. There were not many people at the Luxmi Narayan temple in Sector 6, Ram Mandir in Sector 2, Shiv Mandir in Sector 9 and Shiv Mandir in Sector 20. People started gathering at the temple in the morning. While devotees wore masks, they carried “Prasad” as offering, which was not allowed. Rush in Mohali, many without masksIn Mohali, devotees thronged temples on Monday to celebrate Lord Krishna Janamashtami. Temples in Phase II, 3B1, IX and X were teeming with devotees. At many temples, devotees were not wearing masks. Punjab health minister and Congress MLA from Mohali, Balbir Singh Sidhu celebrated janamashtami at Bal Gopal Gaushala Balongi. Later, he inaugurated work on another shed for animals. Sidhu congratulated people on Janamashtami.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/chandigarh-janmashtami-devotees-take-covid-norms-lightly/articleshow/85784954.cms||---
---||India||Covid: Most of adults will get 1 vaccine dose by October||NEW DELHI: The gover nment plans to maximise coverage of first dose of Covid vaccination by September-October to ensure a considerable adult population is fully vaccinated, or has recieved at least one dose, by end of this year. With increased pace of vaccination and improved supplies, the government is expecting some states to cover a significant proportion of the adult population with one dose by October itself. Coverage in states like UP and Tamil Nadu may take longer. Since Covishield — which accounts for 87% of the total inoculations so far —is administered with a gap of at least 84 days or 12 weeks, it is likely that full vaccination of eligible population will roll over to next year, an official said. The rate of vaccination, that was 57 lakh a day in August, is expected to go up but may also prove a challenge in terms of meeting target of full vaccination of eligible adult population by year end. At present, around 52% of the 94 crore adult population is covered with at least one dose of anti-Covid jabs. The coverage of second dose is lower at 15% of the eligible population. Around 49 crore of the shots delivered are first dose jabs. A total of over 63.9 crore doses have been administered so far. However, officials say, the full vaccination picture will change once a significant proportion of the adult population receives their first dose. Currently, almost 70% of inoculations are first dose but from October onwards— once majority of eligible population would have received the initial shot the proportion of second dose is expected to increase. The government is also expecting the second dose coverage to expand faster with improved supplies, particularly that of Covaxin — which also has a relatively smaller gap of four to six weeks between two doses. Some states like Kerala and MP that have already covered a significant proportion of eligible adult population with first dose and are likely to cover the targeted population by September itself. Smaller states and UTs are also expected to achieve a substantial coverage of the first dose by October. The Centre is also mindful that 100% coverage may not be possible as some people will continue to be hesitant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/most-of-adults-will-get-1-dose-by-october/articleshow/85784957.cms||Sushmi Dey

The government on Monday asked deputy commissioners and superintendents of police of districts where the festival is celebrated in a grand way to hold meetings with organisers and chalk out plans. Sarvajanik Ganesh festivals are celebrated in a big way in major districts of north Karnataka, including Dharwad and Belagavi. "The decision was taken after the government received petitions from various organisations and BJP functionaries to allow celebrations. But chief minister Basavaraj Bommai will hold another meeting with experts and take a final call on September 5,” an official said. In the guidelines issued last week, the government banned installation of Ganesha idols in public places and celebration of the festival in a big way owing to fears of Covid-19 third wave hitting the state. But the decision was opposed by many BJP MLAs and some pro-Hindutva groups. Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal had threatened to defy Covid restrictions and go ahead with the Sarvajanik festival in his home district. This put the Bommai government under pressure and it’s likely to allow installation of idols while restricting the number of people at such places.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-govt-likely-to-allow-ganesha-idols-in-public-places/articleshow/85785000.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Fresh outbreak in Kolar nursing college, poultry farm||KOLAR: Alarm bells were ringing in the corridors of Kolar’s district administration after two Covid-19 cluster outbreaks were reported — one in KGF taluk and another in Mulbagal taluk. Fresh cases in Kolar district were declining, with only seven new infections reported on August 24. However, there has been an uptick since August 25. On Sunday, the district reported 54 new infections. Officials attributed the spike to students from Kerala returning to colleges in the district. G Prasanna Kumar, health inspecting officer, KGF taluk, claimed “scores” of students from Kerala returned to Noor Unissa Nursing College campus in KGF four days ago. Initially, four had shown symptoms and tested positive. Sensing trouble, authorities took samples of another 56 students, all from Kerala, and 28 of them were found to be infected. Health officials then conducted tests on all 265 students from Kerala enrolled in the college. By Monday evening, 66 had tested positive. The number may well go past 80, Kumar said. He said the college has been sealed off and sanitised. He said, when they arrived, students had submitted Covid negative test reports issued by private labs in Kolar, but their authenticity was doubtful. Meanwhile, border taluk Mulbagal reported 16 new cases in the past 24 hours. All the cases emanated from a new poultry farm at V Shettyhalli village, near Urukunte Mittor, said Dr Varnashree, taluk medical officer. She said a Bengaluru-based poultry farm was setting up a branch at the village and had hired labourers from Sarjapur, Bengaluru. Four of them tested positive two days ago. Tests were then conducted on all 24 labourers and 16 were found to be infected. She said all who have contracted the infection have been admitted to BGML Hospital and steps are being taken to sanitise the farm. Dr Varnashree said staff are keeping an eye on villages which share borders with Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Barring KGF and Mulbagal, the other four taluks in the district have been reporting positive cases in single digits during the past few days, the health department said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-fresh-outbreak-in-kolar-nursing-college-poultry-farm/articleshow/85785061.cms||Ranganath Krishnaswamy
---||India||For school staff, 2 new CoWin categories||PUNE: Two categories have been created on the centralised CoWin portal for teachers and non-teaching staff of educational institutes to ensure all of them are fully vaccinated ahead of schools reopening post-Diwali for offline classes. The Centre has allocated more than two crore additional Covid-19 vaccines to the states to vaccinate these two categories on priority in the run-up to Teacher’s Day on September 5. “Most would have received the first dose. The objective now is to accelerate their full immunisation,” NK Arora, chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on immunisation, told TOI. “It is a crucial part of the preparation to reopen schools.” There are nearly 97 lakh teachers in the country. Earlier this month, NITI Aayog member VK Paul had said that almost 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff across the country had already been vaccinated. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, too, has indicated that vaccination of these two categories was the key to resuming offline school education, disrupted since March 2020. “I request all the state governments to give their support and cooperation to this campaign to strengthen the foundation of the future,” Pradhan tweeted recently. States and Union Territories have been advised to use the unified district information system of education data and coordinate with their respective education departments, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghtan and Navodaya Vidyalaya Sanghtan to leverage full immunisation of teachers and non-teaching staff. With schools shut for almost 18 months, experts across the education spectrum have expressed concern about the continued disruption of cognitive and physical development of children.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-school-staff-2-new-cowin-categories/articleshow/85785106.cms||Umesh Isalkar

They will be allowed to go home after another test at the end of the quarantine. “It is a precautionary measure and on the advice of the experts,” revenue minister R Ashoka said. The government clarified that RT-PCR negative certificates are a must to enter Dakshina Kannada district from Kerala; those without the certificate will be turned away at border check points. The rule will come into force from Tuesday. The government has decided to utilise government hostels to house travellers from Kerala. “If there are no government facilities available, then the state will identify budget hotels for quarantine. While the week-long stay will be free at government facilities, those quarantined have to pay at private facilities,” said health minister K Sudhakar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-day-quarantine-must-for-kerala-travellers-karnataka/articleshow/85785133.cms||---

In 32% of the cases, charge-sheets were filed in just seven days. Most of these cases (71%) pertain to charges under section 354 IPC (outraging modesty of women), 13% are related to POCSO, and 15% are connected to both adult and child rape. While the Disha Act is yet to be ratified by the Centre, cops have been functioning under the spirit of the bill in a bid to prove its concept. While the idea of completing investigation, arrest and charge-sheeting has been established, the prosecution within a targeted period can only be tried after the legislation is passed. Cops point out that they have achieved 148 convictions — which include 17 life imprisonment verdicts, while three got life imprisonment until death. According to crime and criminal tracking network & systems (CCTNS) data, the district-wise compliance rate for the legislation in sexual offences show Prakasam, Krishna and Vijayawada on top with 100% compliance rate. Vizag is next at 99%, while Kurnool and West Godavari have a 96% compliance rate. The overall compliance rate of Disha Act across the state stands at 90%. Conversely, Rajahmundry, Nellore and Tirupati hold the lowest compliance rate of 72%, 74% and 75%, respectively. While the main focus is on crimes against women (CAW), the spirit of the legislation is followed in other cases as well. The total number of FIRs filed within seven days stands at 1,645, out of which 1,000 are pertaining to CAW. The data also shows that there has been a 4% overall decrease in crimes against women in 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/disha-spirit-3114-offenders-charge-sheeted-within-15-days/articleshow/85777983.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Police said S Immanuvel, 26, of Chempakkam in Kancheepuram district and five of his family members and friends were returning in his SUV to Chennai after visiting his property in Ooty on Sunday night. When they crossed a village near Prithivimangalam near Thiyagaduram in Kallakurichi district, a motorist entered the highway from a link road forcing Immanuel, who was at the wheels, to take a sharp turn. He lost control of the vehicle, which hit the centre median and entered the opposite lane. The SUV collided head-on with a TNSTC bus bound for Salem from Chennai, coming from the opposite direction. The impact was so intense that the top portion of the SUV was completely ripped, and the bus dragged the SUV for a few metres before both the vehicles partially plunged into a pit along the highway. A highway patrol team, with the assistance of a team from Thiyagadurgam police station, reached the accident spot. The members of the teams with the help of giant machinery pulled out the SUV stuck in the front portion of the bus. They recovered the bodies and sent them for post-mortem to Kallakurichi Government General Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-six-including-boy-12-dead-as-car-rams-bus/articleshow/85785201.cms||---
